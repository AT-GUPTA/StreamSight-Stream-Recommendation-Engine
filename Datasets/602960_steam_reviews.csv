The game is fun with friends but if you play it in a public lobby. It quickly becomes boring when you're dealing with randoms in the game that doesn't know anything about how to play the game.
To people that wants to ruin the fun for everyone by killing everyone of us inside the ship.

The submarine editor is an astonishing feat, I feel like I'm programming. There are many different systems, from submarine sections, air and water propagation, ballasts, electricity and circuitry, logic doors... The amount of possibilities in building your submarine seems endless. I've personnaly spent countless hours building a sub to use it on a campaign, and it is so rewarding. You're building your ship to your liking, and need to foul test it to detect design issues or bugs until you get it right. You even have wifi nodes, and you can actually build a drone ship which may attach to the sub and you may control from a PC in the main one (how cool is that?).

Gameplay-wise,  it's amazing. After building your sub, you need to assemble a crew and take advantage of its possibilities, manage it efficiently. Apart from that, you get your own character class, inventory management, resource-management, future-planning... Exploring the world is super fun, but it's also a horror experience. Tension is always palpable, and it is so immersive. Putting on your dive suit to go out and explore a cave, fighting with monsters or people alike, underwater or in interiors. 

Story/Plot was mostly superficial in EA, as well as factions and skill trees, so I'm not reviewing that. (No need, the rest is just so good already).

The game starts you off with the cheapest recycled submarines available, then assigns you some easy tasks like few transport jobs that are safe and pays enough to feed yourself and your crew. Perhaps you'll even have a little extra to purchase some rounds for your favorite revolver, or a couple of medkits just in case things take a turn for the worse... Or maybe even invest in your ships' armor and formidable guns that will eventually protect you from everything that is not inside the ship! As you progress through the campaign map, you'll see different and vast amount of missions there are in this game. And don't worry, the more dangerous it is the better the pay is! Your goal is to survive and reach the end of the campaign map, which I will not talk about due to spoilers. 
The gameplay loop is exceptional, seamlessly complemented by the randomized campaign map and its nodes. Each experience in this game is unique to the seed and, naturally, friends you're playing with. Moreover, the immersive sound design further enhances the gameplay experience. The engine emitting series of clunky noises accompanied by the heavy, metallic sounds of your submarine moving in cold waters, the oxygen tanks working ceaselessly to sustain life, the ballast tanks regulating water in and out, and the eerie sounds emanating from the unknown creatures lurking in this god forsaken ocean... It's a hopeless situation, but you try to make the best out of it. My personal favorite is the outpost theme called Wartrauma, you'll often hear this theme after a significant battle or as preparation before confronting a titan. It eminates a militaristic and somewhat nostalgic ambiance. And god, does it make you feel like you can conquer everything this moon throws your way!
As you plunge deeper, the atmosphere grows increasingly tense and darker with every meter descended into Europa's frigid and unforgiving ocean. Unwelcoming alien life lurks in the depths, launching unexpected attacks on your submarine. Betrayal simmers among your crew, with some turning against you, seeking to sabotage every endeavor. Traitors conspire to bring down the ship, adding to the perilous array of challenges and pirates attempting to bring you and your crew down. I cannot put this into words properly but when you find a game that is very magical to play for the first time -- like when you played Minecraft for the first time as a kid -- I had the same feeling with Barotrauma. My first experience was a multiplayer lobby filled with great friends of mine, and because of the timezone I'd sacrifice my sleep every night to play with them. It was worth it, and I cherish the many fond memories I had with them.

The mods are where this game shines, it has a massive modding community. If you like working as a team to make a ship run well despite the odds, and being able to customize it to match exactly what you want, this is the game for you.

However, large amounts of mods and playing with friends leads to very unstable gameplay, with several of my friends having repeated issues when trying to join despite following every single troubleshooting guide. It is especially frustrating when all seems fine for half of our campaign and then suddenly they can't join anymore. A lack of a client side crash log makes it nearly impossible to troubleshoot issues without long hours of testing.

Because of the stability issues with mods, and the lack of content in the main game, I cannot recommend this game for $35. Wait for a major sale, and expect it to make you frustrated enough to quit with some of its issues.",1708313683,1708313713,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

That is ok, because this kind of game doesn't have to be a big thing, it just has to be its own thing, and be its own thing well. I wish that more games had the respect for their audience that Barotrauma does.

Before reading further: The game  loses something if you are planning to play it solo. For that reason I would generally recommend having at least one other person to play with, ideally two or three. It's a team focused game around crewing a submarine in dangerous waters, dragging it back from the brink of catastrophe and putting out fires (sometimes literally) to keep that rusted tin can of a submarine chugging along just long enough to reach the next safe harbor: it benefits from communication, coordination and that shared experience. Think of the moment in Das Boot when U-96 is stuck on the bottom of the gibraltar strait, the hull groaning under the pressure as the crew scrambles to desperately try and save the submarine. Bots just can't replicate that fully. it won't really be the same, it'll just be silent.

I think Barotrauma is the type of game that is kind of hard to write review for, given that what the individual takes away from it can vary wildly depending on preference. I think it would be good to first say that like many indie games it has its own specific niche it caters to: for some of us, that niche is something it does very well, for others, that niche might not be enough to get past some other aspects. This is not to imply that Barotrauma is a 'diamond in the rough', but it is the type of game where the appeal can largely be derived from whether the atmosphere and the experience are something you think is worth looking for. If a relatively complex-but-simple crew based submarine game about exploring deep into uncharted alien waters is something you find inherently appealing, then the experience that you will likely find is hard to replicate anywhere else. If that kind of thing is not something that excites you, or if submarines in general don't strike your interests, then some of the jankier aspects (the physics, character controls, some of the aspects of the gameplay) will begin to make your experience feel like a chore that dissuades you from going further. The reward you get out of playing the game is that unique atmospheric experience, so if the appeal is lost on you then you may find yourself losing motivation to continue. I think there is a lot depth here if you are willing to dive into it, but if that prospect doesn't seem appealing on it's own, then consider doing some more research into the game before you make any decisions. 

I said before that Barotrauma is a niche game that does its niche very well. I also said that the game has respect for its audience. While I won't go into general gameplay mechanics in this review (because it would take too much time), I do want to talk briefly about what made the game so appealing to me. The submarine editor I think is the most in-depth and interesting part of the game, given it allows you to take what is effectively the main character of your story (the submarine) and completely rebuild it from the ground up. Starting from scratch I can create a submarine however I want, handling the hulls, the layouts, the electrical systems and wiring, the automatic control systems and subsystems (through logic components, which allow you to do some really complex things given enough dedication), the ballast and fluid control systems, the decoration and aesthetics, the gun coverage, etc. Some of the things you can do with the tools available to you are really complicated and in-depth, like switcheable periscopes and gun systems, remote-control shuttlecraft and drones, 'overdrive' engine systems, 'silent running', emergency backup power systems, autonomously-controlled submarine guns, moonpools, automatic reactor and temperature control, REGEX-based computer control systems, periscope navigation, etc. As of right now, the workshop has 31,170 player-made submarines uploaded. I have uploaded 7 of my own (they are mid at best). The majority of my hours were in the editor. These kinds of things take hours of effort to make and demonstrate the kind of passion that people have for this game, as well as the depth that the game offers to tailor your experience to you. Some of them are low effort, some of them have problems that have not or cannot be fixed: the game is complicated by nature and not everything will work as you might want it to. But it goes to show just how dedicated people can get to this game, and just how much the game (and its developers) trusts you to do whatever you want with its systems. Want to create creatures of your own? The game has a creature editor for that too. A lot of the game is moddeable, and adding new items, equipment and armors can be as simple as XML and a text editor, depending on what you are making. Once you have an understanding of just how much effort and knowledge goes into the workings of both the systems themselves and the submarine you chose, you gain a sort of profound respect (or disrespect sometimes, ha) for the game that doesn't really seem to go away.",1708202968,1708203198,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

-Missions are really tedious and repetitive. Almost every level plays the same down to a small amount of enemy diversity.
-Enemy balancing sucks ass. Just absolutely horrible how there are multiple enemies who can instantly breach your submarine's hull from a single hit, flooding and totally fucking you over, and they can usually tank enough bullets for you to not be able to stop them before that happens.
-For a horror game it's really really really hard to get scared when you're more pissed off at the horrendously annoying enemies. Deep sea horror personally really affects me and I expected this to have great scares but I instead just found myself frustrated

Well the game is alright but playing modded is hard because most players won't join due to the load times and sometimes they don't know how because some mods require special work arounds to join servers.

Old review:
Could a prisoner gamemode be added for multiplayer? It would be fun having to escape while security is around the submarine trying to get to its destination.

Could a game be made which is like this but in space and more horror like? Like imagine sucked out of your space ship and slowly freezing to death only to have your lungs burst due to trying to hold the air in your lungs! I could be something like dead space but different

Devs please make it so when you stun a player their screen goes fully black. There is a mod which adds in a improved stun into the game and it's pretty 10/10! If I were you guys I would add a ""You are stunned"" on top of the screen so the player won't think the game broke.

update: Bro wth? I beat the game fair and square this time and I still didn't get achievement on new save! I was using Typhon2!
Update: Wait what? Barotruama Dead Space mod plus Barotraumatic modpack? Heck yes! Good game!

Update: Just managed to beat the game solo but sadly I got soft locked at the end of the game.. Had to use cheats just to actually get past the soft lock :(

Update: I have found that this game is most enjoyable with mods when playing solo. Still the price is not justified though so my negative review will stay the same. I wish I could be able to recommend this game to friends.

Just found out they raised the price of this game. THIS GAME IS NOT WORTH £30! I've had more joy walking than playing this game.

The hardest part in this game is trying to survive with fellow crew mates. They will try to kill you eventually no matter what. It's not a matter of if. It's a matter of when.

EDIT: Don't play this game unless you have real friends. Game is pretty sad at times and you may then end up wasting your whole day playing it. There is no sense of accomplishment in this game. You will pretty much always feel like you have wasted your time. 

Talking to random people in this game is like talking down into a tunnel where not much sound can be recieved! God help! 

Game is mostly pretty well made though.. But it just needs more content.",1650751528,1707933523,False,0,0,0,0,True,True,True

Players assume the roles of a submarine crew, exploring the seas and battling monsters with limited resources. The game's music, atmosphere, gameplay loop, and progression are all fantastic, creating an immersive and engaging experience.
The music in Barotrauma sets the tone perfectly, enhancing the atmosphere and creating a sense of tension and suspense. Combined with the game's visuals and sound effects, it truly immerses players in the underwater world and adds to the overall experience.
Speaking of atmosphere, Barotrauma excels in creating a dark and foreboding undersea environment. The graphics and sound design work together to create a sense of claustrophobia and unease, making every moment feel intense and suspenseful.
One of the game's strengths is its satisfying gameplay loop. Balancing exploration, resource management, and combat, players are constantly engaged and challenged. The mechanics are well-designed, allowing for strategic decision-making and teamwork in order to survive the dangers of the deep.
Progression in Barotrauma is well-paced, providing a sense of accomplishment as players upgrade their submarine and unlock new abilities. The game keeps players motivated and eager to explore further, offering a rewarding sense of progression.
On the other hand, enemy variety in Barotrauma is lacking. While the gameplay itself is solid, the limited range of enemies can become repetitive after a while. This detracts from the overall experience and could benefit from more diverse and challenging opponents.
Additionally, the game does suffer from some bugs and technical issues. While these can be frustrating at times, it is worth noting that the developers have been actively addressing and fixing these issues.
In conclusion, Barotrauma is a captivating co-op adventure game with a fantastic music score, immersive atmosphere, engaging gameplay loop, and satisfying progression system. However, the lack of enemy variety and the presence of bugs do detract from the overall experience. Nonetheless, for those who enjoy underwater survival games with a cooperative gameplay element, Barotrauma is still a worthwhile choice.",1652431126,1707672770,True,2,0,0.539748966693878174,0,True,False,True

The game boasts a great atmosphere and plays well with friends. There is a bit of a learning curve, however, and there is little in the way of quality of life features. Overall, I can recommend this game so long as you go in with your eyes open.[/i]

Barotrauma is as much a simulator as it is a game. And by that I mean that there's more depth to certain aspects of the game than you might expect from a cursory glance. But this also brings with it a severe lack of quality-of-life in terms of inventory management, crafting and item storage as well as UI design.

That said, Barotrauma is quite immersive. The gameplay loop is simple yet effective - complete missions, earn money and improve your gear and submarine to go deeper into Europa. While the game can be played just fine in singleplayer, I feel that most people would get more enjoyment out of multiplayer. Bots are very efficient at some aspects of the game and they work well enough for the most part. But for some players, the chaos that results from playing with only people will be a big draw.

The visuals are generally dark and moody, while the Europan wildlife looks familiar-yet-horrifying. I can't honestly say the game looks [i]pretty[/i], but the visuals achieve what they set out to do. They have a certain vibe to them and it works.

The sound effects are on point, the guns and creatures sound good. The background music is atmospheric and not very intrusive. Again - it fits the vibe that the game is going for.

Of particular interest to some will be the fact that you can design and use your own submarines. Over the course of the campaign my friend made several custom submarines and we had a great time using them. So while it may not be for everyone, I feel that the submarine editor is a great feature of the game.

I had a good time playing this with a friend until we completed the campaign. As far as I can tell there is little reason to keep playing after that. The ending itself is also a bit lackluster in terms of gameplay and story.

Either way, if you don't mind a bit of a learning curve and messing around with a fiddly UI and inventory management, this game can be unique and entertaining.",1707144606,1707144606,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Most of the crew were eaten by mud raptors, but a good chunk of them managed to survive the onslaught. So, after hearing them screaming about requiring medical attention, I listened to my conscience and returned to treat the survivors. While doing so, I saw the mangled body of a security guard who, despite being eaten by a mud raptor, was only an inch away from death. After figuring he was a lost cause, I decided to shove an injection of Deusizine (A drug I never used before) up his ass for funsies, where said guard proceeded to jump up and down while screaming at the top of his lungs. Shocked by this fortunate turn of events, the remaining crew made our way to the beacon station, repaired it, and then failed the round, because everyone had clicked End Round during the mud raptor attack.

The atmosphere ranges from jovial drinking with the crew to straining your hearing whilst searching for the Latcher that sunk you. 

The progression system is quite well done, stressing your submarine to it's absolute limits before allowing you to upgrade.

Customisation and creation of creatures or submarines is extensive in the editor or with rewiring.

Surrounding lore and backstory of the factions and of Europa itself is fascinating.

In single-player this game fits the niche between trucking simulator and side scrolling action-horror.
In multiplayer it ranges from murder mystery to laughable insanity.

Cons: The game fails to explain some of it's more complex systems adequately enough, rewiring your submarine is a notorious example of this.

Sometimes you fall through stairs you thought you had fully climbed or miss a ladder you thought you had grabbed.

Being 2D comes with the challenge that NPCs and corpses take up the hobby of blocking your bullets, usually at the most crucial of moments.

The lore, whilst quite good, requires quite the amount of searching outside of the game itself. Past what I would consider normal.

Playing in single-player hinges you to AI which sometimes overdose you on morphine or shoot you in the back. Whereas in multiplayer your game will entirely depend on your crew, either you work together efficiently or you get a troll who blows up the reactor. (not a designated traitor, just a prick)

It is the only game I own that comes close to what I loved about FTL back in the day. Completely enjoyable solo if you commit to learning the limitations of the A.I. (and also how to (ab)use it later on), it is very doable and often easier than with a multiplayer crew. The strength of this game lies in its depth and complexity, embracing the depths of Jupiters Moon uncovering its secret.

The only downside to this game is that the game is horribly optimized, runs on one CPU core and tends to stutter itself into oblivion mostly in the 3rd and 4th biome, making a modded ""lag fix"" almost mandatory. Equally, the depth of the campaign itself is enjoyable for a full playthrough, but becomes stale for the second. Mods expand this game enourmously, without touching the core gameplay (almost) at all. Dynamic Europa is one of my favorites, it flips the macro game upside down and improves it on every front. Adding more wrecks, beacons and stations make the game feel like you see more variations, styles and the vanilla game provides.

The only issue I've had was finding a few friends to play the game with. Barotrauma isn't for everyone, but is a LOT of fun if you give it a try and stick to it.",1705660972,1706385750,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I had a small crew and a weak submarine in my first run. We had power failures left and right, and many creatures could easily board our ship. But as the game progressed, slowly I was able to afford more and more upgrades, until I could buy a bigger and even better ship. This cycle continues on and on but each mission is different than the last, and definitely more dangerous than the last. I made different alliances with certain factions and unlocked new research and technologies. Once I finally bought the best ship I was no longer scared of the occasional crawler, spineling, mudraptor or hammerhead. But such feelings of comfort did not last long, as the game then presented me with new stronger, faster, bigger, and scarier creatures that made their predecessors seem like a joke. They tore my ship apart, along with the people inside it. 

The learning curve in Barotrauma is steep and difficult, it is not an easy game to pick up and play, and the tutorial does not efficiently teach you the various aspects of the game. Especially how to play roles such as the Medical Officer, Engineer, and Mechanic. However, even though this may seem like a downside, I believe not knowing what to expect in a horror game like this actually helps add to the game's theme of isolation and exploration. In some twisted way, things like your Submarine being boarded by aliens and all the power failing is actually really fun, I mean....isn't the whole point of horror games/movies is to have stuff going wrong? Just imagine this: You're an Security Officer for the ship, your job is to handle the weapons and keep lifeforms out of the ship, but the whole mission has gone to shit. The nuclear reactor is failing, the lights have gone out, the navigation systems are dead, and you are armed with your trusty revolver, and a flashlight. As you slowly creep around the decrepit hallways of the submarine, you hear a scratching noise coming from the medical room, you quickly climb up the ladder and peak through the window, you can tell it's a person but you can't exactly make out who it is. You open the door, assuming they were stuck in there, but as this 'crewmember' turns around, you see their helmet is cracked, long tentacles poking out of it, their suit is torn and they smell of decaying flesh. That 'thing' is certainly anything but human....

Overall, Barotrauma is a great game made 10x better when playing with friends. The idea of your submarine being stranded several kilometres underwater is terrifying, and it makes you have to think on your feet when there are leaks in the ship, or terminal cells, mutating and corrupting your ship from the inside out. You will die many times in this game, but each time you will gain some new knowledge on how to adapt and beat this problem next time it comes around. And there are so many cool items to mess around with. I got the game while it was on sale, $20 down from $50. I would recommend waiting for the game to go on sale because 50 does seem a little high to me, but if you have money to throw away then getting the game for 50 is not a bad idea.",1706368241,1706368241,True,7,0,0.605707108974456787,0,True,False,False

The story I have is of a crew where i was the captain of a sub, and we had one simple mission:
fix a beacon station and get to the outpost. Simple.

We started, mined some ore, fought some eldritch horrors, the usual. Until we got to the station.

In the station, while we were repairing it (and where i died once) our engineer informed us that we only had a single fuel rod left, so we needed to hurry.
We finished fixing it with our last fuel rod (great mistake) and we tried to dock on the outpost, but a group of monsters attacked us and thanks to them (and my severe case of skill issue) we got pulled down and sank FAST
thankfully, the batteries on our ship were charged, so we managed to repair our ship, and with the idea of a mechanic, we drained the ship of all water, and let the buoyancy of the ship push it up

...this didn't go as planned, because we hit a rock and we were stuck, so we managed to come up with a desperate final plan, we were NOT giving up.

I got out of the sub with an underwater scooter, and went to the beacon station that we fixed to get the fuel rod we left there, i managed to get it, and even used a fire extinguisher that was in the station to propel myself once the scooter ran out of battery!

And in the end, we failed.

Opening the airlock to exit the sub made it sink, and with no power to get the water out, the sub with everyone inside sank until a group of monsters spotted them, destroying the ship more and making them sink to 5000m, making it to crush depth, and all dying

And while ALL OF THAT was happening, i was trying to return to the ship, fuel rod in hand.
Eventually i began to run out of oxygen, and as i saw name tags disappear off the HUD, I accepted my demise.

I got out of my suit, and smoked my captain's pipe one last time as i died.


Remember kids: always bring extra fuel rods, or you will die horribly.

The game has come a long way since the start of it's early access on steam, there are tons of incredible mods, and the developers are still adding major content updates like the rework to traitors mode. There are occasional bugs and annoyances (Like: Sometimes people recruited from random events will not have a proper ID card, so their name will change every round), but the experience is overall very solid. The editing tools given are very well made as well, so it's very easy to create your own ships / mods.

The price tag is a tad bit high, but the game goes on massive sales occasionally, alongside free weekends (usually around major updates). Definitely try the game during one of these events if you are thinking about buying.",1617883637,1706005449,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Newly introduced performance issues since the Rising Tide update has made the game quite literally unplayable for me and hundreds of other players. This issue doesn't seem to be high priority for the devs as they've closed a megathread for newly introduced performance issues after referring people to the thread and closing other threads as ""duplicates"" but the main thread was closed as well.

I love this game, it's one of my favorite games, but despite being well above the reccomended specs and previously being able to play the game at 144FPS, I'm still completely unable to play because of these issues. I want to change the review and I absolutely will once (IF) these issues are fixed. I'm getting a sinking feeling the devs aren't going to fix them. I hope they prove me wrong, I love this game so much.

Outdated Update: Honestly I've lost all interest. The updates have been terrible, making known problems worse and just overall being downgrades to the game. I'd happily play older versions of the game but the live version has lost it's vision. It feels like the devs don't know what they want the game to be anymore. They'll add some interesting new feature in one update, then the very next one completely change it, usually making it worse in the process and not providing any ways to revert the changes in custom settings. You must play the game the devs want you to play unless you want to spend hours setting up mods.

But... I wouldn't recommend this game if you don't have friends to play this game together. You can play with random people, but it's quite difficult to find a good server.

Most hosts don't care if you are a beginner or not, and won't bother to teach you. Not to mention the type of host who likes to just kick people for no apparent reason, or when you make a mistake because you're still a beginner.

The AI seriously, SERIOUSLY needs to be revamped. You need to be able to give orders that think ahead, like telling crews to put on diving suits or grab extra oxygen. Bots shouldnt leave their suits lying around or waste expensive meds on minor injuries. Sending them out on excursions with respective mining/repair/salvage/guard roles would also be a fantastic addition. Maybe you could even implement a simple command-script building to make repeatable chains of orders at once. And we need drydocks- Places where we can park our sub so we dont have to worry about water when we cut it open to make minor changes to the wiring. Either that, or some kind of 'access panel' that acts as a wall, but have a small door to access hidden components.
Undertow, I love your game. It is so so close to being perfect- And thats what make these drawbacks all the more frustrating.

It took me by surprise just how much content is actually in the game & then there is additional Steam workshop support. If anything could be a 2D Garry's Mod, this could be it.

I hope the game continues to receive support & content.

Edit January 10th, 2024: It's annoying that you still can not free yourself from handcuffs. Additionally, not sure why they changed the sprites (ragdolls), they behave & appear less appealing than before.

Edit January 11th, 2024: Apparently you cannot rename crew bots; it does not seem to be functioning properly unless you are buying or discarding an NPC crew-mate at the same time of renaming another. There appears to be no persistent objects other than what is on your submarines & your crew, which is annoying when you want to feel like your actions & choices have an impact on outposts/stations & the environments.

Edit January 13th, 2024: After having played the game as a returning player, honestly, the game feels like a downgrade with the changes they have made compared to older versions. After the amount of time this game has had in development, there just is not even enough vanilla/base content to consider the price of this game as worth it at all. Most of the content comes from the community, both from playing with other players & from their efforts on the workshop. Changed my review from positive to negative to reflect the changes the game received; a reluctant change of my own on what could still become a great game.",1655174917,1705159535,False,1,0,0.512372612953186035,0,True,False,False

But With the combination of mechanics that lean toward group play and a steep learning curve, the community develops this barricaded feeling that ostracizes new players and makes the game and community a bit unwelcoming, a problem it shares with games like foxhole.

and I although i admittedly havnt gotten far into the solo campaign, I dont think it is really one of those things that will speak to most people or keep them hooked, despite its in depth mechanics, trying to breach the surface is like staring at a lake from a cliff, you know it would be really cool but making that jump is a nigh impossible task to do alone.

for these reasons I cannot recommend this game to most people, but think it would probably be worth trying to see if it scratches an itch for you.

My main complaint about this game is the lack of diversity to ship tasks. Yes you'll have different ships during your journey with different layouts, but it's more of the same. Piloting never changes, it's the exact same from hour 0 to the end of the game, repairing is always the same minigame, dealing with the engine is always the same process.

Just feels like there should be a little variety between all the ships in the tasks that need to be done.

ALL SUBMARINES ARE EXTREMELY FLAWED.
Creatures will easily kill you until you get better weapons which won't happen soon.
Most diving suits are just not worth getting especially the Exosuit they ruined completely.
The game isn't very playable without a full team to fill all jobs so you can get decent gear mid game instead of only late game by buying it.
Most skills got nerfed and are a joke, skill trees got completely ruined as you can only pick one now.
Getting levels in skills takes way too long which is why it's nearly unplayable alone or with bots as they can't help you craft or have more then two neurons.
Most encounters are more bothersome then interesting or they'll straight up just enter your submarine and it's over as you'll have pressure to deal with, flooding, sinking to the bottom which will cause more damage, all AI dying as they are brain dead and won't bother with getting a diving suit until it's too late.
Also a fun fact, guards on outposts are nearly immortal and they will definitely be impossible to kill without any insane weapons like nukes or rail guns which you can of course not hit them with from the sub.
Stealing items is being punished so much that if they even catch you with stolen items they'll cuff you and that's the end of your ENTIRE game if you save the handcuffed state if you have no friends to take them off for you",1668546150,1704503865,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Fun to co-op and solo

Was progressing through biome 2 looting sunken wrecks, killing hammerheads and Moloch's left right and center thinking i'm pro captain.
50m away from docking into the outpost and then suddenly a new friend called latcher say hello

All of a sudden my sub starts to sink, The whole crew working on repairing the leaks and electrical systems, The critter seemingly fled in the opposite direction.

Descend 400m

We managed to get the sub back into operation and start to ascend back up to the outpost...
Until our new friend want to say hello again.

The creature kept on coming back and we couldn't recover in time.
A few moments later
3200m

3600m

4000m

As i stand there watching our sub sink at increasing speed, The Crushing Depth indicator start's to go off
Everyone is panicking,  We land on the cavern floor 4300m, Spared by the 4480m crushing depth.

Our new friend was not finished with us yet though :(
The submarine getting pummelled, Slowly filling up with water, Crew member's dying 1 after the other from increased pressure. We where not expecting this.

-Game modes

As of today, start of 2024, there's only two real modes, solo, kinda boring, flat, submarine pilot simulator 2024, and multiplayer, multiplayer being the most GOOFIEST SHIT I ever saw in my entire life.

Solo is good, good while listening to music, ai is half braindead, can still shoot guns with decent accuracy, (use pulse not chaingun), and well you travel from there to there, make your money etc, then upgrade, lacks introduction to others classes, and you're stuck being the captain, the ai being unable to dock by itself, or even fine a path if there's an ice spire in a 509 meters radius.

Multiplayer, is like putting 6 monkeys in a nuclear reactor, and give em a shit ton of bananas, you gonna die, you gonna explode and be reduced to atoms, but it's gonna be the best fucking moment of your life, either while clowning around, or fighting mudraptors with a diving knife, while under all drugs known to man, it's never boring and definitely worth trying it.

-Performances
Do not, and trust me, DO NOT play this game with an I3, without a graphics card, it litteraly burns (real), otherwise the game lacks optimization, as soon as I hit the 2k items it starts to be worse, and well trust me on that, fuck the crystals, these being in one of the lasts zones just make it worse, as when you're here you're in a tier 3, and it makes it even larger, and with added mods for ammo, items, or simply guns / ships, you're gone, can't be finished.

-Community
50/50 deal, either a chad who carries you because he got five times your hours, or a guy that kicks you either because you have a name he doesn't like,  or because he doesn't know how to put a game on private, having payday 2 feelings on that, either way, finding people easy, good one less, and the discord is just completely overrun, impossible to find another if you're a beginner.

-Conclusion 
Game is good, worth to buy, even more with sales, just way better with mates, even inexperienced, (or unemployed), assistant is the meta, and praise the honkmother.",1704067531,1704067531,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This game is one of those games where the emergent game play is so dam good you wont be able to put it down.  Here is a few stories from my stupid amount of time in this game.


I was in a public server once where one guy insisted on fighting everything we came across with a crowbar. It was a funny bit until we got attacked by a abyssal creature which if you don't know what that is just picture a creature the size of the submarine. Now we were loosing this fight badly, we were about 200M from crush depth and one more hit from the abyssal creature probably would have sent us past crush depth. AND YOU KNOW WHAT THIS FUCKER SAYS, ""Let me at him I can take him."" and he then proceeds to leave the ship via the airlock and activate a sonar beacon to lure the abyssal creature to him. He managed to distract it long enough that we were able to run away. (obviously he did not live) 

Another time I was in a server with some friends and we were running a mod called hazardous reactors for the first time (which changes the way that reactors work). Now my friend who usually plays engineer was overconfident and refused to read the manual the mod provided in game. Then the reactor started leaking radiation and right before repairing the reactor he confidently says ""See I don't need a manu--"". I then saw him fly halfway across the ship past me as I saw the reactor ark flash him.",1672481155,1703907972,True,2,1,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,True

The creatures are relentless and will stop at nothing to eat every last person. Playing solo can be a nightmare, but so can playing with random players. There are no rules. Everything is destructible. Sometimes the random players can be more dangerous than the creatures in the sea. However, you can hire bots and program them with specific commands that completely replace players altogether. A solo/Bot run is completely viable if you are tired of trusting random players. Playing with friends is highly recommended because this game really shines from teamwork and communication. Modding is built into the game. You can completely create your submarine from scratch and bring it into a new campaign. You can also bring it into an existing campaign through a 3rd party save editor. This game is good to replay as well. You can go for New Game + which increases difficulty automatically each play through or you can start completely fresh with a completely new generated campaign map. There are multiple routes to take making each choice a new experience. Also the Toy Hammer is the best weapon in the game. I bonked a latcher to death with it. You'll find out what a latcher is when you play. It likes to give out free hugs and take you to the sirens lair at the bottom of the ocean. 10/10 I partied hard with the latcher and the sirens. Don't forget to bring your funbringer 1000 with you. Praise the Honkmother. Oh and if you like dark and twisted being a husk is not so bad. You turn into Dracula and can turn everyone else into husks. Has a type of play through for everyone. Just don't try to manually ""ascend"" to soon.

It makes me troubleshoot, eats me, puts monsters in the ballast, gives me a periscope and flares. The lovely, lovely flares. They light the dark in red circles, and there is so much dark. There are so many strangers in my metal ice-travel tube. They have their own wants and needs. They do not have the flares. I have all the flares.

Barotrauma strikes a balance between simplified and simulated that births predictable unpredictability, and is brilliant with a barnacle-encrusted crew of friends-turned-undersea-under-ice-psychopaths. Less recommended if you don't have friends to play with, though the campaign is fleshing out nicely, and the game has been continuing to get meaty updates. 

I picked up Barotrauma because I loved the idea of being stuck on a submarine while compartments filled with water, opening doors and being crushed under the surge, sealing compartments to contain the leak. It does this very well.

The submarines feel creepy, cold, and gross, an atmosphere lightened by the game's subtle-but-persistent sense of humor and humanity. You can play an accordion. Clowns drift around outposts and infest the occasional multiplayer lobby, carrying with them a strange and chaotic folk religion.

Barotrauma is hardcore in that a single mistake can get you crushed, burned, lacerated, or parasitically transformed, but at the heart of the game is a submarine sandbox built around having fun in a challenging, occasionally terrifying environment. It gives you a whole lot of tools (from bike horns to handcuffs to C-4), and a whole lot of permission to use them. You can unwire critical systems, turn some gun emplacements against the submarine itself, smear the walls with spray paint. The level of freedom it provides is the beating wet heart of the game. (It's also the thing that necessitates multiplayer to some degree.)

It's not a game for everyone. (But boy is it a game for me.) 

It's not a deep simulator. It's not a purpose-built single-player game. (Updates have improved the solo experience immensely over the last few years, and it's something I've had a lot of fun with personally, but that's still not where Barotrauma shines.) It's easier to understand than I was expecting going in, but still has a steep learning curve at the beginning. The controls are simple, but survival and success depend on knowing how various submarine systems (power, batteries, ballast, engine, etc.) interact, how to prioritize tasks, and so on. There's a lot to learn.

Slow at times. Successful missions on easier difficulties mean consist solely of 10+ minutes watching pitch-black cave water pass around the hull of your submarine, squinting at radar pings and clicking on junction boxes to fix them. And that's it.

Disaster is sudden. A single enemy can bring your submarine to the sea floor within seconds, in increasingly desperate need of repairs. Learning your sub's systems (each is wired differently, and the wiring matters) is necessary to repair it effectively. The margin between a working submarine and a deep sea paperweight is narrow, sometimes frustratingly so, and the gameplay can easily fall into loops of click-thing-until-it's-fixed when your boat takes damage.

This is all stuff I either enjoy or don't mind too much, but everyone's wants and tolerances are different, so I think it's important to mention the big sticking points. Barotrauma is doing something weird and cool and different, and delivers an wandering, immersive experience and a fuckload of atmosphere.",1607655027,1703640270,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

If you don't do things well, you might get screwed over. It's often better to play very passive than very aggressive (as the Captain's role, arguably the one you'll play most in Singleplayer.)
Once you know the mechanics and AI though, it gets much easier. You can predict creatures much better, and it's overall so much easier to deal with everything.
There is also a multiplayer side, and for the MOST part it is well done, but there are a couple major issues.
First off, you don't get to control AI in multiplayer. If you want some perks like crafting the best tools, but you don't have an Engineer PLAYER (not NPC) you're out of luck, and have to settle for the next best thing. This goes for everything.
The other gamemodes are great though. Campaigns are long tho.

Have you ever wanted to be a sea dweller in the depths of Europa?

To have fun with your friends?
To work overtime in a shitbox you and your crew call a submarine?
To have a captain drunk on ethanol not tell you of a pod of hammerheads just outside the ship?
To be underpaid in any given situation even when the bank is full of money?
To question the morality of whatever the hell the doktor is currently doing to the mechanic?

If you answered yes to any above, Welcome abored to a (very short) lifetime of underwater shenanigans.

When you first come around you may consider going in single player, but I'd advise against it because you wouldn't have the full proper experience of a clown rigging a door with four tons of C4 and the following chaos where half the crew is infected with an alien parasite while the suspicious medic is currently running for his life from security, and at the same time the captain is being dragged into the ballast by the assistant for... unknown purposes. All the while the submarine hasn't moved an inch from the dock.

As you can see from this fun tale, multiplayer is significantly better than singleplayer. singleplayer is meh.

The game play loop is pretty great and its the players that make it better, it goes as follows.


- don't die
- prepare to go a mission, transporting goods, peoples, chemicals or hunting abyssal horrors, you name it.
- don't question what the clown is doing as the crew wont notice you missing.
- get shot at in the crossfire from the outpost security shooting at your medic for stealing all the meth
- nearly die
- go on mission
- ask about your 1% salary, the captain laughs and continues piloting the sub.
- captain says ""WHAT THE F#*% IS THAT THING!?""
- get slammed into the roof
- submarine fucking dies
- everyone dies
- local mudraptors get lunch
Rinse and repeat until you get through to the next outpost, whoever made this game is a genius.

If you want to make a submarine that others can crash and burn in the vast sea, you can easily do so using the Editor, where magic and creativity prospers.
Ranging from everything and anything, you can make some great ships, or... some with questionable designs.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VR7uNgwOeM

I'd highly suggest you watch some videos, download some ships and take em apart to see what works and figure out how to make a lump of scrap into a work of art, watch Initialdesu, he knows what he doin.

Anyways game is 10/10
Multiplayer is 10/-10
Singleplayer is 7 divided by Pi
Editor 11/10
Alive crew mates 3.5/8

Oh yeah if you plan on hosting a server, bring friends :) and don't tolerate the arseholes who will try to ruin your campaign, because they will grief and sap the fun out of it. advise from Mr. Troll.

now play the damn game already.

Update:
To amend this, the problem I have with the update is the storage changes. If it only applied to new saves, I'd maybe consider trying out it. However, I'm currently balls deep in a campaign that I'm playing with two friends, using a series of subs I've made, with the previous storage system in mind, and the Treacherous Tides update colossally messed that up. 
Found a few mods to revert it, but the point still stands. Doing sudden major changes to how important mechanics work creates huge problems when you're hours into something.  Ironically, with the combination of those mods and the update, we end up having even more storage space than before...

As for the big thing in this update, the traitor system stuff, that part might be fine for those that enjoy that. Dunno. I don't play, and have no interest in playing the traitor mode.

I started playing as all the roles except Captain. I found some solid funny groups that worked together and had a captain that would talk and give orders. When the crew is working as a team it can create positive moments, you really do feel like you're in an underwater sub on another planet. But it's pretty hard to find that good mix of people that talk and really get into their roles.

So I started to create/host games because I was tired of being matched with people without mics. Then I started to play Captain and that's where the real fun began. It's stressful at times but its nice to vet people without mics and also playing as Jean Luc Picard in a sub is awesome. Create dive teams, go on inspection checks, tell someone to grow tobacco plants so I can smoke more and give individual tasks to keep them engaged and busy. This is the only game that really captures the captain & crew feeling. You almost NEED a talkative captain to have a decent experience because without that voice, the crew becomes disorganized and runs out of things to do faster imo.

It's scary outside the sub. Combat is janky and funny. Enemies are wide in variety and terrifying. Husk infections can infiltrate your crew like a plague and sometimes forces you to make some crazy decisions like locking a crewmate in a room or maybe depressurizing a room to kill a traitor. There's lots of custom subs on the workshop that can really cater to any kind of sub layout you want. I love having locked doors on my captains quarters because i like having some peace and quiet sometimes. Also I like giving the security or medic a master key just incase I lock it and somehow pass out in there.

The only way you can see the monsters is with your fragile human eyes or with sonar, which only tells you where they were a few seconds ago, not where they are now - a question to which the answer is always ""closer and now they're even more angry.""

Barotrauma is deceptively simple in its premise, and even its 2D art style. Easily one of my most favorite games on Steam, and an absolute blast with friends, this game is an absolute jewel and should be played. It isn't perfect, mind you, but the devs are always engaging with the community and working on sizable patches to solve such complaints and in the meantime the community makes their own solution thanks to the Workshop. 
The game play loop isn't complicated, which might make you think that the game isn't. Boy would you be wrong. 

Man a submarine, do simple tasks, make profit, trade profit for men & materials at the next outpost... repeat. 

However, things go south very very fast. In a sense, this game is the spiritual successor of Space Station 13 (complete with Traitor mechanics) because things do go south, incredibly fast, and the enjoyment is in trying to duct tape a bad situation into something serviceable.

Only major complaint I have that ruins the multiplayer for me is that your characters are server based. 
Meaning progression is dependent on if you're able to get back into a specific server.
Normally this wouldn't be an issue because many games do this but to level up once takes a long time.
Several missions even. Which can take up several hours of your time. 

TLDR: Until you're able to transfer characters around I won't be playing multiplayer all that much. Since I got this game specially for the multiplayer I can not recommend it. I can only hope they add this as an update.",1702362916,1702366112,False,4,0,0.476099908351898193,0,True,False,False

It could be much more fun if it did not have Skill Loss on Death and The Reapers Tax, a special debuff that punishes you for choosing to respawn and help your friends and other players instead of staying dead until they die or reach the station after finishing the mission. That is two things that punish a players hard-won skill progression on death, which can happen rapidly and with minimal warning, and even happen from other players trying to save your life. As hilarious as such things would be if it was harmless, the fact that it can cause a massive reduction in your stats and a slow degradation of your character to worse than fresh-spawned basically ruins the gameplay if you plan to spend more than a few hours on it or want to enjoy the more indepth parts without a serious and serially succesfull crew to boost you. 

It is really rough to be playing and realize you have wasted hours working on your character, only for them to be worse than if you had never touched them. The Devs need to curve their artificial difficulty boner before I will recommend this game.

It has its serious hard-core player-base, do not be surprised when you find that you are not secretly one of them that missed the message about this game. It is a game for a niche group of people, although very fun, the excessive death punishment makes it nearly intolerable to a newer player trying to explore it. But that is just my personal feelings on the situation. From what I have heard the game devs believed it was too fast to gain skills so they set things up to prevent that, I don't know what too-fast means, but if it takes me 10hrs to see the first few levels of progress beyond token skill boosts in a game like this, I wouldnt call it too fast, I would call it cripplingly slow.  Perhaps there are extremely good builds out there that help you progress quickly, but they aren't ones that I stumbled upon. 

Summary: Game is fun, gameplay is fun, Death is doubley punished, extremely common, and makes advancement near impossible in game without a serious amount of player experience. 4/10 Fun Until You Try To Play Seriously and Explore. Pick up if you are a masochist that likes to watch your stat-grind get reversed by excess waterpressure.

Even on the easiest level, after some time, completing a few missions and reaching the next base is a great success. Most often you have to start from the last base many times. The game is deliberately set up in such a way that a person practically falls over his own feet and dies unexpectedly. And it's hard to find any rule here, except that the rule is that it has to be tedious, and that's actually one of the main attractions of this game. Even when you want to make a key move at the moment of attack, the game is set up in such a way that something turns off or you fall. It's supposed to add atmosphere. However, this is completely unrealistic. Where, in what world, in what environment, in what work is a person exposed every second to so many dangers and to such bad luck? With almost worthless security measures. It's as if a person goes to work every day and has to repair his car several times on the way, and in the end he will die because in a moment a bird will fly into his windshield and then his wheel will fall off. Do planes not reach their destinations or do submarines sink every day?

Campaign - Not much too it other than you leveling up your submarine and character buying more crew members and (SPOILER) fighting bosses that there are 4 or 3 of them

Difficulty - You will struggle and need to use your brain when a swarm of creatures swim their way in to your submarine trying to break in to it.

Fun - Single player can be enjoyable, but multiplayer is where it strikes best

It is a very very atmospheric and gorgeous game, even though it gives big Flash game vibes. The music and sound design are impeccable. It's very clearly been given a lot of love and passion. 

The Sub Editor is also amazing, if unintuitive. There are a lot of guides though, including stuff posted on the official wiki site. You can make some gorgeous things with practice, make an overpowered FUCK-THE-ICY-MOON ship, or just customize a personal and handmade vessel for your exact needs. 

The gameplay is weirdly fun for boiling down to a maintenance game. Click button with good timing to make bar go faster. Shoot leak with proper fire gun. Don't crash the ship into that goddamn iceburg. Apply morphine in every situation possible. Apply morphine in every situation [i]regardless[/i] of possibility. You can also harvest plants minerals which is very fun as well. All of them are really quite pretty. 

The combat is very, very tense. Catastrophe is common and frankly a lot of the more chaotic parts are about fixing the catastrophe. One leak can spell your doom and there is very often more than one. The weapons, however, are really damn fun. There's railguns! Miniguns! Shotguns! .61 caliber revolvers!!! It's amazing. 

The perk system is satisfying, and most of them are genuinely worth considering over the other. The perk points are rare enough to be very, very exciting when you get one. 

I haven't played the multiplayer yet, but I'm told it's very very chaotic. In contrast, the singleplayer is described as relaxing, and I must say I agree with that statement. Outside of combat, you have total control over the situation at all times. You go at your own pace, get all the money yourself, choose where to go, and answer to noone. It's nice.

This underwater odyssey transcended the boundaries of traditional gaming, offering an experience both creepy and cozy that captivated my every sense.

As I took on the mantle of captain, the weight of responsibility settled on my shoulders like the depths of the abyss itself. The eerie ambiance of the game painted a vivid picture of the unknown, with every creak of the submarine's hull and flicker of the flickering lights adding to the suspense. Yet, in this unsettling atmosphere, a strange sense of coziness emerged – the camaraderie among my crew, the warmth of the dimly lit cabins, and the shared struggle against the unforgiving depths forged bonds stronger than any naval alliance.

The brilliance of Barotrauma lies not only in its atmospheric design, nor only in the reliance on team communication, but also in the seamless integration of mods that elevate the gameplay to unparalleled heights. From enhanced submarines to terrifying sea monsters, the modding community has breathed new life into the game, allowing captains like myself to tailor our underwater adventures to our wildest imaginations. I personally think Barocraftables is the best mod due to it allowing a crew to completely change their ship throughout the campaign. The mods transform the already gripping narrative into an ever-evolving saga, where each playthrough feels like a fresh exploration into uncharted waters.

If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead– murdered by my brother-in-law, Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now, and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, he asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded. I... I always thought Hank was a very moral man, and I was particularly vulnerable at the time – something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me in on a ride-along and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin, so I agreed. Hank had a partner, a businessman named Gustavo Fring. Hank sold me into servitude to this man. And when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn. Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling-out. Things escalated. Fring was able to arrange – uh, I guess... I guess you call it a ""hit"" – on Hank, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured. And I wound up paying his medical bills, which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge. Working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring. The bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA. To keep me in line, he took my children. For three months, he kept them. My wife had no idea of my criminal activities, and was horrified to learn what I had done. I was in hell. I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, and in response, he gave me this. [Walt points to the bruise on his face left by Hank in ""Blood Money.""] I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family.

I recently submerged myself into the enthralling depths of Barotrauma, and the experience left me captivated and eager for more. This game combines the intensity of survival with the thrill of exploration in an underwater world filled with danger, and it's an absolute triumph.

Immersive Underwater Atmosphere
Barotrauma's atmospheric design is nothing short of breathtaking. The dark, foreboding depths of the ocean create a sense of isolation and tension, perfectly setting the stage for the challenges that lie beneath the surface. The ambient sounds and visual details contribute to an immersive experience that keeps players on the edge of their seats.

Cooperative Chaos
The cooperative multiplayer aspect of the game is a highlight. Working together with a crew to operate a submarine adds a layer of teamwork and chaos that is both exhilarating and unpredictable. The need for communication and coordination creates memorable moments of triumph and hilarious mishaps, fostering a sense of camaraderie among players.

Varied Roles and Responsibilities
The diverse roles players can assume on the submarine add depth to the gameplay. Whether you're a captain, engineer, medic, or security officer, each role is vital for the crew's survival. This diversity not only encourages strategic thinking but also provides a unique and dynamic experience with each playthrough.

Deep Crafting and Customization
The crafting and customization system allows players to modify and upgrade their submarines, adding a strategic element to the game. The depth of options for tweaking and improving the vessel ensures that no two expeditions are the same, keeping the gameplay fresh and engaging.

Developer Engagement and Community Support
The developers' commitment to the game and the community is evident in the frequent updates and responsiveness to player feedback. The dedication to refining and expanding the game shows a genuine passion for delivering an exceptional gaming experience.

Conclusion
Barotrauma successfully combines gripping survival elements with cooperative multiplayer dynamics, creating a unique and memorable gaming experience. The underwater world it presents is both beautiful and perilous, making every expedition a thrilling adventure. For those seeking a challenging and immersive multiplayer survival game, Barotrauma is a must-play that continues to evolve and impress with each dive into its depths.",1701604102,1701604102,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

A lot of different biomes, different missions, different enemies, good progression. very versatile game. If you're really nitpicky you might find some flaws, but honestly, in my opinion, those add to the game. I love when the outpost's npcs get stuck on the stairs and start pole-dancing. 10/10. Game is very much alive, I recommend playing with friends, but there is a also a super lively co-op and modding community. Have considered getting sound-proofing from how much fun I have with this game.

There's also supposedly a sussy amogus traitor mode but i haven't gotten any traitors yet (except that one engineer that keeps making me drink energy drinks to make me nauseous... hm. and sometimes they hit me with their wrench?? they also keep making WAYYYY too much C4 and claiming it as ""making medicine"").

Game has it all. Seriously. You can make a band with the crew (drums, harmonica, guitar...) and HUG the pet alien dog/cat/snail/blob/bird/lizard/peanut. This game has CLOWNS in it too; and psychosis!

If you can nab it on sale, ABSOLUTELY go for it, but with the amount of content and addictive gameplay, it's worth full-price too if you can spare it. Also, absolutely suck your friends into it :) I seriously didn't think this would be a game I would enjoy at first, but I'm thankful everyday I have this silly submarine game.

I have a friend who likes Space Station 13 — a niche 2D pixel-art multiplayer game with a lot of deep gameplay mechanics. It's also very role-play-oriented, and I think most of the servers would ask you to play the role you chose (say, a civilian bartender) not to ruin everyone's experience. I'd say it's not exactly user-friendly, maybe even difficult to play, but it's quite a unique experience due to how all of its gameplay systems work together.

[b]Early Access[/b]

One day, that friend of mine introduced us to Barotrauma. Back then, it was still in early access. And despite being quite different from SS13, you could tell it was inspired by it. And even back then, it was an adventure.

The developers were releasing updates from time to time, and, over the years, we have gathered our old team to have another adventure 2-3 times. Since the campaign wasn't completely done, our adventures were never really finished, but each took at least a few sessions, every session being 3-4 hours long.

[b]2023[/b]

In March, the game left early access. For this occassion, we have gathered our old team, and a few guys who never played the game before. Due to timezones and work, the most difficult thing for us was to find the time that suited us all, so our sessions were not really regular. But, after around 80 hours (so, months after release), we did beat the game after all.

Like SS13, it has a lot of deep gameplay mechanics (like electrical signals wiring; health/medicine; crafting; water, oxygen and fire simulations) and is coop-oriented. Unlike SS13, it's more user-friendly, modern looking, and overall slightly different from it in its core. This, and thick Lovecraftian-like atmosphere, all mixed into a long, and sometimes challenging or even unfair, campaign of exploring the depths of an ocean, fighting monsters of various sizes, and overcoming emergency situations on and off your submarine.

And even after release, developers still continue to work on the game, making content updates, bug fixes and quality of life changes. On top of that, it supports Steam modding, and community has all kinds of things there. And with in-game submarine editor, you can also make your custom build and share it with other players.

If you have the friends to play this with, this is a game that totally worth at least trying it.",1701125157,1701125157,True,1,0,0.52702707052230835,0,True,False,False

[h1]Nitty-Gritty[/h1]
Turns out, the first three people I'd choose to hang out with on a submarine in an inter-planetary post-apocalypse are the last three people with whom I'd like to be trapped on a submarine in an inter-planetary post-apocalypse. Funny, eh, life's coincidences?

It has its fair share of public griefers, hackers, and trolls, but overall it's a good, fun game, especially in private servers. The in-game tutorials don't walk you through everything they could, and you have to walk through them all subsequently, and I do mean [i]walk[/i], but they're a good starting point to establish your preferred role (even though someone must always be the captain in a server). There are now well-functioning skill trees for your characters, which I greatly appreciate, since it used to be if you weren't an electrician, you were basically a toaster, and if you weren't a medic, you were Edward Scissorhands.

Genuinely intricate DIY sub-building. I can see why they put the videos outside of the game instead of loading them into the files; you can copy-paste bits and pieces, just fine but a good 10 hours of my play time has been spent trying to figure out how to jerry-rig two pre-built minisubs onto one unholy abomination of what constitutes a military-ready transport-class deep-sea submarine, because when you give me multiple choices, I usually select them all. Also, you can infect your friends with parasites, steal their IDs, and walk around in a suit to impersonate them and their permissions.


The Security team AIs can stuff it--literally all of them, every single one; just strip them of their gear, confiscate their weapons, and lock them naked in the airlock before opening the external doors--the Assistants are pretty much worthless if you're the captain, and the engineers and electricians can barely function without supervision over simple instructions like, ""For the third time, don't blow up my goddamn nuclear sub, Harvey!"" or ""DAMMIT BARBARA, I SAID FIX THE REACTOR BEFORE THE CONSOLE."" or ""If you don't want to be beaten with a crowbar, don't be an idiot, Elliot. NOW GET BACK HERE!"" Medics are pretty good, though; just tell them to follow you so they don't go chasing your jettisoned security officers.


[h1]Take-Aways[/h1]
Seriously, though, being able to disable the handcuffing from AIs, or being able to handcuff AIs would be my greatest recommendation to the devs, because even setting one's server to chaos does not stop the captain's own crew from imprisoning him and his friends, who cannot in turn imprison them.

If you've got friends to play with, I can recommend this game at full price, even with the supporter pack; if you're playing alone, I'd say go for a 50-75% sale, though, because the best parts of this game are played in groups and you probably won't feel your money's worth otherwise.",1690313324,1701120270,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

At first I was skeptical. So many clones of SS13 have been attempted (myself included) and have failed (also myself included).  And there wasn't a lot to see when this game first came out.

However, here we are today, after many years of early access, and I have to say, the game is absolutely amazing. I wouldn't call it a predecessor of SS13. It has similar mechanics (deep learning curve and simulation, sabotage, small confines of a ship, etc.) but it's unique in it's own way. Everything it does it does well and when you have a good group of people to play with, it really is a lot of fun.

Having an unknown traitor on board as one of your friends is truly a fun mechanic. Many games have replicated this traitorous mechanic and I feel like this game could have been a lot more successful if it was a lot simpler. Other games with traitorous mechanics usually have very simple tasks that are supposed to be minor distractions while the traitor(s) go around completing their tasks, but Barotrauma forces the player to really focus on their tasks and the traitors end up being a minor distraction given the depth of the jobs each player has to focus on.",1701107262,1701107262,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I watched the  ""Making of..."" video and the creators are Scandinavian metal heads that wear all black and then paint their nails black on Sunday. They obviously worship an old pagan Norse god of torture, sadism and Dethklok.

Very steep learning curve, tutorial took almost an hour.  There are lots of touchy, fragile interdependent systems that are the game, any of which will kill you in quickly and creatively. Like spinning plates of C4 and Alien face huggers, with some sabotage for fun. Tutorial took about almost an hour.  Your friends will get pissed off unless they took extra Adderall and decided not to study today.

Interesting concept, theme and game play, but for me there was not enough fun pay off for the difficulty and constant break down. I gave it a good try and then it was too much time to get a refund (anything more than 2 hours). 

You will be doing your first basic mining or Fedex mission and the submarine hull will breach, a lot. You will be trying to weld repair and one of your crew will drown. And then, your sub will get boarded by a couple deepwater razorclaws and you will bleed out after trying to shoot them with a welder and stab them with your screwdriver, because the mission asked you to buy 6 bullets, which is not nearly enough. 

This is not clear when you buy the title. It looks a lot more fun than I had and there will be rage quitting.

Singleplayer has its benefits and a lot more atmosphere than multiplayer. The issue is you're essentially running a daycare with AI and while they mostly work fine it can get pretty limiting when you move out of the submarine.
Multiplayer with a good crew you have everyone knowing what they need to do or in the process of learning. Better than AI every time and can help track supplies the ship needs along with handling resources. Again singleplayer you have to do all the higher level thinking stuff on your own and that's taxing. So sharing the burden between players is great. Only thing I'll give AI is that it's much better at monotonous tasks, because no fucking human wants to do that.

(I've spent 4/5 of my game hours in the submarine editor)

I suggest you do that after playing for some hours, it's fun, if you're someone like me who prefers to build stuff instead of it being handed to you while playing games. If you're not or you have limited gaming time then you should use the different default submarines, they're very good as well and get the job done.

Clarke had developed it. Barotrauma is very much its own thing, but with pings and echoes from other sci-fi classics.

It is a unique simulation unto itself with a smorgasbord of features including character development, crafting, factions and unique storyline that develops as you progress through the single player campaign.

Other features include:

+ Steam Workshop/Modding support adding subs, creatures, QOL and total conversions

+ Hilariously fun multiplayer, but get to know how to play in single player mode first

+ AI crew, that can succumb to stress, crises and parasitic infections

+ Random crew chat dialogue that adds to the atmosphere

+ A look and feel unlike anything you've tried, this one is in its own corner

You can spend hours on it, finding the perfect combination of sub and crew, or you might just pop in for a mission or two like I do, between other life activities or software.

Highly recommended for fans of FTL looking for something along the lines of an adult graphic novel inspired FTL, though don't expect FTL.

There are a lot of things to do in this game such as crafting, killing monsters, stelling supplies, or trying to take over a station most of these features weren't present in the legacy. I do admit I still have the best memories from BT legacy because it is free and the only downside to the steam version is the steep price but luckily the game is often updated with exciting new content and is also often on sale so you and your friends can pick it up. If you are planning to play alone I don't recommend it as it is not nearly as fun as it is with friends.

Edit: Steam awards 2021, hopefully this game will win as it is still easily one of my favorite games the updates have never disappointed me or my friends.

Edit: Steam awards 2022, Barotrauma is still one of my favorite games. There were few major bugs but the developers have fixed them and introduced a lot of QoL features. The best part about this game is the modding community that expand the game unimaginably.

Update 3: 

This game is now ""finished"" or Fully launched, however you would like to look at it. However, The devs are still giving it tons of bug fixes, tid-bits of content, and have said they are not done with the game yet. That coupled with the great quantity and quality of mods means this game will last way into the future. The only thing I think is holding this game back, is still the price tag. Its definitely worth the money, but for the type of game it can be hard to get people to drop 35$ on a game that can take a while to learn.

Don't have friends? play solo and have an AI crew that you can swap between or go into lobbies with strangers and make friends, or enemies, up to you, just go have fun, want to cause mischief you can either go be a traitor in the special game mode, or just do it normally, I would warn caution to you though. you may make to many enemies

It was my first time playing this game, I barely understood how to control my submarine as my two AI controlled crewmen kept it from completely falling apart from my naivety behind the helm. The reactor growled like a hungry animal, gnawing on our fuel reserves. I knew resources were short, however, and my sonar had just picked up what looked like the wreck of another submarine just below us! There *had* to be some fuel rods on board, and we did not have many, so naturally this was a stop that seemed *critically* important. I gathered a bit of courage, knowing full well my thalassophobia would try to kick in if I left the safety of my submarine, but the bots certainly weren't going to handle it for me. So, diving suit on, extra air tanks grabbed, and my trusty harpoon gun now in hand, I opened the airlock and stepped into the cold, briny expanse beyond my cozy metal diving can.

My swim to the wreckage was thankfully brief, hair standing on end a bit already as my visor light pierced only a few feet into the seemingly endless black of Europa's vast sea. My feet touch down on the top of the rusty old plating with a echoing metallic *thud*, the sound of my plasma torch muffled by the heavy water pressure around me as I cut through the docking hatch. The sound of water rushing into the previously empty hallway of the seemingly ancient derelict was all that greeted my entry, quickly returning to near perfect silence as the room was claimed by sea water. The dark, rusted interior of the vessel did no favors for my anxiety, but I needed fuel rods, and a little rust wasn't going to scare me off.

I went right to work, my oxygen meter slowly ticking down and keeping my mind on task, knowing that taking in the scenery for too long would leave me empty handed, or worse, with empty lungs. The cabinets of the airlock hallway offered a few trinkets, diving knives, old clothes, simple gadgets my own sub had in abundance already, barely worth taking for scrap. Cutting through another bulkhead door, I was shoved inside by the water as it dragged me into another formerly vacant space, and panic briefly caught hold of me. My harpoon gun is immediately and held forward, ready for whatever appears from the shadows! But after a few seconds... nothing. I am still alone aboard this dysfunctional vessel, and with a bit of luck, it will stay that way. Continuing to scavenge and scrounge whatever my pockets can hold, I descend deeper into the metal beast, checking it's flooded ballast tanks, it's empty medical bay and it's busted O2 generator, it's main airlock blown open and exposed to the sea beyond, until finally i find it's reactor room!

I almost dive onto the control panel of the hulking generator, popping open the fuel ports and ready to salvage that nuclear gold for myself, only to be left frowning at four empty slots. Did someone else find this wreck first? Did this submarine run out of fuel and sink, unable to crawl home after whatever blew open the airlock? The questions piled in my mind as I looked around the room, nearby cabinets offering nothing but a few old engineering suits. Rad resistant, yes, but useless to me now. Sighing in disappointment, I remind myself that I haven't searched the whole ship yet, there could still be a fuel rod around here somewhere! Resuming my search, I climbed back toward my entry point, intending to check the other path I had initially ignored. An old, faded label along the wall informs me that i'm nearing the helm of the ship, and ahead lies another bulkhead, this one with a aged porthole resting within it's rusted frame.

The faded, reinforced glass glares my visor lamp back in my face as I approach, but after getting close enough, I finally see a few feet into the helm. Suddenly, a silhouette of a diving suit fills the porthole, a second one at it's back! Survivors?! My plasma cutter finds its way into my hands almost instinctively, and I start to cleave into the bulkhead's protective sheets. The figures watch me through the glass, seemingly just as desperate to leave this God forsaken hulk of metal as I am. It was annoying, not being able to see the faces of the people I was saving, but i had to act fast, they couldn't have much air left down here and their suits look as old and derelict as the submarine!

That's when my face went pale, and realization hit me. The electrical systems have clearly aged beyond repair, the oxygen generator was destroyed when i saw it, there's no way air is still flowing in these flooded confines. And their suits, while old, are the same as mine. The visor lamp is, to my knowledge, bio electric! It would run as long as an at least *recently* living entity was wearing it. Meaning whatever is in there... My morbid curiosity gets the better of me as i stare closer from my presumed safety, just as one of the figures *slams* into the bulkhead, shattering the visor of it's suit against the viewport! The face inside is mutilated beyond recognition, sharp tendrils scrap their barbed tips against the glass as they violently attempt to lunge at my throat! I step back in shock, my mind kicking itself over the fact I almost let those things *out*. Then the question that tips my anxiety to the boiling point enters my mind, where are the bodies of the crew? This ship has been empty of any and all remains, it's airlock is completely obliterated, and yet only these two ""bodies"" remain? That was the last straw, this submarine was hiding something sinister and I was not about to fall prey to it and leave my crew without a captain. So I grabbed what I could and climbed out the docking hatch once again, returning to my own submarine's somehow welcoming groans of hunger. I've still got a mission to finish on my way to the next port, and maybe this scrap will sell for enough to buy the old girl some food instead. So with a sigh of relief that at least I didn't bring any trouble back with me from below, I took my seat at the helm once more, and set sail toward another job.

-End of story, actual review time-

Barotrauma does many things right, in my opinion. It's mechanical depth allows every player to feel like part of a crew even if they aren't directly piloting the submarine. Everyone has a job to do, and together it can be done. But beyond the thin walls of your assumed safe space the seas of Europa are hiding some terrifying things far dangerous and often vastly larger than encountered here. If there is any one thing I would say this game does best, however, it's in it's atmosphere and aesthetic. Europa is an oppressively dangerous place to live and work, with each port giving you a small breath of tension free air and offering a few laughs thanks to the game's sense of humor. 

Often times your submarine itself is a good, relaxing ride, shipping cargo between ports and mowing down a few swarms of crawlers or the occasional mud raptor. But when you dare to leave your submarine, the tension grows thick. You cant see very far, and we humans are not designed for life thousands of leagues deep. Your ability to breath is on a timer, you can die easily, and you are most certainly *never truly alone* out there, somehow *especially* when you're the only crewman outside. 

Once you learn what lies below the cozy ice sheets the main routes travel through, that terrifying moment when your little blue sonar ping is returned with a loud, large orange ping from something *far* bigger than you? You'll learn quickly if you have a fear of the deep. Or maybe if you're unable to resist the urge to go deeper, find a way past depths that would normally crumple your submarine like a soda can, build better submarines that make the process easier (or harder, you glorious rebel), you'll find something worth your trouble? I, for one, found a new favorite game for my list.",1700927691,1700927691,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

In case it's not obvious, you're a seaman on a submarine. In space. Not quite in space, but a moon of Jupiter, so definitely not Earth. Everything out there is trying to kill you, while you're just trying to make a living, sometimes including other humans. You can side with different factions by completing their quests (only a handful of them right now), earn money for... basically housework of the submarine. Restock on ammo, improving guns, appliances, and all that business. 

Immense opportunity of roleplay, even with just 2 or 3 other friends. Getting a full, 10 man sub full of actual players and setting up a chain of command between you is undoubtedly hard, but it can be SO MUCH FUN.

With that said this game is an absolute BLAST, a lifefull campaing full of adventures, losses, and stories to tell. Vanilla game is such a masterpiece that i can't even START to explain how good it is. Mods for this game are good too, for those who are bored of Vanilla map, outposts, and locations you can try Dynamic Europa. Got bored of same old ungodly monsters from deepest corners of the abyss? try Barotraumatic. Getting tired of firearms and armor Variety? there are so many weapon and clothing mods that entire book won't be enough to count all of them. Want to try a new submarine? there are tons of those in the workshop. Need a new job to play with? try Warden or Diver or any other job that you can find at the workshop. My point is that no matter how much you play this game the possibilities are ENDLESS, you can play and act however you want, and that in my opinion is what makes Barotrauma, Barotrauma. No matter how many times you play this game, you will always find something new for yourselfs and friends, so stop reading this review and buy the dang thing already! join the others at the journey to the eye of Europa and prove that you are worthy of this crew!",1700918811,1700918811,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

When I finally played it for myself, I was impressed by how much there was to do in it's early access form. I have had a lot of fun playing solo and multiplayer. I love to play it vanilla, but most of the community created content is good too. The diverse cast of jobs allows for you to find your niche among the crew. Really the only thing I disliked is that the game sometimes crashes, but that is to be expected from an early access game like this.

However, after learning each role, I truly love this game. I think many would, and I HIGHLY recommend checking it out. 
Pros:
Creepy Atmospheric Music
New game style with in depth innovation. 
Each multiplayer game is totally different, it's always something new that will happen.
Mods and community have made some great templates for ships, mini subs, maps, game styles and more.
The option to play entirely solo game, or multiplayer. 
Pretty good graphics. 
Constantly updating. 

Pro\Con:
You MUST work together, or die together. This is with exception of having Traitor enabled, which allows you the option of ending alone, or killing everyone.

Cons: 
Learning curve (take the tutorial, for others, if not yourself), both in game and with the game interface itself. Some mods can become out of date, and require PC knowledge to go and manually delete them to avoid constant error popups when starting game(s).
Solo AIs aren't very intelligent, and even cannot perform some basic things without taking direct control of them. They also are even worse on mod created ships. 

All in all, I would recommend this game to just about anyone. It's a total trip.",1700868252,1700868252,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Enough chaos to make any encounter varied and manageable. Fun missions both outside and inside the submarines whilst never feeling impossible.

Traitors was a great update and it runs well on my laptop (minimum system requirements) and I nominated for 2 places on steam awards.
Devs are great as they know many of the small issue with the game and fix and bug path frequently.
Only issues I had were with the bots but their getting reworked. 

Another issue is you can't tap to click when using a touchpad so you definitely need a mouse to play this.

I crawl out of a closet to find myself and one of our AI crew members to be the only survivors. The dozen other crew members having died in under ten seconds. Assessing the damages, the only reasonable course of action left was to take the AI down and swim out into the murky void. Surrender to Europa.

Multiplayer: Up to 16 players can all man a submarine at the same time.

Solo: Exactly the same as Multiplayer but you are ALONE, real fun for people who likes survival single-player games.

Mods: There are endless mods for Barotrauma, submarines, weapons, player models, more aliens, scarier experiences and more dangerous elements to the world.

Role-play: The Role-play is really fun, the game has a trait system so every time you create a new character on a server they will get a random role-play trait. If you act according to the trait you will have a fun experience.

Skills: The skill system is very good, there is a lot to choose from.

Final thoughts: If you enjoy Survival games, either Solo or with Friends or Strangers. Then this game should be very fun for you!",1700830197,1700830197,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The inventory system is very easy to get used to, and if you somehow get bored by this game over time there is a large array of mods, good ones at that, to make your experience more interesting.

There is a lot of things to like with this one, such as the atmosphere, the tension and you really do feel the pressure and desperation of survival when your hull is about to breach, there is unspeakable horror outside and most likely now also inside the sub but you still have a chance to make it to the next save outpost if only you could fix the pump to get the flodded section between you and the helm under control...

Some runs just end on a wreck and the survival rate ... well lets just say I nominate this game for ""Game I suck at"".
The good reviews are justified and the jank and odd controls add to the charm after getting used to.

You traverse an ocean inside of various submarines that can be chosen from a list of vanilla or workshop subs you can download.

Barotrauma is a game of many features:

Weapon variety and Combat, you can kill enemies and your friends in many ways which can vary from guns mounted on subs, to handheld firearms, harpoon guns, melee weapons, and an assortment of grenades types. Harpoons guns can have their harpoons recovered after firing. Revolvers are a good backup weapon and can be used with one hand. Assault rifles take up a backpack/toolbelt slot but are all rounders and do good damage. The HMG is the ultimate handheld weapon with a massive DPS but has expensive ammo, but the cost shouldn't be an issue at the point you acquire it. For melee, you can use knives, two handed boarding axes, stun batons, and even using your tools in an emergency.

Traitors can be enabled in multiplayer servers in which a player will be selected at random and must complete a separate objective that is either to sabotage or kill the crew, the normal crew can choose to either kill or restrain the traitor to prevent another appearing, as if the current traitor dies, someone else is selected as traitor.

The health system is in-depth, there are many healing items, poisons, buffing drugs and chemicals in that can be good, bad, or cause side effects, there are many poisons that will kill you or do other things, there are items that will speed you up or make you stronger. The health system is limb based which will affect your performance relating to the location. Once you lose your health, you go into an unconscious state where you stop breathing and lose control of your character, players will have to perform CPR to revive you from oxygen loss or use medical items to heal you to sufficient health for you to regain consciousness.

Classes, there are different roles and sub-roles. The Captain sails the ship and commands it, engineers operate the reactor and repair electrical items, mechanics repairs mechanical items and fix hull breaches, security officer are effective at attacking hostiles in the sub and aiming turrets, medics which heal people and an assistants which are not very good but are decent at all skills.

Alien Creatures, there is a good amount of creatures that inhabit the ocean with some having variations. They vary from small monsters that can enter your sub and kill your crew from the inside, to massive behemoths that can destroy hull segments in one hit.",1575060353,1700774238,True,3,0,0.568345367908477783,0,True,False,True

There is only one downside - you need whole lot of friends to play this game to the fullest...

This is especially true if you decide to mod or touch the sub editor. Lots of little rules that would catch you by surprise if nobody told you about them. Excellent game with a lot hidden under the hood if you bother to look and learn.",1700732609,1700732805,True,2,0,0.543859660625457764,1,True,False,False

Go investigate some odd readings your mission says. Ok, doesn't seem too dangerous. You dawn your clown suit and go to terrorize your crew with a bike horn until a swam of angry minnows attacks your sub. After fending them off with your deck guns and repairing the damage you arrive at the site. Since you've picked engineer you stay on the sub to manage the reactor, watch the sonar, check the guns and perform general maintenance. While your crew is gone something attacks them. They come back and while you try to enforce quarantine they brush it off as nothing. Queue a tentacle erupting from one of your cremates throats as they lurch towards you. You gun them down thinking that to be the end of it. But nooooo a giant screw off Xenomorph that another crew member had been hatching from an egg charges through the door and kills you. You watch helplessly as the rest of the crew fights to keep the menace down. You respawn in a small rescue shuttle and make your way back to the ship. As you dock both ships are enveloped in a nuclear fireball because you were the only engineer and no one else decided to check on the reactor.

The gameplay is somewhat simple where you are piloting a sub from point A to point B in small sections while completing selected goals along the way. The missions are fun with many forcing players to leave the relative safety of submarine to complete the tasks. Enemy encounters have a wide range of difficulty from easy to ""where did our hull go?"" Customization and creation of submarines looks complicated with a steep learning curve, but can generate some excellent works as seen in the steam workshop.

Playing multiplayer is definitely recommended as bots are kind of dumb on path-finding and task priority, but good enough for basic functions like repairs/weapons/reactor operation. In the current state, the mission variety is fairly limited and can get repetitive after a while.

'Tis a whirlwind adventure that had me chucklin' like a parrot with a belly full o' rum. Arr, brace yerselves, me mateys, for a jolly good time!

Imagine this, me scurvy dogs: ye be sailin' through the depths o' the ocean, seekin' booty and dodgin' sea monsters, aye? But here be the twist – yer navigator, bless their peg leg, be readin' a map that looks like it was drawn by a drunken sailor with a shaky hook hand. We be gettin' lost in Davy Jones' locker, navigatin' in circles like a confused crab!

But it be gettin' even better, me hearties! The crew in this game be a rowdy bunch o' scallywags. Yer engineer, he be sayin', ""I'll fix this leak,"" and next thing ye know, the whole ship be floodin' like a breached galleon. We be swimmin' with the fishes, tryin' not to get shocked like a landlubber touchin' an electric eel, while the engineer be scratchin' his head like a parrot solvin' a riddle.

But the true gem, me buckos, be the communication system. 'Tis like decipherin' a message in a bottle from a long-lost pirate. I be shoutin', ""We got a leak in the engine room!"" and what reaches the crew be more like, ""Avast, we be throwin' a shindig in the engine room!"" The next thing ye know, we be celebratin' with cannons blastin' confetti while the ship be sinkin' faster than a cursed treasure chest.

Now, mind ye, Barotrauma be testin' yer patience like a stubborn sea serpent, but 'tis the kind of frustration that be ticklin' yer funny bone like a mischievous kraken. 'Tis like watchin' a slapstick comedy unfold on the seven seas, with jokes flyin' faster than a cannonball.

So, if ye be yearnin' for a game that be tryin' yer mettle, makin' ye laugh till ye snort like a blowhole, and remindin' ye that life as a pirate be one riotous adventure, then set sail fer Barotrauma. But heed me warnin', me hearties, this game be leavin' ye in stitches like a tailor with a blade at hand!

Meant to be played in groups though, and I've only played with friends. The game is hard to learn but easy to master. Features unique visuals and exotic music which builds a cold alien atmosphere usually not found in different games.

As a crew member of a submarine traversing vast oceans of one of Jupiter's moons, your responsibilities come down to two things and two things only:
[list]
[*] One is to contribute to the ship by repairing it, shooting ship's cannons and managing resources. Your goal is to survive and your most crucial tool is teamwork. Someone has to steer too :D
[*] The second objective is to fool around during the time in between encounters. In other words - have fun. This is easily achievable thanks to provided musical instruments, non-lethal weapons or other means to troll your crewmates. Barotrauma lets you ragdoll yourself in a silly matter. It's hard not to enjoy all those crazy scenes that you and your friends play out spontaneously. Yo, there are even clown outfits among other clown things 🤡[/list]

Anyway, game's super fun. Sometimes you chill, sometimes you're fed adrenaline. Every adventure is amazing and produces some cool memories. You'll face some difficulties at the beginning though.

It has a lot of amazing qualities and multiplayer seems like an absolute blast, but I'm playing single player and it's been quite awful. The crew AI isn't just bad, it's maybe the greatest enemy I've had to face in the game thus far. I just lost a sub because my captain decided he didn't want to pilot anymore. If he's not at the helm he's not flagging hull breaches, which meant our ship was attacked by god knows what and then we fell about 400 meters to the bottom of the ocean when we flooded from the breaches, which further devastated our sub. What was he doing? Nothing. Literally nothing. Just standing in a spot likely with his finger firmly up his own ass. He ignored all of his directives and just stood there, mouth agape while our sub was shredded mere meters away from the next station.

And this is just one instance. Managing multiple crew members is like herding a group of angry, coked out cats. The SECOND you click off of one you're using they take off to wherever their dumb little hearts desire. So imagine: you're trying to mine for ore. You control a crew member and head out into the pitch black sea. The game doesn't tell you exactly where the ore is, just a general area. Okay, I'll switch to the captain, do a quick sonar scan and see what the landscape looks like. That should help me get my crew to the place to mi--welp. My miner is already back on the ship... I've been on the captain for less than 60 seconds and my miner raced back to the ship the second I clicked off of him. And the amount of times my engineer just decided to stop managing the reactor is incalculable. Remember: no power means sink straight to the bottom of the ocean to suffer massive damage to the sub.

I understand this is meant to be a multiplayer game, but I honestly would have preferred they didn't add the single player content at all if the AI was this awful. I could've save my money and time if it was listed as exactly what it is: a multiplayer game. It's genuinely got the makings of a great game and it probably is in multiplayer, but the single player experience is just miserable and it's completely because of how impossibly stupid and frustrating the crew AI is.

Then suddenly we all bought it at once for some reason. Our first session lasted 1084 minutes, according to the Steam overlay. Some of us went sleep and woke back up again to rejoin the same session they'd left six hours earlier. This game is bloody amazing!

After 100 hours (of which at least 24 was spent in the submarine editor - the BASIC submarine building tutorial is like 2 hours long and it's considered speed-building if you whip together a decent one in 8 hours or less - if you can design a functional submarine in this game you can probably design one in real life) we finally reached the Europan Ridge. The second biome-area in the game, out of about five, apparently. 

Within five minutes we had submarined into...something horrifying. It took over our ballasts. It then spread to the reactor directly above it, and all of the junction boxes within. It then proceeded to cook the Engineers and Electricians alive. It then erased the Medical Officer from existence while trying to save them. The Captain finally left the bridge he'd grown so attached to after realising his Navigation Terminal was no longer working (unerringly reminds me of kids only surfacing when the wi-fi turns off, actually) and for once, the problem didn't go away because the peasants in the lower decks fixed it. He climbed down the ladder and was instantly destroyed by the horrifying thing that had now taken over half the submarine.

We all agreed that it was a fantastic time, joy all around. Jolly good fun! The submarine that took 24+ hours to make is going straight back to the drawing board!

Along the way we sedated an entire Military Outpost before robbing their armoury of everything they had on them, explored more caves than I can count, salvaged multiple wrecks  and a few hostile submarines, slaughtered leagues of Europan wildlife (all of which deserves it by the way), experienced the riveting delight of the enemy within due to rampant husk infestations, witnessed a grown man cry when his pet Mudraptor was summarily executed on deck, watched horrified while a Clown birthed multiple baby Mudraptors in a civilian outpost for ""the fun of it, Captain!"" and ultimately discovered why you should be afraid of the deep dark.

At one point we were battling a giant Black Moloch (I call them Bollocks for short, which perfectly describes them) who beat us up so badly half the submarine was missing or ruined, and our submarine sank 1000m into the abyss - on the precipice of reaching total crush depth - before we got it running again. On the way back up, we encountered something bigger than our entire submarine. I'll never get the stains out. Our engines and reactor gave EVERYTHING they had to get us out of that hellhole, and somehow we managed it, being smashed around up and down, repairing the hull constantly while the Captain pulled us out of hell itself. On the way to the nearby Outpost we encountered thee Black Molock again, and our valiant Captain decided to shoot it with the Railgun. That was loaded with a Nuclear Shell, and stuffed full of C-4 explosives. At point blank range. The entire front half of the submarine was obliterated instantly - everyone in medbay who were recovering from the fight with the abyssal horror died almost immediately, crushed to death by water pressure - but the sacrifice was necessary, for the Black Moloch was slain along with it! 

There was much jubilation. Vengeance has that kind of effect.

We limped back to the nearby Outpost and ended the round. A round that was supposed to be a simple delivery and beacon activation mission that would take no longer than ten minutes. Instead it took two hours, killed most of us, eradicated all our supplies, caused multiple breakdowns through stress and soaked my clothes through with sweat. 

100 hours. I only bought it like a week ago. I don't even feel like I've even been playing it. Where did the time go? I normally only review games when I finish them...but with this one, I don't even feel like I've started it. How?

I love this game.

The diving part feels great too. There's just something about rushing to the diving suits, gearing up, grabbing your plasma cutter and then jumping out of the airlock of your submarine with your crew in tow to explore some subwreck, or a cave filled with horrible stuff, positioning yourself while floating in the brine to mine some ores or gather some flora, it's just very cool all around, for truth. 

Thank you very much Space Station 13 and FTL for making me interested in this game! If you like those games, you'll love this.

Some sketchy updates post ""release"" though, which has soured my opinion a little of the games future lifespan, and has made my friends quit the game entirely, but oh well. I had my fun while it lasted. Still worth buying if you weren't playing before the ""updates"" - ignorance is bliss!",1629023484,1700681252,True,80,10,0.858704984188079834,0,True,False,True

You pilot a submarine travelling through the deep ocean of Europa, one of Jupiters moons, trying to make a living doing whatever you can. Be it mining, mercenary work, scavenging, stealing, anything you can to get by. The works actually feels alive, with its faction system that requires care being put into who you help and who you hurt, the broken down submarines that you can scavenge or just ignore (maybe you can repair them and even get them running again, but I haven’t tried), the random encounters with monsters, and different factions reacting to what you do. On top of that, the game seems to have been built for multiplayer but if you don’t always have internet like me, there is ai that actually makes the game not only playable, but fun when alone. 

It was built for kb+m, there are great communities made steam deck input maps that make it so enjoyable, I played it exclusively on my steam deck for months before installing it on my pc. 

The game has a constant sense of tension as you need to decide between having your sonar on but risk being spotted by enemies, or turning it off and being blind to your surroundings. Sometimes they’ll crack your hull and send you to the bottom of a cave as you frantically try to get them out of your sub/kill them, repair the holes, fix your machines to pump the water out, refill oxygen tanks if you’re under water, and keep your crew inside the sub and alive. At least when you make it to a station, you can pay a small fee and get the whole sub repaired for you and your crew back to health. You get missions that can change what happens on your next expedition as well. These missions are pretty much mandatory in the early game, as there aren’t a whole ton of options, but later in the game you can make do with mining+scavenging+killing aliens. 

Terrific mod support, you can get anything from a new submarine to a game look overhaul on the workshop and easily choose which mods take effect, and even which ones take priority over the others. 

Also, the soundtrack is very good and sets the stage and mods very nicely. I’m no expert on music, so not much I can say other than it sounds nice.

At first I didn't [b]sea[/b] it, but this game is so much worth [b]diving[/b] in.
It's a [b]reel[/b] promising deal, [b]breathtaking[/b] even, I'm just stunned with how many strong [b]emoceans[/b] this game made me feel already

Not everyone's [b]on the same boat[/b] about this game being worth it, mostly due to the [b]fishy[/b] price, but the [b]coast[/b] is worth it! I'm [b]shore[/b] of it! But you can always get it on [b]sail[/b] instead, [b]water[/b]ver works!

Now keep it in [b]line[/b] tho, that its best played with friends, and the community might get [b]salty[/b], so its best to [b]hook up[/b] some friends to get this game with you before the [b]uncharted territories[/b] that are the open [b]surfers[/b], things will [b]go south[/b] if you don't have what it [b]lakes[/b] or if you're not [b]on board[/b] with how the game works.

I've been [b]sinking[/b] hours into this game and I'm still learning new things, I just cant get [b]tide[/b] of it, the content just keeps on [b]rowing[/b], holy [b]ship[/b] it never ends, and the Devs have an official road[b]map[/b] showing future [b]waves[/b] of updates, and its a [b]crab[/b] ton of content! So much that you can [b]drown[/b] in it, which will ensure the game doesn't [b]run dry[/b] of improvements!

But the [b]current[/b] game already has plenty of [b]fish[/b] to offer! [b]Shell yeah[/b] it does! I don't understand how some people can call the game too [b]shallow[/b] or too [b]hull[/b], this game is [b]fin[/b]tastic! It makes me [b]sand[/b] that its not that known, [b]naut[/b] yet at least

But this game has a lot of [b]depth[/b], it has a [b]reely[/b] interesting campaign mode, and I mean multiplayer campaign, with a [b]reservoir[/b] of things that can go wrong, [b]hellm[/b], the amount of things that can go wrong is off the [b]radars[/b]; Campaign mode has actual consequences if you fail missions, so the [b]pressure[/b] is high!

It has my official [b]seal[/b] of approval, oh [b]buoy[/b] this game deserves to shine, I hope it keeps [b]afloat[/b], I wish nothing but good winds for the Devs!

A group of more than four friends who like to sail together might give this a try but playing it with bots or random people might be something that intelligence agencies utilize in black sites.

Let me say, though, that most of my criticism is highly subjective and I am generally happy that this game has been made, for the developers and anyone who might be inspired to make something that tickles my fancy more.

[h3] What I liked about this game:    [/h3]
- The general idea of manning a ship with different tasks is well done. The positions are sufficiently differentiated so that cooperation is necessary while interesting enough in themselves to not get tedious.
- The artstyle is nice and consistent.

[h3] What I disliked: [/h3]
- The decision to employ a ragdoll engine for enemies and characters not only makes the game look incredibly wonky, it also leads to clipping issues, imprecise movement and very chaotic firefights. Ragdolls should be saved for party games or a long overdue Team America game.
- The worldbuilding and “story” is just strange to me. The background and gameplay are so gloomy that the attempts at absurdity and humour fall totally flat while the fact that you are on Europa in a future where space travel is clearly possible never really impacts anything. Yeah, there are aliens. But it could as well have been some undiscovered deep-sea cave 20 years in the future instead.
- No manual saves. I get that this is somehow still a polarizing point in gaming and might be difficult to implement in a multiplayer focussed game. But the single missions can go on for quite some time if you run into trouble and we have had problems sometimes within the group with our allotted time. Would have been nice to just save and quit when you need to.
- The rougelike aspect isn’t my cup of tea and here it also clashes with the idea of trading which is implemented but doesn’t really make sense. Most of the time you need to move forward. Every mission and station that makes you go back is a risk that you will take 3-5 times at most (I assume). This becomes a gameplay problem, when you NEED to go back because you are in danger to softlock your progress because you ran into trouble and need money for a better ship or munitions.
- It is rather easy to get into a downward spiral. The game has several points at which you need a better ship for which you need money. Also, you need a lot of ammo which also costs money. So if you have a couple of “bad” missions, where you spend more ammo or resources than necessary or even fail them you might get to a point where you can’t really go on.
- More often than not, getting to the next station was more of a drag than fun, especially when random enemies just spawn without warning and jump you which could lead to a cascade of attacks that might add up 30+ mins of additional gameplay after completing some hard missions. Yeah, yeah, the soulsike groupies might see it differently, but especially in a multiplayer game it’s not fun to start over and lose an hour of progress just because of randomly generated levels/enemies. It’s especially bad if this happens (as it did quite often for us) within the very last few meters before docking.
- Whoever designed the last mission should work on sidescrolling shooters but not on this type of game. Or it was a sad joke that I did not understand.

There’s more but these are my main points. Have a nice one.",1700653043,1700654382,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Silence... That's the beauty of Europa. Ever since my childhood I saw these waters in my dreams. Finally I'm here. It's strange that I've feel a connection to this place. Leaving the past behind me I will seek my fortune through Europa's endless ocean. I will be the Security Officer of the 'Unnamed Orca'. She seems in good condition. Our captain is Grand Admiral Yorick, he seems like he knows what he is doing but I have no idea who gave him the Admiral title. Our medical officer is Dr. Kane. he has bags under his eyes and looks tired most of the time even though he seems everywhere around the ship and helping out everyone. Plus he looks like he knows what he is doing too. We have Jeffrey the Electrical Engineer. he is a fun lad. From time to time he gets electrocuted but that's fine he is getting better and his will keeps him on the run. Our mechanical engineer is Jamal Kukri. He is seems like it's his first time in a sub too. He looks clever enough to figure it all out. It's a good crew. We can do it.
[b][i]16th September 2238[/i][/b]
We made a couple of cargo missions to keep our pockets filled. We got a few breaches, shotgun is my fav alien repeller at the moment. I got a new collage Officer Thrawn he seems like a silent man. All is good for now. Everybody is doing their best.
[b][i]22th September 2238[/i][/b]
Officer Thrawn died during a breach. He was in a breached room without suit, his head popped up instantly. The Ocean gave him a quick death. May he rest in peace. I took his body to armory. After this incident I stayed on Coilguns. Sweeping and searching through Ocean's endless void. At some point I thought I heard something, like someone singing. It was only for a moment I guess I'm hallucinating from exhaustion, I gonna take a nap, we are close to station anyway.
[b][i]23th September 2238[/i][/b]
It's AMAZING! Dr. Kane hatched an ailen egg. He seems cute, his name is Peanut. Dr Kane also gave me some methamphetamine gonna try it on my next trip out of sub. 
[b][i]25th September 2238[/i][/b]
We had a GOD DAMN NUCLEAR BLAST IN OUR SUB. We were getting attacked by swarms of Crawlers and Hammerheads around the sub. I was on the guns defending the ship. Suddenly I heard a big explosion and seen a spark on the sub even from the periscope! I went to Reactor room and it was fucked. Jeffrey's remains were all across the room. Poor lad was trying to fix the reactor but apparently, he died because of a nuclear reactor blew up to his face. I'm gonna miss him. While transferring his remains to med bay I saw Peanut eating the corpse of the Office Thrawn. I pulled my revolver and pointed it against the Peanut's face but he just smiled at me. I couldn't do it. Sorry Thrawn.
[b][i]30th September 2238[/i][/b]
We got 2 new engineers. Sigurd for electrical Jamal's cousin Kukri as mechanical. We payed respect to our dead comrades. The newbies seems to know their way in an 'Orca' which is a relief. The ocean has been violent lately. Grand Admiral Yorick died of barotrauma. I'm gonna miss him well. We got a new captain Grand Admiral Thrawn. He seems like a bureaucrat. I hope we will get along.
[b][i]2th October 2238[/i][/b]
I was on meth in a wreck to collect the logbook of the long dead captain. We contacted a husk and i got bitten by it. Dr Kane was with me and he quickly dragged me to the sub and gave me cure for it. He seems like he saw shit about this parasite but he would rather not talk about it. We are the only 2 survivors from the beginning we have an understanding between each other. Plus he supplies me with morphine and meth. It's the best kind of friendship you can find under the ocean of Europa.

We killed a Moloch. It was HUGE. It was a fast kill because we were prepared for it. I loaded the piercing ammo for coilguns cuz that I heard the creature had though armor. It indeed had. But as functional crew we made in no time. While gazing the beasts enormous corpse falling down to the bottom of the ocean to be a feast for the parasites of the bottom. I heard the same song again stronger this time in a language I can't understand. It was... It was soothing to see his corpse slowly fall down to abyss as the song kept on. I was frozen on the periscope of the coilgun. I refuse any allegations to my drug habbits. It was not a hallucination.

Sigurdr died of Barotrauma. Our engineers have a bad habit of dying. It's like this ship has a curse on engineers. We hit an ice block and he hit his head to the wall of the sub which made him unconscious. So he couldn't move or said anything and as the water kept flowing the room. Poor lad couldn't get a suit and died of Barotrauma. We got a new Engineer Eman. He seems on edge after hearing the fates of our last engineers. Can't blame him. 
[b][i]15th October 2238[/i][/b]
Eman died during a breach. A Mudraptor got in the ship and tore him to pieces. I was too late to save him. I blew up the creature's head. Peanut drifted into the void during this breach, that was the last time I saw him. He got sucked into ocean. Hope you are good out there Peanut. You are home now.

Survived my 4th Husk infection. I love Dr. Kane.

We got new engineer, Nino. Hope he survives. That's all.  Also I miss Yorick.

NOW I KNOW! I KNOW! AHAHAHAAHA! We were on a mission to get an alien artifact from some ancient alien ruins. It had a strange architecture. Strange cravings and traps were inside. Soon we found the artifact and as I grabbed it we swam back to sub. But during that time with the artifact in my hand and swimming in the Ocean. Looking directly into that abyss where no light reaches. I heard the song again! It's the most beautiful thing I have heard in my entire life. And this time...
This time I understood. I get it now. Message is clear.

This... this is like the perfect game, all big franchises are dying everywhere you look but at least we still have Barotrauma.... A Whole New World~

great mods but mods can be risky, IMO & the NPC/Bots are kinda useless sometimes they are tinkering with them to make them more useful, but it's still a fair warning)
everytime i kill a Husk i scream: The Wayans Bros. was a good show, and they didn't even get a final episode!

Also, it's amazing that you can use singleplayer CAMPAIGN with Player mods!!

the ragdolls will make you giggle like a schoolgirl while alone at night with a heart of ice, And Hollywood films can't even match the jump-scares, but also the look on my face when i finish these Midnight Mining tasks.

Performance Fix by Evil Factory tends to solve the FPS issues the game has, and i think recently updates in April 2024 really helped, as low Frames Per Second was the biggest issue in the game.

sometimes your mods will break though, load order is key so that takes some testing...if that annoys you then you won't like the game at times, but if you can ignore it (or fix it) then you will LOVE IT

So like i said, the modders have outdone themselves, as well as the developers are tweaking things constantly, we just need a few minor fixes so i can continue the downward spiral into the Abyss, You can install almost any kind of mod and it keeps going BTW, like the Duracell bunny. it's not high graphics and it won't make you pasta, but for the price & all it's little workings 9.3 on the enjoyment scale. (make sure you tip the modders [that i like], they really put in work, lol)

Edit: there are many things that could be added to the game...however to speed it up & make it more fun, like a way to edit your character's features (tough, professional, crazy) after the first load-in to the game, (send them to the re-education camp!) and a way to put ammo in a magazine, so you dont have to carry around loose bullets. 

Max stack for ammo should definitely be 60+ for loose bullets (but there is a mod for this...it doesnt always work though), you dont buy a gunshop ammo pack and only get 8 loose rounds in your pocket.... so i prefer the SMG magazines, but those should stack to 4 or 6 and im seeing it as 2x Mags (i get tons of free magazines when i attack a station but 2 on each inventory slot is a bother)... Duffel Bag MODS are a blessing, because you can put all your ammo in your waistbelt or duffel. 

2nd Edit: i need to add there are too many gun mods, too many diving suit mods & now too many gene mods too (probably), but it's not a big hassle besides needing to sort or avoid buying things and just sell all the guns you find, lol. also, ONCE AGAIN... mods can break because there are so many mods... watch out for that & becareful with what you install, like some mods can be unsafe. i took the risk of using mods from people who have (VAC) bans (cheaters) but i dont recommend other people do this.

And I paddle away from brave England's white sands
To search for my long ago forgotten friends
To search for the place I hear all sailors end

As the souls of the dead fill the space of my mind
I'll search without sleeping 'til peace I can find
I fear not the weather, I fear not the sea
I remember the fallen, do they think of me?
When their bones in the ocean forever will be

Plot a course to the night to a place I once knew
To a place where my hope died along with my crew
So I swallow my grief and face life's final test
To find promise of peace and the solace of rest

As the songs of the dead fill the space of my ears
Their laughter like children, their beckoning cheers
My heart longs to join them, sing songs of the sea
I remember the fallen, do they think of me?
When their bones in the ocean forever will be

When at last before my ghostly shipmates I stand
I shed a small tear for my home upon land
Though their eyes speak of depths filled with struggle and strife
Their smiles below say I don't owe them my life

As the souls of the dead fill the space of my eyes
And my boat listed over and tried to capsize
I'm this far from drowning, this far from the sea
I remember the living, do they think of me?
When my bones in the ocean forever will be

Now that I'm staring down at the darkest abyss
I'm not sure what I want, but I don't think it's this
As my comrades call to stand fast and forge on
I make sail for the dawn 'til the darkness has gone

As the souls of the dead live for'er in my mind
As I live all the years that they left me behind
I'll stay on the shore but still gaze at the sea
I remember the fallen and they think of me
For our souls in the ocean together will be

It's an exceptional game, especially when played with friends*. The narrative is not explicitly presented but rather unfolds through the environment and interactions. The gameplay might initially appear straightforward and unengaging, but it quickly escalates into an intense and thrilling experience. Barotrauma comes equipped with a built-in submarine editor and supports workshop mods, allowing for subtle adjustments or a radical transformation into an ultra-realistic diving simulator. Overall, Barotrauma is an immensely enjoyable game that can be played casually for a few laughs or seriously, delving into the lore and sparking heated debates among teammates regarding their preferred faction loyalties.

The developers behind Barotrauma started out making a spiritual successor to ""Space Station 13."" They ended up with much more. They leaned into oceanic horror elements... in space... in the oceans below the ice crust of Jupiter's moon of Europa. The developers have also mentioned that Frictional Games' ""Soma"" was a big source of inspiration for Barotrauma. The result is quite an experience.

The game is light on story elements, but what there is for story unveils itself pretty naturally as you progress and dive deeper. The random mission (or quest) structure generally involves transporting people/cargo, mining, retrieving objects (Ye Olde Fetch Quests), hunting the wildlife, or hunting outlaws. On the surface this looks pretty limited. But beware... it's not quite so simple, as once you drop into the procedurally generated world, anything can happen. You could get a ""blue milk run"" that has little to no action and is just easy money. Then... you could stumble into terrifying situations that you and your crew barely survive. Playing with bots on even normal difficulty presents a challenge at times, not because the AI is bad, but because there are things lurking in the deep that will challenge even seasoned crews.

Speaking of crews, each member of the sub is important, and will help in vital roles. The sub itself is both the object that keeps you alive, and tries to kill you... that's where the crew's roles come in to play. Whether that be Security, Engineer/Electricians, Mechanics, Doctors, and of course the leader being the Captain. Engineers keep the nuclear reactor purring and maintain electrical equipment. Mechanics maintain equipment, Doc maintains the crew's health and can perform CPR to potentially revive crew that have gone into cardiac arrest. The Captain makes sure everything is coordinated and running smoothly, as well as filling in gaps in coverage when necessary. There is also the role of ""Assistant"" which is basically a ""red-shirt"" from the original Star Trek. If specialist crew are killed, it will typically have a negative effect. Not so with assistants, though there are certainly other good reasons for hiring them as they can provide... some unique... services.

It's a very unique, fun (and at times terrifying) experience, and I hope that people won't be turned off strictly by its classic side-scrolling nature.

Playing in singleplayer is challenging at first but once you get the hang of efficiently assigning and prioritizing tasks for the crew, the AI does those without you having to manually control the specific crew members. 

Multiplayer is where this game shines through as it is absolutely a different experience filled with nerve-wracking pressure and also perhaps some crew shenanigans along the way. Expect the unexpected especially when you go deeper into other biomes as there are routes where you may encounter Abyss creatures.

First, its a great coop that requires cooperation but its prone to chaos. Would you keep your cool or will everything catch on fire while you sink and are boarded by creatures from the depths? Will everyone be covering their post or will you have a straggler that accidentally opens a hatch and condemns the whole crew to its doom?

Also has a traitor mode that can be hilarious.

The game can be very technical. I've spent almost as much time designing subs with complicated wiring and component systems as I have spent playing. You don't have to go into such depths to enjoy the game, but it opens a huge doo for experimentation and chaos.

The campaign has a nice flow and diplomacy layer that you need to manage as well as  resources and economy that reacts to your actions in the map.

Its ok as solo but its not very good because the bots are very limited and it can be overwhelming to have to deal with many of the missions, but bots will perform fixes and other tasks inside the sub with enough skill to be able to not think about them. But you really want to play with you friends.

Update for the steam game awards:

If you like space station 13...or 14 (Now on Steam by the way) then this is the game for you. Enter a sim-like experience where you will struggle to maintain order amongst the crew, fight awful demons that they say are ""Aliens"", and generally try not to die from barotrauma (the insane pressure at depth).

Edit 26.11.2020: Editing this review for the Steam Awards badge yet again! My opinion on the game hasn't changed. If you got some friends to play it with, you're bound to have a lot of fun and even if you don't have friends to play with, you can find some from public servers! :D

Edit 25.11.2021: Here we are again. This game is something that I just never really get bored of long term. Sure I take breaks from it, but I always end up coming back to it! There's also a lot of mods available for the game, if you ever get bored of vanilla. Anyway, until next year!

Edit 23.11.2022: Hi, I'm back! This is the 4th time I'm adding to this review now. The game's still as great as it was before and it keeps getting better as the devs are still actively updating the game. If you were thinking of getting this game, I'd say now's a good time as the game's 75% off and for that cheap price you're going to get possibly hundreds of hours of fun. Well I can't think of anything else to say, I hope you're having a good day whoever might be reading this! See you in 2023! :P

Edit 22.11.2023: Hello again! It's the 5th time that I'm updating this review! I'm still playing Barotrauma, though admittedly not as much as last year.  The game is still a lot of fun though, and they've finally added a proper ending to the campaign (which I still actually haven't got to, but I've heard it's good). Anyway, how's your year been? Good, I hope? To me, 2023 was one of the best years in my life so far, despite some low points. Well, I'll see you next year!

It's at its best when everything is going down the drain and the environment is nothing but chaos but your team is staying organized and clearly communicating.

It's a game of feast and famine, of hurry up and wait. Some tips for getting more enjoyment out of it: use only the in game voice chat/text  (trust me it ties in to a few things), don't do all your organizing when you're docked (it's good to have stuff to do during lulls), and don't look up anything on the wiki (its much more fun to not know what lurks in the deep)",1700607508,1700607508,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

As a new player, I found myself constantly learning new things about the submarine systems its management, as well as the vast array of missions and encounters throughout Europa. This vast array of systems and mechanics allows for an incredible level of pain and suffering, allowing players to really make their time with the abyssal horrors their own.

The gameplay itself is intense, with high stakes and a constant sense of danger. As we descended into the depths, I found myself constantly checking the status of the submarine and crew. Mainly cause we were constantly taking on water, I ain't the best captain. But at least I'm learning and enjoying myself, unlike the rest of the crew.

In addition to the main gameplay loop, you don't need to progress forward as you can always turn back and just have fun while not stressing about progressing. These missions offer a great way to freak out and also provide new challenges to tackle. But yea the game can seem highly repetitive at times. 

Overall, I highly recommend Barotrauma to anyone looking for a unique and immersive drowning simulator. The game's challenging and extremely unpredictable gameplay make for an incredible experience that will keep you coming back for more.

Amazing game with constant update, you can just throw tons of hrs only in the editor to make your best submarine, or try playing the hardest mission with your friends/crew,  is also good for roleplay giving the player lots of things to use.
The atmosphere is amazing with low flickering lights, energy that comes and goes off from the reactor, monsters outside the sub, crawling and trying to break through the hull and a strange space environment around you open to exploration.
 
[h1]Pro: [/h1]

-Atmosphere
-Coop
-Exploration
-Crafting
-Subs/Monsters/Characters Editor
-Workshop

[h1]Cons:[/h1]

- Not easy to understand on the first impact
 there is a tutorial but some things like eletrical components are not clearly explained, you need to use them multiple times and experiment before understading how it works (that can be also considered a PRO)

- AI
The AI is not the smartes if you play solo, but not completely bad. you can order them to do a lot of things.. anyway dont expect help if you are drowning outside the sub. They keep costantly saying a lot of bullshit, campaign-talking 0 interaction with the AI crew (actually anyway is decent AI, hope for improvments).

- Mission in the campaign
Some times the missions you can get form the outposts can be repetitive, they are adding more and different type of missions, the biome the strcuture of the map and the situations change how the mission should be accomplished but some times.. just dont feel enough to breake the game routine

Overall awersome game if you love submarine/space atmosphere and coop palying, is a must play.

Love this game, hope they keep adding things in.

[b] small TRYPOPHOBIA warning for ballast flora  [/b]

this is a complex game which is a spiritual successor to space station 13... you can imagine the chaos this means.

[b] gameplay[/b]
You and your (bot or real) friends are in charge of navigating and keeping a submarine working, while exploring an extremely hostile unending deep ocean that is darker and scarier than the path from your bedroom to the kitchen/bathroom at 3 am

[b]the good[/b]
you will never run out of things to do. specially if you play as engineer/electrician because EVERYTHING WILL BE CONSTANTLY BREAKING WITHOUT GIVING YOU ENOUGH TIME TO BREATHE
and that's when you playing it right, mind you. when you play it wrong you will instantly die.
playing it right means agony stress and slow death :D

you can have your own pet alien, one is named peanut and another is named orange boi. imagine how cute they sound

you can become the alien, or if you are a doctor you can make everyone else the aliens. both in a lethal and non lethal but very mutant way. via genetic engineering and forcefeeding your crewmates.

you can steal stuff which is far cheaper than crafting it yourself :D

[b]the bad[/b]
-peaceful underwater silence... and then explosions that are louder than the jumpscares in FNAF4 out of fucking nowhere, and likely inside your pocket or the area you are standing in. this kept me off of playing it for a while because I almost had a heart attack.

-the bots AI is abysmally STUPID. to the point you can't quite enjoy playing it singleplayer because they will just fuck up too much, lose all your diving suits in the middle of your sub sinking to the bottom while aliens breach and chomp your head off but you cant do anything because the bot lost the last diving suit and chose to close you in the medbay that is now serving as a full ballast because the aliens wanted to enter that way. and yo can't exit because the bot thinks they are helping by constantly closing the door so the alien doesn't get inside, while you, as the captain are drowning trying to escape trough that same door while getting your legs eaten away by a freaking underwater dinosaur.

- the possibility of getting stuck with an incredibly annoying 'DO WHAT I SAY BECAUSE I SAY SO' kinda crewmate, which will not let you do anything other than what they want. yeah I get that you are the medic of the sub, but I know that I should be fixing shit instead of commanding the helm because I'm an engineer and not the freaking captain. (a captain that is very alive and already driving the sub btw)

[b] my experience [/b]

ignoring the first hours of gameplay i had with a shitty crew and the small 'loud enough to make you deaf' jumpscare that almost killed me and put me off of playing it for years..

i am honestly very hooked to this game now, after some rounds with a small 3 person crew which are all very cool with each other, and avoiding explosive cargo, and nannying the reactor to make sure it will not explode... i am having the time of my life pretty much

i love how you can be peacefully navigating the void for a while.. and suddenly you get swarmed by aliens that breach your ship and get inside so you can beat them to death, then get alien aids and since you are both the engineer and the medic of the crew you need to eat a bunch of antiparasite medicine while pumping your crewmates full of opium and giving your sub cop a crapload of steroids so he can go punch the aliens better. 

and then you regain control of your ship, get back on your feet, navigate peacefully for a little while UNTIL SOME MASSIVE MARINE MONSTROSITY DEVOURS YOUR WHOLE SUB AND YOU ALL DIE, and out of nowhere you hear clown noises...

i freaking love this game. space station 13 was made out of CHAOS and even if this one does not reach to even a quarter of the chaos of SS13 you still have your good deal of chaos , and is the chaos and the roleplay capabilities of your crewmates that can make the end of the sub, a glorious time to remember.

9/10

get this if you want to have a taste of chaos and possibly roleplay, oh and also if you like gardening and pet keeping.

Even though you are still restricted to moving in 4 directions, this game is amazing with its open world feel to it, its a crazy experience when something bursts through the hull of your submarine turning your routine of fixing equipment into an all out panic to find either a dive suit or a room that isn't flooded or inhabited by a hostile monster. You will feel like you're accomplishing so much by repairing an entirely destroyed submarine, fixing breaches, repairing pumps and restoring the power from the nuclear generator, junction box by junction box.

You wont know how awesome this game is until you have parked your submarine for an external voyage. leaving the relative safety of your submarine full of oxygen will change the game for you,. With not knowing if there is a monster diving at you from above or below, or not knowing what caused the wreckage you're about to explore. 
I enjoy scavenging for everything i can from a wreckage or from the cave walls/floor to sell, use, or craft with.
Beware the alien structures, if you don't pay attention to the route you take, you could find yourself getting turned around and lost with limited oxygen. The artifact you drag out of these places can be a game changer for the rest of the mission or an explosively failed mission if you don't know what you're bringing on to the submarine...

The unique mechanics and deep sea horror atmosphere of the game plus its difficulty made playing with my group a blast, but as this game was updated its flaws would grow to its breaking point. I think two updates in particular mark the largest drops in quality for the game, the latcher update and the talent update. The latcher update was perhaps the single most mind boggling updates I have ever seen for a game. Abyss creatures are by their design and nature meant to be scary, insurmountable barriers and a deterrent to navigating the abyss. I remember the first time I entered the abyss and encountering an endworm in the first zone of the game while trying to reach a mission objective and being terrified by the line that moved on sonar. We tried to do that mission several more times after that to no avail and eventually gave up on that mission. The latcher is, by design, an easy abyss creature, it is the only abyss creature that spawns in the earliest areas, it has the lowest hp pool of any abyss creature, Its AI will start retreating at a handful of gunshots sent in its direction, its latching attack can send you UPWARDS (and off of hydrothermal vents in many cases) which is more beneficial then it is a detriment. This is contradictory to what made abyss creatures scary, interesting, and more importantly fun. The pandemonium that would break out on my ship when a few orange shockwaves showed up on sonar was fun and constitute my favorite memories of playing this game. During the campaign where I beat the game I was [i] RELIEVED [/i] when plummeting to the abyss in the [b] Hydrothermal [/b] Vents (last area in the game) and seeing that the abyss creature that spawned was a latcher, any and all tension that we might all die was lost and that is [b ]NOT [/b] what an abyss creature should be doing. 

    I don't even know where to even begin with the talent update. I feel really bad for my friend who played assistant because they got [b] DESTROYED [/b] by that update, although as a captain main we didn't get off easy (although captains have always had a bad talent tree, made worse with the medals being nerfed). Engineer is still far too powerful and can do the roles of mechanic and security with their talents. Security and Doctor were good changes, but doctors are still a largely useless class outside neurotrauma playthroughs. Many of the fun things about the talent trees (assistants getting being able to reach 200 in every skill, 3 medals at the end of a mission if played well, Hand Cannon not being trash) were removed and made the anticipation of progressing to get new levels much weaker and is one of the reasons why my group of friends never finished our 1.0 playthrough of the game.

    The last thing I want to briefly touch on is how this game has one of the most out-of-touch communities I've ever seen for a game in terms of what makes this game fun. There was an outrage a while ago in the Barotrauma community over the removal of ""storage containers"" which at first me and my friends though meant the removal of the boxes that items came in when you purchased something but was actually about the removal of a suitcase-like item that functioned as an additional 4 inventory spaces. Me and my friends never realized that so many people were actually playing the game with their hotbar filled to the brim with these items (which sounds like management hell to me) and were so mad at this that they threw such a tantrum that the devs backpedaled. Not the talent changes or the awful latcher update, they were angry about an item that made inventory management [i] worse [/i] somehow. I think that its telling that only 3.5% of players have  gotten the achievement for beating the campaign, compared to 2.1% when I first beat the game prior to 1.0. 

If you want to play this I suggest taking a time machine to late 2021 or early 2022, rising tide was probably the peak of this game.",1700265915,1700266818,False,26,2,0.540685057640075684,0,True,False,False

And now traitors are much more fun to play with. You don't get the same traitor tasks over and over again anymore and now the tasks are much more interesting. And also allowing you to set at what chance a traitor might be on your sub is very cool. The update overall is perfect. I hope they add more monsters, structures and missions for the campaign.

The battle to get to it was hours of fun, enjoyable conflict of managing AI (which were a little silly sometimes) where I fought against so many horrors that made me genuinely spooked (at least for the first time fighting them). There's nothing more terrifying about seeing a sonar signature that [i]you don't what it is and it is coming very very quickly[/i]. It is a fear that made me (and possibly you if you play) irrational as maybe instead of trying to enter an alien ruin, you try to level it to dust by wasting ammo instead of being brave in facing the alien guardians inside. [b]Barotrauma is a game where you don't have as much control as you think you do.[/b]

There are some qualms I have about it such as sometimes dumb AI and a lot of management in singleplayer. I also dislike the fact its so hard to get lore when I deeply deeply want to drown myself (haha) in this world. I want to know the biology of how these monsters work and the ecosystems as well. However, as far as I know, the monsters are just enemies rather than apart of an ecosystem. Lore exists and I know it is deep however it is hard to find with it being thrown in through text or rare characters (which I think is fine, I just want more).

Of course, friends will make this game 10x as funny and enjoyable with the intense moments caused by being attacked by a moloch from the top and a thresher horde from the bottom (you'll learn these terms quick) let the game have any atmosphere you want in a snap.

Accidentally damage the ballasts severely while screwing around on our way to port after the mission, and plunge to extreme depths while trying to repair. We hit the bottom hard, and almost die from the impact. Fortunately, we patch ourselves back up and start the long, 1600 meter ascent to get to port. And then a late game monster hears our sonar.

We are then hunted in the deep ocean by a beast about the size of the ship that really likes sticking its tentacles to the sub and dragging us hundreds of meters down. Not only does it drag us down, but its spine attacks cut clean through the ship and flood every compartment, causing the ship to plummet even further. To top it off, we hooked our brand-new depth-charge system up incorrectly and it didn't work, so we only had our weak cannons to fight it. But after hours of fighting, flooding, sinking, repairing, and the most intense respawn sub journey I've ever seen wherein we ran out of power and had to swim the last 100 meters through the abyssal-monster-infested ocean, we finally got into a rhythm and decided this bastard was our white-whale, and we weren't going home without it being dead. It took everything we had, and by the end we had almost no ammunition, welding fuel, or addictive medication remaining, but she was finally dead, and we limped home.

Gameplay: Barotrauma is a 2D sidescroller. The game was intended to be played mainly in multiplayer, but enough work was put into the bots to make it... playable in single-player. In the game, each person controls a certain human character (in singleplayer, you can switch between the crewmembers), who then, according to his role as well as the needs of the mission, is responsible for doing various tasks among the team's submarine. There are 6 classes in total:

- Captain: Pilots the sub. Usually, in multiplayer games, acts as the ""game master"", giving orders to other crewmembers. He's the most crucial of the bunch, since bad piloting can strand the sub in an unrecoverable position (such as sinking into the Abyss to be mauled by a gargantuan Abyss monster). The sub mostly navigates using active sonar, which also attracts monsters, so around some (like the blind Moloch) you can simply sneak past. On top of that, piloting too aggressively can fry the electrical systems, so there's a bunch to juggle, and it can get quite intense at times.
- Mechanic: Repairs mechanical devices and crafts mechanical items. the game also has a very robust inventory management system, with roughly about one or two hundred different items, each with various functions, and which can be stored within toolbelts, storage containers, or sub furniture lockers. This includes various tools, drugs, weapons, ammo, clothes, etc. On top of that, most items that can be carried can be crafted using a fabricator, while any raw ores mined from inside caves can be deconstructed for raw materials for the fabricator. Usually, the mechanic is responsible for quite a bit of that.
- Electrician: Repairs electrical devices, but can also help out the ship by tinkering with the wiring. The game has a significantly complex electrical wiring system, with a bunch of logic components to allow rudimentary programming of certain functions of the ship. Stuff like automatic nuclear reactor controllers, automatic door controls, remote-controlled guns, extra ballast toggles, silent running modes, and whatever the players can think of. Neat.
- Security Officer: Responsible for the guns. Both manning the large cannons attached to the ship, but also wielding shotguns and SMGs for excursions outside of the ship. A bunch of missions involve exploring Europan caves and alien ruins, which is where the Security Officer shines.
- Medic: Responsible for healing crewmembers, as well as crafting various medicinal drugs, and tinkering with more esoteric stuff, such as researching alien genetic material for genetic boosts. A more niche role in the vanilla game, it's still very helpful to have at least one in a crew.
- Assistant: A role for newbies. Focused mostly on fast skill gain, and becoming a jack of all trades by the end. A bunch of crew talents lose bonuses upon crewmember death - but none of those count on assistant deaths. So, it's essentially the Star Trek redshirt class.

Each class also has a talent tree, which unlocks special abilities for each class. They can range from minor to almost game-breaking. They can give status effects, or they can unlock new fabricator item recipes, allowing for the crafting of new tools and weapons.
There are also a bunch of mods that can overhaul some essential systems of the game. For example, ""Neurotrauma"" is a mod that completely reworks the medical system from the ground up, making it much more complex and engaging. Haven't really played it myself, though.
The game is very in-depth. Expect to spend a day or two just browsing the wiki, like you would to prepare for playing Space Station 13.


Level Design: Sailing the ship from one end of the map to the other takes 10-20 minutes, but if the crew take some 3 missions that require excursions outside the sub, that can quickly balloon to about 2-3 hours. On top of that, due to all the crafting and inventory management, I would also sometimes spend up to 2 hours in each station in-between each mission just organizing and upgrading my sub's inventory. The game has a ""director"" AI that spawns hostile fauna at different points in the mission - it's just a bit repetitive, and you can almost expect and brace yourself for an incoming attack.
The Campaign has some 30 missions if you go straight forward through the world map, so expect to spend quite a bit of time before reaching the ending.


Story: Barely exists. Most of it is tone and set dressing, Essentially, the game takes place in a future on Europa, one of Jupiter's moons. Humans have started colonizing the planet, but then lost contact with Earth. Also, Europa is full of alien ruins and hostile fauna. And the game takes place in an anomalous crater, from what I understood. That's... essentially it.
There are some random events that can be triggered in stations, but they give little extra world-building. There's a group of ending missions, which take place in a unique environment, but that's essentially where the story actually begins - right near the very end of the game.


Graphics: The sprite work is great. The ships feel slightly rusted and worn down, yet still functional. Rugged, yet still high-tech. There's a lot of visual clarity - each piece of furniture, appliance and most items can be easily identified and picked out from background decorations. A lot of aesthetic weight is being carried by moody lights, lamps and other light sources illuminating (parts of) the ship. 
The monsters are straight-up Lovecraftian - the crawlers, for example, give me Innsmouth Deep Ones vibes. The Abyss monsters are majestic in their size and sheer presence. The background has parallax layers of rock floating. Wrecked ships are all completely rusted, like in Iron Lung, or some of the interior pictures of the carrier Admiral Kuznetsov. Europa truly feels like a tight, hostile place.


Music & Sounds: Great. The main theme is strong, full of creaking metal sounds. Intensity layer music almost acts as scare chords. Outpost music is usually a bunch of sci-fi bangers, with samples of buzzing machinery or electronics incorporated into the tracks. I have some of the tracks in my personal playlist that I listen to while working.
The sound effects are quite functional. They're not overwhelming, but draw your attention, and give a lot of info as well. Monsters growl, hurt humans grunt, damaged alien machinery loudly beep, the nuclear reactor buzzes, engines whir, weapons go *bang-bang* while sub cannons lobbing shells go *thwump*.  When an emergency alarm is blaring through your ship, you'll hear it loud and clear.


Summary: When I first read the story idea on /v/ for the game ""Pressure"", I wasn't too hooked by it - it didn't sound so fun. However, Barotrauma proved me wrong - it's a phenomenal game, and, dare I say, almost one of its kind. If you have a stomach for complexity and item management, definitely give it a shot.

While the rest of the community complains about the storage changes, they actually make it much more manageable to play solo. Empty crates are still a nightmare, so is crafting while controlling a single character, and bots still suck but they can be worked around, so it can be done, especially with mods. Not all issues were addressed though, original review below.


This game is not ready for a 1.0 release.

Bots still get stuck. Ordering a bot to clean up will result in them standing around when they're done and not doing the next order in their list. If you were wondering why a turret was not firing and your sub is flooded, then this is likely it. Bots tend to be bad in general, especially during emergencies. They'll struggle to repair flooding breaches up a ladder. They will run around enemies for some reason while I'm trying to get a shot in. Speaking of which...

[strike]A revolver round costs half as much as a railgun shell. As in, [b]one[/b] revolver round, yeah. For the basic revolver, which needs about 5 shots to kill the most basic critter in the game. I can either buy two of these, or buy ammunition that will annihilate them several times over in one hit. Anyway, the consequence is if you get boarded, even if you manage not to lose anyone, you get severely punished in terms of resources, and if you're in the early game you probably won't survive another hull breach. Also, merchants have very little stock of everything, including railgun shells which you need copious amounts of in the late game. The economy needs to be reworked across the board.

Talents tend to be bad,[/strike] mostly the early ones. Some talents only give crafting recipes for very basic things that later become obsolete. Similarly, a lot of talents revolve around gaining bonus XP or leveling skills faster, which necessarily means they'll eventually become pointless.

The game features single player campaign but is absolutely not designed for it. Since traders have very limited stock, crafting is mandatory and incredibly tedious solo, as you have limited inventory slots and you have to haul everything around yourself, while controlling crewmates with different crafting skills who keep wandering off. Being able to order bots to craft things on their own would be much better and would have saved literally a third of my playtime.

Also, for some reason, buying things at a trader spawns a crate in an arbitrary room in your sub with the purchased items inside. Each purchase at a trader (there are usually 3-4 different ones at each station) creates a new crate, which you can get rid of by picking them up one by one and dropping them in the deconstructor in a different room. Empty ammo bins also have to be deconstructed/refilled one by one. All of this easily took another 20% of my playtime. It's completely ridiculous, and yes, you can now guess how much percentage of my playtime was dedicated to actual gameplay instead of chores.

There are probably a few more points I have forgotten about since it's a complex game, anyway I doubt there is time to properly fix everything. Developers have announced the game will be out of early access soon, but this really isn't the time for a full release, it sorely needs quality of life and a lot of adjustments and fixes. I've mostly enjoyed the game by keeping its EA status in mind the whole time, so I can't really recommend this game if it gets out of early access in this state.

[strike]EDIT : 1.0 patch notes don't mention any of these issues, and it seems there are new ones as well. I bought items twice from a merchant which spawned two crates, one of which didn't have the items I bought in it. Previously only one crate spawned per trader, not one per transaction, which I suppose causes the bug.[/strike]",1675717903,1699291971,True,0,0,0.591426432132720947,3,True,False,True

I know many and love them. But Barotrauma is by far the best cooperative game I've ever played! The possibilities are endless! The fun is enormous, the replay value unrivaled so far. 

Sure, it's still an early access version and the AI could use some upgrades, but the game is already a legend.

I would still highly recommend to use some mods (https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3027569027) and also, if you have that time, to build your own submarine in the editor. That makes the game even more enjoyable!

Very little actual content. Most levels are the same barebones wastelands with little to do besides loot the same 3-4 pre-made wrecks, spend AGES navigating alien ruins for abysmally small amounts of loot, mine randomly generated caves that have bugged layouts concerningly often or mostly very samey copy and pasted missions that are ""kill monster but bigger"", ""mine x rock"" or the occasional ""cargo mission"" in which you get free money on basis of cargo missions being almost impossible to fail and having no risk associated with them.

Did I mention the changes to campaign balance? The campaign balance that doesn't exist. Extraordinarily easy to stack armour or buffs to instantly kill enemies, become impossible to damage, and maintain this state for almost completely free.

TLDR: This is one of the best co-op experiences you can have with your friends with a plethora of features and details that a lot of devs simply lack, please support this product.

Barotrauma is such a unique experience as a game, so much thought was put into this and with every update it only expands upon itself in so many ways and evolves itself to fit any medium in its own way (which at least to me says something to the quality). Putting these words into perspective is a bit difficult, so I wont. However! I can telly you dear reader that there are few games that will make you absolutely HATE your friends/crew mates in a very unique way, I stg this is a competence test, you will go through the equivalent anger of watching someone sledgehammer your pet in front of you, then IMMEDIATELY after they resurrected it said ""JK bro just a prank here's 1 billion dollars"". All you are left with is discombobulated emotions and like a higher quality screwdriver for repairs, maybe even a real neat gun. With that intense hatred comes an extraordinarily strong sense of duty and respect for your crew mates, having a full crew in a dire situation doing everything they can to keep a ship running gives an incredibly strong feeling of community, after all its only a few inches between you and oblivion...or another horror of the depths.

I wont go into too much about the actual content of the game, I genuinely think going into this with a group and discovering for yourself what it has to offer is the best possible experience, that being said I wont leave you with nothing, so I'll give general information. Faction status matters a lot in game progression, its not hard to manage just don't go on random killing sprees in stations...Unless it benefits you, you can play this game any way you like and it will generally be viable. Any sub can be customized to its fullest potential, I mean everything, from its shape to the way the wires run and function in the ship, its not even a necessary feature you can just do it to reach any potential you want. The game is linked with steam workshop (always a bonus) I would recommend modding, normally I wouldn't I personally enjoy games as a company presents it but the community of this game is insanely good at making everything feel like an authentic addition (within reason). when on stations random faction missions appear out of nowhere giving you random advantage. Level design and monster design are inspired, some missions feel like you're experiencing one of the Alien movies....just not any post Aliens, maybe Prometheus but only the goods parts. A lot of this game really feels like you are the survivors of multiple horror movie scenarios and the more you learn the more you just become the monsters you fight so hard to quell in your pursuit of glory and riches..... Perhaps some clown related activities.

To close off this rant; this game really is something special to me and I think there should be more like it, I hope this will inspire anyone to give it a go, I promise its worth it.

Often times I will complete objectives slowly, exploring the map, killing off the entities attacking my sub and tediously collecting resources from each one. 

Delving into every cave to collect materials, scrapping abandoned and destroyed subs for loot while trying to figure out what went down. Dragging bodies back to my sub to be returned to their families. 

This takes hours sometimes per delve, so it gets exciting when things go wrong, the stakes get higher. Perhaps the moloch you were contracted to kill rams your ship into the ground, maybe you let your guard down and suddenly a bone thresher and his posse of tigers decide to get under your sub and tear it apart, sending you crashing into the rocks below. 

Thank god I have my crew to depend on, like brothers. Each one of them ready to man the guns, ready to repair the hull, ready to repair the electrical boxes and restore the nuclear reactor. They can all do this in under a minute and if anything gets inside we kill them without prejudice. It’s thrilling when things that had gone wrong end up going right, the cultists even managed to survive in stowage. Nice.

This all works out about 50% of the time, sometimes things get out of hand and loses are inevitable. That’s part of the game. 

But when after all that trial and tribulation, half your crew refuses to equip diving gear before repairing sub and they explode due to low pressure, it makes me want to commit self harm. 

I should not have to use up an order to at all times have my crew ready for expedition so they do not  willingly kill themselves. Please for the love of god give the ai some self preservation. If the hull is compromised and their little bodies are bout to bust why are they repairing before equipping the suits that are in the next room? Sometimes they outright refuse to wear them or take them off only to die moments later.

Edit: New review. With the comeuppance of the latest update; It truly feels like treachery. Radiated_leader had already stated most of what I wanted to say in their review ""  I like the game, I find it pretty fun, both with and without mods. Pretty good servers still remain. I overall really liked it and it was definitely worth the price I paid for it.

HOWEVER

It is a dying game, the devs have made quite a few changes that were opposed by the players, and, like many other games, it is greatly overpriced now.
If you buy this game off-sale, you are paying $35/€35/£30 for a game that has about 5-8 non-campaign servers at a time, and something like 10 campaign servers.
While I can't speak for the campaign servers, since I don't tend to play on them since I consider it a commitment, I can speak on the non-campaign ones. About half of the non-campaign servers suffer from shitty hosts and admins that abuse their powers at the expense of the players.
For the ones that don't suffer from admin abuse, it's about a 50/50 whether your experience is ruined by reactor griefers, shitsec, or medics that just poison/OD everyone. That leaves about 1-2 non-campaign servers at any given time that will actually be fun for a decent person to play.
But of course, you can just play on your own. Except due to limitations of the bots (I think the devs have tried their best to make them better, but they still struggle alot) singleplayer campaign can be a living hell.
If you want to play with friends, that's another $35/€35/£30 for each of them.

Overall, as much as I love this game and would love to see more people join, I can't honestly recommend people to buy it.""
After the community had publicly stated that they would not want the removal of storage containers from the usage inside other storage systems, such as cabinets, it had practically nullified their entire purpose. I am not biased with or against any side of the argument in terms of relations, but instead of the idea of ideal gameplay. The undertow development team has truly made a blunder by the rework of this system, and effectively made grinding in their game FOCUSED on grinding in order to finish a campaign practically physically fucking painful. It has also made SEVERAL, and I mean SEVERAL creators have to redo FLEETS of workshop items to the point some have them may have even given up entirely on the game. So we may lose a strong modding force due to this complete assfuckery. Several times over the community has stated NOT to make this change and yet they stepped over them like bugs -- hence, they no longer care for what the community has but instead completely ignored them. Matter of fact, I myself am starting a new boycotting group against Undertow due to the fact they've overstepped. Yes it IS their game, however to make a change that would irrevocably anger hundreds if not thousands of players due to the MASSIVE scale it has, completely breaking saves and workshop items that FOCUSED on this feature being changed. There was talk on how it was ""difficult for new players"" to find resources -- and that is COMPLETELY bullshit. Now, it will be even HARDER for large scale campaign players to organize their resources and stuff everything into one location, meaning overstock will occur and thus some items will be lost. And then backpacks -- the idea was practically used because of the popularity of a mod. and thus, Undertow practically just yoinked that for themselves which sounds pretty familiar (Ahem. Development teams have taken entire ideas from modding teams quite often recently.)

Even after the community basically begged and cried out for this change not to happen, the devs stepped all over creators who had large-scale ships and stations posted on the workshop, some who may have left due to this change. and then, not to mention the complete RUIN it sets onto previously functioning campaigns which will now have items and storage containers all over the floor. 
The older players pleaded for a while when this was announced, all the more to sell out to newer players who were just a little whiny that they couldn't find some extra items. But since this is a change MANY players don't exactly like, I suppose like all true crews. 
I'm proposing a mutiny. And we're gonna aim for scuttling if the terrible changes are not removed, and fixed.

Now, for those who wish to read my original review:


  


I've played this game since it was a wee legacy on gamejolt and I have to say that watching this game grow is like being the godfather of a child -- You know it's not yours, but you cherish it just the same.

and here's my experience at 700 hours on this version:

When you join a lobby with a long campaign, be sure to check if there's a discord! There's lots of friends to be made, especially when you join the Almighty Meat's servers! 

Clowns are actually a good thing in my opinion (I am a clown and doctor main.) So when you see someone going assistant and in a clown suit, be sure to help them get clown gear! But NEVER provide them explosives! I can tell you right now that in legacy, clowns were the icons of demonic influence! So it's best to help them grow from the negative roots, and nurture the slapstick comedy factors.

Be sure to pick Engineer or mechanic if you don't feel like you could handle too much expectations like a medic or guard, and especially a captain. They're important and also can provide extremely helpful gear in the endgames of campaign runs.

whenever you go out for a dive, grab a couple of extra oxy tanks and place them into a toolbag or clothing piece you have if you have ""pockets""

Never mix up oxygen and welding fuel tanks.

I will edit this review as more wisdom comes to me..

It's poorly implemented, you always get stuck under the destroyed ship making it annoying to continue...

You'll feel the paranoia of a parasite outbreak on the sub, the rage as you attempt a mutiny on the captain for docking your pay, or the fear of losing radio contact with your crew in an underwater cave. Like any submarine, the game is a bit rough around the edges (poor single player support, wonky physics, connection issues, occasional frame rate dips), but will serve you well if you stick with it. Plus, if one sub doesn't work out, you can always make your own or download one from the workshop! To this day, the question ""We diving tonight?"" is always met with a resounding ""yes"" in my discord. I definitely recommend.",1697860710,1697860710,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The premise of the game is simple, get from A to B in a submarine while completing missions and getting paid. But every level is different, and can be a good challenge. The game itself isn't hard, and you will need to learn what you're doing, but the tutorials do a great job explaining. Past that, there is a large degree of freedom afforded to the players. You can create your own electrical logic gates to do just about anything if you know your way around computer logic(not that hard, trust me).

The games replayability is immense, but it truly shines with at least a small crew of friends (2-3 friends can work very well, 4+ can be amazing). Past that the modding/steam workshop scene for this game is one of the best I've seen, and so many of them introduce fun aspects. Your friend is too loud? Cool. Remove his lungs like the surgeon your parents wanted you to be. Wanna get fried alive by sonar? There's a mod for that. Giant mech suits? There's a mod for that. Wanna secretly drug your friends ad make them go insane? That's already a thing but mods take it to a whole new level.

Barotrauma is a survival horror game developed by the Finnish studio Undertow Games and published by Daedalic Entertainment. Following an early access beta phase that started in 2019, the game was later released in March 2023. I enjoy this game and it's one of my favorite games.


Basic Knowledge And Lore
Barotrauma is set in a fictional world where humans have landed on one of Jupiter's moons “Europa”. Due to the icy surface of the moon, people have moved under the ice into a vast and deep ocean. Civilization lived as one until they stopped receiving signals from Earth. Due to the sudden break civilization broke apart and formed into many separate factions. In the campaign, you play as an adventurer whose goal is to maintain his submarine and venture into the depths of Europa.


Location And Setting
Barotrauma does a great job of giving you a sense of location and freedom. Even though most of the game is spent inside of your small cramped submarine, the game nails the caves and feeling of a vast and open ocean. The different biomes give you a sense of progression while reminding you of the dangers that lay ahead. The game keeps you from feeling bored on long journeys with its huge element of surprise. For example, ice spires appear in vast spaces and you need to make a choice. You decide whether you shoot them, causing noise, or you outmaneuver which takes more effort and be silent. This is just one example of the many cool dangers these oceans present.


Creatures
Probably my favorite thing about Barotrauma is the number of scary creatures that roam the ocean. These creatures range from deceased humans that roam the halls of flooded submarines due to a parasitic virus called “Husk”. Fun fact: the husk virus attaches to its victim's bones so you can capture it using calcium extract. The game also features eldritch horrors beyond your imagination such as the Charybdis, a huge sea monster that is incredibly efficient at tearing apart the hull of your sub. It has relatively bad eyesight but it makes up for it with its hearing. If you have your radar ping on and it hears you… it's pretty much game over. The game has tons of terrifying enemies that can also BOARD your sub. Meaning they can claw their way into your submarine and rip you apart. I have separated the scariest 3 into what I like to call “the big three”. One of the big three is the Charybdis who I talked about earlier. The second one is called “the Latcher” It has 30 eyes and lurks in deep dark crushing depths. It attacks by biting your hull and sticking its tongue into your sub, proceeding to drag your sub down into crushing depths. Hence the name “Latcher”. The last one is “The End Worm”. This thing is the most aggressive creature in the game. It makes its presence known even from afar with its loud roars and shrieks. It is the largest creature in the game. When it attacks your hull it will beeline toward your sub hitting it with a devastating blow violently sending your sub flying toward rocky cliffs. This thing attacks all creatures showing no mercy. 

 Overall
Barotrauma is a very scary yet interesting game and if you enjoy a good scare I definitely recommend this game. For this game's price tag of 35 USD, I would definitely buy it without waiting for a sale. I also wanted to mention that I had a lot more to say but I wanted to keep it spoiler-free hehe. Thanks for reading and I hope you have a good day.

I believe it deserves all the recognition it has. In essence, its a game about crisis management, recovery, and team coordination, playing solo your best bet is to grab a good small sub you can manage largely alone, in a group, is where the game truly shines. 

I will not bore you with the dramatics, but my experiences have included. 

Being trapped at the bottom of the abyss by a colossal leviathan, we where unable to destroy with what we had, we instead disabled every part of our sub that was making noise, sealed all the holes, and floated slowly out once it couldn't detect us anymore. 

Watching my captain succumb to a rabid infection that turned him into a monster, having locked himself in the brig to prevent it from spreading. 

Spent hours with a friend of mine who enjoys organisation, meticulously managing our supplies and equipment aboard the submarine. 

Falling into the abyss aboard a re-spawn shuttle, and abandoning it, having to swim up in pitch darkness, while the main submarine barely was close enough for us to pick eachother up on radio. The most despair and fear I have felt in a game, quickly became the biggest joy I have felt in a long time, when we saw the searchlights of our rig. ""I SEE LIGHT! I SEE THE SUN!!!"" 

This game is a challenge, a trial at times, but if you are with the right group, or are personally dedicated enough, you will prevail. 

You must be patient, you must be willing to lose everything if you fail, you must accept the cruelty of the world. This is the philosophy to enjoying Barotrauma.

Introduction:
Ahoy, brave submariners! If you've ever had a hankering for undersea adventure, alien encounters, and the relentless pressure of survival, Barotrauma is the game that plunges you into the murky depths while keeping you on the edge of your captain's chair. In this review, we're going to take a creative deep dive into the world of Barotrauma.

Graphics: 4/5 - ""The Abyss Beckons, in Pixel Art Glory""
Barotrauma embraces the pixel art style with a twisted grin, making the depths of Europa (one of Jupiter's moons) feel both familiar and alien. The submarine interiors are claustrophobic, and the underwater landscapes are hauntingly beautiful. It's like watching a classic sci-fi film on an old CRT TV, and it fits the game's atmosphere perfectly.

Gameplay: 5/5 - ""Waterlogged Chaos Wrapped in Strategy""
Barotrauma is like a chaotic symphony of survival and strategy. You're part of a crew aboard a submarine, tasked with completing missions while battling the elements, terrifying sea creatures, and your own sanity. The gameplay is as unpredictable as the depths you explore, making each mission an adrenaline-pumping thrill ride.

Exploration: 4/5 - ""Europa's Dark Secrets Await""
Exploring Europa's ocean feels like venturing into the unknown. You'll uncover bizarre creatures, mysterious anomalies, and eerie underwater caverns. And remember, every dive could be your last. The thrill of discovering what lurks beneath keeps you coming back for more.

Multiplayer: 5/5 - ""Crewmates or Chaos-Mates?""
Barotrauma truly shines when played with friends. Whether you're coordinating repairs, battling monsters, or plotting mutinies, the chaos of multiplayer is where the game's heart lies. Your friendships will be tested, and the hilarious mishaps will be endless. Just pray your engineer doesn't flood the ship again.

Creativity: 5/5 - ""Submarine Building, Meet Madness""
The real magic of Barotrauma is in its ship-building system. You can create your own custom submarines, complete with reactors, weapons, and the all-important coffee maker. It's like a mad scientist's playground, and the results can be both awe-inspiring and utterly disastrous. Just remember, a bad design can lead to a watery grave.

Terror: 4/5 - ""Fear Has Many Faces (and Tentacles)""
Barotrauma's alien sea creatures are genuinely terrifying. From grotesque humanoid monstrosities to tentacled horrors, you'll encounter nightmares from the deep. The tension as you battle these monstrosities is palpable, and the jump scares are both panic-inducing and hilarious.

Conclusion:
Barotrauma isn't just a game; it's an underwater carnival of chaos, creativity, and camaraderie. Dive into Europa's abyss, face your fears, and forge unforgettable memories with your friends. Just be prepared to shout ""All hands on deck!"" as you navigate the unpredictable waters of this deep-sea adventure. Barotrauma is a unique experience that'll leave you gasping for air and craving more aquatic madness. So, captain, are you ready to dive in?",1696676850,1696676850,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

In the ingame world of Barotrauma, instead of human life, society & social unrest being on the surface, and you being isolated from it, in an ocean uninhabited by humans:

Barotrauma takes place on a moon of Jupiter where humans built underwater cities and outposts traveled between by submarine

there's the Europa Coalition, undemocratic authorities ruling with an iron first,

Jovian Separatists, rebels that conduct guerrilla warfare against the oppressive Coalition authorities trying to crush them,

cultists that worship a horror-parasite,

in a future where a large portion of humanity has migrated to underwater cities & outposts in the ocean on the moon of Jupiter Europa,

You control human characters that can rig explosives & use handheld guns for human player-on-human NPC ambushes, as well as warfare, inside underwater cities & outposts,

which are also part of a free-lance submarine crew,

there's authorities, rebels that wage guerrilla warfare, cultists that worship a horror-parasite, and a clown order,

Like Rimworld and Angry Birds Combined, good game-play loop, Spectacular monster and biome design, and Overall funny
Whats Meh
Grimdark, is not scary in the slightest (and i don't even watch the horror move trailers because i think there scary), World-building is all over the place
What i Don't Like
Factions are as bland as could be, Your AI crew is as dumb as the Multiplayer player crew, Certain Monsters, plants, and viruses can Be annoying
What i would add
New factions (particularly a Prussian, Soviet, or Early USA Inspired one), Random AI Controlled ships that you can pirate, trade, or acedently run into because your player or AI captain is a not smart individual, New Monsters to spice things up
Either things
Game is disinged to be a horror but isint scary witch can cause tone issues, Bugs and lag complained in either reviews have bean fixed (as far as i can tell, my computers ram is 8g), Community is in between normal and the weird Rimworld com so take as you will.
in Conclusion if you like the ""likes"" and at least one ""Meh"" or ""Either"" you'll have a lot of fun either wise Look some where else

Security no longer has ammo after spending it all shooting the clown for bludgeoning them with a hammer and stealing all the alien blood.

Medical no longer has morphine due to trying save the clown by outpacing his bullet wounds and bartering with electrical for monster corpses that they have begun dancing around in the medical office.

Electrical is attempting to put out nonexistent fires and trying to fight non-existent invaders after becoming psychotic and is vomiting from his morphine addiction.

Multiplayer is very fun as it can lead to some great moments in the game.
Although not much lore, the lore the game DOES have is interesting
The game has a good challenge but isn't hard enough to no longer be fun.
The community is nice and understanding, they gave me 10 bucks just so my account can no longer be limited so that I could post steam workshop items related to this game.
The feeling of accomplishment you get when you reach the end of the level after almost dying feels really nice.
The game can very suddenly shift the tone from mundane to goofy, to horrifying to dreadful, and back to mundane all in the blink of an eye.
This game is extremely fun when you go into it blind and aren't aware of what kind of obstacles you'd face, although, I recommend you do at least learn somewhat about the controls and mechanics before you play.

Things I dislike:-
Not many weapon options, and the few weapons that the game DOES have can not be bought early in the game, making it harder to survive intruders.
A steep learning curve for those that know absolutely nothing bout the game
Griefers 
Stupid NPC Crewmates, being limited to assign a maximum of 3 tasks to them, and no quality of life commands such as ""Don't be in this room"" or ""Don't shoot ice spires""
Although most of the talents are great, some feel very mundane.
Although all of the classes are great, I feel like Assistants and Captains are slightly left out, Assistants have a lot of talents related to their own death which can feel unnecessary at times, and although the captain has a lot of powerful buffs for the crew, he lacks a powerful craftable item for himself to make himself feel like a god, the handcannon he can make feels underwhelming, whereas other classes get stuff such as mechs, drones, giant raptor pets, drugs, etc.
The stations although interesting at first, get mundane rather fast, they don't FEEL like an actual place where you'd expect someone to live their entire life, it would be cool to have other things to do at a station besides just buying stuff and getting a quest.
No ""Press R to reload"" and other convenient things most games have.

Overall, I love a lot of things about this game, but also hate a lot too. I very much enjoy playing this game but get frustrated about the minor things I wished this game could change. This game still has some ways to go before I can think of it as a fully finished game.

I highly recommend you try it out (Oh, and here's a tip, if you can't afford the game, just go and download a VPN and pretend to be in a 3rd world country, you'd be able to get the game for a cheaper price, I live in Pakistan and got the game for like 7 bucks at 50% off. If you aren't sure whether or not this game is for you, do what I did, pirate the game, try it out, and then buy it if you come to enjoy it.)",1694854214,1694854214,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

- A submarine is a giant collection of Tamagotchis that constantly need feeding (= repairs). Running through the sub, applying your wrench here, turning the screwdriver there, replacing yet another fuel rod in the matter of minutes, putting out random fires, while nothing of significance happens is fun how exactly? As a workaround you can let a bot do these tasks - which is just an elaborate way to turn them off.
- Hulls are apparently made from cardboard that break when a goldfish licks the paint. So you run to the nearest breach to weld it shut. Which you don't finish, because pretty much everything is almost insta-kill, be it water pressure, alien creatures, etc.
- ""Respawning"" doesn't place you back in the submarine, but in a shuttle that first needs to find the sub, then dock. Guys, seriously, dying is frustrating enough. Why are you making it so hard to get back into action (the fun part)? But that's not even the worst thing, which is...
- Default respawn time of five minutes, really? ""Pointless waiting - the game"". Not fun.
- All this happened on the easiest difficulty, which should be a walk in the park and motivate me to try the harder settings, but really didn't.

If a crew member dies, they're gone for good, though, and some enemies are very unforgiving (looking at you Latcher), so be VERY thoughtful on your choices; with enough coordination and pre-planning you can get through even the worst of it with few to no casualties. Also, there's NO SHAME in running from things, some things are better left alone, and it's DEFINITELY better to live to fight another day.

But the devs seem dead set on changing things in worse directions rather than fixing bugs (like my achievements not getting proc'd) and adding new content, they want to artificially inflate the difficulty by retroactively adding false difficulty. Have you earned a lot of supplies? Decrease storage. Benefiting from a perk they deem too strong? Removed, no attempt to balance.

The game itself is janky and pretty boring for 70% of gameplay, the community has some good folks but plenty of people play the game just unwire your sub and leave. The game's gameplay is mainly a number check: Do you have the resources to survive an attack? Or the resources to defeat a monster? If yes, you win. If no, run or die. It's not particularly exciting after you've done it 100 times, after you've seen all the content the game offers, and the devs don't add new content. 1.0 was the biggest release ever, and yet the somehow didn't manage to add a single new monster that wasn't tied to endgame.

TL;DR: Very active modding community. Every class and play-style has something to offer. Kind devs that are willing to take feedback from players. Great environment and sound design. 

Pros

-Dark and aesthetic environment. Games like Barotrauma really need an immersive environment to pull in players. And Barotrauma executes it very very well. The depths of Europa feel like a bleak abyss. The sound design is very powerful, the creaking of the ship and screeches of the local wildlife feel very real.

-Engaging gameplay that keeps you on your toes. Every role has something to offer in Barotrauma, as captain you have to manage driving the ship and keeping your crew in order, Security officer works of firing guns and keeping the ""wildlife"" outside. Barotrauma is a rare game that can keep you entertained no matter what class you pick. No one class feels less important than the next.

-The modding support. This is a HUGE plus. Barotrauma has a very friendly, and very active modding community. This game is made for modding. And the community does so. Which helps the game feel fresh every playthrough. Main mods I would recommend are: Neurotrauma, Hazardous Reactors, and Dynamic Europa. 

-Active online community. If you don't enjoy playing solo there is a very active community of Captains willing you let you join their play through. The discord has plenty of kind individuals waiting for others to join. 

Cons

-Barotrauma made some questionable decisions on the physics of your character, with them kind of wriggling and flying around due to your legs hardly feeling attached to your body. This is funny to begin with, but can quickly become a nuisance. It's not that big of a deal, but can be frustrating when you're getting stuck in door ways after being killed by an abyssal creature and getting sent back to the station. 

-Linear progression. This isn't necessarily a con as some games can benefit from linear progression due to the fact that it gives you a clear goal. But Barotrauma does have a pretty linear progression without you really knowing what your end goal is. The map is pretty straight forward and you don't really know where you're going. 

In conclusion: Barotrauma is one of my favorite games. It feels fresh with modding support and is constantly being updated by devs that listen to the community. It can be hard to enjoy the game solo and it definitely has it's flaws. But is a gem amongst some pretty bad games that have been realsed within the last few years.",1668229549,1693329218,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

I like the game, I find it pretty fun, both with and without mods. Pretty good servers still remain. I overall really liked it and it was definitely worth the price I paid for it. 

HOWEVER

It is a dying game, the devs have made quite a few changes that were opposed by the players, and, like many other games, it is greatly overpriced now. 
If you buy this game off-sale, you are paying $35/€35/£30 for a game that has about 5-8 non-campaign servers at a time, and something like 10 campaign servers. 
While I can't speak for the campaign servers, since I don't tend to play on them since I consider it a commitment, I can speak on the non-campaign ones. About half of the non-campaign servers suffer from shitty hosts and admins that abuse their powers at the expense of the players.
For the ones that don't suffer from admin abuse, it's about a 50/50 whether your experience is ruined by reactor griefers, shitsec, or medics that just poison/OD everyone. That leaves about 1-2 non-campaign servers at any given time that will actually be fun for a decent person to play.
But of course, you can just play on your own. Except due to limitations of the bots (I think the devs have tried their best to make them better, but they still struggle alot) singleplayer campaign can be a living hell. 
If you want to play with friends, that's another $35/€35/£30 for each of them.

The different kinds of missions, certain quest lines, enemies, locations, submarines, submarine editor - what this game offers is really fun. Not to even mention the mods people come up with.

However that there are some things that are just [b] really [/b] annoying, especially when you play by yourself or with not very cooperative players.

1. If you don't have a deconstructor and fabrication bench on your ship, and have them right where the shop crates spawn, it's extremely annoying and just time-wasting to either get rid of empty shop crates that spawned with each purchase you make or refill/deconstruct empty ammo boxes.
If you have 3-4 human players and they are willing to help you, it's less of a problem, since one crate per player, carrying it to the deconstructor or fabricator to destroy or refill it. But it's still a chore that you all have to do, forcing you to not ""play the game"", but carry stuff around after each and every quest, all the way troughout the entire game. Is there really no better way to code it? Not to mention, what if they are not willing to help, or you play by yourself? You have to take each and every crate all by yourself, [b] one crate at a time [/b], pick one crate, go out to either toss it into the ocean or climb all the way up to the outpost deconstructor to get rid of it, and repeat it for every single crate, every single purchase you ever make, and every single ammo box that gets emptied. It's not only time wasting, it's a freaking psychological torture.


2. There are serious performance issues. My current PC should definitely be more than enough to handle this game with no problems, and yet I'm having serious FPS drops, stutters, even freezes. Even with settings set low.


3. Bots are so freaking annoying on multiple levels.

-One, they are talking just so much about nothing important, and there's no option in the menu to change the frequency of their babbling, to decrease it or turn it off entirely. You want them to only alert you about an enemy, leak somewhere, or broken device? No, you can't, enjoy the messages popping up on top of messages, repeating themselves how X doesn't like crawlers, Y is afraid of husks, or Z thinks one kilo of steel is heavier than one kilo of feathers. So annoying!

-Not to mention that every time there's a leak, they put on the diving suit on... and whenever ""it's no longer needed"", they don't put it back, no, they toss it onto the floor, right where they were. At least there is an option to tell one of the bots to do ""maintenence - clean up"", but 1. when you don't know about it, have yet to discover it, it can be really rage-enducing and 2. When you have a pet and toss food onto the ground for it, even if it starts eating, the crewmate will take it out of it's mouth and put it into the locker - make it starve! So you either have to A) juggle the tasks every time you want to feed the pet(and they sometimes still do 'cleaning task' anyways, even when not asked to do so, taking things into lockers that you want to be on the ground!) B) Forbid a certain door from being opened, trying to prevent bots from entering a room trough it, so you put pets in there and throw food onto the ground there. But 1. they will still try to access the room if the door is ever opened, so you have to hurry every time you want to put food down, open and close the door with haste. 2. If there is a leak in that room in particular, you again have to juggle commands, either go there yourself to fix the leak or unforbid the door, and as soon as you open(or unforbid) the door the flowing water will push the pets out, requiring you to ""put them back"" there every single time there's a leak.

-Did I mentioned that every time you 1. Load the game 2. enter the outpost 3. leave the outpost. The locations of pets change? So every time either of those events happen, you have to manually pick a pet, carry it, and put there into that pet/feeding room, lock there, and hope there won't be leaks/breaches there...

Also, I tried to forbid certain item, but even if I do, bots pick it up and put into lockers anyways. Epic.

So much playing around with commands just to prevent bots from being an absolute nuisance instead of help!


4. If there is more than one cabinet linked to a fabricator/deconstructor, the positions of the inventories are all over the place. Even if you reposition the inventory windows to where you want them and then click the option to ""lock"" them there, it still changes!


5. Want to have a fruit garden in one of the rooms? Make some extra money on the side, or perhaps make food for your pets instead of needing to buy it one fruit at a time? You can, with planting pots, but then what happens? Regular blazing inferno appears! Because for some reason developers thought it would be fun feature to code in that randomly some of the fruits dropping are freaking molotov cocktails. Epic. 
Maybe it's up to a dispute, but to me, it's not a fun challenge, but a total nuisance that just discourages you from using that feature.

Picture this: you and your crew can take on different roles like a badass Medical Doctor, a hardcore Security Officer, or even the almighty Captain. Each role brings its own unique flavor to the gameplay, and trust me, playing the doctor is epic! You'll be the hero, saving your buddies from the jaws of death when they mess up. Talk about a life-or-death adrenaline rush!

But that's not all. Barotrauma hooks you with its variety of missions. You'll be exploring creepy underwater caves, going on intense research expeditions, and even engaging in epic battles. The missions keep coming, and you'll never run out of challenges to conquer. It's the kind of game that sucks you in and refuses to let go.

Now, if you think the vanilla version of the game gets a bit dull after a while, fear not! Barotrauma is a goldmine for mods. You want more missions? Done. Fancy some wicked weapons or mind-boggling sea creatures? You got it! Mods take the game to a whole new level, keeping things fresh and exciting.

Oh, and here's the cherry on top: you can build your own freakin' submarine! How cool is that? Barotrauma lets you unleash your creativity and design a sub that suits your style. From the structure to the interior layout, it's all up to you. It's like playing with Legos!

So, gather your squad, gear up, and get ready for the adventure of a lifetime in the treacherous depths of Barotrauma. With its awesome multiplayer dynamics, thrilling missions, modding madness, and the chance to create your own sub. Get ready to laugh, scream, and cheer as you and your friends conquer the underwater world together. Let the madness begin!",1692784886,1692884435,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

The developers deserve a special mention for their commitment to the community. Regular free content updates keep the game evolving, ensuring that it never grows stale. It's a refreshing approach that sets this game apart from others in the market.

But be warned, this game is not for the faint of heart. The challenge is real, and it demands strategic thinking and adaptability. Each level presents unique obstacles, making every victory feel earned and satisfying.

I must confess that I haven't explored the multiplayer aspect, but the single-player campaign alone has been a rewarding investment. Intricately designed levels, compelling storytelling, and immersive gameplay fully justify the money spent.

Barotrauma from an idea standpoint should be a game which makes being on a sub on alien world with a number of people (Or bots) one of the most unique experiences in gaming. From having different classes which decides what roles on a sub each person is good at, to building your own sub and a campaign which allows u to play it your own way.

Sadly Barotrauma is never that game for too long. So lets get on with the main parts:

The bugs:
This is one of the biggest problems this game suffers, its so bad that it took me a whole year of getting fed up of the bugs to come back to finish the campaign. Now some bugs aren't so bad like the random disconnects which happens without any reason behind them, to the AI of both monsters and bots just breaking at times. I had one time a monster fully just standstill and do nothing on the sub but as soon as we move the sub it started to move again. Another time is a crew bot deciding randomly to not shoot the ship guns but shoot it's gun at me out of the blue. Note i was just walking into the room when that happen and this was single player.
But the bugs get worse like not letting u dock randomly which requires u to restart the whole round which can be up to a hour of game play wasted to random parts of the subs just stop working again without reasons as i have even check the subs in editor to find nothing wrong with them and at times they just start working again.

The mods:
I normally have a view which is if a mod is need to make a game playable.... something is wrong with your game. Now thankfully Barotrauma doesn't have that problem but has another... the lack of content mainly online. See while the game does give you roles/classes well there really isn't much reason to stick to what jobs those roles are meant to do. Even the items you get in-game are kind of basic which honest isn't a bad thing but with how long this game been out and developed feels its lacks stuff. So the answer is mods which honest Barotrauma has a good number of mods which really make the game play better. However when you start using more than one mod that's when you really playing a dice game with wondering if the game isn't going to crash or break a save or even a sub. Why bring this up well notice i say more than one mod, well even if say u use 2 mods with don't even mess with the same stuff, sometimes they end up breaking each other sometimes out of the blue and then work fine later on. Tho i do recommend to use mods if you do feel the game is lacking stuff as even with those faults the do make a difference.

The Subs and the Editor:
You know when i think of an in game editor, i normally think they would make it so anyone could pick it up and make a sub.
What you find instead is an complex editor which fails to teach you how to use it and what each thing does, has settings on items which feels like you have to write your own code just to add a simple id to a card. And the wiring... oh my the wiring... while as an idea is sounds interesting. In game how ever it becomes this nightmare as one missing wire can at times break a whole sub. Honest the editor should not be this complex and made simpler for newer players to learn instead of having to look up a number of guides written by other players, not the devs to even understand the basics.

The Performance
Now i not going to say i have a high end PC but if i can a number of games at high graphics and frame rate at times then i should be able to play this game easy. Sadly Barotrauma suffers from unable to access more than 2 cores at any one time which really hurts it to how un-optimize the game is. Want to play with a number of people well hope u don't have more than 5k items or the sub just lags and yes its easy after a few hours to get to 5k items as every bullet, mat, wire, even doors are class as items and u need a size able sub for more than 6 players. Even monsters on the higher difficulties spawn at high rate which lags the game. Even worse i don't think no matter what sub i been on i never had a lag free mission with another sub i need to kill for a mission.

The Online:
The online is a mix bag, on one hand it is the best way to play the game, on the other hand is also the worse. Let me explain, you could be in a lobby with a good crew who all having fun and progressing the game. All that can change as soon as someone joins and just trolls which it turns causes others to leave. The next problem comes to finding a committed crew to play with as its a hit or miss. i been lucky that i find a crew when i beat the game finally last month but that took near a month before hand to even find those people down to time zones and how busy people are. Even then some trolls was able to slip into our private game under the idea they wasn't which shows its hard to trust people playing the game.
The last problem with the online is how bad the server log is. Back to the wires, if someone disconnects a wire on the sub in game, then the log only tells u a wire has been disconnected. Doesn't tell you where and which wire was disconnect. This makes running a public server a pain as u spend mins at a time trying to find which wire was disconnected.

Art/sound:
This is one part i feel Barotrauma does well, the way the sounds u hear on the sub as you walk around or even when the sub moving makes you feel like you only have a wall of metal to protect you from the horrors in the water. The way the monsters all look makes it easy for you to tell what they are and even the sounds they make are different from each other which is a nice touch. Character design is nice and doesn't feel out of place, personally i do use an anime mod for human characters but that's a personal taste, even then tho i do feel the base game's designs aren't bad.

Conclusion:
Barotrauma is a game which has been worked on for many years, by a team of devs which have done their best to bring this game to life with all the ideas i stated at the start of this review. Sadly over time i feel somewhere went wrong and the game just fails to live up to those ideas. The performance problems is the big killer as depending on your PC your mileage may vary but for a experience to have with a number of people all on a sub, not many games can do that.

With that i don't recommend the game if you expecting to play this game with randoms and by yourself at this time, but if you have or find a number of people to play it with then i would recommend it even with all its problems and to pick it up on a sale as right now i don't feel its worth the £30 asking price at this time.",1668960713,1692634983,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

When you play it, you might think that the waiting time for setting up the actual playtime is a flaw.
Even if it is, the game weaponizes it. It makes you want to play.

You start the game. You load into a lobby. You wait for everyone to get done at station one.
And the amount of time between events, whether that be mission objectives, or fights, or whatever else, is PERFECT. It's not too long to make the game boring, but it's JUST long enough that you start getting settled in to your task. The moment you forget about being vigilant, THAT is when the eldritch horror starts attacking. That moment, when everyone is minding their business, and the captain has forgotten to check sonar, and the entire sub SHAKES. And everyone goes unconscious for a moment. That moment is the most masterfully created moment of this game. Because right after that, when everyone wakes up and hears the water pouring in, EVERYONE gets to work. With multiplayer games like this, you sometimes run into troubles with a team that doesn't want to work. But because of the perfect waiting period, everyone wants to do something, and it feels exhilarating watching everyone get to the task to repairing the ship. Watching and helping the gunners fend off the monsters. Rescuing a diver who got paralyzed by the thalamus. Even being dead, the scene of whatever crew left trying desperately to repair the sub and fend off the invaders, in red, dim lighting after the reactor shuts down, is impeccable.
And then the mods.
Hazardous reactors, for if you want the engineer to never leave the reactor room lest the entire sub get covered in radiation (they really need to design better reactors for these things), Neurotrauma, where the medic singlehandedly heals the entire team that are all dying from fractured bones and internal bleeding and asphyxiation and so much more, and Barotraumatic, for when base game isn't hard enough and you want MORE MONSTERS.

That's the good, and truth be told, it's EXCEPTIONALLY good.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Now for the bad.
It's not many issues right now (just some inventory management easily fixed with mods), and...well one is critical.
They're one currently-an-unstable-build (that's not far from becoming the latest update) away from making the game entirely unplayable.

LONG read below, TLDR on it: Carrying enough oxygen to even play (in a game about constantly sailing around and leaving your sub in a dive suit) is about to become so impractical that the game's effectively going to be unplayable.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Long story long:

I'm particularly not fond of quite a few """"balance"""" choices the devs make.
This isn't supposed to be dark souls, and I damned well do NOT want to spend 1.25hrs moving railgun ammo 1 bullet at a time into the ship from a enemy ships (seriously, that's not a hypothetical, we literally spent over an hour and 15 minutes doing that shit!) because the ammo is fairly expensive and hard to come by so you have to stock up.

Not having these things stack in containers or some form of transport is downright criminal.
Oh, and now they want to make the game unplayable!
The game's main grind involves about 30-45min in an average run submerged at several thousand feet under the water in a suit. So right now as of typing this, oxygen tanks stack up to 8.
...
Now. They. Want. To. Remove. Stacking!

At 5min 33s in each tank, with one stack of 8 plus the tank in your suit, you can currently spend 49m57s under water before needing to be back in breathable atmosphere or find somewhere to fill your tanks.

But your inventory space is EXTREMELY limited.
9 hotbar slots (at LEAST half of which will be taken up with required tools, weapons, ammo, and meds) along with an 8 slot toolbelt (for air tanks and a few spare spots to put the precious loot you just grinded half an hour to HOURS to get).
And carrying all that is a requirement, unless you want to die and lose +12hrs of gameplay worth of skills (-30% to all your skill levels is an insane penalty when it takes about an hour to grind 10 skill levels, in a game where you can hit a cap of 100 per skill and there's 5 skills).
Not to mention potentially losing nigh-irreplaceable equipment that can only be found via extreme 1% RNG chance after fighting your way through a wrecked sub you found on the ocean floor near crush depth, which is crawling with infected bodies and various creatures.

So carrying at LEAST 4 tanks per stack is an ABSOLUTE must for the game to be remotely playable or enjoyable.

i didn't regret for buying this game and this game has a lot of potential in the future , i wish it would have a lot of new features in the future (original) , even there's a lot of mod from the workshops and even a lot people play the original/vanilla version too.

My though on this
"" Single&Multi Player / Role Playing / Slaughter / RPG like / Horror / Shooter / 2D experiences / Monsters / Modding / Server Hosting / PVE / Sandbox / Strategy / Mechanical gampeplay / Underwater Environment ""
Also this game remind me of an Old Video Games Arcade in the 90s called ""In the Hunt "" i played in Playstation 1 , it was awesome too .
I think that's all i can tell for now

My group consists of 4 members with the occasional 5th (very rare) we assume the exact same roles every game. 

-One heroic and bold captain (he doesn't reward us help us or do anything around the ship other than bark orders)
-One brain dead security officer (He often gets drunk then calls everyone racial slurs, hand cuffs himself and doesn't do anything but sit by the guns AFK)
-One Toxic Engineer (When you are not paying attention he will stab you with morphine and give you an opiate addiction, he will also feed you husk eggs when you are not paying attention which turns our dear security guard into a zombie. He will also hatch a giant alien egg aboard the ship attacking the entire crew, he will also chase and threaten you with a bomb)
-One junkie Mechanic (Is almost always addicted to opiates, gets electrocuted very often and never crafts anything which is his job)

This crew consists of some of the finest Autism god has graced this earth with... now while you may be thinking this crew sounds like a shit show, you are absolutely right... but occasionally the story changes.. Our captain picks up a wrench and gets to work... Our security officer braves the darkest depths of the ocean floor... Our engineer puts out a fire he started... Our mechanic pulls his head out of his ass and starts crafting... 

With our Brave captain keeping us focused on the mission at hand...with our Security officer fending off the dangers of the oceans depths... and with our mechanic and engineer keeping us afloat... we get the job done... one mission at a time.

After a 144 hrs I finally finished the campaign for Barotrauma, yet I still haven't seen everything this game has to offer.

Right off the bat this is the best nieche game i've played, the game knows what it is and doesn't have mechanics that don't fit.

The presentation is beautiful, this the best looking 2d game i've seen, it has a style that looks amazing.

The mechanics and CO-OP features are really well made, YOU HAVE TO cooperate to survive and you can't be a one man army, truth be told the guns and melee weapons are your last resort options, they aren't good, but that fits.

The atmosphere is just perfect, the story is simple on paper but the deeper you go the crazier it gets, and in a good way, the game makes you feel like a nobody, like you can die like everyone else, you're not the center of the universe.

The music is simple, but executed to perfection.

In-game lore is interesting, and the random encounters/quests were really good

Sound design is great in some places, while in others it's passable at worst.

Overall a 10/10, best experienced with friends


SPOILERS:








The Eye quest is one of the most unnerving thing i've experienced, i was invisted in the story of the crew, and the game yet again puts the spotlight on how vulnerable you are, the background scenery after the portal is amazing, the fights are balanced and fair, and while the ending isn't truly anything special, it does it's job well enough to have me satisfied with the journey i've experienced.

Once you accept those as integral parts of the game, you'll find that Barotrauma is insanely good.

It runs well. the only issue ive had is some slight desync in multiplayer, but that isn't common enough to be an issue.

One of my favorite parts of Barotrauma is the mechanical depth. Each of the six jobs on the sub can be learned to proficiency reasonably easily. OR you can take the time to master the job and do crazy stuff. For example, Engineering isn't that hard to learn: Run the reactor, make sure the electrical systems run well, craft your materials to save money, etc. OR you can rewire the entire sub, push the reactor beyond what it should be able to do while managing the risks, build cool gadgets and traps, and learn to do a bunch of crazy stuff in the submarine editor (i saw a vid of a guy today creating his own guided nuclear torpedo). Another example is the medic. You could learn to heal, manage medicine, and become your crew's savior, OR you could craft poisons against human or animal enemies and turn your crew into coked up super-heros (even if you make them part-alien and addicted to meth lol). All of the jobs have depth like this, even the assistant (You should definitely become a clown sometime. when done well, it's a blast). This game has phenomenal depth of features.

The game's got weird lore, a wicked cool submarine editor to make subs to use anywhere in the game, and integrated mod support! The mods are wonderful too!

Also, you maybe wouldn't expect a side-scroller to be horror, but Barotrauma delivers. You gotta experience that lol. great solo or coop, but especially coop with some chill people.

Barotrauma fits a lot of game into barely any storage space.

I play Barotraumatic Explorer with all creature packs included in particular, so the ""what the hell is that?"" factor is heightened with no centralized wiki-page to know quite what we're dealing with apart from experience teaching us, combined with the increased potential human mortality of Neurotrauma.

Barotrauma is a great game and there's nothing else quite like it out there.  Perhaps the few other submarine-centric games would count, such as perhaps U-BOAT, but actual submarine simulators don't catch the abyssal terror of not knowing what's clawing into your hull from the outside.  Maybe Iron Lung comes to mind, but even then, there's a distinct degree of helplessness present with that title.

Instead, Barotrauma is about a dysfunctional crew of submariners dealing with the day-to-day hostility of the fictional environmental hazards of Jupiter's moon, Europa; whether it just be the local wildlife of varying degrees of abyssal horrors and eldritch monstrosities, a dangerous parasite that nurtures itself within one's own skeletal system, ancient ruins from an alien civilization long gone, yet another parasite that has somehow managed to cross the barrier from organics to inorganic matter by commandeering wrecked submarines, the threat that other humans pose whether it be the political climate or various cults or just plain old piracy, or even just the planet itself via the intense depth pressure of the waters surrounding you or your submarine's hull.  Barotrauma wants to kill you at any opportune moment, and it's amazing how quickly the tone changes from you goofing around with your shipmates to everything going utterly and horrifically wrong.



It's a great game, would let the captain drive into an old forgotten naval mine again, rupturing the hull and snapping my neck against the wall flying away from the blast, thus rendering the only medical doctor aboard the submarine a vegetable whilst the rest of the crew screams in a frenzied panic.

Absolutely give the modding community a try as well.  Between the EK collection, Barodrama, Enhanced Armaments, Real Sonar, the myriad of custom subs, and other assorted goodies, they pump out a lot of great stuff.",1648622087,1691529852,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,True

One of the brilliant aspects of this game is the subtlety of its story. It's not glaringly obvious, or in-your-face like some other games, but more of a nuanced, lurking presence. It's not intrusive, so players who prefer straightforward gameplay can do just that. However, if you crave a narrative, it's there, quietly waiting for you to piece it together. This delicate balance is so rewarding, as the game caters to various playing styles.

The crafting system in Barotrauma is both extensive and rewarding. It gives you a sense of being a real mechanic aboard a submarine, learning what each item is made of and what needs to be broken down. This attention to detail and the immersive mechanics heightens the overall gameplay experience.

Now, onto my favourite part - the role system. It has to be one of the most refined and immersive systems I have ever encountered. I've come to realise that letting the game assign me a role has been the best way to play. After trying out every role, I can now switch between different roles with ease, leading to a more comprehensive gameplay experience. This flexibility ensures that the game never feels limited; it keeps expanding in possibilities the more you play.

To sum up, Barotrauma is a dynamic, immersive and intricately detailed game that challenges and rewards in equal measure. It doesn't just allow you to play a role; it lets you live it. A definite must-play for any fan of submarine survival and role-playing games.",1638039951,1691170539,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

You can hire your own crew, control them as you want, play them if you want. The game is challenging and requires a dedicated mind to play through the hardest and most difficult situations where you are sinking to the bottom, being eaten alive, being shot at, suffocating, burning alive, being crushed by the immense pressures and survive...

There is so much to discover in this games, cults, revolutions, pirates, amazing biomes, caves, new outposts and new crew. You can go ahead and start killing guards at a facility, poison or infect your own crew and others. 

There's a lot more that I don't yet know about so the good thing is to play more, enjoy the relaxing moments until BOOM! Your submarine is hit, you are thrown to the ground and nearly knocked out, your sub's hull is damaged and water is pouring in fast, your crew is quick to react but what will you do to survive?

All and all this game is absolutely worth the full price, a refreshing new gaming experience even for seasoned gamers. So much to do, so much to explore... 10/10

I barely able to locate the sole survivor from the attempt, our Captain, and together we sniped the affront of all creation with an SMG.

After discovering the power of syringe gun and medical skills, I proceed to commit “supply repossession” in every single outpost by committing medical malpractice and stealing their ID card to populate my ever-growing collection in the medbay, which slowly filled with all sorts of cabinets stolen from beacon stations. Much to the annoyance and horror of my crewmates that one threatened to shoot me if I put one outside of my personal room (I put a loading device unit at the hallway).

Once, I accidentally loaded cyanide in my syringe gun and poisoned my crewmates, thinking I loaded them with morphine instead. 10/10 remember to check your syringe gun or keep it empty until otherwise.

i've enjoyed a lot of it, can have a lot of resource management, crew killing each other... rigging doors with c-4 so everyone in the captain's helm blows up, it's fun though!
 i think the world is pretty interesting, do wish there was more dry area to explore (specifically caves as those would be really cool), as well as bigger monsters posing more of a risk to the crew inside the sub. one big issue i have is that big monsters have a hard time killing crew inside the sub.

the talent system (essentially they're just skills that characters can pick that give you recipes, bonuses to stats, etc) is also something that, feels kind of too overpowered for the crew throughout the campaign, especially (or mostly i guess) for security officers.

The attention to detail in Barotrauma is astounding. The submarine mechanics are so realistic that you'll feel like a seasoned captain navigating through treacherous waters. The constant danger posed by hostile creatures and environmental hazards adds a rush of adrenaline to every moment. The sense of teamwork required in multiplayer is unparalleled. Get your friends together, and you'll be shouting orders and scrambling to survive in no time.

The game's difficulty is challenging, but that only makes every victory and narrow escape all the more satisfying. The sheer unpredictability of what you'll encounter keeps you coming back for more, and the modding support means there's no shortage of new content to explore.

In short, Barotrauma is a must-play for anyone seeking a gripping and immersive gaming experience.

The game does an amazing job immersing you in a dark, alien ocean atmosphere with a gritty, steampunk/futurepunk theme. There are a multitude of mostly well balanced gameplay mechanics that add a surprising amount of depth. Focusing on survival and strategy is rewarded, if not required. Every decision feels important. Comebacks are very satisfying - and crises will get your heart racing.

Nothing beats the chaos experience of your friends all yelling over the radio with water pouring into your Barsuk, sinking into the abyss and being boarded by a half dozen tiger threshers. And that's really a fairly ""normal"" crisis.

I do wish the price was a bit lower - the $35 tag after full release makes it challenging to convince those who are on the fence about purchasing it. Hopefully there will be sales in the future. As great as the game is, the campaign does still feel incomplete, the AI needs significant improvement, and there's a surprisingly lacking amount of creature diversity (mods solve this).

Recommendations:
- IMO, playing with Jovian radiation is truly the best way to get the true game experience. When first learning the game, turning it off will make things easier. Once you get comfortable, start a new campaign and turn it on. Without the radiation, you will take more missions, make more money, and quickly become overpowered - taking any challenge out of the game. Having radiation on and a 1-2 mission count will make every mission, every salvage, and every mineral all that more important.
- Download mods. The developers are incredibly supportive of the mod community, and the quality and quantity of the mods reflects this. The mods alone at least double the overall game experience, and make the game worth the full $35 price tag. I recommend looking at Barotraumatic or any of the ""extended"" series, just as a start. I would avoid mods that add OP mechanics or make the game easier, but that's just me.
- Treat the campaign like it's a storyteller, and try not to restart the mission every time something doesn't go your way. Losing an AI crewmate because they decided to open the airlock without a suit at 5k meters adds to the chaotic and unpredictable story line - you ARE thousands of meters down in a foreign, alien inhabited ocean after all...",1690739456,1690739456,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I got this game because haha funny submarine game, and now I´m 250 hours in and I´m going through math and programmer forums trying to set up turrets on my custom sub at 3:00 AM.

This is a game about trying to survive on a submarine on an alien moon, repelling threats like a giant eyeball, mudraptors or the ships medic. 
There is also a resource management aspect to it, but fortunately its not very complicated and usually boils down to figuring out which engineer will attempt to start an arms factory and shooting your captain if they come near the medical supplies.

You can build your own submarine, which is where most of my playtime and my sanity has gone. 

The sub editor is very versatile, allowing you to do pretty much anything as long as you have the nessesary know how. 
This leads to it being pretty complicated, but the basics are still pretty easy to learn and you can usually work yourself up from there. 

I can make a submarine that can help you create a Statement of operating costs based on german real estate laws* and thats not even the tip of the iceberg. 

*(provided you feed it the right information ofc) 
(I am not responsible for any legal documents creating using my submarines.)



TL;DR: if you like boats, suffering, coordinating with your friends, getting munched on by edritch horrors (and your security officer), extremely overcomplicated solutions to simple problems with a slight seasoning of grimdark, you should definitely give this game a try.

I kept an eye on Barotrauma for a couple reasons. For one it was a Finnish game, which earns bonus points from me, but it was also a game about submarines, underwater perils and management of a ship, all of which sound GREAT to me!

But, as you might have noticed, the review I'm giving out with less than an hour spent playing the game is a negative one, and there are a few good reasons for that.

First and foremost: this is not really a game suited for single player. It is designed around the learning and mastery of complex systems and communicating with your crewmates on how to manage all of that together. Since one of the key systems to master is the physics-based movement of your character, efficient movement and communication feel key to success. However, the AI crewmates are immensely efficient and quick to act, making the players actions and input feel almost pointless, at least early on. 

That movement, along with the camera motion accompanying it, is why I gave up rather quickly. Movement and animation are based on physics, which is a neat idea and might allow for complex, unexpected interactions. All it did for me was send my character bumping into doors, ragdolling inside hatches I accidentally closed on myself and just generally acting sluggish and unresponsive. Add to this the fact that the camera lurches around quickly to track mouse movements and I found the game gave me a headache after just 15 minutes of play, unless I sat still and stared at the captain's screen, which wasn't much fun alone.

I feel Barotrauma borrows a lot of its ideas from Space Station 13, a complex game of varying roles for players to learn and adopt. But unlike SS13, Barotrauma cannot hide its complexities behind simplified visuals and instead tries to show and simulate a bit too much, easily overwhelming new players. It's quite telling that one of the first things the game offers you is a link to a wiki. A sign that the game simply lacks the tools with which to teach you all the mechanics you'll need to understand to play.

It's also a sign for me to move on.

I'd love to see more of the world on offer, to experience more adventures, but as a solo player there really isn't much here. With a group of friends and a lot of time, you might find this game worth your time, though.

Is it a game you *want* to play, though? Well, I would imagine it would appeal to the sort of person who played Subnautica and thought, ""no, this is too easy to control and to see what's going on, I want to be trapped inside of a bathtub, at the mercy of the whims of AI crewmen, while my head is stuffed inside a sack so I can't see anything and with the developer of QWOP in charge of the UI design""

And it's one of those games I feel a bit bad about giving a negative review because I can absolutely see what they were going for: Cold, darkness, claustrophobia, monsters and the potential to play it in co-op to survive, relying on the whims of NarutoXSephiroth666 rather than a janky AI crewman.

But it just sinks itself by having one of the clumsiest UI's I've ever dealt with, with a ton of information obscured from you, generally only seeing an ill-detailed sonar screen rather than, well, any of the actual darkness and spookiness around you. I think that 90% of my issues with the game could be cured if they just tossed out the sonar conceit, so I could see what was going on rather than having to guess, and made the interiors slightly more spacious. I know its supposed to be a submarine, but if you want those sorts of cramped environs, you also need the tightest controls known to man, which this game does not have.

 Kinda funny amogus tricks and goofs, but its almost a whole game of skyrim-esque radiant quests of killing a creature or a swarm of creature, collect $ and then get stuck at boss because of funny graphics that happen nowhere else in the game, or get stuck because of some random new alien weapon that has deep lore explaining why a sack with eyes now has floating lasers guarding it.

 Small nitpicks make this game dog-sh*t after its initial play with friends
(Clicking on one singular pixel while being chased to open a door, stealing trash items initiates deadly force responses, you will be teleported outside of your submarine; many times, you will struggle with quests on a multiplayer server/friend group since the game cant handle multiple people talking to anyone, Quests bug out and you will have to retry certain objectives, you have to wipe a character and their perks if you want to no longer be locked in a class, you will lose dozens of objects in your inventory if you die outside of your sub, your body is almost always either eaten or smeared into paint making retrieval of items impossible)

It is based off of space station 13 in the same way a rapist is inspired by Bill Cosby. It definitely aspires to it, but the fact it has this dream when theres already a G.O.A.T of the sport is definitely not needed. Does everything worse and is so filled with little nit picky annoying things that the only people who will enjoy this at the end of its inevitable lifespan will be big foreheaded white men with thinning comb overs. Who will suck any teat of video gamm-ing to sow and reap bits/subs from the adolescent amogus crowd, and stay at home dads who used to play TTT with their now buried friends.

The game is about you doing multiple missions while having to fend off sea monsters and you
have to maintain a submarine but you can do a lot in this game and i mean a LOT and with the multiple things you can find in the Workshop it just makes the experience even better! you can find servers where people are just generally having fun or servers where you can do SCP roleplay. its really just a fun game and i recommend this to people who like the complex and teambased gameplay of maintaining a ship
sadly its pretty common to have people who wanna grief the ship if you do decide to play with random players.

Update: this game is not recommendet for people who cannot grasp the confusing and complex gameplay since yes you may be able to play the game but you have to learn a lot in order to know what you need to do when a problem arises and also YES i know the game is very pricey thats why you should probally get it when its on sale so you either have to be patient or pay the full price.",1625051242,1690109239,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,True

You'll find yourself running around different stations just to talk to the right NPCs for missions, supplies, and sub upgrades. Man has made it to Europa but didn't invent telecommunications. It would have been much simpler to have NPCs on a menu screen instead of having to jog everywhere just to tell them to ship X items to your sub. It felt like the game did everything to waste time; NPCs located as far from each other as possible, hatches connecting interior compartments don't open automatically, bought items do not get stocked automatically (or by bots) to the appropriate compartment, and the list goes on. I want to feel like I'm the captain of a space-age submarine, not the cabin boy of an 18th century sailing vessel.

The bots' AI is terrible and can't allow them to prioritize tasks. You're bleeding out defending the sub from intruders? Too bad, your bot medic is trying to fix leaks WHILE the monsters are still roaming the sub.

I asked the medic to heal me but he said my injuries were to minor to waste any time on. I fell unconscious and was left for dead on the bottom of the ballast tank, i would have died if it wasn't for my friend who came and did CPR to revive me.

I came back thanking him even though he had basically killed me in the first place, but my thanks were short lived for he then inserted 90 units of alcohol into me and i went around vomiting all over the other crew.

My nausea left but i still was taking insane amounts of damage from my destroyed organs. I grabbed my shank and went off the find my friend. While he was in the cargo hold i stabbed him in the back twice before the captain came down into the hold to see whats going on. He saw me stabbing my friend so he pulled out his revolver and shot me in the head. I fell onto the ground and was paralyzed while my friend pulled out an SMG and mauled me with it.

I re-spawned in a shuttle and i set course back to the ship. Even though my little shuttle was faster than the main sub, we seemed to be getting further and further away from them. I then noticed three small green dots right next to the submarine following me on the sonar. Knowing that these dots were probably monsters i tried to find a gun on the shuttle but i sadly failed at this task when the shuttle smashed into a cliff. 

i turned to run to the navigation system but before i reached the ladder the wall in front of me burst open and water ripped into the room. I was on the verge of suffocation when i was able to grab a diving suit. i swam through the rooms and corridors of the shuttle trying to find a welding tool to fix the hole. I went through all the compartments in the shuttle but found that it had not been correctly supplied. 

I then sat at the bottom of the shuttle accepting my fate. The sound was just silent for a moment as i looked back of my fond memories of my short life. But this did not last for long as a thresher rammed through the neighboring wall of the sub and i was mauled to death while attempting to kill it with a screw driver. I died.

All in all the best experience i have enjoyed that much in a long time. I got to have a more glorified version of a story that five billionaires had, and i didn't even need to pay $250,000 for it! 11/10",1690027026,1690027026,True,2,2,0.504950463771820068,0,True,False,False

---The UI is really annoying. There is no keyboard key that opens doors, so you have to click on each door to open it. Same for ladders, which are everywhere.  Also there is no key to jump, the spacebar just makes you ragdoll in ridiculous fashion. You have to close all menus with right click.
---About 80% of this game is completely passive. You steer your sub waiting to get to your destination. If you are security, you sit at the guns waiting for an enemy to come. If you are medical, you wait until someone gets hurt and heal them. If you are engineer or mechanic, you wait until something breaks and fix it. From what I have played so far, the vast majority of the game is simply waiting for something else to happen. It puts me to sleep.
---This game does a terrible job of explaining itself. There is a tutorial for each of the roles & the basics, but it never explains other important concepts like fixing a beacon, navigating an outpost, or progressing in a campaign. Combined with an annoying UI it is a recipe for frustration.

Pros:
---The atmosphere is really cool, and it does a good job of feeling like an alien ocean full of danger
---Very good mod support
---Online multiplayer

Prepare yerself for a tale of treacherous depths and heart-wrenchin' hardships that'll make ye question yer very existence.

Barotrauma is a survival game set in the icy depths of Europa, one o' Jupiter's moons. Ye and yer crewmates find yerselves aboard a submarine, embarkin' on a harrowin' journey through treacherous waters infested with all manner o' horrors. Ye'll face the relentless pressures of the ocean depths, the icy chill of the waters, and the constant threat of death lurkin' at every turn.

The first thing ye'll notice about Barotrauma is the sense of dread that hangs in the air like a thick fog. Ye'll be plunged into a world where darkness reigns supreme, and the only light ye'll see is the eerie glow of bioluminescent creatures, a constant reminder of the danger that surrounds ye. Every creak, every groan of the submarine will send shivers down yer spine, for ye know that disaster could strike at any moment.

Ye and yer crewmates will face a barrage of challenges that'll push ye to the very limits of yer endurance. Ye'll be fixin' leaks, managin' oxygen levels, and navigatin' the labyrinthine depths while facin' creatures that would make a kraken think twice. The pressure is on, laddie, and the consequences of failure are as unforgivin' as a Highland storm.

But what truly sets Barotrauma apart is its multiplayer aspect. Ye can gather a crew of brave souls and face the horrors of the deep together. But beware, for cooperation is key, and trustin' yer crewmates can be as tricky as navigatin' a treacherous reef. Betrayal and chaos can lurk just beneath the surface, threatenin' to tear ye apart like a shipwreck in a maelstrom.

Now, laddie, I must warn ye that Barotrauma is not for the faint o' heart. It's a game that revels in yer suffering, a masochistic voyage into the depths of hardcore survival. Ye'll face permadeath, catastrophic failures, and the unrelentin' forces of nature. But if ye have the fortitude and the will to endure, ye might find yerself emergin' from the abyss with a sense of accomplishment like no other.

So, if ye're ready to face yer fears and dive headfirst into the cold, unforgivin' embrace of Barotrauma, then prepare yerself, laddie. Brace yer heart for the pain, yer mind for the challenges, and yer spirit for the ultimate test of survival.

Now, I'll be off, seekin' me own thrills in the virtual realms. May yer submarine sail true, may yer crew be steadfast, and may yer resolve be as unyieldin' as a Scottish Highlander. Slàinte mhath!",1689756799,1689756799,True,2,1,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False

They've definitely improved the AI over the years, and as a solo player, I can definitely approve of it being solo-able, however there are still plenty questionable moments for the AI, that makes me question their underlying logic and code.

Note, however, that this is not exactly a complaint, but merely me wanting to point out some frustrations and funny moments.

Security Officer AI's appear to prioritize the most powerful ammo types over others. No matter where I hid the nuclear shell on my submarine, he'd always make it his damn mission to load and fire it first, after a reload, quickly turning my submarine into a notmarine.

Despite having my Security Officers set to prioritize hostiles on-board over manning the turrets, only one of them actually decided to do something against the two mudraptors having a party in the airlock, by which he promptly stared at them while the engineer was beating their [strike]meat[/strike] heads in and getting clawed to death.

While the engineer was literally lying on the floor bleeding to death, the medical AI decided it would be a better priority to administer minor medical treatments to my gunner across the other side of the submarine, running past the dying engineer at least twice.

Once the medical AI finally did decide to resurrect the engineer, he promptly ran away trying to fix mechanical devices before even being partially healed, to the point where he nearly bleed out and died again.

The AI also seems to enjoy hanging around Volatile Fulgurium Fuel rods, promptly getting themselves killed or causing my medical staff to waste my entire supply of antirad, unless they're part of a mission, in which case the medical AI will ignore them and let them die of Radiation Sickness.

Overall though, I do truly love this game from a solo perspective, and the few rounds I've had with friends has also been incredibly fun. Especially the horror part, which is coming from someone that nearly passes out playing other horror games.",1689701801,1689701801,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Me, being a foolish new recruit, leaves the safety of my team and within two minutes I am mauled to death by threshers. None of them know where I am, all they know is that I am dead and my corpse is missing. Three of the crew, failing to find my body, decide to go searching in the mine anyway where they happen across the diamonds. One has forgotten to take extra oxygen, so returns to the sub to resupply.

As soon as he returns to the sub it is attacked by a swarm of crawlers and a crawler mother and failing to counter-attack quickly, they puncture the hull and send the sub falling from the crevice it was tucked into at the entrance of the cave, separating the two members of the crew busy at work with their plasma cutters retrieving the diamonds from a rapidly descending sub quickly falling into panic. Managing to dispatch the crawlers, their sub gets stuck between two large rocks, preventing it from descending even more dangerously low. As soon as they manage to catch their breath, hammerheads attack- and at the same time, the two miners above discover the sub is gone. Out of batteries and dangerously low on oxygen, they begin their descent to make it back to the sub.

On the sub, the member of the crew who abandoned the mining crew for oxygen is killed by the hammerheads. By some miracle the two on the sub live, and return to patching it up. Above, one of the miners is running out of oxygen. In a moment of pure heart, the weaker of the two gives up the last of his remaining oxygen in the hopes at least one of them makes it back. Minutes go by. The sub is almost ready to move. 

The miner who gave up his oxygen dies with a quarter of the way left to go. The other grabs his corpse and continues to swim. The sub has been fixed, powers up, and prepares to make an ascent. The final miner makes it to the sub, and swims underneath to reach the airlock. Before he can close the airlock behind him, the sub immediately launches upwards, and the last living miner is thrown out of the airlock. He runs out of oxygen and perishes.",1689546952,1689547345,True,61,7,0.83879542350769043,0,True,False,False

One of the major issues with the game is that it has a nasty habit of trivializing itself.

And god help you if you play as medic, electrician, or mechanic. You will fall victim to the same repetitive game play loop especially after all the upgrades.

- manage a crew of specialists who each have their own roles and skills (captain, engineer, doctor etc)
- ensure your submarine stays fuelled, repaired and use it to explore the ocean and complete missions for different factions on Europa
- fight hostile wildlife, including some creepy/ scary boss fights with huge creatures in the deep sea

Gameplay-wise, it feels like a much more fleshed out FTL, it's 2D and consists of traversing through dangerous environments between different set points on the map, going between colonies and stations to get missions, upgrade your sub and recruit new crew members.

To start, it has become painfully apparent that the developers are being actively hostile to the community, as their response to bad optimization and poor inventory management is to remove inventory management. Which is unfortunate, but fine and almost expected. However, this leads me to my first crucial point of the review: If you want a vanilla experience, don't buy the game. Vanilla will waste your time and hurt your feelings because if you don't play *exactly* how the developers want you to, including not playing one of the game modes, then you will not have fun....however, there is hope.

This leads me to the second part, which is: Modding. If you treat the game like one developed by Bethesda, which is to say, the game itself is fine. Not good, but not terrible: ""It just works."" ...however, the game itself is a platform for mods. Then Baro becomes an enjoyable experience. I don't think I am overstating it when I say that mods are the reason the game is still alive today. If you don't mind the hour or two setup of mods, and dealing with the headache of fixing them every so often as the developers making modding their game worse, then you will probably enjoy it.

In summary, if you're looking for a ""vanilla"" experience from Barotrauma, don't buy it. If you want to mod the game to hell and back, then buy it on sale because my god 34 dollars is an insane price.

Original: This review is hard to write. I've played and loved this game for a long time now. I've made countless subs (Some on the workshop, some for private use) and was forced to remake them as well, which I'll get into later. I've laughed with friends while being a literal clown, and in the next moment been trying my hardest to save the sub from something out of a Lovecraftian horror. Through all of that, I believed the developers had the best intentions for this game. That is, until recently.
The past few updates, as a seasoned player, have been worrying. In the past, they have broken the sub editor and/or the subs made with it, forcing many (Including me) to remake the sub from scratch. This, while annoying, always seemed to be for the better, albeit not without growing pains of something new. However, the more recent updates seem to break a lot of the core functionality or changing it in a way so unrecognisable that it is hard to even begin to understand. To be clear, the sub editor was never intuitive to begin with but these changes made it much worse.
However, I understand making a sub from scratch isn't for everyone and some people just want to play the game. Well. Recent updates on the campaign side of things just made that much much harder for you. Barotrauma was never an easy game. Nor were any of its mechanics easily understood (Especially Medical as a lot of the in-game tips were wrong). It was hard, and hard to get into. Recently, they made it so selling items salvaged off of less fortunate submarines than yours, or even items you made/mined yourself significantly less valuable meaning it takes significantly longer to get *required* upgrades to your sub to progress. In simple terms, it makes the game significantly grind-ier. This is before I mention that those same items no longer give you as many materials when deconstructed, making repurporsing them effectively impossible (As the cost is now too great). All of this is without mentioning how punishing the game is for being under prepared, which was a good attribute until making it improbable that *anyone* would be prepared. One smaller thing to note as well is that recently there was a colony update which, did sound awesome on paper, however in practice didn't change much aside from making you walk significantly longer distances to buy what you wanted, or in many cases, needed.
To sum up my thoughts, the game was really good and had the potential to be amazing, however recent updates make me question if the developers have good intentions for their player base or if something more sinister is around the corner. The game, in its current state, shouldn't be picked up by any newer player, and veterans like myself might have to seriously consider retirement (I personally have chosen that route for the time being). Maybe I'll be pleasantly surprised by a positive change, but until then do not buy this game.
I hope I will be able to change this review. But until then, TL;DR-Game was good, had potential then developers squandered opportunities and made it a grind.",1655403915,1689388722,False,188,21,0.677489936351776123,13,True,False,True

Squad is a game being created and developed by Offworld Industries. It was approved on Steam Greenlight, Kickstarter-funded and is currently has left Steam Early Access for full release.

Squad is an online, team-based, military themed first-person-shooter where high levels of teamwork and communication are crucial to success.

Built from the ground up in the Unreal Engine 4, Squad pits teams of up to 100 players against each other in white knuckle modern day combined-arms combat scenarios, with both conventional and unconventional forces.

The players dictate how the scenarios unfold with base-building and interactive environments, intuitive squad command and management tools and large-scale warfare where strategy and leadership are just as important as a quick

Barotrauma is a good game. It's fun with friends and is playable solo with bot crew. Vanilla experience stays varying stage to stage. Understanding the downsides of your vessel is important so that you don't sink.

Modded experience can by very bumpy. Using the same modset, players on similar power machines can get different experiences. There might be a bug that just kicks you to lobby and doesn't let you back until the crew in-game finishes the level or restarts the server.

With the modding workshop you can get hundreds of hours of entertainment, but 35$ (26$ on sale usually) is an outrageous pitch to friends for a game you need WELL over two hours to get into.

The premise is pretty straightforward, play submarines on an alien planet. 

The problem is that sometimes the game itself is maybe too straight-forward. Without expansions to the gameplay offered by player mods, many of the jobs are too simple and/or unexciting, and the gameplay doesn't vastly change or improve over time. May of the developer decisions are bit a questionable, hard to understand.

I like the game, I really do, but the developers are clearly not interested in making it more engaging and interesting for players in a timely fashion now that the framework for the base game was finished with having left early access. The price point is too high for a niche game, that offers no major end-game content without the workshop.

----Quick rundown on why jobs stay boring----
Captain: Your goal of piloting the ship means you stand around, looking at a sonar map for hundreds of hours.

Mechanic: Many of your trees are mediocre and don't give you much to do. Your main job (repairs) becomes less necessary as other crewmates level up their skills, and you feel useless besides some overpowered talents from your skill tree.

Electric Engineer (""Nukies""): Your primary job is very intense, and very important, but perhaps also a but dull. Your potential for getting into mayhem is significantly high with your talents, especially since you can get a remote control for the reactor. But your base kit is boring and can often be managed automatically, that you just sit around playing with logic gates and circuits fruitlessly trying to do ""cool"" things to automate the sub.

Security: Maybe the only fun job, as you get to shoot at things and become harder to kill, but conversely you don't have any extremely interesting talents to begin with. 

Medic: Bandage. Morphine spam. Bio glue if they're really torn up. Your talents are neat but you probably won't use most of them that much.

The recent media has portrayed me with new fears that made the game even more enticing and realistically detrimental to said fears. It is more tightened up and it is required that you are fully prepped and know what you are doing for the campaign. Fear is real and you are going to fight it.

**update**
Was afraid to touch my review, because I was proud that it was accurate and genuine. But still, to this day, the developers have continued to impress me with innovative ideas and mechanics. It really is a great game for those that want to play into the story or just the shear mania of physics/disasters that will inevitable ensue. I HIGHLY recommend this game if you are not afraid of a steep learning curve (for everything, but everything is optional) with high reward. 


Barotrauma provides an excellent atmosphere for lovecraftian fans with subtle horror appearances and the exhilarating touch of a co-op, fast response, roleplay. The good news is, you can roleplay if you want, or you can play seriously or maybe something in between. Enjoy the game the way you want to.

Rating: ★★★★☆ (4/5)

Barotrauma is an intense and immersive survival game that plunges players into the depths of a treacherous alien ocean. Developed by Undertow Games and FakeFish, this cooperative multiplayer experience offers a unique blend of horror, strategy, and exploration that keeps players on the edge of their seats.

Set in the distant future, Barotrauma presents a dystopian world where humanity has colonized the moons of Jupiter. The game revolves around the struggle to survive and maintain a submarine as players venture deeper into the abyssal depths. The oppressive atmosphere, coupled with the constant threat of hostile creatures and malfunctioning systems, creates an intense and nerve-wracking experience.

One of the standout features of Barotrauma is its intricate gameplay mechanics. Each player assumes a specific role on the submarine, such as captain, engineer, mechanic, or medic. Cooperation and communication are paramount as you work together to navigate through dangerous waters, repair critical systems, and fend off aggressive underwater creatures. The depth of the gameplay and the need for coordination make for engaging and dynamic multiplayer sessions.

The game's graphics, while not groundbreaking, effectively portray the hauntingly beautiful and eerie underwater environments. The attention to detail in the creature designs and the unsettling ambiance contribute to the overall sense of immersion and tension. The sound design, with its creaking metal, echoing sonar pings, and ominous background music, further enhances the atmospheric experience.

Barotrauma's steep learning curve may deter some players initially. Mastering the controls and understanding the complex systems of the submarine can be overwhelming, especially for newcomers. However, once you overcome this initial hurdle and grasp the mechanics, the game rewards you with a deep and satisfying gameplay loop.

The game's replayability is a double-edged sword. On one hand, the randomly generated levels and emergent gameplay make each playthrough feel fresh and unpredictable. However, the lack of a strong narrative or progression system may leave some players searching for a deeper sense of purpose. While the multiplayer experience shines brightest, the game also offers a single-player mode with AI-controlled crew members, though it does not capture the same level of excitement and camaraderie as playing with friends.

Despite a few minor shortcomings, Barotrauma offers a compelling and nerve-wracking underwater survival experience. Its immersive gameplay, intricate mechanics, and cooperative multiplayer dynamics provide hours of thrilling gameplay. Whether you enjoy intense teamwork, atmospheric exploration, or facing the unknown dangers of the deep, Barotrauma is a game that truly submerges you in its harrowing and unforgiving world.",1688529627,1688529627,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

-Spawn in the respawn shuttle as an Engineer
-Wait for transport to our sub
-Land on top of the sub while it's on the verge of collapse
-Put on a disposable diving suit and exit from the hatch
-The sub starts moving up once we exit and we almost get crushed by it against a ceiling
-The sub then starts to rapidly sink leaving us desperately swimming after the sub
-After what feels like hours of swimming we finally reach the sub at 14% oxygen left in our tanks
-Upon entry we take off our suits and immediately get to work
-Everything proceeds as normal for a while
-I do a little trolling and remove a button from a ballast room with an automatically closing door
-Our chief engineer gets stuck in the ballast room and loses consciousness from drowning
-Our captain and I drag him out of the room and give him CPR, good as new
-As we go back to look at the room, our chief engineer wants to show me something
-He takes me to the sub's shuttle bay, telling me if shit hits the fan we're gonna get in the shuttle and go away
-As we go in the shuttle, our head of security undocks the shuttle
-The sub's only engineers are now off the ship
-I scream at our head of security accusing him of being a traitor and proceed to stab him with the knife I stole from one of his duffel bags
-He turns away from piloting the shuttle (which he did not know how to do) to shoot me
-The bullets hit the control panel causing the shuttle to be stuck at full acceleration
-The shuttle collides with a rock at extremely high speeds, causing immediate depressurization and killing all of us on impact
-The shuttle continues to speed off after impact with our captain chasing after the shuttle unaware that we have all died
-Our bodies explode shortly after

Revert the last update. This game just went from grindy to un-fun.

UPDATE: Hoist the sails came out yesterday. The devs have not only doubled down on their changes to make the game more grindy, but they addded more unnecessary changes to make the overall player experience worse.

[olist]
[*]I spawn into my first sub as a medic, greeted by the captain who was dressed as a clown and playing a harmonica in my face (Immediately, what the fuck?).

[*]I went into the medical bay where there was already 2 dead people and another unconscious.

[*]At the same time, I could hear screaming of an engineer and a couple security guys saying ""THEY GOT IN, THEY GOT IN!""

[*]I grabbed medical supplies and tried my best to resuscitate the unconscious guy in the medbay using what I learned in the tutorial which absolutely did not prepare me for the chaos and bullshit that was going on.

[*]The guy dies, I had literally no idea what I was doing.

[*]I grab his crowbar and sprint into the captains quarters where my superior officer, the clown, was using a shotty to hold off an unbelievable number of monsters. I help him by Morgan Freemaning the shit out of their skulls.

[*]We're both dying, the clown goes unconscious, I manage to save myself from the same fate. I perform CPR on the clown and bring him back to life.

[*]We both limp below deck where only the engineer is left, he somehow killed them all and was repairing the breaches.

[*]The clown gets on the hull guns, his happy facepaint hiding his terrified tears.

[*]I help the engineer repair the ship. Whilst we are repairing the electrics, he is shocked and goes into cardiac arrest. I perform CPR and somehow bring him back from joining the rest of the crew in the forever sleep.

[*]We get the ship powered again, I take over the guns from the clown, he climbs the ladder back up to his alien-corpse-ridden quarters and directs us towards the closest docking station.

[*]With me shooting down the horde, the engineering performing repairs (still screaming btw), and the clown steering us home, we somehow manage to achieve our goal.

To sum this game up, you and your buddies (or bots) have to pilot a submarine through the depths of the previously-mentioned moon of Jupiter, gaining cash money and upgrading to go deeper and deeper until deep doesn't have a meaning anymore. Sounds fun, right? That's because I didn't say anything about what monsters lurk in the deep dark sea-- there's a lot of them, and they only get scarier and tougher to take down as you progress.

The game doesn't have too much of a direct narrative, but there are story-like quests and a very vast world to explore. You'll be meeting interesting groups such as; the big-bad government, small and disorganized rebel forces, a cult that wants to turn everyone into parasite zombies, and a group I can really only describe as ""the entire circus.""

you need to emerge yourself to play this game to have maximum fun......RP never hurts, but game chat is what I mean. proximity chat and using radios makes it fun, like when you get knocked out while out of the sub, and your friends no longer hear you so they go out to save you or recover your corpse

The later stages of the campaign are very ""grindy"" and they make for one boring trip of fighting the same enemy's and stopping at outpost for necessities. its very cut and dry later in you go. I have yet to COMPLETE THE GAME fully BC of this after getting 2 stops close.

There is a draw for nearly any person, for me I learned how to build a sub from scratch and learn how to balance power between junctions to make ""the dirty bubble"". It takes a long time to learn all the things to build a sub so i don't recommend  it for first time players. it is a little less of programming a simple robot with visuals.
If you are a gun guy, you can build guns or just shoot them, being a mech engineer, or a guard. 
Captains are very important and knowing how everything works in game is very important for best trip.
Doctors have so many different ways to heal someone and healing in game is very in depth, while also being easy to understand.

there are a couple game modes but never really seen them as worth the time loading up besides the campaign 

All in all, game is so damn fun and It was fun with my group of 5-4.  we are probably done with my 150 hrs in sub editor and 70 hrs in campaign.

It makes you feel small and insignificant almost in a Lovecraftian way (which is very valid).
It's mostly a co-op game (wouldn't recommend going solo) about keeping the submarine going, completing missions and staying alive in and increasingly hostile environment.

I'd give the game an awesome 9/10. I find it really fun - especially with friends - but definitely not a game for everyone. If you don't mind 2D games and aren't easily deterred by complicated and hard things - you may be pretty interested in this game. And here are my thoughts:

There's a pretty good, complete main campaign that doesn't really have ""missions"" within itself as you go, only a final destination and some hurdles on the way. There's PvP, traitor mode (which isn't fleshed out too well at the time of writing), chaos mode and pretty much whatever you can think of and make on your server.
There are multiple mission types that you can complete in between outposts, maps are generated based on current biomes (with their looks and quirks), if you're looking for something to do in between mission areas you can usually find something to explore or get resources from.
At the start you pick one of the classes which have different starting stats, equipment and - most importantly; in campagin only AFAIK - different perks which can make not only classes but characters specialise in distinct areas.
The main focus of the game is mechanics - it's pretty advanced in that area: different types of damage and wounds (and medical system to match) on separate limbs that influence how well you can use them, repairing things requires tools designated to repair them, repairing things that are currently powered may prove shockingly hard for the unexperienced, other creatures - while being very different - still follow the same rules as your character does, mining and gathering underwater plants, crafting system for a ton of things, modifying the ship with basic logic gates (useful making automatic or just better systems for your ship) and more.
There are submarine, outpost and creature creators. Though creating a non-small submarine or an outpost takes dedication and a lot of time. Also there's a vibrant modding community - a lot of ships, some items and a few deeper mods.

When you start you will likely feel absolutely outmatched, underequipped and unexperienced (though it's not that bad anymore at the very start of the campaign) and you'll probably be right, but don't let it discourage you. It takes time, practice and failing a bunch to start getting good at the game and figuring out what works, what doesn't. But you will get good, less panicky and more confident.",1687507507,1687847526,True,2,0,0.522058844566345215,1,True,False,False

Otherwise, you have to either bring up your patience game (former) or bring up your self restraint (latter) game to enjoy this.

2. 1.0 is, unfortunately, very rushed. Game is yet to be properly operational for a release game instead of EA. I'm fairly certain this is Daedalic's doing, and devs are doing their best to build a lot from a shaky ground, but a rushed release is a rushed release.

Get rescued by your friends as they change course to pick you up before the crawlers get inside. Become the all-round shipmonkey with wrench, screwdriver and welding tool who doesn't have any mechanical skills but a shitty weld is still better than an unsanctioned window to the abyss.
Operate the gunnery stations. Pepper crawlers with coilguns. Fend off raptors with machine guns. Find out what ""danger close"" means when you notice too late that the first round in the railgun rack is the special Honkenheimer™ brand nuclear shell spiced up with an extra bike horn in its payload slot. Flash-boil yourself, half the submersible and an entire crawler swarm including their mother.
Decide to do a little funny. Sneak around a Separatist station. Steal every oxygen tank you find, including the ones in the emergency diving suits. Use a plasma cutter to flood the crew quarters and watch as the traitors rush to get to the diving suits before the reality of several hundred thousand liters of water rushing in can assert itself upon them. Smile, knowing you have already repo'd all the canned breathing fumes for your own hoard like a particularly vile undersea magpie.

The game can be as high pressure as the surrounding water when certain happenings begin to happen around your vessel. Task delegation seems to be important with clearly defined roles and appropriate workloads for each friend-turned-crewmate to ensure utmost efficiency and accuracy. 

Here is a description of our last 30 minute or so play-though leaving the starting station. As captain of our sizeable crew of 3 individuals it was also my duty to be a repairman, ""trained"" medical professional, and de-facto head of security all at the same time. Other crewmates had similar workload sizes with extra hands being needed for various important tasks such as repeated electrocution and morphine overdose. We begin our journey by simply undocking and turning on our active sonar to explore the surrounding waters. Unfortunately, this decision drew in a few of the local sea natives who began chewing at our seran-wrap layered hull finding an easy way in to our vessel. Of course, to deal with this situation we sent our strongest man who was currently busy with nothing important (reactor upkeep) to deal with these intruders. The fight was eventually ended with a few welding tools and a couple well places shots by yours truly the captain, with his trusty revolver. Unfortunately, during this endeavor the reactor was left in a manual operation mode and had completely expended its resident 2 fuel rods with 1 micron of uranium in them. This led to a small blackout aboard our vessel causing a catastrophic sinkage to occur. Fast forward about 20 seconds we impact the bottom completely removing the metal foil protecting our bottom half allowing a vast amount of water to enter the living compartments. Our reactor man eventually succumbed to multiple bite wounds , lacerations, and internal bleeding in the following scuffle with the natives that came with the liquid. Captain and extra man attempted to repair the hull breaches only to find no metal foil left on the holes to weld. Captain and extra man decide it best to swim back to the station with extra man not grabbing sufficient oxygen and eventually suffocating in the black nothingness on the way back to home. Captain overwhelmed with grief over the untimely demise of his crew decided the only recourse was removing the diving suit in the middle of the abyss. Captain removes his diving suit and is surprised by nothing happening in the seconds after, shouting with glee to his fallen comrades spirits watching over him. In the following second the emotional roller coaster comes to it's downhill portion when the surrounding water realizes it has been deceived and captain is actually not in fact wearing his protective sweater. Surrounding water implodes captain crushing not just his body, but his dreams entirely. 

If you made it through my 2:00AM literary abilities congratulations. I highly recommend this game to anyone who has some friends to play with, the more the better, and if no friends and you're driven enough you can play with bots which join your crew for money at stations or with other online randoms via the server browser. I would expect a slightly-below average crew cohesion though if you choose to play with randoms (sabotage may be a common occurrence) maybe thats fun though.",1687424608,1687424770,True,3,0,0.565217375755310059,0,True,False,False

Bots informed that there is fire and did nothing to save sub, I found fire extinguisher and tried to remove fire but died.
