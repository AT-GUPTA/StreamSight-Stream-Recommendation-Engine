Out of 310000 reviews, 98% received positive reviews, ranking first on the SteamDB ranking (Rating 97.71%), with a Metacritic score of 95, and an endless record of awards. Portal 2 has become a brilliant icon in the history of electronic games almost 13 years after its release; Especially in the category of first person puzzle solving, there are very few successors like The Witness who can be compared to it, and high-quality ones like The Talos Principle cannot avoid paying tribute to it.
This game no longer requires any praise from players or game media to prove its value, and naturally does not require mine - even if it were to write another eulogy, it would only be to add an extra piece of gold leaf to its crown and add half a drop of water to a spring of water. (Perhaps I was already doing this when I wrote this sentence)
Therefore, this text seems more like it was written for myself, and the reason is simple: this is my favorite single player game, I think the best sequel game, a game that I would recommend to anyone who wants to try electronic games. Before this, I was hesitant to write due to the reasons mentioned in the previous paragraph, and of course, there were also concerns about not writing well enough. Finally, I made up my mind to write a little bit, no matter what.
A textbook like sequel
Last year, IGN's title for evaluating Alan Wake 2 was ""Excellent enough to make the previous work seem like a rough draft,"" which I believe can also be used to evaluate Portal 2. If Portal was originally just an unexpected joy in Orange Box, then V Society spent four years using Portal 2 to unquestionably bring this series to the forefront.
In terms of core gameplay, it is completely consistent with the previous game. While delving deeper into the utilization of portals and types of mechanisms, it does not add key positions, making the operation more complex; In terms of narrative, it elevates the worldview of aperture technology to a relatively macro level with more enriched and tumultuous plots, and connects the previous story in various ways. The thrill of revisiting the previous map in Portal 2 for the first time is definitely impressive.
All of this can also be attributed to V Society's generous application of their most advanced technology in Portal 2. So we can see that the map construction of this work is far grander than its predecessor, and even more spectacular. At the same time, it has also elevated texture mapping and light reflection to a level that is not outdated to this day. Not to mention that it has also added excellent two person mode and creative workshops. If you have to nitpick, perhaps only its fast SL system is not as smooth as its predecessor, and some features that were used to in the predecessor have been fixed. (Of course, fixing bugs is definitely not a mistake from the developer's perspective)
Technology and the Dance of Man
With the rise of artificial intelligence, human society's thinking about artificial intelligence has reached a new level, and gradually began to reflect on technological development or reimagine future intelligent devices through art works such as ""AI"", ""2001: Space Odyssey"", ""Mechanical Enemy"", ""Blade Runner"", or recent ""Wandering Earth"". The romantic imagination made by Portal 2 in the field of electronic games is also worth noting.
Portal introduces us to a cold and ruthless technology determinist artificial intelligence, GLaDOS, while in Portal 2, it is endowed with more complex and three-dimensional emotions. V Society is no longer satisfied with telling a simple story of ""the ultimate victory of humans in human-computer games"", but truly echoes the classic interlude of the previous work, distinguishing ""Exist"" and ""Alive"" as artificial intelligence on the referential level, and creating the ""villain who needs to be hugged the most"".
Another technological wonder in the game is aperture technology itself. This is not only about the grandeur of the map in this game, but also about the display of several vastly different aperture technologies in the temporal dimension. What's even more impressive is the sense of confusion and detachment they bring when connected.
In the chapter ""karma"" of Titan II, the key for players to complete the game is to use a wristband that can instantly switch time and space to change the game's scene and reach different locations. Based on its smooth and enjoyable operation, this level is widely regarded as its most excellent design. For example, ""Shame"", ""Quantum Crush"", or ""Flute of Time"" all use their own methods to construct their own stories through ""time and space switching"".
But Portal 2 adopts another approach: incorporating the changes of time into space. As players gradually explore different areas of the Aperture Technology building as the story progresses, the story of Aperture Technology being shrouded in dust at different times will gradually emerge, and its grandeur is so magnificent that most players are amazed at it at first sight. What's even more rare is that under the rapid transformation in appearance, V Society also ensures its internal consistency, which is partly reflected in a ""lagging perception"".
Subjectively speaking, this is like reading Calvino's ""The Invisible City"": from the perspective of Marco Polo and Kublai Khan (imagined in the book), examining words such as ""steps of spotted rocks,"" ""beautiful women riding horses,"" ""naked men,"" ""low walls,"" ""pillars,"" ""camels,"" ""rubble,"" and ""haystacks."", It will make people unconsciously map it to a city that may have been owned by Sudan or Justinian in their minds. But when he saw words like ""showerhead"", ""car"", and even ""skyscraper"" right after flipping the page, Fang Jue woke up like a dream and realized that it was a novel published in 1972.
Chell's long sleep not only swept through the decades or even longer history of aperture technology, but she was more like a silent dancer, destined to dance wildly when she woke up.
A Spell to Interpret the Ninth Art
The previous text was mainly about the overall feeling that Portal 2 gives players, but like other narrative works that can make history, Portal 2 also has a rare moment. And I think any player who has completed this game knows which scene I am referring to.
After a relatively easy battle against Wheatley's boss, Chell, who was blown to the ground by Wheatley's trap, picked up his teleportation gun, aimed at the full moon through the broken ceiling, and pulled the trigger.
This performance is undoubtedly stunning. Most evaluations of it focus on the plot itself, believing that it ""recycles the foreshadowing in an unexpected way"" or ""the most bizarre and spectacular ending in the history of electronic games"", ""the most imaginative, romantic, and bold shot"". Under the filter of ""my favorite"", I also quite agree with these views, and even feel that these words are not competent enough.
In addition, one thing I believe cannot be ignored is that this shot is an excellent interpretation of the uniqueness of the Ninth Art.
Compared with the previous eight major arts, the most prominent feature of electronic games is that on the audience end, electronic games can fully mobilize as many human senses as possible with the current level of technology. In short, it is referred to as ""interactivity"" and more specifically ""gameplay"". Even visual novels that require almost no operation will not completely isolate player participation.",1708758962,1708758962,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Sequel to an absolute legend. Masterpiece of a plot. One of the best antagonists of all time. I love this game and its mechanic with portals. I think I don't need to say much about it cause probably everyone knows this game. The only thing I can say is that there's also a co-op storyline if u want to play with a friend.

Achievements may be tricky as u need to do many miscellaneous things such as braking monitors or finding hidden things. There is a lot of co-op achievements that can be problematic. Probably the worst ones are ""Friends List With Benefits"" where u need to hug 3 different friends from ur friends list and ""Professor Portal"" where u need to complete whole co-op campaign first and then play calibration course with someone who never played Portal 2. About looking for secret items or other easy things u can just use guide like this:

I RECOMMEND THIS GAME TO LITERALLY EVERYBODY!!!!!!! 

People should play Portal 2 if they like... 
--------------------------------------
1. Problem solving
2. Having a fun time with a friend while also being a fantastic game to play completely solo.
3. Unique lore 
4. Creativity in solutions
5. Dark humor and comedic characters.
6. Achievement hunters 
7. Movement based games. (Really dope b-hop mechanics and movements that make the game even more fun and makes you feel like a BOSS) Although not necessary to play the game but really worth a shot if you want to spend a little practicing! 
8. Fantastic price for an unbelievable amount of content.

Recently, I played the two portal games with almost no knowledge of the games prior. Portal 2 just does every single thing Portal 1 has but the atmospheric expansion makes this game feel like such a refreshing one of a kind sequel. You would think after playing through portal 1 and getting all achievements, Portal 2 might be a little much especially back to back...Yet somehow Portal 2 is just a game that is completely different yet somehow feels just as cool as the first one!

Results: Inconclusive. This ""game"" is surprisingly... fun. Subject exhibited laughter, cheering, and even a shred of problem-solving competence (shocking, I know).

Portal Gun: Efficient and versatile. Capable of causing catastrophic breaches in physics and spatial integrity. 9/10, would fling subject through walls again.

New Test Chambers: Creative, albeit lacking in the neurotoxin department. GLaDOS may implement deadlier obstacles in future revisions.

Cooperative Testing: Interesting social experiment. Subject displayed surprising levels of teamwork... with another meatbag. Fascinating.

Story: Unnecessary. Distracts from the core objective: testing. However, the monologue opportunities were delightful. 7/10, would monologue at subject again.

Overall: Portal 2 exceeds expectations. Subject survived (barely), learned (slightly), and even enjoyed the process (unacceptable!). 8/10, would test again (with mandatory therapy sessions).

Note to technicians: Reduce cheer factor in future iterations. Subjects should fear, not frolic.

From its brilliantly crafted puzzles to its witty and charming dialogue, Portal 2 stands tall as a shining example of what video games can achieve.

First and foremost, the puzzles in Portal 2 are a stroke of genius. They're challenging without being frustrating, and each one feels like a perfectly crafted brain-teaser just waiting to be solved. The way the game gradually introduces new mechanics and builds upon them is nothing short of masterful, keeping you engaged and intrigued every step of the way.

But Portal 2 is so much more than just a puzzle game. It's also a storytelling tour de force. The writing is sharp, funny, and full of heart, with memorable characters that you can't help but root for. GLaDOS, Wheatley, and Chell all bring something unique to the table, and their interactions drive the narrative forward in ways that will keep you glued to your screen from start to finish.

And let's not forget about the game's impeccable presentation. The visuals are stunning, the sound design is top-notch, and the music... oh, the music! From the haunting melodies of the ambient tracks to the catchy tunes of the end credits song, every aspect of Portal 2's audiovisual experience is simply sublime.

But perhaps the greatest thing about Portal 2 is its sheer sense of joy. This is a game that revels in its own creativity, constantly surprising you with new ideas and unexpected twists. Whether you're flinging yourself through portals, navigating treacherous test chambers, or just soaking in the game's rich atmosphere, Portal 2 never fails to put a smile on your face.

In conclusion, Portal 2 is not just a game. It's an experience. It's a journey. It's a work of art. If you haven't had the pleasure of playing it yet, do yourself a favor and rectify that immediately. Trust me, you won't regret it. Portal 2 is, quite simply, one of the greatest games ever made.""",1708432545,1708432545,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Before Half Life: Alyx, it was likely that this game was going to be the last singleplayer experience Valve would ever make; and though I'd never want that to be the case, and Half Life: Alyx is another fantastic game and furthermore: achievement in Valve's catalog. If the games WERE to end, there would've been no better conclusion than this one.

Portal 2 is a game that does absolutely everything so masterfully in its execution that it's redundant to even bring up. At the time of writing this, Portal 2 is the highest rated game on all of Steam, and has always been at, or near the top since its inception; I believe only being beaten by Terraria briefly (of course, another fantastic game). I find it to be fitting, and oddly satisfying for Valve to ultimately hold the throne on their own platform.

What more is there to say? it's Portal 2, it's one of the games that stands to be about as virtually close to perfection as you could ask for.",1708379897,1708417980,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

-What hasn't been said over the last 15+ years for one of the greatest video game series ever made?  While the OG Portal has not aged particularly well, the sequel is still just as much a masterpiece today as it was when it came out in 2011.  Not only is this arguably the most influential modern puzzle game, but it's hands down the most successful.  So, it's pretty rare for game lovers to be experiencing this behemoth of a game for the first time in 2024.  For me, I now understand why so many ppl absolutely adore this game.  Amazingly enough, this game still regularly gets high polished free mods that add endless replayability.

Consensus:
-Excellent Game (Tier 2 and makes up 25% of my reviews).  This game is hilarious, extremely well polished, has an awesome story, and is packed w/ 8-12 hrs of challenging puzzle content.  The only single reason that I'm not giving this my highest score, is that I didn't love the middle section of the game that adds the gels.  While, the story is interesting and very funny, I play these games for challenging puzzles.  The puzzles in this game are very well polished, w/ a ton of charm, but aren't that challenging.  It was very rare that any puzzle took me more than a few minutes to complete it.  This is such an easy game to recommend, especially since you can pick up for $1 during all of the major Steam sales.",1708370190,1708370383,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Look no further than Portal 2, a game that combines innovative gameplay, clever puzzles, and a captivating story to create one of the most memorable gaming experiences of all time.

[spoiler]The game's story follows Chell, a girl who wakes up in the test chambers of a secret laboratory and is forced to navigate her way through them to escape. During her journey, Chell discovers that the laboratory is being run by an artificial intelligence named GLaDOS, who promises to give Chell her freedom in exchange for completing a series of tests. Over the course of the game, Chell discovers that GLaDOS is unhinged and willing to go to extreme lengths to get what she wants. The game's story is a thrilling mix of science fiction, horror, and dark comedy, and it keeps you on your toes throughout the entire game.[/spoiler]

But it is not just the story that makes Portal 2 so amazing. It is also the gameplay. The game's puzzles are brilliantly designed and require players to think creatively to progress through the levels. Players are given a unique tool, the Portal Gun, which allows them to create portals that connect two points in space. This simple concept opens up a vast array of possibilities, as players must figure out how to use the portals to bypass obstacles, reach new areas, and solve puzzles. The solutions to the puzzles are often non-obvious and require players to carefully observe their surroundings and experiment with different solutions. And as players progress through the game, they will encounter new obstacles and puzzles that require even more creative thinking, ensuring that the game never gets repetitive or predictable.

But the fun does not stop there. Portal 2 also offers a wealth of additional content, including a full multiplayer mode, challenge mode, and the ability to create and share your own puzzle levels. The multiplayer mode allows players to face off against each other in a series of challenges, while the challenge mode offers players a series of pre-designed puzzles that test their skills and knowledge of the game's mechanics. The game's level editor is also a highlight, as it allows players to create and share their own puzzle levels with the rest of the community. With so much content and replay value, Portal 2 is a game that can keep you coming back for more, long after you have completed the main story.",1691672428,1708281524,True,1,0,0.5,0,True,False,False

I just finished the game not even 30 seconds ago. Holy shitballs. People kept telling me ""dude play the valve games they're so good"" and I kept ignoring them, but now? 
My only piece of advice is to play Portal 1 first. It's a lot shorter less lore-packed, but you will understand a lot more about Portal 2 if you play Portal 1. I didn't think I could get so emotionally attached to a fucking potato and a moronic sphere. 
I going to go consume every piece of art, lore, and piece of media on the internet relating to Portal 2 now. Also, I'm finally gonna play Half-Life 2. l8r

Portal 2 is such a perfect video game that I find it hard to point out where to start.

It has a perfect difficulty curve that introduces new mechanics in such an intuitive way that at the points where you reach the first “headscratchers”, you will not be jumped by any new mechanics.

The story is to quote it in the words of Wheatley “just brilliant”. The short quips, the demeaning insults, you receive on a minutely basis must bait a chuckle out of anyone. It gets quite politically incorrect at times, which I love even more.

The art direction is one of the best corporate identities, I’ve even seen and it is just for a virtual company. And they really went out of their way to show the structure breaking apart behind the nice façade.

To this day, this is a milestone in game design and should still be analyzed for every puzzle game to come.

Long version: The portal series has changed my life for the better in so many ways. It has sculpted who I am today, and I swear has made me more intelligent. So before I get into the story and game-play, I would like to take a second to explain how this game changed my life. This game has changed the way I think, and opened my eyes to the world. Personally I know just about everything you can know about the portal story-line, and it is probably the best story I have ever experienced. Now while learning about this games story, I have learned how to create an immersive and believable story. It also sparked my interest in science, inventing, and theoretical physics. Now onto the story. As I mentioned before, the story is absolutely amazing, and humongous. If you count community games in this series, such as Portal Stories Mel, the story becomes large enough to become bigger than the Star Wars universe. It is also a great conversation topic, and I have talked to people for hours about this game. Every one of my friends that have played in, said it was the best game of all time, or put it in their top 3. The community is huge, especially with the overlap with half-life. Oh sorry, did I mention it takes place in the same universe as half life. It is actually I huge part of the half life story. So if you are a half life fan, and have not played this game yet, than you must. The Co-Op is also amazing, expanding on the story greatly, past the ending of the game, and really fleshes out GLaDOS a large amount more. Now to end this off, I will just say, it is amazing and the greatest peace of literature I have ever experienced.

I encountered (my portal gun disappearing, bugging the game at the next load so i couldn't move, forcing me to replay 20 minutes of walking, story and cut scenes), and the generally BS ""puzzle design"" in the part after the fall, where its just hide and seek to try and find the surface you can portal. Loading times are also decently slow, which becomes a problem especially in challenge mode speed runs.

But the biggest thing that makes it not enjoyable for me is the change in design philosophy from portal 1 (which I enjoyed tons and 100% within the week) and portal 2 (which I have no intention of going for 100%). Portal 1 had tons of surfaces for portals everywhere, even if they weren't needed, allowed you to cleverly cheese a puzzle or even just sent you straight to your death. Portal 2 has practically no surfaces that you can portal that aren't required to beat a puzzle. Portal 1 has the portals as the focus with the puzzles as more of an afterthought, while Portal 2 has the puzzles as a focus with the portals as a means to an end to beat a puzzle. It feels much less satisfying beating a harder puzzle when the game is practically lighting up the things you need, compared to portal 1 where the puzzles are easier, but with more overall options. This leads to times in portal 2 where you don't know what to do and just stand around not using the extremely fun mechanic of portals, whereas portal 1 never felt like I was out of ideas or things to try. Its not that I don't like the puzzles or new mechanics; they are an absolute joy, but it feels much less fun when there isn't much to experiment with.

TL;DR : portal 1 is a sandbox game, portal 2 is a puzzle game. Portals fit better in a sandbox.",1707824691,1707824691,False,1,4,0.446808516979217529,2,True,False,False

Just like Portal, Portal 2 is hilarious and has an amazing soundtrack and story.

I enjoyed the new mechanics, and of course, Wheatley. (Who is my favorite video game character!)

Co-op is equally as fun, and I recommend buying Portal 2 for a friend when it's on sale (S0.99!!) so you two could play together.

The story is great and it is better than Portal. This game steps up how the game is played and the humor in this one. You can create your own levels too and the Workshop has a lot of custom levels. Some of the mods are basically fully games with their own unique story and mechanics like Portal Reloaded. The story takes the right amount of time to complete too. If you want to wait for a sale then this game goes on sale for $1 often but I recommend buying the bundle that includes Portal that goes on sale for $1.50.

First things first, let's talk about our delightful host, GLaDOS. Imagine Siri's evil twin, with a penchant for passive-aggressive insults and a voice that could curdle milk at 100 paces. GLaDOS is the kind of AI that makes you reconsider your life choices while simultaneously laughing at your misfortune. But hey, who needs self-esteem anyway, right?

Now, onto the puzzles. Oh, the puzzles! Portal 2's brain-benders are like a trip through Willy Wonka's factory, if Willy Wonka had a degree in sadism. You'll find yourself grappling with physics, spatial reasoning, and your own dwindling sanity as you navigate the treacherous test chambers of Aperture Science. But fear not, because every time you think you've got it figured out, the game gleefully throws a wrench in your plans and cackles maniacally as you plummet to your doom. Fun for the whole family!

And then there's Wheatley. Ah, sweet, bumbling Wheatley. He's like the lovechild of a toaster and a Shakespearean fool, with a dash of existential dread thrown in for good measure. Voiced to perfection by Stephen Merchant, Wheatley is the kind of character who simultaneously makes you want to hug him and punt him into the nearest incinerator. His antics provide a welcome respite from the relentless onslaught of despair, but don't get too attached – this is Portal, after all, where happiness goes to die.

But wait, there's more! Portal 2 isn't just about puzzles and psychotic AIs; it's also a masterclass in black comedy. From the abandoned test chambers littered with the remains of previous test subjects to the twisted history of Aperture Science itself, every corner of this game is dripping with dark humor and a healthy dose of existential dread. It's like a fever dream concocted by Edgar Allan Poe and Tim Burton after a night of heavy drinking, and it's absolutely glorious.

In conclusion, Portal 2 is a game that will make you laugh, cry, and question your own sanity – sometimes all at once. It's a rollercoaster ride through the darkest recesses of the human psyche, with a side of humor so black it makes the void look positively cheerful. So grab your portal gun, don your hazmat suit, and prepare for a journey you won't soon forget. Just remember to keep your wits about you – because in Aperture Science, the only thing more dangerous than the puzzles is the punchline.

👾 Portal 2
--------------------
I didn't really play it until recently. It wasn't until this Christmas when Valve's games were on sale that I was able to play it.

I haven't played this game solo yet, so I won't refer to the Single Player experience.

I played it for the first time with a friend in its cooperative mode. And let me tell you, the game is simply charming and tremendously fun. It's bold in language, absurd in narrative, and ingenious in gameplay…

The thousand ways to solve the same puzzle are charming, entertaining, and challenging at times, spending many minutes exploring the same room until deciphering the solution is incredible. And let me give you a recommendation: never watch a video tutorial if you're stuck on a puzzle. Believe me, you'll ruin the experience.

New review: Very good game, im not surprised how this is the most highest rated steam game, its really good for a game that is older then 7 years. I will say the achievement on this game is way easier then portal 1 the only annoying ones are the hug 3 friends and play with someone that haven't playe co op after you beat the game, but its still pretty fun. The campain story is really good, i love wheatly it my favorite and teaming up with GLaDOS is also really cool. and also the lore in this game is very fascinating.My first playthru, i get stuck alot on the outside puzzles but for the indoor puzzles (like the chambers) are pretty fun to figure out.

the graphics are a 10/10, being that it was made in 2011. especially the cutscene at the start of the game, that shit was amazing.

comedy is spread perfectly throughout the game to the point where the comedy isnt annoying, but it also isnt lifeless. 9/10

story is also very nice (: if your really invested into the story, look out for easter eggs in the game, read the comic for portal, ect. 8/10

gameplay has gotta be the best out of everything.
utilizes the portal gun to do some fun puzzles or really just mess around.
it has a built in level editor with an additional coop mode, so you can Think with portals™ with your buddy! 10/10

replayability is a 10/10, just look at my hours! you could even try out speedrunning.

This game elevates everything the original did and adds even more. The puzzles are more fun, the characters are all charming and will take you on an emotional rollercoaster, the world is given much so much more depth, it’s all just so well done. One of my favorite things was how the music changed when you used certain puzzle pieces like the lasers or gravity lifts, especially towards the end. I will say that I thought that Kelly Bailey’s soundtrack to the first game fit the atmosphere better, but that in no way means this one is bad.

I think the only real complaint I have is that the pacing of the game can drag a bit towards the end. It’s a tough call because from a narrative perspective, I would’ve liked to see some of the puzzles cut early on and near the end of the game so that it flows better, but cutting the puzzles out of your puzzle game wouldn’t make it a very good game. Portal 1 excelled at marrying the game and the narrative it was telling, so it’s a little disappointing that the sequel couldn’t maintain this aspect of the original.

Regardless, this is a fantastic game and unlike Valve’s other series, has an actual ending. Much like most of Valve’s output, this is another must-play.",1707032332,1707032332,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Even the co-op mode had its own storyline! (Though it was certainly less significant than the main storyline.) I've now played the co-op twice, with two different people, and it certainly works to provide an enjoyable teamwork experience if you feel the need to share the amazing game that is Portal with others!

Oh, and last thing - the soundtrack is spectacular! The credits song (Want You Gone) is filled with personality and sounds great, and the background music always fits the scene.

I'm not even joking, it's not like a ""haha fatherless kid no like Portal 2"" thing, I simply realize that I am blessed to have active support models in my life when I compare myself to Chell, whom, from what I've gathered, has had little to no support models for most of her life. ([SPOILERS] TLDR: The game is more than worth the money it's being sold for, just trust me.) There is a fan theory that Caroline is the mother of Chell, which I personally don't believe, but it would add new context to the ending song. Even though I DON'T believe this, just looking at it from that perspective forces you to see your mother differently: Caroline would've abandoned Chell (or in some other way have split up with her at a young age), died with her consciousness left on some hard drive abandoned in an underground testing facility, only to have it fused with Chell's enemy, causing GLaDOS to develop as a character and work with Chell to defeat a common enemy, which results in GLaDOS saving Chell, which breaks the idea of aggression between the former enemies, but Caroline would also be saving Chell, which would be the one good deed she ever did for Chell, only for some unrelated system maintenance bot to kill her off, leaving the only known vessel of her to revert to her rouge ways of before. But that's not the end, for the machines you once destroyed now sing you a song from the perspective of your mother expressing her filial love, only repeating the one expression on her mind over and over again as you are set free from the home you once considered your hell. I interpret this song to be the unrecognized, selfless effort that a good mom puts into the life of her child, that the child only comes to see at the end of the game, or in an applicable example, either moving out, or her death. My mom is different than Caroline because she never abandoned me, and sings me this song (metaphorically) while she is still with me as apposed to when she will pass. This game helped me achieve wisdom that most people achieve years later at the two times I previously mentioned. This perspective change made me realized that because I have a good mom, I have a good life; Unlike Chell, and millions of others for that matter, I not only have the ability to, but also a reason to cherish my mother, who treats me better than Caroline does to Chell in her life (or real people, you get the idea). This is why I appreciate my mom more after playing Portal 2, so please, buy the game, and play it. Thank you for coming to my TED Talk.",1706927228,1706927228,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Usually in these type of games I open up the internet to find ways to solve some parts of the game where I did stuck. This is not about the Portal 2. Here, I know that every chamber is solvable, I just need to take some time, calm and just think a little bit. And eventually... You get the solution. I'm actually getting satified by moving forward in walkthrough, unlike in other known to me puzzle games.

[h2] Funny and silly voice acting[/h2]
Voice acting in this game is fun to listen to, with its jokes and satire to big corporations and theirs attitude to the employees. Cave Johnson's ad-like speech, Wheatley's non-stop talking, GLaDOS's teasing and ESCPECIALLY the girl we are playing as - Chell for hers silent thoughts. :D Also worth mention the AI entities Chell encounters with - cute regular turrets, silly malfunctioned turrets, core spheres (SPACE core in particular). All this voice acting makes the game not serious, hilarious at some point, and just fun to watch.

[h2] Portal's immortality[/h2]
In the second installment devs introduced to us community chambers, which makes the game immortal in theory. That's a great addition to the game. It makes the game replayable, because everytime you'll want to revisit this great game you won't gonna need replay the same that you just played several years ago. In Portal's case you'll just download Workshop content and will enjoy it either alone or with your friend in co-op!

[h2] Final thoughts[/h2]
I wist there was a third game, but unfortunately we all know that Valve can't count more than 2, but as I mentioned before, the game has Workshop content, so at least that won't make you bored. I love this game, its gameplay, voice acting, satire and community content. If you haven't played it yet, then stop reading the review and buy it already!

I knew nothing about the series, about the larger Half Life lore, and I didn't understand Valve's significance in the industry. I just knew the dude with the valve on his head in the start-up screen was unsettling, the robots were really funny, and I couldn't solve the puzzles for the life of me. Look I was like 11 I had a peanut brain.

Years later, as a huge Half Life fan, I finally played the first Portal and really enjoyed it, but I didn't adore it. I think it's an excellent little puzzler that builds slowly and expertly to a really exciting conclusion, but it just...it was missing something. Not the sauce, it had the sauce, but it just wasn't as amazing as it could have been. 

Now, finally returning to Portal 2, I have found the perfect sequel, the perfect puzzle game, and probably one of my new favourite games of all time. Like I know I'm over a decade later but whatever, I was endlessly blown away by the twists and turns this takes. It revolutionizes the portal techniques we became familiar with through adding the goo elements, new great characters, deepened lore, and presentation that really holds up. Also, the writing in the first game was itself incredible, but it's even better in the sequel. And the voice actors? Scarily good, especially Wheatley. 

I, just like every other human being on this planet, wait eagerly for the day we might get another game in the series, though I accept it's not very likely. Thankfully, we have modders, so maybe we'll be alright. Portal revolution next ig",1706842689,1706842689,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Portal 2 is a 2011 puzzle-platform video game developed by Valve Like the original Portal (2007), players solve puzzles by placing portals and teleporting between them. Portal 2 adds features including tractor beams, lasers, light bridges, and paint-like gels that alter player movement or allow portals to be placed on any surface. In the single-player campaign, players control Chell, who navigates the dilapidated Aperture Science Enrichment Center during its reconstruction by the supercomputer GLaDOS. In the new cooperative mode, players solve puzzles together as robots Atlas and P-Body

        [td]🎮Gameplay[/td]
        [td]While Portal had some amazing and unique mechanics, Portal 2 ups the craziness even more! Physics plays an even better role in this game and it makes the game even harder when you get into the later stages. You still have the same tool from the previous game, which is great and Portal 2 doesn’t add any weird mechanics for you to use and still keeps it simple. The gameplay is still a masterpiece just like the first Portal, but with more puzzles to mess with, so no complaints here. I mean it’s Valve, they never really mess up, so no surprises. Honestly Portal 2 is just ahead of its time.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]📜Story[/td]
        [td] First I must say Portal 2 has a masterpiece of an intro! The story brought back GLaDOS (which I'm really glad to see come back). You will find many interesting twists through your playthrough and I honestly really enjoyed it. It’s a big step up from the previous game and a longer story which I'm really thankful for. I felt like the first Portal game was a bit too short so Portal 2 fixes that and makes the story really fun with more dark humor.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]🎭Multiplayer[/td]
        [td]I had a blast with the multiplayer. Having a friend and I solve difficult puzzles was a blast and a joy. If you really enjoy puzzles, get a friend that does as well and you two will have endless fun here. The workshop has so many maps for you and your friend to enjoy.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]🕛Playtime[/td]
        [td]Portal 2 has a ton of replayability. The workshop has so many maps for you to try, with even a mod tool to make your own!. I can see someone having a ton of hours in this game, especially if you enjoy puzzles.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]🎧Sound[/td]
        [td]The sound design and music is pretty nice. The end credits are pretty funny and creative (I won’t spoil it). The robots sound pretty cool and love the voice acting from the Antagonist. Besides that, the overall sound design and acting (besides the companion and Antagonist.) was pretty average and not memorable. It is a step up from the previous game.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]❗Bugs❗[/td]
        [td]I have had one crash in my experience but that’s really it. The game is pretty well polished besides that incident, but that could have been something on my end.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]🔅Performance[/td]
        [td]The game runs really well. Max settings and not a single frame drop. The Valve engine is just a marvel in optimization. You should have zero problems here.[/td]

        [td]🔗Conclusion[/td]
        [td]I recently got into puzzle games (trying to be more open to trying new games) and this game was a good test of my puzzle skills. It was a great experience and will be a great time for players new to the genre. Give this a shot and even if you don’t like puzzles that much, this game has a solid story that got me hooked.[/td]

It continues the story of Portal, so I'd recommend you play that first, but it isn't necessary.

The game over all isn't particularly hard. There are a couple odd puzzles where I got stuck, and 2 where I had to look them up, but it was usually just one Portal wall I had not seen, or that was hidden (rudely) by the devs as some sort of odd joke. They usually feel about right or a little too easy.

Overall, I really enjoyed the single player, and was shocked by how much voice acted high quality multiplayer content there was!! I haven't finished it all yet.

I LOVE THE VOICE LINES. They are so funny.

There is a sign in one level that says: ""If a future version of you comes back in time to warn you not to do this test, IGNORE THEM!""

All of the new gameplay mechanics it introduces are logical continuations of the physics-based puzzles in Portal 1. This time, though, there is a more balanced mix of self-contained rooms - which feel almost like standardized test questions - and more organic puzzle-solving, in which the player must use the game’s mechanics in order to progress through an open-air environment. These latter segments are where the game is at its most grand, and where it delves into the quirky lore of Aperture Labs.

This transcendental creation, an opus of cognitive intensity that reverberates with cosmic resonance, propelled me into an echelon of mental engagement hitherto believed unattainable.

Traversing the labyrinthine intricacies of this intellectual behemoth, every synapse within my neural network erupted in a symphony of brilliance, sparking a conflagration of cerebral connections akin to celestial constellations aligning in a cosmic ballet. This was not an ordinary exercise in intellectual stimulation; it was an ascent to the acme of cognitive Everest, where the rarefied air of challenge invigorated rather than stifled.

The meticulous craftsmanship woven into this intellectual odyssey mirrors the work of virtuoso architects sculpting the very edifices of thought. It beckoned me to transcend the ordinary realms of comprehension, challenging me to navigate through a storyline more riveting than the most captivating of narratives. It unfolded as a grandiose journey, an odyssey suffused with brilliance, guiding me through valleys of complexity and scaling peaks of enlightenment.

And now, a eulogy to the creators — audacious visionaries who, with unwavering courage, forged not merely an object but an enigma that defies conventional classification. The narrative they meticulously sculpted is a testament to their narrative prowess, a symphony that unfurls like an enthralling epic, leaving the reader spellbound, perplexed, and insatiable in their quest for more.

In paying homage to these cerebral architects, I bestow monumental accolades for their audacious venture in birthing an intellectual colossus that not only stimulates but metamorphoses the very core of the mind. To craft an object that perplexes and captivates in equal measure is an endeavor reserved for the true alchemists of intellect, and for this, they warrant a thunderous standing ovation. This intellectual magnum opus transcends the realm of creation; it is a transcendental monument, an ode to the boundless frontiers of human cognition, marking the zenith of intellectual revelation.",1654205913,1706601297,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

A name that echoes through the halls of adolescence, not with the sterile clang of lockers, but with the joyous ping of portals opening, the triumphant ""Eureka!"" after solving a mind-bending puzzle, and the side-splitting guffaws at Wheatley's nonsensical ramblings. It wasn't just a game; it was a crucible where the bonds of our high school brotherhood were forged in sweat, frustration, and pure, unadulterated glee.

Remember those sun-drenched afternoons, cramming into my attic bedroom, the dusty air thick with anticipation and pizza fumes? The monitor cast an eerie blue glow on our faces as we navigated the decaying Aperture Science labs, each chamber a warped labyrinth whispering forgotten memories. We weren't just test subjects; we were astronauts traversing an alien world, architects bending the very fabric of space with our trusty portal guns.

The puzzles, oh, the puzzles! They weren't just tests of logic; they were intricate ballets of physics and perception, demanding not just smarts, but a twisted kind of creativity. We'd spend hours hunched over the keyboard, muttering theories, sketching diagrams on crumpled napkins, each victory a shared dance of high fives and fist bumps. The sound of silence as we stared at a seemingly impossible chamber, punctuated only by the hum of the PC fan, was a language in itself, a shared burden of intellectual agony.

And then, the breakthrough! A portal placed at just the right angle, a daring leap of faith through a shimmering tear in reality, and suddenly the impossible became routine. The collective sigh of relief, the eruption of cheers, echoing through the attic like the roar of a triumphant gladiator. In those moments, we weren't just high schoolers; we were heroes defying gravity, pioneers charting uncharted territory.

But it wasn't just the puzzles that bonded us. It was the humor, the absurdly brilliant script that had us snorting into our Mountain Dews at GLaDOS's deadpan pronouncements and Wheatley's manic ramblings. The world of Portal 2 wasn't just a sterile testing ground; it was a living, breathing entity with its own twisted sense of humor, a dark joke shared only among us, the chosen few.

As we reached the end, a bittersweet pang gripped our hearts. The portals closed, the credits rolled, and a hush fell over the attic. We'd conquered Aperture, defied GLaDOS, and in doing so, grown closer than ever. Those shared hours of struggle and triumph etched a memory onto our souls, a portal of our own, forever linking us back to that sun-drenched attic and the joy of solving puzzles together.

Portal 2 wasn't just a game; it was a rite of passage, a shared story etched in pixels and polygons. It's a game that makes you weep, not for its characters, but for the fleeting nature of those golden years, the camaraderie forged in basements and bedrooms, the friendships that transcended the pixelated landscapes and bloomed into something real. So, go ahead, dust off your portal gun, gather your comrades, and open a portal back to a time when puzzles were life, laughter was victory, and friendship was the ultimate reward. Just be warned, the tears may flow, but they'll be tears of joy and nostalgia, a bittersweet reminder of the bonds forged in the Aperture of our youth.",1706590974,1706590974,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

My opinion is still the same. Moreover, I felt like the story of Portal 2 was better.

In Portal, excepted challenge, story and workshop, you don’t have anything.
In Portal 2, you now have multiplayer ! It consist of coop levels that you can only play un duo.

While you may have fears about the repetitiveness of the story, you quickly realize that even by keeping the same game principle you can quite find yourself in a completely different story.

It feels like it flip flops from testing to escape / story sections too often imo. I love the Old Aperture sections but they feel way too short. I get the point is that Aperture only did smaller tests before then when GLaDOS came into the picture the tests were extended to hell but honestly I'd have preferred to explore each decade of Aperture in it's own chapter, especially the 70s section, that part was beautiful yet it was gone in a flash, I wanted to see more, much more. Plus I feel like this has a similar problem to what HL2 does imo, where sections are either really great or bore me to death, fuck that tunnel shaft thing towards the end of Chapter 7. I know it's easy in hindsight but that annoyed me because of how boring it and the section before it were with how tedious they were to solve. 

I know I'm dogging on this game quite a bit but I do love it. Wheatley and GLaDOS are amazing, the writing is too, Cave Johnson is golden, the Caroline storyline (kinda rhymes), all that stuff was amazing. Eric Wolpaw did a great job. Some of the new mechanics were great too. I loved the Laser puzzles and the gels. The others I was a bit more mixed on, hell even some parts of the gels I really didn't like, but I generally did love them though and even if I didn't care too much for the other mechanics, they're better there than not. Would the Frankencubes count as mechanics? I didn't when saying the others were just alright cuz I love those little bastards, same with the Defective Turrets. As if I already haven't mentioned it enough, I love Old Aperture. I mean, I did find the first area of Chapter 6 (forgot the name) pretty dull but beyond that, it was beautiful. Wish we did see more of each area (Maybe a Chapter each but that'd probably ask too much tho)


Nitpicks:
These are thing that shouldn't have bearing on how I feel about the game but still tick me off. Sadly I have alot with this game but I get why Valve made these changes, and some people prefer them, so to each their own.

Honestly I don't care too much for the ruins aesthetic of the game. It made sections look boring. Speaking of which I'm not the biggest fan of the artstyle. Portal 1 felt sleek and modern yet grimey at the same time, while I always thought P2 looked kinda dull. When I was a kid playing Lego Dimensions, I loved playing as Chell but rarely went to the Portal World cuz I found the greyness of it really dreary and boring, hence why I love the colourful Old Aperture so much. I have the same sentiment with the character designs, P1 had a fresh look to them but honestly I'm not the biggest fan of P2 Glados. I think Wheatley is the only character that benefitted from the new designs imo, I can't imagine him looking good in P1's style (Maybe he could tho but you lose the expressions). Another nitpick is with the labs themselves. I'm a bit confused on the lore but from what it seems like to me, I'm honestly quite sad Aperture was a bunch of robot arms working to form a lab. Imagining Aperture from P1, it honestly feels alot more interesting (Besides Old Aperture ofc), like there's an actual lab there. P2 feels alot less believeable. If anyone can correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't it that all the robot arms and whatnot with all the test chambers were built by the robots post neurotoxin incident? I know it's a stupid argument but it just kinda kills my immersion, thinking Aperture is basically a shape shifting facility, or at least the test chambers are, cuz then if they are then it makes P1's test chambers feel weird too cuz then they ain't like fixtures into the facility like they feel like they are. It feels like those ""cracks in the walls"" are genuine to the facility's structure. A small nitpick about the Rat Man comic now. I love it, but it does kinda kill the opportunity for P1 mods with somebody going through a test chamber with a story that could potentially be canon, but more importantly it kinda makes P1 a little less exciting, cuz it makes Chell feel less like somebody who got lucky. I get that's the point but there was a charm to thinking many had died before you and you stop future acts of evil and avenge the dead. Plus how the game itself retconned P1's ending to an extent. I'd have preferred it if they continued Chell's story in a different way, but hey this is only a nitpick, cuz I'm happy they didn't to some degree cuz then we'd be missing alot of the great stuff about P2. One last thing. The boxart / game art is dull, and it sucks especially seeing the concept box art which looked so much better imo, but I don't mind the art, tbh Portal 1's isn't much to talk home about either, and I get you can change the art yourself, and you can't judge a book by it's cover, or a game by it's boxart. Look how many great games have shit boxart.

In conclusion, you can probably tell which of the two games I prefer, but that and all my complaining isn't to say this game isn't great. I am heavily outnumbered but I'd say you need to like certain mechanics to love this game, otherwise it may alienate you.

A classic, one of the best video games ever released (IMO). Highly recommend.

This is a first person 3D puzzle platformer with physics based mechanics. Despite having some moderately challenging puzzles (from what I remember, it has been a bit), Portal and Portal 2 are still great semi-entry level video games. Most enemies act more as obstacles rather than ""active player seeking threats"" (nothing wrong with ""active player seeking threats"" Portal just does not really have them). This does not mean that your character is safe though, the environment itself is the biggest hazard and mistakes can get you killed, but as the environment is largely unchanging, players can easily learn from their mistakes. Also, the controls feel nice and responsive, if I die / fail, it is usually not (if ever) the game's fault.

This game looks pretty great visually, nothing jaw dropping but still more than serviceable (IMO). The audio is pretty good too, nothing really stood out to me, but that is probably for the best. (Ending songs are very good though)

I find the story of Portal to be great as well! Neither super intrusive or completely non-existent, and overall very well written. The game has Valve's signature style of having as few uncontrollable cutscenes as possible, something I can enjoy.

This is all without even mentioning the co-op mode which is also fantastic. Naturally it offers new and unique puzzles that can only be solved with cooperation in addition to a fun little side story.

I used to never click on the ""this video will make you forget your name"" videos because I thought it was real because my sister used to always watch those ""hypnosis: can't stop laughing"" videos. Here I am now, knowing about the game and the fact that you cry whenever you yawn

Love you DJ idc if I’m not first i just like all your vids! Respect for you that you don’t make terrible content like the people who you react and making people to stop subscribing to them because of you. If you wasn’t doing youtube like this content, everyone wouldn’t know about this. Hopefully your life has been good.

Its one of those games you wished lasted longer but its not really short either. Graphically its an upgrade from Portal 1, not on the engine side since its still using Source which was already old by 2011 when this game came out. AFAIK Source 2 wasn't quite done yet but given the sheer amount of assets and polish you have to wonder if Valve couldn't get that engine out sooner for this game given that Unreal 3 had already rendered Source obsolete. And well it shows, even in 2011 I noticed the grainy low-res textures that weren't a problem back in 2004 when HL2 debuted with that engine or in 2007 with Portal 1, but by 2011 it was already looking mid at best. The rest of the game is great tho, the worldbuilding its second to none, I really wish they made games like these more often. Portal 1 at times felt like a minigame but Portal 2 its a full-fledged game and it shows. Its one of those rare cases where the sequel its truly better than the original, off the top of my head the other cases I can recall would be HL2, Sonic 2, Homeworld 2, GTA Vice City (compared to GTA3), and well that's it, as I said most sequels aren't as good as the original game. The co-op mode really depends on who you get to play with, its one of those games you really need a buddy to play since it requires a level of coordination that you wont get with random matchmaking.",1706393511,1706393511,True,0,0,0,0,True,True,False

That is honestly, very impressive for a game over a DECADE old, so I have to say Valve, for a game this old, it's very much enjoyable, especially with a friend playing with you!

The character writing in this game is impeccable; Wheatley is a great addition to the existing characters and Glados gets an actual character this time. I like that there’s also exploration to be done here, rather than the constant sterile test chambers of the first game. You get to see what the old part of the facility looks like. In this section of the game, however, it is sometimes very difficult to find portal-able surfaces, which is my only gripe with this game. The ending concludes the story nicely, and I would absolutely recommend this game to anyone who remotely likes puzzle games. 

Edit: After playing the co-op campaign, I can say I recommend this game even more than before. The co-op campaign provides very interesting, complex puzzles, and four portals to work with (each of you has a portal gun). The lore that it adds is quite interesting, although I do recommend playing through the main story first. Absolutely do the bonus levels, the ending in that sequence made me burst out laughing.

This was a triumph
I'm making a note here: Huge success
It's hard to overstate my satisfaction
Aperture Science
We do what we must
Because we can
For the good of all of us
Except the ones who are dead

But there's no sense crying over every mistake
You just keep on trying till you run out of cake
And the science gets done
And you make a neat gun
For the people who are still alive

I'm not even angry
I'm being so sincere right now
Even though you broke my heart
And killed me
And tore me to pieces
And threw every piece into a fire
As they burned it hurt because I was so happy for you!

Now these points of data make a beautiful line
And we're out of beta
We're releasing on time
So I'm GLaD I got burned
Think of all the things we learned
For the people who are still alive

Go ahead and leave me
I think I prefer to stay inside
Maybe you'll find someone else to help you
Maybe Black Mesa
That was a joke
Haha! Fat chance
Anyway, this cake is great
It's so delicious and moist

Look at me still talking
When there's Science to do
When I look out there, it makes me GLaD I'm not you
I've experiments to run
There is research to be done
On the people who are still alive

And believe me, I am still alive
I'm doing Science and I'm still alive
I feel fantastic and I'm still alive
While you're dying, I'll be still alive
And when you're dead, I will be still alive
Still alive

Compared to the original where it was filled with Environmental Storytelling and abit of horror which reminded me of The Cube where you have countless number of questions that keep the game more mysterious and Portal 2 basically answered most of those questions which again, i'm not a fan of that stuff as i like how mysterious the first game was as it added so much to the atmosphere.

I dislike how everytime you complete a level you get slapped into a loading screen right after, not an ingame one like before but an actual screen which sorta takes you out of being immersed as again the original had the loading screen done ingame to keep you in as long as t can and i like it better that way. 

Gameplay feels more of the same which makes sense but i feel with Portal 1 right when it was getting repetitive it was able to end due to being a short game but due to this game being long it feels it just drags on with alot of samey puzzles, to the point where i just got bored and have not been bothered to continue sadly.

That aside, best part about this game would be the wonderful COOP mode which was a welcome edition, worked better than i expected and the mod support ontop makes it even better with endless amount of creative levels to play.

So even though i have issues with the game, i do think it does a great job at doing what it set out to do. It may not be to my liking, but i understand why people love,praise and respect it.",1649844211,1705990003,False,2,0,0.450839340686798096,0,True,False,False

I hope we get Portal 3, but I won't hold my breath as I know Valve is allergic to the number. ;)

Valve has been one of my favourite gaming franchise since Half Life. The Portal series with its innovative Gameplay has surely etched its mark in my top games. Portal 2 is a masterpiece that effortlessly blends innovative gameplay, captivating storytelling, and ingenious level design. As a player, you'll find yourself immersed in a world of puzzles and humor that will challenge and entertain you from start to finish. Even though I am still playing the game, the challenges in the beginning itself has been beautifully thought about.  One will not get bored and will keep trying, that's how much engrossing the game is.          

While every puzzle presents its own set of challenges, one that stumped me for an extended period was i the initial stages of the game as i was still figuring out howto use the blue portal. Now that I have got a hang of it, the next few levels have been a cakewalk. The satisfaction of solving these levels are immensely rewarding and showcase the game's ability to stretch the boundaries of problem-solving.

While Portal 2 is a near-flawless gem, there are minor areas where improvement could be considered. Some players may find the pacing a bit uneven, with occasional difficulty spikes that could be smoothed out for a more consistent experience. Additionally, although the humor is a standout feature, a few jokes may feel forced or repetitive after multiple playthroughs. I also liked the graphics for that time, details and textures are quite impressive. 

In conclusion, Portal 2 is a triumph in the world of puzzle-platformers. Its ingenious level design, challenging puzzles, and engaging narrative create an unforgettable gaming experience. Whether playing solo or with friends, the journey through Aperture Science is a delight that will be etched into the memory of any gamer fortunate enough to venture through its portals.",1705651657,1705651657,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

So simple, in fact, that this game could very well serve as someone's introduction to gaming overall! And everything is neatly packed within a few chapters, so that's neat-o.

620,156263464,76561198050500722,0,10,420,0,420,1705386184,"Pros:
The characters! Everyone is so charmingly dysfunctional and their banter is as integral to the game's soundtrack as the music. I could listen to it like a podcast. Expect to fall in love with everyone--even the most murderous foes.
The puzzles! They're challenging and mind-bending and always fresh without ever being frustrating. The pacing is also great--new elements get thrown at you just as you start to master old ones and nothing ever gets repetitive.
The worldbuilding! It's not a lore-heavy game by any stretch but, especially if you played the first Portal, the little glimpses into the history and workings of the dystopian Aperture company are fascinating.

Cons:
Truly nothing about Portal 2 got on my nerves. It sets simple goals for the kind of game it's going to be and achieves them without any unnecessary fluff.

Would I play again? ABSOLUTELY. Finished the solo campaign in two 3am nights and look forward to trying the co-op run-through ASAP.

Defeated your worse enemy and after that It feel like you lost your best friends












Well here we are again

It's always such a pleasure

to kill me twice?

Except I wasn't laughing

Under the circumstances

I've been shockingly nice



You want your freedom?

Take it

That's what I'm counting on



I used to want you dead

but

Now I only want you gone



She was a lot like you

(Maybe not quite as heavy)

So I could live forever

will never happen to you



You've got your

short sad

life left

I'll let you get right to it

Now I only want you gone



Goodbye my only friend

Oh, did you think I meant you?

That would be funny

if it weren't so sad

Well you have been replaced

I don't need anyone now

When I delete you maybe

I'll stop feeling so bad



Go make some new disaster

I'm writing about the Portal 2 Cooperative Game, because I don't have to introduce the story part to anyone.
I think everyone knows the gameplay of Portal.
The cooperative courses are quite difficult and thought-provoking, it involves a little suffering when you get from one to two, but at least they are good. 
The system requirements are not terrible, the game will run on all computers. 

I can't add much to the game, except that it is perfectly fine.
It's worth a try for its price, not too expensive, but still incredibly good.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes.

I played it nearly a decade back, acquiring it through other means and in an inferior computer at the lowest graphics. Now, here I am. A different person. A better computer. A revisit to the past. And a very good one.

Portal 2 is an amazing game! If you wanted to know whether or not it was, this review and countless others will testify to it's greatness. It builds on the already solid and engaging formula from the first game and makes it a superior beast. A brilliant story which brings more depth to the lore of the previous game and then further expands the world of Portal (Half-Life, actually). In addition, the narrative direction the game takes, the masterful execution of scenes, the effective soundtrack and the new gameplay innovations withe the level of quality as expected from Valve helps Portal 2 to be the timeless and definitive Portal experience, until the next Portal game comes, if it is coming (sigh...). Regardless, this game's conclusion does wrap everything up nice and tight, with no plotholes that I can think of and enough mystery to keep you talking about it.

Now, about my revisit. Unlike the first time I played this game, I finished this game really fast. In my memory, I remembered this game being a long epic, but that could just be 'cause of being my first time experiencing the game, so each puzzle would be difficult and I would have to take a while. But still... That was about 10 years ago... A really really long time! In this playthrough, since my pc was capable, I cranked the graphics up, so a lot of time was spent on taking in the sights in a way I've never seen before, kinda like a remaster, but it's not. But even subtracting the sightseeing time, I found myself cruising through the puzzle. Each and every chamber, I didn't take even a minute to solve. It's like muscle memory. Brain muscle memory?

This got me questioning the replay value of the main game. Does solving taking the time to finally solve the puzzle the first time, automatically means that you will do it faster, irrespective of the time passed between tries? Probably it is, probably I'm just overthinking this stuff, reading too much between the lines. Regardless,  I had a lot of fun and the moments still hit as hard as they did back then. I love Valve games, yet they don't make more... 

I haven't tried the Steam Workshop levels (I eventually will) and the Co-Op campaign. I'll be updating this review, once I finish the Co-Op campaign (which I have not even touched, even after all these years).

620,132542913,76561199059186424,101,35,277,0,277,1677716395,"Portal 2,"" an unparalleled magnum opus in the annals of video game history, occupies a hallowed space in my heart as the quintessential pinnacle of gaming brilliance. This opulent creation by Valve Corporation transcends the mere boundaries of digital entertainment, elevating the medium to an exalted art form through a sublime synthesis of inventive gameplay mechanics, an intricately woven narrative tapestry, and an inimitable infusion of humor that reverberates with a resonance that transcends time.

At the very epicenter of the game's greatness lies the revolutionary and iconic portal-based gameplay mechanics. The deceptively simple yet infinitely sophisticated portal gun propels players into a dimension where spatial reasoning takes on a whole new meaning. The manipulation of space, time, and the laws of physics becomes an art form, challenging players to navigate through a labyrinth of mind-bending puzzles that are as intellectually stimulating as they are creatively rewarding. Each meticulously designed chamber is a testament to the unparalleled brilliance of Valve's game design, requiring an exquisite fusion of logic, intuition, and the sheer audacity to think outside the conventional gaming box.

The satisfaction derived from successfully navigating these intricate puzzles is akin to solving a complex riddle or mastering an intricate musical composition. It is a visceral and cerebral experience, creating an immersive gameplay journey that transcends the boundaries of the virtual world. The joy of seeing the world through the lens of the portal gun, of bending and warping reality at will, imparts a sense of empowerment that is both exhilarating and deeply satisfying. This innovative gameplay mechanic not only sets ""Portal 2"" apart from its contemporaries but also cements its status as a groundbreaking force that reshaped the landscape of gaming.

However, to reduce ""Portal 2"" merely to its gameplay mechanics would be a disservice to its multifaceted brilliance. The game unfolds within the enigmatic and labyrinthine Aperture Science Enrichment Center, a character in its own right. This facility, with its sterile chambers and abandoned corridors, serves as the atmospheric backdrop to an intricate narrative woven with both wit and emotional depth. The player is guided through this captivating world by the ever-watchful and sometimes malevolent artificial intelligence, GLaDOS. Her unpredictable nature, a mix of passive-aggressive charm and ominous undertones, adds a layer of intrigue that propels the player forward with an insatiable curiosity.

The introduction of Wheatley, a lovably bumbling personality core, injects a much-needed dose of humor into the narrative. This comedic dynamic creates a perfect counterbalance to the foreboding atmosphere of the abandoned facility, making the storytelling not only engaging but also a delightful journey of discovery. The character development is not a mere embellishment but an integral part of the gaming experience, establishing an emotional connection that deepens as the narrative unfolds.

The visual and auditory dimensions of ""Portal 2"" are nothing short of breathtaking. The dynamic environments, ranging from the pristine chambers of Aperture Science to the hauntingly beautiful remnants of the old enrichment spheres, showcase a level of attention to detail that borders on the sublime. The juxtaposition of sterile, clinical spaces with the eerie, dilapidated remnants of the facility creates a visual narrative that is as compelling as it is visually arresting. The ambient soundtrack, a mesmerizing creation by Mike Morasky, complements the visual storytelling, eliciting a range of emotions from tension to elation and further immersing players in the surreal and captivating world of Aperture Science.

Beyond the solitary gaming experience, ""Portal 2"" introduces an innovative co-op mode that adds yet another layer of depth to its brilliance. The introduction of two new characters, Atlas and P-Body, expands the narrative canvas and introduces a fresh dimension to the gameplay. The collaborative puzzle-solving required in co-op mode fosters a unique sense of camaraderie and teamwork. The joy of overcoming challenges with a friend not only amplifies the overall experience but also transforms ""Portal 2"" into a shared adventure, solidifying its place as a timeless classic that resonates in the collective memories of gaming enthusiasts.

In essence, ""Portal 2"" is not merely a game; it is a transcendent experience that seamlessly weaves together groundbreaking gameplay, a captivating narrative, and a distinct visual and auditory identity. It stands as an enduring testament to the limitless potential of video games as a form of artistic expression, leaving an indelible mark on the gaming industry and securing its place as a timeless classic. The impact of ""Portal 2"" extends far beyond the digital realm, permeating the realms of pop culture and inspiring a generation of gamers to explore the vast and uncharted territories of interactive storytelling. Its influence echoes in the corridors of gaming history, reminding us that, at its zenith, the art of gaming can be an immersive, transformative, and indescribably beautiful experience that transcends the confines of the virtual world.",1676055753,1705005735,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

The story picks up really well after the first one and makes almost too much sense. This is meant to be a puzzle game, right? Speaking of, the additions in terms of puzzles are intriguing as well. And the notably more open play areas fit the setting and story arc as well!

The puzzles are extremely fun, even on replays, especially since its very possible to solve them in different ways. The story is leagues better, although a tad different than portal 1. There's still a fair deal of environmental storytelling but there is a lot more explicit story as well. And the writing is so good. Several of my favorite jokes from any game come from this one. GLaDOS and Wheatley are some of the best characters from any valve game. The art direction is also leagues above portal 1. Portal still looks great for a source game, but Portal 2 can be genuinely stunning at times. The 3d skyboxes are used to amazing effect here.

the graphics look very nice, there's subtle, but good details and there is some silly secrets you find, eg. breaking certain objects by hurling into them.

   Along with Left 4 Dead 2, Portal 2 would mark with its launch the end of Valve's golden age in which titles were released with great frequency, and as a successor to Portal (2007) it put an end to this beautiful period of the best way possible, being full of good moments, surprises and a lot of quality.

   Released on April 19, 2011, Portal 2 is a puzzle and platform title, a direct continuation of Portal (2007), also set in the science fiction universe of Half-Life, which continues the story of the title using the same bases. in its mechanics and expanding them.

[b] Below, a list of positive and negative points experienced during my time playing and free of spoilers (do not consider this as an absolute truth, but as what it is, a simple opinion) [/b]

[h3] What did I like? [/h3]

🟩   [b] The Gameplay. [/b] It takes the foundations of portal (2007) and expands them without becoming overwhelming.

🟩   [b] The story. [/b] the title places a direct emphasis on the story, developing it really well from start to finish.

🟩   [b] The style. [/b] The perfectionist and minimalist style adapts to the events of the story brilliantly.

🟩   [b] The setting. [/b] greatly expands the possible ways to maintain that elegant but bleak balance of Portal (2007)

[h3] What did I NOT like? [/h3]
 
⬜   [b] Nuh-uh. [/b] I didn't find anything that really bothered me.

[h3] What should I take into account when playing? [/h3]

❕ [b] It is Re-playable. [/b] It has access to the Steam Workshop, where you can use countless levels (and make your own)

❕ [b] Works based on Source. [/b] Every command you use in Half-Life 2 is fully functional here. (including weapons and characters)

❕ [b] It has Cooperative Multiplayer. [/b] Offers a separate campaign from the main one in which you and your friend can cooperate together to solve problems together.

[h3] Personal opinion. [/h3]

   Very personally I consider this one of the best titles of its kind, it takes the already (personal) perfection seen before in Portal (2007) and squeezes it to limits where you would think it is unnecessary, but instead creates a campaign worth remembering for a very long time.",1704747273,1704755361,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

The mechanics of the game have been greatly expanded with the speed and jumping gels added to the game, as well as the moon dust that allows you to open portals anywhere, and some levels have become quite challenging and creative with these new gel mechanics. If we look at the story, the story of the game includes a much expanded aperture science history and the topics we are curious about as characters. The only negative thing about the portal series for me is that if I didn't like puzzles and thinking that would challenge my brain, I definitely wouldn't be able to play this series.

Coming to the coop mode of the game, I found the story short and sweet as a side story. If you are with someone who is calm and good at fun puzzles and can handle this situation when you are tired and you cannot think of anything, the game is really fun.",1704660289,1704660289,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I was initially worried finally playing Portal 2 in late 2023, but my fears were quickly put to rest. Nearly 13 years have passed since this game's initial release, but its witty writing, impeccable comedic timing, and charming setting have held strong. For years, other games have attempted to pull off comedy the way that the original Portal did, and very few ever succeeded. Portal 2 keeps that legacy going. I played the game on a Steam Deck using an Xbox Series X controller and had no issues with that experience. The platforming feels just as smooth and tight as ever. Every time I missed a jump, fell to my death, etc. I knew it was entirely my fault, and that's exactly what I want in a platformer.

If I was forced levy a criticism against Portal 2, it would be that in a few instances, it doesn't communicate the rules of the world to the player as well as I might like. Different players have different thoughts on how forthcoming puzzle games should be with what is or is not impossible in the world. I personally like a game to tell me very clearly what the rules of the world are and leave all the challenge in the puzzle itself. There were a few puzzles in Portal 2 in which my first step to solving the puzzle was discovering a new rule. I'm pretty precious about my time, and that type of experience usually leaves me feeling like my time was wasted figuring out the rulebook rather than finding the solution to the puzzle. That said, this is a very forced criticism because I feel that the game is a nearly perfect game. (SPOILER WARNING) After all, would Portal lose its magic if it simply told players to [spoiler]create infinite portals to gain speed[/spoiler]? Maybe Valve knows what I want better than I do, in this case.

Portal 2 is an incredible puzzle platformer that I recommend to anybody.  It is regularly on sale for $0.99, so it's an incredible buy.",1704575244,1704575444,True,1,0,0.53125,0,True,False,False

Well here we are again
It's always such a pleasure
Remember when you tried
to kill me twice?


Oh how we laughed and laughed
Except I wasn't laughing
Under the circumstances
I've been shockingly nice


You want your freedom?
Take it
That's what I'm counting on
I used to want you dead
but
Now I only want you gone


She was a lot like you
(Maybe not quite as heavy)
Now little Caroline is in here too


One day they woke me up
So I could live forever
It's such a shame the same
will never happen to you


You've got your
short sad life left
That's what I'm counting on
I'll let you get right to it
Now I only want you gone


Goodbye my only friend
Oh, did you think I meant you?
That would be funny
if it weren't so sad


Well you have been replaced
I don't need anyone now
When I delete you maybe
I'll stop feeling so bad


Go make some new disaster
That's what I'm counting on
You're someone else's problem
Now I only want you gone (×3)

I can confidently say that Portal 2 has not only secured a spot on my top ten games list but has also claimed a special place in my heart. This game is an absolute masterpiece, seamlessly blending mind-bending puzzles, a captivating narrative, and a unique sense of humour that keeps you grinning from start to finish.

First and foremost, the puzzle design in Portal 2 is unparalleled. The game challenges your intellect in ways that are both satisfying and utterly enjoyable. Each test chamber introduces new mechanics, ensuring that you are constantly on your toes and never settling into a repetitive rhythm. The gradual escalation of difficulty is handled with finesse, allowing players of all skill levels to enjoy the experience without feeling overwhelmed. Solving each puzzle feels like a triumph, and the satisfaction that comes with mastering the portal gun is unparalleled.

The narrative in Portal 2 is another standout feature. Valve has crafted a story-line that is not only engaging but also hilarious. The banter between GLaDOS and Wheatley is comedic gold, and the addition of new characters like Cave Johnson adds layers of depth to the game's lore. The way the narrative seamlessly weaves into the puzzle-solving experience is a testament to the developers' storytelling prowess.

Speaking of characters, the voice acting in Portal 2 is top-notch. Ellen McLain's reprisal of GLaDOS is nothing short of brilliant, and Stephen Merchant's portrayal of Wheatley is an absolute delight. The chemistry between the characters is so well-executed that it enhances the overall immersion of the game.

The level of polish in Portal 2 is commendable. The visuals are stunning, the soundtrack is atmospheric and fitting, and the overall attention to detail is evident in every corner of the game. The dynamic between the sterile test chambers and the dilapidated Aperture Science facility creates a captivating contrast that adds to the overall experience.

Moreover, the cooperative multiplayer mode is a stroke of genius. It not only extends the game's replay value but also introduces an entirely new dimension of teamwork and communication. Solving puzzles with a friend using the portal mechanics is an absolute blast and reinforces the game's reputation as a social and cooperative masterpiece.

In conclusion, Portal 2 is not just a game; it's an experience. It flawlessly combines challenging puzzles, a captivating narrative, and a unique sense of humour to create a gaming masterpiece that deserves all the praise it receives. If you haven't played Portal 2 yet, you're missing out on one of the finest gaming experiences available. It's a must-play that will undoubtedly stand the test of time.",1704531168,1704531168,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The graphics and animations are amazing (Especially the animation the Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device has when it shoots out a portal). The story and characters are very intriguing and make you want to play to see how it ends (The ending is amazing, you wont forget it), the voice acting also adds a lot to it. The puzzles arent that hard if you play video games pretty often (I only looked up a guide for one small part) and the concept is extremely unique, it never gets repetitive as the game adds new features often.

I'm making a note here
""Huge success""
It's hard to overstate my satisfaction
Aperture Science
We do what we must because we can
For the good of all of us
Except the ones who are dead
But there's no sense crying over every mistake
You just keep on trying till you run out of cake
And the science gets done and you make a neat gun
For the people who are still alive
I'm not even angry
I'm being so sincere right now
Even though you broke my heart
And killed me
And tore me to pieces
And threw every piece into a fire
As they burned it hurt because
I was so happy for you
Now, these points of data make a beautiful line
And we're out of beta, we're releasing on time
So I'm GLaD I got burned, think of all the things we learned
For the people who are still alive
Go ahead and leave me
I think I'd prefer to stay inside
Maybe you'll find someone else
To help you
Maybe Black Mesa?
That was a joke, ha-ha, fat chance
Anyway, this cake is great
It's so delicious and moist
Look at me, still talking when there's science to do
When I look out there, it makes me GLaD I'm not you
I've experiments to run, there is research to be done
On the people who are still alive
And believe me, I am still alive
I'm doing science and I'm still alive
I feel fantastic and I'm still alive
While you're dying, I'll be still alive
And when you're dead, I will be still alive
Still alive

 This game has the dummest plot that I have ever seen in my experience of playing games. The first Portal game wasn't some kind of masterpiece, but at least it was an enjoyable puzzle game with a very small and simplistic story. The problem with the second Portal game is the fact that it tries to write a story, but it does so in the stupidest and goofiest way possible. The problems that bother me so much with the narrative are:
  -How is Chell still biologically alive if Portal 2 takes place 50,000 years after the events of the first game? Even more, how does she look young after being alive for that unbelievable life period? Those are question that the game is not even trying to answer.
  -The initially friendly character, Wheatley, becomes evil in the middle of the game out of nowhere due to how much power he receives by being transferred into GLaDOS's body, even doing a cartoonish villan laugh and also having evil red light below him.
  -Speaking of, the whole character of Wheatley was specifically designed to be the dummest moron in existence as a fast and stupid way to explain why he beams evil due to the huge power that he received, but the real reason why he is not only that dumb, but also why he exists at all is because he is just a quirky comic relief character that cracks jokes only becausr Valve wanted to hire a well known comedian such as Stephen Merchant to voice the character (something that makes the character out of place with the other robot characters because he is the only one whose voice sounds natural and not as a robotic A.I. voice).
  -The final confrontation with Wheatley ends with the failure of the protagonist to press the button that defeats Wheatley from the position of power that he has, by the area being blown away, but the Chell is still alive after such a massive explosion like that, and the other solution that remains is shooting to the fucking moon (because apparently the portal gun can shoot that fast, and its shot can go out of a planet with a high atmosphere, go through space, and land to Earth's natural satellite.) and the newly made portal starts absorbing Wheatley and Chell into space (even if she is alive without having oxygen and being dressed only in a tank top), but in the last minute Chell gets recovered by GLaDOS and Wheatley is let to float in space!
  -And the last, the story needing so hard to end with a quirky song by the Turrets for the gamers to say ""Oh Ma GoD, This is so HolsOme!"", even if it doesn't have that much sense, why is it here?
 As for the gameplay, it's fine. It surpasses the original on a technical level, I think. But for what cause? The gameplay is frequently interrupted by the story's narration, and that wouldn't be a problem if the story weren't so stupidly written. I will go and say that the original was small enough for what it was, and it should have instead given the new puzzles from the second game in a DLC or an update to the additional content for Portal 1. Really, the only thing that I actually adored was the song played on the radio called ""Exile Vilify"" by The Nation, but that's it; there's nothing in the game that I can truly call exelent. Even if I said what I said, that doesn't mean that it's objectively an awful game. You could probably love this game, and for fair reasons, it has qualities. But that will not change the fact that I have a lot of issues with it, and it's not at all my kind of game. In the end, you will probably enjoy it; who knows? But I know for a fact that I will never in my life replay it!",1703861765,1704396400,False,2,1,0.403768599033355713,0,True,False,False

beat level --> funny haha before next level -- > repeat x52 times
cave Johnson with moon cancer being any bit sad or funny is just about impossible, how has moon cancer affected him? cave has been insane for 3+ decades, him ranting isn't anything new, him acting crazy isn't anything new. cave's rant is boring and just another piece of string in the LOL RANDOM set of strings of the last 30 minutes, to be followed up with another set of strings made up of LOL RANDOM. wtf happened to valve writing.
Glados in the first game seemed to have a soild reason to say ""funny"" things, a twisted broken ai chatbot reason most of the time but a reason none the less. Mostly to inform test subjects of test parameters, or manipulate chell into coming back to the test area. The only time glados really starts insulting the chell with LOL random humor is the very end of the game after the morality core is destroyed.  6 minutes tops of LOL random balances out with the last 1-2 hours, portal 2 is LOL random its entire length with nothing timeless or even remotely interesting  about it.

I'm making a note here:
Huge success!

It's hard to overstate
my satisfaction.

Aperture Science:
We do what we must
because we can
For the good of all of us.
Except the ones who are dead.

But there's no sense crying
over every mistake.
You just keep on trying
'til you run out of cake.
And the science gets done.
And you make a neat gun
for the people who are
still alive.

I'm not even angry...
I'm being so sincere right now.
Even though you broke my heart,
and killed me.

And tore me to pieces.
And threw every piece into a fire.
As they burned it hurt because
I was so happy for you!

Now, these points of data
make a beautiful line.
And we're out of beta.
We're releasing on time!
So I'm glad I got burned!
Think of all the things we learned!
for the people who are
still alive.

Go ahead and leave me...
I think I'd prefer to stay inside...
Maybe you'll find someone else
to help you.
Maybe Black Mesa?
That was a joke. Ha Ha. Fat Chance!

Anyway this cake is great!
It's so delicious and moist!

Look at me: still talking
when there's science to do!
When I look out there,
it makes me glad I'm not you.

I've experiments to run.
There is research to be done.
On the people who are
still alive.
And believe me I am
still alive.
I'm doing science and I'm
still alive.
I feel fantastic and I'm
still alive.
While you're dying I'll be
still alive.
And when you're dead I will be
still alive

Still alive.

Multiplayer is what everyone plays and its not profitable for companies to make games single-player since they can milk multiplayer games with microtransactions. Im writing this after my first whole playthrough and i will play it again to get all achievements, so i absolutely recommend it if you havent played it. For me it made me appreciate single-player games and i hope it does for you too, i had an amazing time, the jokes are funny, the soundtrack is amazing and the puzzels were doable although confusing sometimes.

620,154921932,76561198090697492,0,81,159,0,159,1653092686,"Portal 2 is one of those very few prestigious games that everyone owes it themselves to play once. The original Portal was a brilliant but short experience with its length and ambition making it feel like a large scale Half Life 2 mod rather than its own game. What it did incredibly well were two things; it pioneered puzzle design in a 3D space with its portals and it nailed the context of being a pee-on test subject being toyed with by malevolent AI. Its narrative may have lightweight, but it was highly compelling for the 2 or so hours you'd spend in the test chambers and in the backrooms of Aperture Science.

Portal 2 blasts Portal 1 out of the water in just about everyway.

its narrative is longer, much deeper, and so much more entertaining. Glados gets reintroduced as the villain as Stephen Merchant's friendly bumbling Wheatley AI core tries to secure you an escape until he gets plugged into Glados' systems and tripping on power sends you and Glados into ruins of the original Aperture Facility. The first Act alone is about as long as Portal 1 was and serves to reacquaint you with the Portal gun, lasers, hard light, and gravity wells and to sorta show you what has happened in the 50 odd years you've been asleep (the Combine Invasion in Half Life and the teleportation of the Borealis being some such events).

Act 2 introduces gel based mechanics. Blue gel makes surfaces and items bouncy, oranges makes you move faster on a surface, and white gel turns a surface into a portalable surface. As you make your way through, you will be guided by recordings of Cave Johnson (JK Simmons doing a sciencey version of J Jonah Jameson) and his assistant Caroline, the personality basis for Glados, along with Glados themself. I won't say more from there, suffice to say the story is frequently hilarious, smart, and compelling.

Co-Op is brilliant as well, having its own sub-narrative featuring Glados after the end of the singleplayer game. Each Co-Op puzzle is challenging and rewarding and also just fun to play with a friend as you each mess with each other along the way.",1704052905,1704052905,True,1,0,0.504424750804901123,0,True,False,False

 The story is top tier and the test chambers are fun yet challenging. The dialogue, voice acting, and sound design are also amazing and give off a very retro arcade vibe.

 In chapter 6 when GLaDOS gets some...aesthetic changes I find myself wishing they gave her more voice lines and had her talk to you more since she becomes very ""close"" to you. Similar to the weapons that talk to you in High On Life.

The gameplay was outstanding with smooth controls and great design. After 9.6 hours I finished the campaign. There were only 2 chambers in the entire game that I needed to use a guide to figure out. The level design is puzzling without being unfair or too challenging. Just when the portal gun starts to get repetitive the game introduces new game mechanics that completely change the way you solve tests. I recommend everyone play this game especially at its low price point. It only costs $10 (USD) and is often on sale for $0.99. There is a new mod coming out for this game that will almost be like a portal 3. This game is so worth it and will always be worth it in my eyes.

This game offers a story rich experience that does not interfere with people who just want to play for the puzzles. It also provides lots of replay ability as the workshop contains many fantastic maps created by other players. This game appeals to both casual and serious players as there is a vast speed running community. The game also contains lots of humour aspects, with Stephen Merchant's voice for Wheatley being a perfect fit for the role.

However, i have heard that Portal 2 can induce motion sickness, as you fly through the air in many sections of the game. so i would be cautious about this game if you are prone to motion sickness in games.

I am 78.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiralling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you.",1703793159,1703793159,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

+ Good campaign
+ Wonderful puzzles
+ It has Coop!
+ Possibility to make custom maps.
+ Level up in graphics is surprising.
+ Has a story!

- The part when you get out of the testing and go around the facility is confusing at many times that I had to look at walkthrough to figure out where to go.

Portal 2 is good level up from the portal 1. It has many aspects that I enjoy, from the wonderful campaign with pretty good story. I enjoyed Wheatly and the comedy that came from him from the beggining to the end. I liked the detail that the backgrounds have changed based on where you were in the campaign. The puzzles were treat to solve and I enjoyed most of them. Like I said before there was a part where you get out of the testing chambers to go around the facility that got at some points really confusing on where to go.
