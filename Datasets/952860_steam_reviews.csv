缺点一个是部分配音有点出戏可能是赶工的缘故吧。另外通关的BGM比较平凡（明明挺多插入曲很好听的），缺少了当初侠客风云传那种剧终BGM高潮响起时热泪盈眶的冲击。

Its is that good if you come with the right expectations.
As of Oct 2022, most bugs previously highlighted are resolved and it is fluid and highly playable.
(I played in Chinese language since I am tri-lingual so no comments on the English translation)

Pros:
+market leading Wuxia sandbox (nothing comes close imo.)
+lots of martial arts (you can regard them as powers, moves or ninjutsu)
+lots of side quests (& while some are chores, a good portion are meaningful) 
+striding on water with high 'qing gong' (aka 'light' 'skill/art') stats is too awesome

Cons:
-you probably need a fair bit of Chinese/Mandarin based Wuxia knowledge to enjoy fully (this is a pro to those who are)
-graphically on the mid to lower end if you compare to games in recent years (although considering the indie grade budget and manpower, versus the price,contents and delivery, this is not shabby to be honest)

Highly recommended!

I've played tale of wuxia and tale of wuxia the pre-sequel recently and I've been looking for similar games. Unfortunately there are not many wuxia or xanxia games on the market, at least ones that are interesting to me.

If I had to compare this one to the two former games form heluo, then I would probably say that even though many aspects have been improved, I enjoyed this one a tiny bit less. 
The big open world is nice, but gets boring and sometimes irritating, because I get the feeling of a wasted time.

Pros:
+ cool leveling system 
+ lots of skill books and there is no limit to how many you can learn. You can master most weapon types if you wish (I focused on fist, sword, blade)
+ open world with many quests and side quests
+ cool companions
+ immersive especially at the beginning
Cons:
- no official english translation. Even though I'm grateful for english mod, there were many issues with it. For example names were inconsistent or text wouldn't fit into textboxes, so it was cut off. Even with this english mod I had to do a lot of guessing
- could have more interactions with party members
-  many cool skills were Yin type, which is harder to raise than Yang. I wish there was some other way to alter between yin/yang instead of skillbooks with limited amount of each qi type, so that I could check out all the skills. Or not implementing this at all.
- bad optimization for and old game
- glitchy

Overall, I finished this game once and I enjoyed it, but I'm definitely not going for a second playthrough - at least not in the near future.

Good game but too many horrible game-breaking bugs, and Steam doesn't allow refund, even though the game breaking bug was discovered 6 hours later on the first day of purchase (and the bug couldn't be discovered earlier because you can't beat the snake place within 2 hours refund policy in advance when your level is too low.",1639287603,1639287603,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False
952860,105230729,76561198039859166,0,7,2332,0,745,1639291732,"I bought this game a really long time ago, but I didn't play it back then since there were complaints about stutters and bugs, Now 3 years after the release, I discovered that after 3 combats in that enemies float in the air after moving and the game is stuck because you can't hit them, and it hanged multiple times when I alt-tabbed from full screen. It also hanged mid-battle. This happened multiple times in a short period of time and I view it as a critical thing that will happen over and over in the game. 

The updates have stopped and it seems like the devs have given up all hope in solving bugs, stutters or adding DLC/content to it, In my opinion, due to its nature as a role-playing game, these bugs immediately stops you from being immersed and makes it very flawed. 

It's really quite unfortunate because the gameplay seems very close to succeed as an Wuxia RPG. You can sprint/leap in a 'flying' motion and scale up cliffs like the Chinese tv shows, act arrogantly or gentlemanly, take the path to become good or evil, though there seems to be the 'fetch' quests problem.

If you have the patience and fortitude to immerse yourself despite the bugs, perhaps you would be able to enjoy the game, but I wouldn't recommend the game otherwise.



Edit: Finished the game and speed rushed overall in order to give a more comprehensive review. Unfortunately, I'm still not recommending the game.



Bugs to take note of if you decide to buy the game:

1) Battle crashes didn't happen again, so it must have been a one-time thing. I also avoided going up/down cliffs/slopes to avoid enemies floating in the air.

2) NPCs can disappear and not appear (and this is not about waiting for a specific hour so that they appear). However, this is easily remedied by going to an inn or opening up a sleeping bag to skip time.

3) Some animation bugs. Models disappearing or stuck in weird poses, glitches. I did finish the game's main quests, so overall the game can be completed


Story and RPG options:

I skipped a lot of text and skimmed a lot content, but there are moments where I'm pleasantly surprised by the quality of how characters interacted with each other. Overall, I think I got my money's worth just going by the story, yet it's frustrating in many places because I don't think the main character did anything worthwhile.

To put it succinctly: Where is skill check in this RPG? 

This game desperately needs a proper New Game+ mode. Books of Dragon could have added new branching storylines or choices due to the way how the plot is set up at the end of the game. But the only thing that New Game+ has is all related to gameplay, which makes it a head-scratcher.

In summary, the RPG choices that you have can be summarized as Good (A) and Evil choices (B). If New Game+ had C and D, it would have been much stronger as a Wuxia RPG.

There are two character behaviors that you can adopt, arrogant or gentleman, but I didn't really dive deeply into these options as I wanted to have a fuller opinion of a completed game.


Graphics:

Should I blame it on unity? This game's color scheme isn't that bad. The day/night system's lighting is quite vibrant/saturated. However, that's about the only praise I can give it.

For all that work on my GPU, the game stutters massively during cutscenes. Characters footsteps jerk all the way, feet sinks into the ground and pops back up as though there's a bandaid workaround to stop them from disappearing all the way down. 

Character models look mediocre, some textures are so bad (rocks, water) that caves and cliffs look same-y, I get lost in cities because everything seems to look the same and the minimap is basically trash. A few quest indicators are off the minimap's mark and I spent hours trying to get to the next section.

World design is in between good and horrific. If you stand at a high place somewhere, the world does look pretty picturesque, but areas like caves and certain mountains made me feel like I'm playing a game way back from 2001.

There hardly seems to be any ambient occulsion. This is a pretty big issue because you're traveling to mountains and caves, and it's also why I said the game looks it's from the early 2000s.

One can compare Unity to Unreal Engine 4. The latter's counterpart, Faith of Danschant, has strong aesthetics, but it's still not AAA gaming level of graphical quality. Still, Books of Dragon isn't particularly good-looking enough for my taste. The MC in particular looks like some generic mob.



Gameplay:

I had a number of conveniences modded in. One was using a trainer, speeding up traveling and increase jumping height so that I can traverse the map quickly, the other was a cheating mod to put in a fast travel item in my inventory.

These three things actually made me feel like I'm a character in the Wuxia (chinese fantasy martial arts) world. If there were a mod to tie in Qing Gong (martial arts based on movements) that affect running and jumping... The default settings makes me feel stifled, especially since there are a lot of fetch quests and map traveling.

Without the fast travel the game would have honestly run my patience down to zero, and even then I feel like the speed isn't fast enough.

The combat system of tactical RPGs hasn't really changed in decades. Here, the characters are allocated Action Points as resources, and they recover them every Turn. These AP allows them to recover HP, attack, and move.

Characters have six categories of unique dispositions. I chose Speed as my initial disposition, and filling up them up gives supplemental bonuses to my attacks, and could be requirements for learning a martial skill.

Damage calculations are quite complicated. Generally, leveling up 内功 (Internal Strength?) and related Weapon Skills multiplied by X Martial Art's based damage will be your basic damage. I think this is a fair number system to mimic the Wuxia books. However, I'm not sure if 内功 reduces damage. But this is a minor thing.

The biggest negative point that the game fail has is the Level Scaling the enemies have. This artificial way of making things difficult for the gamer completely nullifies the point of you being in an Wuxia world. There's just no excuse for this. The MC recovers his martial art skills in a matter of days, so how is it possible that Mob ABC and Boss ABC are always above the MC's level?

Character immersion is completely broken for me. 


Sound:

Music and Voice Actors aren't really something I can review properly. I think this particular section is good. If anything I feel disappointed over the large amount of unvoiced lines.


Conclusion:

I think there's more than enough value in this game to justify the price tag, but I'm highly unsatisfied by the gameplay and insufficient RPGness of the game.",1638639620,1638815422,False,3,0,0.510149598121643066,0,True,False,False

There are some fetch quests, but there are also a ton of storied quests, some of which you get answers to or vague insinuations as to what the full story was. What can really be applauded is that you can often solve a quest in different ways, sometimes this result in failing one quest, but picking up another. The story itself is pretty decent, there are some longer side-quests as well. 

Personally I think that this is the best wuxia-themed game on the market currently, and I have played many. There is a lot of freedom as to when you'll want to begin certain content, and you can traverse and begin quests everywhere from the get-go. Still some of my favourite turn based combat, lots of different skills and synergies with the talent trees. 

There will indeed be npc's who'll be there and gone, a lot of these might be dependent on quest/story progression & day/night cycle, in fact different areas will be subject to less or more cycles, usually you'll see different schedules based on 4 cycles throughout the day. 

Is the game perfect? no, the graphics can be great, you'll have very good textures, and very bad ones, mixed together, or stretched out. You'll have npc's appearing out of nowhere during the beginning/ending of day/night cycles. You'll potentially miss certain skill-books or content by progressing the story too quickly. There is always sun, never rain, or snow(snowy area).  No matter if you play this on easy/general/difficult/purgatory, you'll have to grind to some extent, this can feel quite tedious, but before you know it you're very powerful, if you don't mind grinding, play this on difficult or purgatory, or the game might become too easy. There could have been mini-games as well, which we saw in Tale of wuxia, fishing for example could have been fun.

It is good to keep in mind that this game was developed by a small team, and you can for sure feel the love that went into the setting, thankfully this is wuxia and not xianxia which makes it grounded, but still fantastical. The game world is not that big, but there is a lot to do. It is mentioned that you are in a province on several occasions, this is a great way to explain away why there aren't so many martial arts schools, and why the area is limited. There are guides to be found, I half-recommend using these, but also don't stop exploring, you'll come across secret books or items just fine without. 

This was a follow up of a very old game, that was never translated, but that I know that a fan-translation was being worked on, but which was never finished, It isn't on steam. 

The same studio developed the excellent Tale of Wuxia games, give them a try if you like the genre. As for Path of Wuxia, I personally haven't played it yet, the anime style is a huge turnoff for me as I far prefer what we have seen previously for wuxia games, the setting too does not please me. Why do I mention this? 

Because I sincerely hope that we'll see Heluo Heroes sequel sometime, bigger and better.",1614278757,1614278757,True,15,0,0.671016216278076172,0,True,False,False

If we compare some of the older WuXia games to this one - this is a new height for the genre:
- night & day cycle (different events are triggered)
- deep leveling system
- crafting system
- tones of side quests

and are barely readable, not to mention that sentences don’t fit on screen and get cut-off. 

I am not blaming Lash (author of the translation mod), I think he did as good a job as could be expected with the edited machine translation since I had no problem understanding the quest related information for the most part. Can’t say the same about the story-related nuances though, but it’s not like (the current) official translations for Tale of Wuxia or Pre-sequel (other games from Heluo Studio) are much better either.

Ho Tu Lo Shu would be best described as chinese version of Gothic or Risen with tactical turn-based combat. It provides a similar limited open-word experience, but just like its ""german counterparts"", this game lacks polish. Expect some confusing ladscape/dungeon layouts since there is little variety in textures used as well as awkward platforming and physics that don’t always work as intended. Most frustratingly, the game may fail to load up the quest npc or a mob even when you meet the requirements (quest stage, time of day). This did not happen just once or twice; I’ve wasted a lot of time running around double-checking everything only to come back to the same spot and notice that npc or mob have magically appeared.

The quests themselves feel somewhat small-scale when compared to the Tale of Wuxia or Pre-sequel. You’ll be mostly (not all the time, but mostly) stuck as the errand boy either doing minor fetch quests or chasing chickens/monkeys/other animals (as part of the main story tasks!) up until the late midgame.

So, is there nothing positive at all about this game? There is. Combat. Tales of Wuxia and Pre-sequel system received a massive overhaul. If I had to guess, it was the developer’s primary focus.

The battles now take place in the same location you have actually encountered the enemy instead of a grid hexagon field with generic scenery, but the transitional loading time is still required. Your character’s battle style is fully customizable and no longer limited to a single style like Tales of Wuxia or a few moves like Pre-sequel. Cultivation from Tales of Wuxia also makes a comeback with a few improvements. Styles you obtain are shaped as skill trees that improve your stats or unlock new moves as you learn the corresponding techniques within. Each technique has its own requirements to learn from simply obtaining some EXP to finding a rare herb, which is more in line with the cultivation lore compared to traditional ""level up"".

Ho Tu Lo Shu is not a terrible game per se, it just does not provide the same level of excitement as Tale of Wuxia and Pre-Sequel. I would’ve rated it as ""thumbs in the middle"", but forced to choose between thumbs up or down, I have to place this game into latter category due to its major lack of polish.

have not encountered any bugs after 10 hours playtime. I really enjoyed this game and it brought me the memory of playing the legend of jinyong. I'm really highly recommended you to buy this game, if you enjoy playing jinyong.

still love the turned based game and like that you could build the story based on each decision you made and will develop different story.

keep it up heluo studio! thanks for developing great games for us!

2希望未来增加做任务时的队友对话 增加队友存在感 现在的人物除了跟个人任务有关 招进队基本就是哑巴 这里说的对话不需要太长 各种任务时对其他NPC哪怕简单一句评论 就能大大加分游戏的代入感 证明他或她不是战斗机器 而的确是队友 
3从最早的金庸时就希望制作组重视玩家操作舒适度这一块 这体现在镜头和UI上 这个游戏的室内战斗的镜头处理是最大的弱项 也包括户外有很多树一类遮挡物的处理 这点大幅度拉远视角就能解决 而非要通过修改实现

However, the content of the game is enough to recommend it for any Wuxia lover. The amount of plot, content and characters in here make it more than worthwhile to play. 

This game is the culmination of a generation of effort to make a 3D, open-world, Wuxia themed RPG. It does well in Wuxia, it does well in open world, and it does well as an RPG. 

It's filled with content in every corner, of the non-boilerplate variety. I'll often be running about in the countryside and come upon something related to a minor side quest or character I've never seen before. Though the content amount is a bit weaker to the north of the map. 

The characters you meet and interact with will have plenty of personality and their own intriguing storylines. You have a chance to make real choices which affect the ending you receive and how the world you play in turns out. 

The skills system is the most intriguing I've seen in a Wuxia game. It fits more closely with how I imagine Wugong than any other system I've played before and since. The effects are not top-tier, but fitting for the Wugong and good enough considering this price.

""Wu-Xia"" is a general phrase describing those whom dedicate their lives in practicing martial arts and use those skills toward Just causes, kind of like vigilantes. If you know what ""Wu-Xia"" is, then you'll like this game. Especially if you have played the previous ones. BUT, since it's Heluo's first time creating a 3D Sandbox version of such genre, the game is quite problematic. Consider yourself warned. Now on to the game:

The Good:
-Single Player Wu-Xia World RPG (this alone gets 50% score)
-Turn based Strategic Positioning Combat System
-Several Main Story lines with tons of side quests
-Great character designs, flashy skills animations and tons of styles of arts to aquire
-Still managed to recapture that '80s Wu-Xia nostalgia
-Great replayability

The Bad:
-Only available in Simplified/Traditional Chinese
-Poorly optimized taxing the crap out of even top end rigs
-Weird bugs/glitches sometimes game breaking will make you lose hair
-The so called Sandbox open world is in fact UNFINISHED with borders
-Some of the stories feel too rushed, ended abruptly
-Some Recycled NPC/weapon skins and skills animations
-Bad camera angles during combat giving you eye strains and headaches
-The game is actually unfinished, some NPCs/items/achievements already exist but quests/stories can't be triggered

Ok, while it may seem like there's quite a bit of negatives, the nostalgia means everything to me, and I'm sure the same rings true for many Wu-Xia fans. I miss a good 'ol fashioned Single Player RPG with a vast story and immersive world. In this day and age every studio out there is about MMORPG and micro-transactions. So I'll continue to support Heluo. I'll be buying every single game and DLC they put out. Buy first ask questions later. I want Heluo to succeed and stick around.

Optimization
I have to admit I was quite disappointed when I read the initial review of this game when it first came out, so I waited patiently for the steam version, which was released a month later with multiple patches already in place. My hardware is quite basic (i5, GTX775m, 16GB ram) and I set the graphics to medium quality. Using this set up the game is mostly smooth except for initial loading or large combats. It does get noticeably slower after 3 hours of gameplay though and I think this is related to known issues with over usage of internal memory.
 
Graphics
The other main gripe with the game from the forums is the graphics. It really is not comparable with AAA open world games, however I really think we should not be expecting that with this price range and the small Heluo studio as it is. Having said that I think the character models/textures could be more refined. Some of the lighting effects and environments are nice and the terrain is quite varied. Nevertheless you’ve come to the wrong place if you are here for the eye candy.
 
Bugs
In my playthrough I did not experience any major game-breaking bugs but there are still a few small bugs which can be annoying. Sound is not good and cuts out randomly especially at night. There are no sound for footsteps. These should be fixed (hopefully soon).
 
Story and side quests
This is the main strength of the game, with interesting story line and rich/variable side quests. For me this was enough to distract me from the small annoyances of the game.
 
Combat and role play elements
I don’t mind turn based combat, so this was a plus, though I feel more strategic elements could have been added to the combat system. I thought the kung fu scrolls and the mastery nodes system was quite refreshing and plays out well, and was quite an attractive aspect of the game.
 
Overall I would recommend this to any lover of the wuxia genre. I think the game could be significantly enhanced by future DLCs or community mods (especially if there is official steam workshop support – hint to developer)

The game is really buggy and laggy which reminds me of old Chinese games in the early mid 90’s, but I still enjoy it with the “more” original feel of the story and a couple of mini side missions. The tempo of the battles is quite slow, requiring some repetitive grinding but it is expected for a SLG style of combat. 

I feel Heluo Studio is getting there with game developing and producing, but not quite there yet. The previous games by the studio with the 2.5D camera angle runs quite smooth, but this game just isn’t optimized well. However, I would recommend this game to the die-hard Chinese reading Wuxia fans out there. I never thought of Wuxia as a niche genre with a small market, but there just aren’t enough good Wuxia games out there.

我玩了116分钟的河洛，暂时还是在体验游戏的操作和流畅度，还没有正式进入剧情。


之前河洛刚推出时恶评如潮。虽然youtube第一时间就有玩家的视频，可是流畅度却是卡卡的。前几天我刚开始玩发现游戏还是卡卡的不流畅但是可以接受。怎知道今天我才知道这个游戏根本就没问题！是不是玩家们误会了？让我分享下解决方案！


1）视角令人头晕。
玩家们是不是指不断旋转，不断改变视角的情况？比如视角左右旋转或慢慢下沉？这根本是bug!
我发现只要使用手柄操作就会出现这个问题！就算事后换成mouse + keyboard操作这个视角旋转问题也没有解决！


解决方法就是重新按一次预设操作，问题就马上解决。正常的情况视角是不会旋转而是跟这mouse左右摆动而改变视角，这是一般3D游戏的做法。河洛也是如此！如果诸位发现视角自动旋转就是bug！


2）游戏很卡不流畅
Youtuber的1080Ti都玩得很卡！问题出自哪里？还是一样，手柄！只要使用手柄玩这个游戏就是特别的卡！一旦使用mouse + keyboard 问题就解决！（当然需要 重新按一次预设操作 不然旋转视角会烦死你！


3）画面粗糙不美
我的GTX970 + 16GB RAM，开高特效，1920x1080使用mouse + keyboard玩得非常顺畅，根本就没有问题！只要不碰手柄就没有问题！


对于那些尚在观望这游戏的朋友，我觉得可以入手了！mouse + keyboard完全没有问题！我还不知道玩上2到3个小时会怎样？这个改天再测试！
