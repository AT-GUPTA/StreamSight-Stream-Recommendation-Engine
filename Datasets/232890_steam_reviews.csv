Stronghold Crusader 2


Pros-

#1.The graphics are slightly better than 1

#2.The music seems ok I could not tell it was different from 1 ?

#3.When the enemy lord speaks to you it has a bigger screen pop up than 1

#4.Not having to expand your granary or stockpile was better but also fully unrealistic compared to 1


Cons-

#1.No story 1 did not have a story either but it is a con of both

They should have put a story in all their games or never put one into Stronghold HD so it would not be compared with it

#2.It was better to build a castle in 1 with more options and  they took the draw bridge away :(

#3.When I attacked an enemy castle the gate did not close and their units could get out and fight mine but we could not get in until we destroyed the gate or whatever it was and that was just silly

It is already silly that one melee unit can destroy a castle wall by himself in stronghold games but that just takes it to another level of ridiculous 

#4.No fear factors I do not know why they took these out and that was a bad idea to do that.Treating the peasants really well or bad clearly was a realistic thing and would affect your work and I personally would have copied everything from 1 and and maybe added a few more both good and bad


#5.The peasants don`t speak when you click on them

#6.There is no little video of each type of building like in 1 when you click them it shows a little video  and was cool

#7.There is less civilian life 2 compared to 1. In 1 there is moms with babies and children playing and drunk men and I would have kept and expanded on that not remove it all like they did in 2. In Stronghold HD the lords wife walks around and I do not think she is in 1 or 2 and I would have left her in

I understand the women,kids and drunk men could get in the way in 1 which could be a good reason to remove them from 2 but it was more realistic to have them and it made the castle feel more alive


#8.The combat is clunky at times and I do not consider the combat an upgrade at all


#9.The maps are too small in 1 at times but it is even worse in 2

#10.They removed the say your name feature in 1 and SH HD when you load the game like it would say ""greetings lord jason"" as a random example and I thought that was cool and funny feature to have since no other game I have ever played did that


#11.The voice acting is boring and could have been improved, I am not saying 1 was great but both could of been improved but 2 is worse than 1





The Bottom Line -


Stronghold Crusader 2 just falls flat compared to Stronghold Crusader 1. If you had never played 1 or Stronghold HD than that would make 2 look much better and clearly is a factor in its positive reviews.

If I owned the franchise I would have tried to come up with a game very similar to 1 with better graphics and certain things to try to upgrade it. When the enemy lord video pops up when he talks to you that is an improvement over 1 because it is bigger and the graphics are better.

Some of the other changes they could have copied like the Civilization games and given us as players the option to turn things on and off.

Do you want the mothers,children,drunks and the lords wife or do you want to turn them off?

Do you want fear factor buildings on or do you want to turn them off?

Do you want the peasants to talk when you click them or do you want to turn them off?

Just taking them out and not giving us the option too was just dumb. That is one advantage of Civilization games is they dont assume you will like it their way so they give us the option to pick. Some people pick realistic and some people pick unrealistic but the point is they pick what they want so they like the game more.

If I was you I would pay at most $5 for everything including all the DLC. I paid $15 or something on a big steam sale and I regret it but I loved 1 so much I had to try 2.

If you have never played a Stronghold game than get Stronghold Crusader 1 and Stronghold HD. For all the disappointment in every Stronghold games since those 2 it is a small price to pay for how much I enjoyed them both. As long as you can look past their old graphics than you should love them so see a video of their gameplay.",1591801314,1708476904,False,2,1,0.496183216571807861,0,True,False,False

- Voice acting is abysmal, and I mean REALLY bad. No excuse for that level of voice acting. The voices in Stronghold are better and that was mostly DEVS
- Game doesn't look terrible but has not aged well at all. A lot of the buildings kind of merge together and its hard to distinguish what building is which sometimes. Especially the military production buildings.

British idiots, who do not know how to balance the game and stick to the standards and mechanics that made this game famous among many of us. Crossbow,the most powerful of the units,all other archers are as useful as ashtrays on a bicycles. I love it when I have 30 of them on the tower, and they all shoot the same soldier. The Spearman, in combat pure stupidity, but if a computer sends it at my soldiers, a thrown spear kills on the spot, or takes off half of HP depending on the soldier.it is even so accurate that it takes the archer off the highest tower, but archers can't hit him because he's against the wall, a smart soldier.
Balista, intended to shoot explicitly demolition machinery, if it hits a soldier literally does not even damage him.
I don't even want to write about the cost of building buildings and the amount of resources obtained because it's so stupid that I feel sorry for the space in this comment.

It is sad that the game in this age of graphic possibilities is this bad visually, compared to the details from the old versions of this series, pure zero.

I heard that this game is not even close but I wanted to give it a try since it was on sale.

after playing my first match of the game I can confirm how downgraded and inferior this game is compared to Stronghold crusader 1. a lot of the features from the first game is missing.

there is no overhead view which makes building experience  so bad.

the physics and dynamics of the game troops moving and fighting is embarrassing.

there is building cap where u cannot exceed 66 building. 100 troops cap. 

I just want the developers to understand that it is never about how the game looks like. 
you had an insanely good Stronghold crusader 1 rating on steam which is 10/10 .
couldn't you just enhance that game a bit listening to the community on just fix some of the things, enhance the graphics and release the part 2 of it . instead u made a completely boring and bad game calming that this game is part 2 of the old one.

To me this game doesn't deliver the feeling of ruling a castle: 
- Fortifications are stupidly expensive and are very fragile and do not provide serious advantage over ground troops. Most of the time I ended up making several towers and stairs next to them for high ground and to lure enemy troops to stairs.
- Economy feels just as fragile as the castles are but also very unstable. You constantly have to adjust taxes, rations, masses to not ruin yourself and it's extremely annoying. Goods aren't worth anything, so you're entirely reliant on this. Buildings are very expensive and very unproductive.
- More limits for stronhold! Now your buildings are limited too, along with troops, population and territory! These limits are also much lower than in previous games (much development).

Other cons:
- Poor economy balance makes mercenary troops considerably superior to their crusader counterparts.
- Stupid unit pathing, some units can't even move properly. Assassins are too stupid to properly path through walls. Formation movement behaves progressively dumber the more units are involved.
- Order delays are sometimes very noticeable.
- Unappealing building designs. Most stuff looks same-ey and barely anything catches an eye.
- They managed to make worse videos of AI opponents than in the first game (how even?).
- This game tries to be fast paced too much, there's generally less units involved in the fighting than in any previous stronhold game.

I liked:
- Unit models looks interesting and appealing.
- Very interesting unit types with unique abilities. Shame the balancing cuts most at the root.
- You can choose your colour in skirmish (for stronghold this is wow)
- Music, sound effects and AI/unit dialogues create a very chaotic atmosphere, I loved it.
- Challenge trails.
- Neutral territory (where everyone can build) along with personal territories (where only player builds) improves much on the territory mechanic of stronghodl 2/legends. But they cut out estates :(

It has its advantages and nice ideas done well, but it has also a huge amount of elements that are either mediocre or simply bad. The latter makes it feel sometimes as if with one step forward there had to be two steps back; as if a random feature I like had to be accompanied with at least two other that make the overall experience less pleasant than it could've been.

As a sequel to the legendary Stronghold Crusader, this game is underwhelming. Enemy Lords lack the charm of the original ones. AI is better than in its predecessor (Stronghold 3), but it's still bad enough to affect the whole experience in a negative way. Basically, the AI cheats in this game with miraculously rebuilding its walls, despite having no stone, or maintaining its population and recruiting new units over and over again, despite having an empty granary stock. It's totally a bummer not only limiting the amount of possible siege strategies that may be used, but most of all forcing players to more or less use the same, rather basic tactic for every Lord - to just breach the wall as fast as it is possible and to attack with spamming swordsmen. It shouldn't be an issue at all while playing mutliplayer, although I'm more into playing single player mode, so I feel it was important to place emphasis on its shortcomings.

Speaking about AI Lords, I should rather call them as Rulers, since there are female Rulers available in Stronghold Crusader 2, which is a very nice addition. About the new Rulers and the recurring ones, I'm neutral towards them. In most of the cases they are different to Lords from the previous Crusader, but it doesn't mean they are automatically good or bad because of that. There is a nice variety of their designs and dominant tactics for each of them. Both elements are either being taken right from the first Crusader game (like the Wolf and the way AI plays as him), or reminding of some of Lords from the previous game (those that didn't make it to the sequel directly by their name and original designs, but their tactics are still alive, just applied to a different character). 

It's a pity that there are so many Rulers requiring the respectful DLCs to be available in the game. Those DLCs are not expensive and add exclusive missions related to said Rulers... but still, I think it's a little bit too many characters treated like that, or rather - there are too few Lords available right away in the base version of the game.

On a bright side, I was worried that the lack of the moat feature would make the game less fun by a huge margin. I was wrong, because at least in my case I haven't felt the need to either see the moat or build it myself during any mission. New special units, dedicated to boost morale or healing, are also interesting additions enriching gameplay with new elements allowing to come up with a bigger variety of tactics.

Stronghold Crusader 2 is clearly an improvement over its predecessor (Stronghold 3). When it comes to castle building and overall stability of this game, Stronghold Crusader 2 is vastly superior, even though it was released years after Stronghold. That being said, it doesn't mean that it has fixed all of the issues from Stronghold 3. Pathing is still far from ideal, even though it's been improved; units act smarter on the battlefield, but still it's not hard to see them acting weird all of a sudden.

With all of that being said, I can't say this game is not entertaining. I have fun while playing it, even without putting a blind eye on all of its cons, even with getting moderately frustrated if they make the game more annoying than hard. If there was an option to make a neutral review, I'd have gone for it. But there is not any, I will just say this: Stronghold Crusader 2 is not perfect, but it's really enjoyable despite its shortcomings.",1699099411,1699099411,True,20,0,0.721892893314361572,0,True,False,False

There are two types of Stronghold games. The main stronghold games are castle builder sims. You have limited control over the castle beyond placing buildings and that's for a specific group of people.

But Stronghold Crusaders is a different type of game. It's an RTS, with unique mechanics and strong control over your castle and troops. They made a million Stronghold games, and so when they finally said they would make a new Stronghold Crusader game I preorder the game as I have hundreds of hours in Stronghold Crusader.

But unfortunately, they lied about pretty much everything during development. They took away everything good and unique from Stronghold Crusaders and just gave us another regular Stronghold game under the name of Crusaders. It's not an RTS.

If you like the regular Stronghold games, you'll probably like it. If you want an RTS, go and get the Stronghold Crusaders HD option instead.",1696586010,1696586010,False,5,0,0.523582100868225098,0,True,False,False

- No ships or naval combat.
- Building space is limited. -> you can only build within your tiny borders
- Maximal building count is limited. -> no big castles possible. not enough stones to build castle in the beginning.
most of the time I end up playing in some sort of ruins with 1-2 Towers and 3 wall pieces.
- Maximal Units count is limited. -> If you happen to collect some coins after a few hours to build an army, then you will get surprised that your unit limit is already exausted with city defense archers.
Assaulting an enemy castle with 10-20 units is not fun and takes too long. Some units way too expensive (Templar Knights +Stables).

Cons:
- Only 1 ressource drop off point and only 1 unit recruitment point means, your units need to walk very very very long distances to achieve something. (Swordsman too slow, Sargeant at Arms too slow -> a snail was faster than my units)
- Story not existing. Randomly connected maps need to be finished to unlock next ""Skirmish Trail"".
- Learning Tutorial is lackluster and leaves much to be desired. Youtube videos were more helpful. Ingame unit info are only vague discriptions of what the units should be doing, not of what they actually do or their stats. (how much HP?, how much armor?, how much movement speed?) -> hidden cost of units with armor and weapons needed (cannot be crafted in most missions due to no iron deposits near your base). You end up playing with the same few units which only cost gold.
- random game crashes (2 times when my granary got destroyed). But most of the time game is stable.

You place down a few buildings then spawn in 50 Archers and rush your first enemy so you don't have to fight two or more fronts. Then you place down a bit of a wall, cramp as many archers up there as possible, so your enemy can't overrun you, then you build up an army of roughly 100 knights, and overrun the last enemies.

The function of digging trenches has been removed.(This is the feature that I find most interesting)

Also, there are some instances that I'm not sure if they are bugs, but it seems like archers are less likely to attack when enemies get close to the walls.

[h2]In depth[/h2]
There's too much I dislike that it has soured me on what I [i]do[/i] like about this game. Unit abilities are a nice addition to your arsenal of strategies. I like that trebuchets can be packed and unpacked. The campaigns are like the first Crusader: short and barebones, but still challenging. I like the small touch of having sheep farms instead of pigs when playing as Muslim. And this is the first Stronghold game that has healers. Unfortunately, they can't heal the damage done by the game's design. 
	
Building castles in Crusader 2 feel almost childish, like you're making them in a sandbox. I can't believe I'm saying that about a Stronghold game! Stairs are too large and don't look good. Instead of being on towers, siege engines are now mounted on wooden platforms that can somehow stay stable at that height. And don't get me started on the walls. In SH2, they cost more, but are immune to regular troop attacks. Crusader 2 took that away and said f*** you. Here, walls don't come cheap, yet the enemy can demolish them at the drop of a turban. What's the point of building a castle, then? It's not like we get a large variety of towers or traps to choose from.

Other aspects have been changed for seemingly no reason. No more siege towers and laddermen, so there goes one of your options for sieges. No more tanners. Iron used to be valuable. Weapon workshops only produce one thing because... streamlining? But this is bad design because being able to switch production [i]is[/i] useful. Late-game, when you have less of a need for archers and spearmen, you can switch to crossbows and pikes instead of replacing your workshops. What, did they think players are too stupid to click an extra button? 

And why change the popularity system? It worked fine in earlier Strongholds. If it goes down, your popularity decreases gradually, so you have time to adjust. Now whenever you see red, you have to take care of it immediately or your peasants start leaving. It gets distracting when you're supposed to be defending or laying siege.

The graphics don't seem to have gotten much of an upgrade compared to Stronghold 2. Things look a bit bright and gaudy, a far cry from the tastefully drawn landscapes of the original. In-game models are basic. I would give this a pass if it meant better performance, but sadly that isn't the case. The UI and 2D art is not bad, but could be better. Using Papyrus as your main font is just... no. The CGI rarely looks good. Richard (the guy on the cover of the store page) actually looked better on the cover of the OG Crusader.

Worse, they replaced the original voices for the Rat and men-at-arms from Legends, and the difference is night and day. The new lines sound like they're reading from a script, lacking character or distinctiveness. Overacting has been a signature of Stronghold since the first game. While characters tended to one-note and underdeveloped, they were still memorable for having unique voices and punchy delivery. They even removed the peasant lines. That's how un-Stronghold this game has gotten.

And instead of improving the AI, they cheat and spawn troops out of nowhere. At least Crusader Extreme lets you destroy the outposts to stop the relentless enemy hordes. Assassins have bugged movement. The occasional lag and crash bring this game down further. 

It's such a shame because I wanted to like Crusader 2. I thought it would be a faithful recreation of the original Crusader in 3D, or even Stronghold 2 in the desert. Instead, I got a slightly better Stronghold 3.",1691391566,1691391674,False,2,0,0.478347152471542358,0,True,False,False

My biggest issue with the game, is it takes you 20 mins to setup your econemy, even with + and - to adjust speeds, wood cutters who take up to 2 mins, to cut down a tree, return the log to lumber yard/woodcutters hut and then back to storage bay to make the wood useable, takes so long. wood needed for everything, in any stronghold game, you tend to spam woodcutters, they got it right in stronghold 2/3 and legends then to take such a huge backstep. woodcutters use to produce 8 woodcutters, who bring back 8 lots of 20 (80 wood). now you have spam woodcutters again. This design flaw was okay in 2001, 2003 stronghold 1 and orginal crusdsaer but why revert back to this. It MASSIVELY LAGS the econemy down by as most buildings require 25-200 wood to make, and really slows progress at the start of every campaign match.

Fun for a bit till you realise that no tactics apart from turtling, building up a massive force then steamrolling the AI works. I get that AI's cheat in games but this sucks a the joy out of it. Their economy is basically for show while your is a brutal struggle. 
So no targeting farms or food production to slow or halt their population grow. AI pretty much does not need pops to build an army they just spawn it.
No resource denial to limit access to weapons\building materials. They just buy it with their pretty much unlimited gold.
Maybe kill their gold supply then. Nope they get it straight in to their bank account.
So only thing you got is wall up, build a tower fill with archers. hope you can quickly destroy their catapults that they can make for free. Seemingly ignoring the build area rules that you have to abide by (Have had siege camp spawned in my base, under troops and behind my walls multiple times) Then train a lot of strong boi's then waddle over, kill their lord.

- The graphics are not as good as some other games, but they are still decent.
- The game's multiplayer mode is the main focus, and it is where the game truly shines.

Pros:
Combat is well balanced.  Most troops have a real use, so fights are pretty interesting.
Economy has enough depth to be interesting but not too much to be annoying.

Cons:
Terrible performance.  I've got a fairly new gaming laptop and even min settings causes my computer to struggle.  Pretty sad for such an old game.
Online play isn't terribly active anymore.  There are enough randoms to find games if you want to, but you can't be too picky.
AI is weak.  Even the strongest AI opponents are a joke in spite of cheating resources.  Can still be fun to fight a whole bunch of them though.

But a mass of soldiers forms a blob of incisive power that can cut a swath of blood and destruction across the countryside in whatever direction you see fit. Stronghold Crusader 2 embraces this blob warfare, offering a plethora of different units you can choose from to form your attacking force while your personal castle--the Stronghold series' signature element--hopefully stays safe from harm. But though its parts come together to form a solid strategy game, the uninteresting options at your disposal never raise the game above being one where opposing blobs crash into each other until one splatters.
Stronghold Crusader 2 puts you in the shoes of either King Richard's or Saladin's forces during the Crusades, as you square off against the other in self-contained battles raging across the desert landscape. The goal is the simplest one in strategy game history: defeat the enemy Lord and take his castle. But lest you think you're merely expected to churn out soldiers and crash them into the opposition, the game requires you to establish an intricate economy so you can actually afford these soldiers and build structures that will let you make different kinds of units. So far, so familiar.
Where the game gets a bit more interesting is when it asks you to attract people to your castle to live and work. You start out with a set population that increases as you become more popular with your subjects. You can make them happier by decreasing taxes (even going so far as outright bribing them), increasing their rations, or building them inns and places of worship so that they can drink and pray. Likewise, you can adjust consumption in the other direction to conserve resources and gain more gold, but you'll be less popular as a result. These concerns are controlled with a convenient panel that lets you change values and tells you the popularity bonuses or penalties you get from each adjustment. Tying popularity and population growth to troop production gives the game a simulation element, and lends the flow of your economy extra texture. At the same time, the fact that you only need to keep track of one statistic ensures that the sim portions don't bloat and consume the rest of the game.

One of the standout features of Stronghold Crusader 2 is the sheer scope of the game. There are multiple factions to play as, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. The campaign mode is lengthy and challenging, and there's even a multiplayer mode if you're feeling up to the task.

The game's graphics are nothing to write home about, but that doesn't take away from the overall gameplay experience. There's something satisfying about watching your archers take down a group of enemy soldiers, or seeing your walls hold up against a battering ram.

That being said, the game isn't without its flaws. The AI can be frustratingly dumb at times, and there are some balance issues that can make AI overpowered.

Overall, I would say that Stronghold Crusader 2 is a solid entry in the real-time strategy genre. It's not going to blow anyone's socks off, but it's an enjoyable game that offers a good amount of content and challenge. If you're a fan of the genre, it's definitely worth a look.",1671975646,1677271718,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Boring, tedious, feels like a chore.
Everything is laggy, buggy, clunky.

Feels like a Blender project.

Everyone uses the same economy tactics to gain as much gold as possible.
The game becomes a job, making you play the same way everytime or you are screwed.

The combat phase is so awful, it alone will make you uninstall the game.
Most of the maps are so small, you can see your enemy from the base screen position.
Some units have ridiculously long shooting distance making it unreal to reach them, by that time your buildings or troops will be destroyed.
The castle you were building for an hour is easily destroyed either by ninjas or by a couple of catapults.

They didn't even make a proper multiplayer for this game.
Not only you are not able to play a campaign with your friends, they just give you some garbage deathmatch multiplayer maps and that's it.

Good luck finding at lest one opponent to play a game.
And even after the start you will disconnect because of constant crashes and desyncs.

The whole gameplay is not rewarding, everything you do counters by some cheesy mechanic and everything you try to accomplish is either useless or eventully will decay, because there is no real RTS elements in this game.
Everything is predetermined by the economy tactics and by sequence of troops hiring.

It looks ugly. Even on 'ultra'.
The mechanics are clumsy. Archers even have to be micromanaged onto the towers.
Tower weapons won't even fire without orders.
All the charming little touches of the old Stronghold, like peasant animations, voice lines, children and mothers are gone from the game.
Walls can be broken down by peasants with wooden clubs.
There is no campaign or storyline.

Why devs are serving to gamers sh*t like this ? Why they cant just reskin it with old AI ? Its joke that old game have so much better AI.

Ofc I am not gonna only hate this game, there are some good new things, like if you are playing longer game and you need to have bigger storage or granary, you dont need to build like 50x same building.

So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join.

Neither of those is the case here. The walls are nothing but a decoration, slowing the enemy for at best 15 second if he doesn't know what he's doing. This game isn't about building castles, cause you have nothing to build nor your fortifications hold any practical value. This game isn't about lying a siegie - cause if castles are castles only allegedly, then siegies are siegies only by name as well. What is this game about then? Obviously not about economy, cause saying that this aspect of the game is ""lacking"" would be a grevious understatement. My best guess is that its about attacking the other guy other with different units, until you and your friends decide you've had enough and decide to uninstall the game the next day. Notice that I said ""attacking the other guy"" - because if you want this game for singleplayer, I genuinely don't even know what to tell you. This game has no ""AI"", it has just some poor excuse for a cheap script 16yo could do for his IT homework assignment. The computer uses no tactics in attacks, nor is even defending himself from yours. You can send everything you've got and dance naked on the place where his left walls 'used to be', but he'll stay stubborn in keeping his units on the other side, cuz idk, maybe after killing his lord you might want to go destroy the other wall too for some reason. The ""AI"" spawns units (Not recruits them, ""spawns"" - cause they don't use up any resources, they appear out of thin air. The Stone Quarry you seen him build? Don't fall for it, its only a decoration, he doesn't use stone.) and then just clicks on your castle. Thats it. The whole game, starting from the defence, attack, tactics, resources/""economy"", finishing on the ""AI"" - it is all an illusion. Bunch of graphics and cheap code put together trying to full you that there's something going on. I loved the first Stronghold, I enjoyed first Crusader, I spent countless hours playing Stronghold 2, but hell this is below any level of what should be socially acceptable as a game.

Pros:
- Brings back nostalgia.
- Better graphics compared to Stronghold Crusader. kinda*

Cons:
- 150 Rangers vs 1 Lord. Time to kill = 30mins+ (very fast game speed) ridiculous
- Selected a group of unit and commanded to attack a unit but they either attack walls or go back to formation turning their backs while being shot at. 
- Assassins stops for 2 seconds after clicking to attack and sometimes doesn't. (What were you thinking Assassin? You have only 1 job.)
- Story missions seem to be rushed and not designed well. 
- AI target prioritization is trash and most of the time range attack misses. 
- Healers are useless.
- AI siege spawns anywhere in the map even on there are structures in the area. 
- Ballista does zero damage bug.
- Crossbow shoots across half of the map bug.
- Knights on foot cant go up and attack unit on the tower.

To start positive i like story missions, random events, new buildings, achievements (that you can do without buying DLCS anyway) and AI lords Slave king and Sultana are well made. Sadly that is about everything good i can say about it.

Most of little details that made Crusader awesome were removed and for money paid you will get only half of the game and to get the rest of the lords and content you will need to buy all DLCS almost doubling original price. AI lords are not bound by any economy rules and build walls without stone or spawn soldiers without barracks. Certain units unless manually controlled just dont know what to do and rest of them sometimes just decide to ignore orders and do whatever they want or bug somewhere. Many things just don't make sense like mounted units unable to attack buildings, certain ranged units unable to do volley fire or tower ballista miraculously working itself. There are no spoils of war and siege warfare is weird, because some buildings are destroied in single hit other are almost indestructible meanwhile weakest unit can survive several boulders, unless they are positioned on the wall that is one shot. Overall it is a big mess and considering game should be mainly focused on battles, i can't really recommend.",1666050924,1666050924,False,17,1,0.692903399467468262,0,True,False,False

[u]What I liked[/u]
-The graphics I think are fine. The updated models look ok and as much as I would like to be nostalgic, I do appreciate newer models. 
-Auto trading on marketplace is nice
-For challenging skirmish maps you get a grace period. This is a nice way to let me set up without being overwhelmed instantly. 
-Candlemaking is free for resources and is a nice way to boost popularity. 

[u]What I did not like[/u]
-Frankly some units are just way too strong for their cost. Conscripts are way too powerful and can absolutely nuke your buildings. This costs the enemy AI nothing to produce and I need to invest heavily in defences for the cheapest units. Doesn't feel much like a siege. The story is the same with the slave king. He spams these cheap units and they take a while to chip down even with crossbows early on. Late game they're not a problem due to volume of units. 
-Unit routing seems broken. You will tell them to go on top of a tower and some will just leave the castle and go outside and die. Sometimes if you tell them to attack the enemy lord they will prioritize chipping away at the wall. There seems to be no rhyme or reason when they do this. 
-Costs in this game are way too high. The mill costing 200 wood is ridiculous. 100 would be much more fair. Others have mentioned and I agree, if you aren't starting with 1000 gold, the early game just feels like an immense struggle to get going. 
-Towers feel weak, like, they should cost 1/5 of what they do as they provide zero assurance the enemy will be held back. 2 catapults can destroy a tower in no time flat and if enemies are close you can't repair it. 
-Archers in towers seem to struggle to pick unique targets. You'll have 40 archers sometimes attacking the same unit which means the rest of the horde runs free to the wall to begin breaking it down. 
-The game stutters frequently. Seems like it's autosaving but it locks the game up for about 3 full seconds at a time. My hardware is good with a 1080ti. 
-The farmers have this weird lag before doing anything. You'll see them collect their crop and then just kind of stand there for a second or two. Then when they get to the granary they do the same thing before entering and depositing the goods. 
-I could do with dropping off of supplies being faster. Feels slow to unload stone/wood from the workers. 
-It seems like iron is never available on skirmish maps. They refuse to give the player any iron so I just spend money buying it which feels bad. 
-If you place a building incorrectly, sometimes the workers get stuck, even though the game said the orientation was fine. This is a bit frustrating as I have to delete the building then. 

[u]Overall[/u]
I think the game really just needed more effort put in by the developers. Some of the bugs are really annoying with units and really impact my enjoyment of the game. I think they really need to think long and hard when they make a new game like this as some of their decisions really detracted from the experience. I loved the first stronghold crusader and they had the right idea with this, they just executed it poorly. I don't think I'd recommend this game even at a steep discount.",1665939641,1665939641,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I've logged thousands of hours in the original Stronghold Crusader, I'm scratching my head wondering how a dev can mess up this badly.

What are these game mechanics? My archers have the high ground, they're literally in a tower and on top of castle walls, yet they get shot down by attacking archers while mine just stand there doing nothing, seriously? If this is a feature, I hope whoever came up with it has stopped smoking whatever they were smoking at the time. How can two opposing teams of archers, at the exact same distance from eachother, with one group having the high ground, lead to the lower team being able to shoot the ones having high ground, yet not vise versa? I'm baffled honestly. Instantly uninstalled when I saw this trash happening.

I was a particularly big fan of the unit formations feature. This feature makes siegeing enemy castles somewhat more fluid as trebuchets and archers are able to be surgically placed to fire on fortifications. I also enjoyed the addition of healers to the mercenary camp. Being able to heal a group of high tier cavalry and reuse them again and again added a new playstyle that I adopted and thoroughly enjoyed.

The castle sim aspect of the game was fun to relearn, although I was surprised fear factor had been completely removed from the game.

While the individual animations for units were not quite as charming as the original, I still enjoyed some of the quirks, such as crossbowmen pointing off the top of towers at approaching armies.

Additionally, something I am extremely impressed by and appreciated as somebody with slow internet is the game download size being under 4GB.

For me, the weakest part of the game was the AI lords' messages. I found some to be downright cringeworthy (special mention to the pig here... what was he on about!?), if these had been made to the same standard as the original it would have significantly improved the immersion. The original had so many quotes and frankly bombastic voice acting that I remember so fondly.

Overall I enjoyed the game a lot, and felt it was well worth the £10 I paid on sale incl. all DLC. It was a fun challenge to obtain 100% of the steam achievements.

Graphically this certainly isn't the best looking game on the market, but it still is a great improvement over any previous Stronghold titles and honestly, no one plays these games for the graphics.
Far more important is the gameplay, which is simply Stronghold-perfection. You have a lot of different missions, that require a variety of different approaches. Some of them are quite easy, some are insanely hard. 
There are four small campaigns, which try to give some sort of story. They are fine, but nothing too special.
Where this game really shines is, like the first game in the series, the skirmish trails and the custom skirmishes.
So this is not a game for people who need a story, but for people who need purely good gameplay.
The characters you fight are also quite varied and present you with different challenges, since each of them builds different castles and builds different units.

There is of course still room for improvement. A little more variation in terms of buildings and especially for the arabian units would have been nice.
There is also the issue of performance since the start. It isn't as bad as it was and it is certainly playable, but it isn't perfect.

Pro:
+ Good building gamplay
+ Good unit and fighting mechanics
+ graphically fine
+ different challenges, where you always need to think before you act

Con:
- not enough variety for arabian units
- performance not always perfect

In the end you have a nearly perfect RTS game for what it wants to be.

But if you're like me, grew up playing Stronghold games, and are on the verge of buying this just on that fact alone, stop and go look into the changes that have been made between this and the OG Crusader. In my opinion, those changes are not for good. If you're looking to get a prettier, shiner version of the original game, just know that it comes at the cost of things like the simple in game map editor. Moreover, as much as I love the older games, it is disconcerting to pay almost full price for a game that still heavily recycles minor things like troop dialogue and even certain map designs while not adding much to the actual content of the previous games.

Stronghold Crusader 2 feels week in comparison; the graphics are really not that good, story is weird and gameplay overall kinda sucks. 

I think i speak for most when i say that the community just wants more content for Stronghold Crusader. Keep the same graphics since its way smoother than the new ones. Just add some buildings, troops, new opponents and a new story line, and i guarantee it will do better than all these newer games. Now it just feels like FireFly Studios are pumping out new titles for the sakes of it, without caring for their best game.

If you're new to Stronghold, dont buy this, it sucks, dont buy warlords, it sucks even more, buy Stronghold 1 and Stronghold Crusader to have a good time ^^

So I picked up Stronghold Crusader 2 a while back, and it got me hooked. I actually found it to be quite challenging despite being just normal difficulty, but in a good way. The last map on the non-dlc skirmish is absolutely brutal, I almost cried. 

I just started the DLC content which I'm excited about. There are some things that I do miss from the original Stronghold Crusader, for example ability to dig moats, and the fear factor for the lord. I liked that you could increase speed with fear, it was an interesting dimension to the game.

Only complaints are archers all focusing on the same single targets, gold being a bit too tedious to gather unless you use mods, game does feel more arcadey in that its more simple than the original Crusader. I also ponder why it omitted siege towers and ladders. I also find it a bit silly that each weapon needs its own shop vs in the original where maces/swords and crossbows/bows were made from the same respective shops.

AI does well with defense, but their offense tends to feel soft, even the more difficult ones like Wolf, Saladin, and Richard. I do kind of wish there was a custom ai behavior mod where you can create your own AI lord and make it easy or hard as well as manage what troops, resources, crops, and siege weapons it uses. Would be a fun way to both famliarize ones self with the game or create an extreme challenge aside from creating custom maps where you can decide what resources/crops can be made where.

Updated: This game is still a broken piece of crap after trying it again: It jitters, lags, and glitches. Sometimes your troops will not know how to fill a perfectly flat spot on top of a giant tower, as well as your peasants will pause for no damn reason when carrying out their duties, thus giving your AI enemies a huge advantage over you in that THEIR peasants don't seem to randomly break half the time. I have a powerful machine and there is no excuse for this glitchy nonsense, none what so ever, it is a sign of poor programming. 
Not to mention the horrible game balance: the ballista towers used to counter enemy siege engines are expensive, slow to fire, easily destroyed, and do hardly any damage when they actually live long enough to hit a target. Meanwhile the enemy will send massive platoons of catapults at your castle that turn your stone fortifications into rubble in a few volleys, and the only good way to counter this spam is to send an expensive group of knights out there to kill them in melee. Firefly studios are the biggest bunch of idiots when it comes to trying to encapsulate how effective stone castles are, they have turned it into a joke. In real life, during the middle ages, castles were so effective (and so strong) that sometimes a small group of only twenty men could hold off against hundreds. Not in this game, no no, your walls give you no significant advantage, they crumble easily to a few boulders and offer no protection for your missile troops that can be easily picked off by the enemy missile troops. This game is a cartoon, and while the previous iterations of the SH were also cartoony, they at least had a much better balance (The ballistas to counter siege engines were much cheaper and could actually fire at a decent enough speed. Not to mention being on top of a tower gave them an armor bonus against ranged attacks).
Economy: Food is basically go bread or go starve. There is no point in building any other food chain besides wheat > flour > bread. The other farm types (apples, cheese, meat) are utterly under-powered and cannot produce enough to keep your peasants fed even on normal rations. So one must ask, WHY even have those type of farms available? What's the point? 
Wood costs: Its amazing how much wood it takes to build basic economic buildings and yet you are fighting out in the desert. You will have to build an army of wood cutters just to get enough wood income to get your economy started, and because time is of the essence, you might even have to turn in all of your starting gold for more wood just to get more wood cutters. Pathetic.


The last quality game this company has made was Stronghold 2, anything after that is a waste of money.

In middle age economy, was candles that important :D? 12 years passed and still muslim sultans are building churches. And there are some new units. They are just too absurd or too op. i.e. if you stack nice amount of whirling dervishes, when you breach the walls of the castle, you just right click to the king and dervishes go and kill whatever there is on the kings building. And we have one granary, one stockpile, and smaller farm buildings. WHY? Why did you need to simplify things that much? We dont have engineers, dogs, traps, digging moats, and many other things anymore. WHY?! And you didn't even bring what we most needed in the first game, bigger maps. Maps are still too small to play with friends and stack huge armies and watch an enormous battle. And characters looking worse compared to the base game. Actually most of the things are looking worse than the base game. Only good thing about graphics in this game is, models are 3D. Thats it.

- You can auto buy/sell resources now
[b] Cons: [/b]
- Build limit, played with my friends and we could only place 60 buildings max. That alone made it unplayable
- Archers not shooting people attacking your walls most of the time
- Takes insane amounts of food production to feed your people, feels like double as much as in Crusader 1
- Out of all the mercenaries they buffed, it was freaking slaves. They take like 5 arrows to kill now
- Graphics don't look that nice most of the time, unable to change view to remove walls/lower walls like in Crusader 1 to help build your castle
- Random AI glitches
- Horse archers nerfed to complete uselessness now
- Alt-Tabbing out of the game causes severe graphic bugs when you tab back into the game

If you want a fun RTS game, this one is good. So you should play it. Unless you are familiar with other Stronghold offerings, in which case, this probably gives nothing new and a few of the downsides may be dealbreakers.  Overall, it's a decent, albeit unpolished at times, RTS that falls probably somewhere 1/2 to 1 standard deviation above average in terms of quality. 

[h1] The neutral/can go either way:  [/h1]

- This is like Stronghold Legends in that the depth is greatly reduced as far as castle management compared to past main entries in the Stronghold series. This is good for combat focused players, and this does seem to be a more combat oriented game. For those who like more peaceful games and micromanaging the castle's economy and quality of life, you'll find little here. 

- Related to the above point, but it's worth pointing out you have no control over what and how much your estates send to you. You can build resource gathering / processing buildings in your estates but you can't tell it ""deliver 50 candles continuously"" for example. At least, if you can, I have failed to figure it out. 

[h1] The good: [/h1]

- The market has auto-buy and sell! 

- The graphics are decent. Not great, but not ugly. 

- The overall gameplay is fun. Not spectacular, but fun.  

[h1]The cons: [/h1]

- In Stronghold 2 and Stronghold Legends the map could be rotated using the Q and E keys. Now you have to hold down Ctrl while pressing A or D to rotate. If you want to rotate a building before placing it you have to hold down shift while pressing A or D. This sounds really minor, but when you actually play the game you'll find it's a bit annoying. 

- Wood gathering happens too slowly compared to stone gathering. This leads to an over abundance of stone in the stockpile at times.

- Your peasants seem to have a larger appetite than in other games. Even on maps with abundant grasslands (in this game farms must be placed in grasslands) the granary seems to run low constantly. Tip: Use the market to autosell excess stone and auto-purchase food and wood. 

- Units that are walking to a destination sometimes just stop along the way. This is really annoying if you are sending reinforcements across a large map to a captured estate, to the enemy's castle, etc. 

- If you play as the Arabic faction, most of your troops still sound British. This totally breaks the immersion. What's stupid is the mercenary tent allows you to train specific Arab archers that have Arabic speech, but if you train regular archers in the barracks the still say the same, ""Our arrows will sing!"" , ""Our strings are waxed!"" sound bites we've heard since the first ever Stronghold game. Why not at least make them have the same phrases in Arabic as the mercenary market counterparts? That's just lazy game design. 

- When setting up a skirmish match it's more limited in how you can set up the positions of everyone. Unlike Stronghold 2/Legends, you can't have estates pre-assigned to a player. Also, you cant really change the starting position of your castle estate unless you are on a 3+ player map. You drag your icon on the map to swap its position with another player. However, if the map only has two positions for castle estates you just can't drag the icons around for some reason. I'm curious to know if anyone else has found this to be the case or if there's something idiosyncratic going on with my installation or computer. 

- The accuracy of the pointer's position on the map can be a bit wonky when you are trying to repair or erase bits of castle wall. Sometimes you have to rotate the map to get your cursor in just the right place. This makes this simple task much more work than it should be at times.

- The map editor is god awful. It's no longer something accessible  in-game. You have to download it from the tools under your steam library as a separate program. It's slow to load, often freezes when loading large or extra large maps, and has no mini-map to let you have an eagle's view of the entire map (so no seeing estate boundaries for the whole map at once!). Furthermore,  I don't think you can do simple things like place water on top of an elevated area. When you place a river or pond it will sink the elevation down to the default on that spot and elevating it again just makes the surrounding dry land rise. Yet the editor includes a waterfall. What's the point if water can't be placed on an elevated bit of land? Also, you have to manually tell the map where units can't walk and buildings can't be placed using the paths tool. Otherwise you will have peasants walking through rivers and enemies walking up cliffs. This wasn't necessary in Stronghold 2 or Legends. All this really drains the fun out of making custom maps.

They took Crusader 1 and made it worse.
There's not a single thing here that is done better than a game from 20 years ago, that you can routinely get on sale for next to nothing.

They haven't even addressed the frustrating elements of the original. Lords have been beefed up even more, and it's harder to build a sizable army, so you end up in situations where the war was won 30 minutes ago, and you're just waiting to amass an army large enough to finish off an opponent with absolutely no chance of winning. 

Stone walls take much more stone to build now, which I initially liked because it makes having a large castle more of an accomplishment, but the walls fall down just as quickly as in the original game, so the end result is just a game less focused on castle-building, the one thing that makes it unique.

The AI has become markedly worse. Some of this is by design, which is even harder to forgive. To nerf fire ballistas, they've been patched so they won't attack on their own anymore. That was the best idea they had. Not making them weaker, or making better methods to counter them, just making the AI too inept to defend themselves. Overall units are just generally much harder to move precisely compared to the originals.",1641180507,1641180507,False,2,0,0.512411355972290039,0,True,False,False

you can see the troops fighting and you can control them completely flawless .
the graphics aren't bad for this old game
however i wish the game had these options
- fullscreen borderless 
- better multi core processing for more fps
- better characters texture
and the gameplay is almost flawless except some bugs and minor tweaks
the usage of food by people is A LOT it needs to be lower
what i would like to see is mostly in multiplayer
first of all better servers are necessary for less lag and more than 4 players
second of all the building is very limited in multiplayer (from 200 to 80~)
there is not a complete wiki for the game like it doesn't show how much candles each producer produce.
you cant move granary without losing your stuff and you cant move your stockpile witch is annoying .
one of the other annoying features is that you cant see where the building path is blocked and it needs to show us exactly where the blocking path is.
for a 2022 game, it is a little bit overpriced and it needs to be lower.

There are some points are unneeded like I can't place some buildings and red because an enemy solder is near even I am winning and seems buggy, even with its good look still hard to control and see where can I click on the control panels like buildings, have a mercy on us I took whole 1 min just looking at the building and read its name to understand what is its goal? Beside, Icons of buildings seem have mistake like industries why their icon is a tree?

I am not sure it is correct or not, you cancelled the ability to the army climb walls and towers by gates, it was allowed in SC HD and Extreme.

Beside, this game seem harder than SC HD and Extreme, I can't get golds fast and here some disappointed points, even increasing taxes only getting few golds, Units are more expensive than SC HD, I doubt there is a bug in player currency because it seems CPUs getting golds faster and build units stronger. Sometimes food running faster for no reason. Some weapons supposed to be very effective against sieges but NO! and very slow and sometimes don't respond to my order.... I can say the currency and industries in this game killing me.

In short, graphics is good but not comfortable for units and UI and icons.

My first impression of the game automatically made me think of SH3. I thought this because of the UI (User Interface) and the way you rotated the camera. Also the controls are similar. Now straight away I had the awful thought that I had spent ?35 on a game, which like Stronghold 3 was broken.

 

But this is simply not true. The game is far better than SH3. Yes the game is similar in the way of UI and the gameplay, but it is different in the way that they have perfected what they could not in SH3. The game is far more optimized, meaning a decent computer could run it at 60 FPS (Frames Per Second) while maintaining fair eye-candy. The graphics look great and although it looks strange at first, after playing the second mission you are back into good old Stronghold.

 

Now allow me to discuss the game, more in-depth.

 

Grid Placements

Something that I love is the good old grid. We all love a good grid. Now for those of you who don't understand, the grid is the area of placement you have. All the Strongholds, except for Stronghold 3 (as far as I know) use the grid. This means everything can be placed in 4 different directions, where as without a grid you can place it in over 12. To some, the grid is bad, to me and most Stronghold fans it's a must. It allows for tidier villages, meaning you will be able to see everything in your castle much easier and it will look much tidier overall.

 

I'm sure this is something a certain Lord_Chris would like, keeping a neat castle.

 

Castle Defences/Walls

There isn't much to say about this but as it is different to SH3, I feel it's a topic I should cover. The wall placement is back to good old Stronghold 2 and Crusader. Walls (unlike other placeable buildings) can be placed in 8 different directions (towers and gatehouses are still 4). The walls are nothing like SH3 where it must connect to another wall in some occasions. You can place walls through existing walls, which simply makes building the best fortress, so much easier.

 

There are a few new defences in the game as well as old ones. Here are just some.

Burning Pitch
War Hound Cages
Spikes
Barricades
 

Of course there are many more, but this is all I can think of for now.

 

There are varieties of towers, with placeable siege equipment to go with them. Which again are easy to place and can be used to your advantage in defence.

 

Troops

There are all the basic troops you get in Crusader as well as some new ones. You can use the basic, armed peasants, spearmen, archers, crossbowmen, swordsmen etc. But there are also new troops such as Sargent at Arms.

The troops all have their own advantages, as well as new names. Spearmen are now called Men at Arms like in SH3.

 

Graphics

Something they have not let everyone down on is graphics. The graphics look great just like in SH3. The little details in the troops, walls, towers even the wood cutter huts have great textured detail in them. It really makes the game come to life and makes your castle look even better!

 

UI (User Interface)

The user interface follows which of SH3. It is really useful and quite neat in my opinion. It has everything you need in a small drop down box in the top right of your screen. Some players may not like it, but after using it for a while I'm sure you will get use to it or it won't even bother you much afterwards.

 

Controls can be very irritating especially with troops. I myself hate having to right click to move troops, but you get use to it after a while and really it isn't that big of a deal.

 

3D

The one thing many Crusader fans were worried of, is the 3D aspect of the game. Being 3D means that there are some features that just can't be added into the game. This includes the building cap and troops cap is slightly lower than which of SH2 and the troop cap is much lower than this of Crusader.

 

But the 3D graphics really do make the game much nicer and to me I like being able to rotate my screen.

 

The 3D is something you'll either love or hate, and there is a chance you will end up liking it.

 

Campaign

From what I have played, the campaigns are very fun for any players. New or experienced. Also with the option of being able to change the difficulty to suit your skill level, it makes the game even more exciting!

 

I feel the campaign can get tiring a bit but with loads of other features in the game, there's no need to worry about getting bored of it completely!

 

Skirmish

Skirmish is the same as Crusader. There is no huge difference in-game but the custom options make it even better. Allowing you to set starting goods, advantages, starting troops, even adding PT (Peace Time) into the game! They really did a great job in my opinion!

 

 

There are many other features in the game which I haven't covered. Simply because I have not had time to try them all out. But from what I have played so far, the game is absolutely phenomenal. For any of you who thought it would be a repeat of SH3, then I ask you to think again. The game is way better than SH3 and I would choose it over most other Strongholds.

The mechanics added since Stronghold Crusader 1 give SC2 so much apparent potential that I wanted to try out, but the balance is unbelievably broken beyond enjoyable use. Trying the skirmish trail, and even the Rat has me on my back foot, as enemy AI is in no way bound to resource restrictions, and thus builds an entire economy (which it doesn't even need because AI doesn't need resources) and is sending out raids literally within the first minute. The AI independence from resources has the additional effect that, even if you manage to send out a sortie to, say, destroy their iron mines or weapons buildings, they don't slow down and you've just wasted troops. There is absolutely no benefit to try and play strategically to whittle down a stronger opponent, you are forced to resort to mass of arms to win the day, and that's only if the literally infinite surge of enemy troops doesn't stop you from amassing any significant force within an hour.

I also recently noticed that towers are absolutely weak. It used to be the case that archers were pretty vulnerable on the ground, but really shined when you elevated them in their mighty battlements, away from immediate harassment by ground troops. In SC2, however, the supposedly weak Rat's unending horde of low-level troops now comprises spearmen who are olympian-tier javelin throwers, able to reach high enough to insta-kill the entire front of a grand tower's archer garrison, then tuck into the base of the tower where the rear ranks in the tower can't fire on them until their spears recharge for the next round of archer annihilation. That dovetails into another complaint: tower archers/crossbowmen no longer run to the edge of towers to get shots in, like they would in SC 1. A objective loss of functionality from SC 1.

All in all, an improvement over Stronghold 3 because they returned to the grid. Still not worth it because unplayable, balance-wise.

Also everything costs too much wood.

UPDATE:
After a few years and updates, and installing a re-balance mod...

They had the right idea, but completely dropped the camel. I played on and off for like 8 hours and I just can't bring myself to play more than ten minutes before I get annoyed and have to shut it off. They did all the things that I talked about at the beginning of the review, but they also decided to remove great features that made Crusader different than other games. Instead of making the AI behave smarter, they simply allow them to cheat.

The most unforgivable aspect of this game that makes it unplayable is the fact that your troops will literally stand around and get pelted to death without reacting. You have to micromanage every little tiny battle or encounter and it kills the game. The other game breaking aspect IMO is how expensive the cost to build a castle is. It takes thirty minutes to build a decent castle, and by that time you will probably already be close to dying and needing to restart.

They also seemed to remove slow motion game speed, and you can only cycle through normal, fast, and very fast. This sucks cause I loved being able to bring the game to a near stop so I could look around and contemplate my next move.

There is very little depth to this game and it feels dated especially for 2014 when it came out. To be quite honest it just feels completely half ass'd.

If you look at the cover and wonder who the ugly peasant with black beard is - it's Richard the Lionheart.

This game is just another generic RTS, with poor attempt at silly fun approach, with dissatisfactory gameplay mechanics and next to no fun.

I'm a lover of RTS games had played Age of Mythology,Age of Empire II,III as well. Really liked this game 
It is fun,realistic and challenging at times as well 
Balancing the economy and deploying units, storming the castles to forging your defense this game has all of it 

It is gorgeous looking game even in today's time 
Will enjoy this game for a while and will look forward to Stronghold Crusader III

(My experience comes from the skirmish trail only)

First the positives:
- Crusader atmosphere is well captured by the visuals and the soundtrack
- General gameplay of building an economy and overpowering the enemy lords' castle is timeless
- The mass-shouting sound effects are great

Negatives:
Gameplay:
- Removed many gameplay elements like moats, castle decorations/fear system, custom stairs, tower defense equipment, shields on walls, monks, etc etc
- Units very often don't follow orders. They don't go where you want them to go and they don't attack who you want them to attack. This makes any micro useless. Trying to cleverly take a castle with few units? They will stop at every slave. They won't focus on attacking the gates, instead they'll spread to all surrounding walls. THEY WON'T ATTACK THE LORD IF THERE ARE ANY OTHER UNITS STANDING NEAR HIM, no matter how often you click. I did some experiments where I made a group of 5 templars and attacked an enemy immediately in the beginning (Caliph I think). Some runs my templars get annihilated, some runs I kill the Lord almost without taking damage. Why is it so random? 
- Same problem with archers on the wall. If there's a bunch of slaves coming, hope that there's no other target in sight, because they won't shoot the slaves.
- If we're at slaves, fire is horrible in this game in many ways. The water troughs are so slow that fire will spread easily even if you have them. The fire will even spread circularly back to the building where it started, because the firemen can't extinguish fast enough. Just deleting the building is better 100% of the time.
- Sometimes even deleting the building doesn't work, because if an enemy slave dies burning from his own fire, the game will play the ""burning death"" animation. During this animation the unit still counts as an enemy unit and you can't delete the building, which is ridiculous.
- Damage of fire is often buggy. Sometimes it removes 50% of templars health within seconds, sometimes they can stand in it for a minute without anything. I once had an enemies' wolf catapult standing in my burning tar for the complete duration without inflicting any damage.
- Line of sight of archers/crossbows is horribly buggy. If enemy units are attacking a wall, ranged units will most often not attack them. At first I thought they tried to make it ""realistic"", but I had situations where enemy units were attacking my tower, I positioned archers BEHIND the enemy unit, and after telling the archers to attack they went close and attacked them with their knives. Line of sight is buggy.
- How ranged units decide for targets is horrible. 40 Crossbowmen on a tower will nearly all shoot the same enemy unit out of 20, although they could kill almost the entire group if they were a little more intelligent. Again, telling them directly what to shoot won't work either.
- Mouse clicking is imprecise. Trying to pick out a single damaged unit from your army is tedious af because the pointer simply won't select the unit you're clicking on. It'll select anything around, just not the unit you're (visually) clicking on. This is also very tedious when deleting walls.
- Economy balancing kind of weird. Why are mills so expensive? Why are markets so expensive?
- AI is cheating. I understand that this is necessary to make AI a challenge, but it destroys any real gameplay tactics. Harassing your enemies' economy is useless, because they'll be instantly getting whatever they need anyways.
- Walls are paper mache
- Just to say it again (because it's so infuriating): It's ridiculous how difficult it is to get units to do what you want. There's a single slave lighting my bread economy on fire, while my 80+ ranged units watch him merrily.
- Oxen range is too large. If there's stone and iron besides each other, the iron oxen will sometimes switch to the stone and walk long distances and vice versa, which is unnecessarily inefficient
- Using defense engines just feels so bad. That fire throwing catapult is attacking like what, every 60 seconds? It just FEELS bad, because there's absolutely no direct feedback from your commands. It shoots so seldomly that it's basically random whether it hits something. Tower ballista the same. I'd much rather have them shoot more often with less damage, but the first time I build them in the game I didn't understand what was happening, it just felt broken how rarely they shoot.
- Also, tower ballista make almost no damage to enemy knights, bad balancing.
- Everything in the economy is so slow, it feels ridiculous, even on the fastest game speed. Getting a single charge of iron takes ages.
- Building walls takes so much stone that in most cases it's completely useless to build a whole castle. In the beginning of the game you have to stack a single tower anyways, because you can't build a full castle and enemy AI attacks you within a minute, but if you have that stacked tower you don't need a castle anymore. Seems like bad balancing to me. (To be fair, stacked towers were also op in the first crusader. But there I at least COULD build walls, because they don't use up trillions of stones)
- Lancemen throwing their lances up a large tower, and onehitting archers, lol. Not even sure if this is a bug or ridiculous design decision
- Units often glitch into the walls/towers
- Assassins are usless. Climbing up or going down walls doesn't work most of the time. Also there is an assassin-breaking bug, where if you change their target (where to move or whom to attack), they will stand 2 seconds without doing anything before moving again (I guess pathfinding?), in that time they get massacred. Again, no micro possible

Presentation:
- Unit animations are bland, often buggy. T-pose gliding around the map happens all the time. The citizens glitch out of their buildings during their animation also very often (bakeries...)
- Main character animations are ridiculously bad. Why is the CGI from over 20 years ago better than in this game?
- Citizen voices missing completely
- Main Menu looks cheap

As I started with: All in all quite disappointing.
I don't really mean to blame the devs. If you look at the credits it's just a small handful of people who have been developing this game, and under that light I actually think it's quite impressive what they have achieved. But a game ""quite good compared to how many people have been developing it"" can be quite not-so-good on an absolute scale, unfortunately.",1626650911,1626795028,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Campaigns seem difficult for someone who has never played a game like this -- beginners, beware!

It has quite a few bugs considering how much time has passed since the launch. There are bugs that affect your game play and can have a massive impact on the performance of your army.

For example, most units lock in place for a few seconds when you command them to attack a target.
In those few seconds, your attack can be suppressed and you lose your army very easily.

Anyway, if you ignore bugs like that, you can enjoy the game.",1626765413,1626765413,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

There are some people here on Steam who say that the first parts (which I enjoyed too) were so much better - even their graphics. But I think they must either play with their eyes closed or have some extraordinarily nostalgic feelings towards those older games. In the early games, building walls takes ages, parts of the battlefield are not visible on the screen, infantry is able to cut down walls as if they were made of cake, controlling certain types of units is very complicated and affords a lot of micro-management, multiplayer games can only be played in insecure networks, the graphics are just as you would expect them from a game of that time ... And on the other hand, Stronghold Crusader II is a mature multiplayer-game with wonderful graphics.

The ""Crusader""-games were always meant to be serious real-time-strategy-games for multiplayer-gaming, with a focus on building and besieging strongholds, while other parts of the series follow slightly different concepts. In ""Stronghold Crusader II"", you don't lose much time to trivialities. Building a stronghold is super-easy and done by a few clicks. Building up a strong economy is very important and affords multi-tasking, but taking care of it doesn't take too much time as well. At the marketplace, which is probably the most important building of all, it's possible to define limits up to which goods should be bought or sold automatically. So even thogh there is more to do than just fighting, there is always enough time to focus on the battlefield.

There are three different buildings where units can be recruited: One for ordinary units (which afford weapons and gold), one for mercenaries (which are only payed with gold) and one for machines (for which you only have to spend gold too). These buildings provide many different types of units with different strengths and weaknesses, and they can be recruited very quickly at any time (as long as you've got enough weapons and/or gold), so tactics can be changed quickly and easily.

The graphics are simply amazing. You can see towers shake and bricks and soldiers fall off walls when they are hit, which makes the game appear very alive.

All in all, there is no reason not to recommend this game. It's an original, one of its kind, well-produced, full of action and fun and still cheap (the DLCs aren't needed in multiplayer-games). See you there!",1626248008,1626248008,True,11,2,0.570024251937866211,0,True,False,False

Long answer, simplified base building by considerably cutting out wall options and no longer needing to expand storage, little atmospheric elements, estates, and broken AI. 
     This game considerably cuts back on your ability to build your base with for all intensive purposes one wall, crenelated 1x1 square or crenelated w/ Walkway 2x2 square, that breaks at there build sizes which compared to the prior game with short wall, tall wall, gradient stairs, and crenelations all of each breaking down by their individual square when attacked. Moral of the story less detailed wall construction and destruction.
     Now lets talk storage, well yeah that's not really a thing in this one as each storage option just needs one building and then you can hold infinite of their respective storage prospects. Compare this to Stronghold Crusader HD which required a constantly expanding storage space to accommodate your growing economy. To some this change may seem better as it simplifies the game but in all honesty it just removes quality for the sake of simplicity. Simplifying things can be good but there's a limit when thing being simplified wasn't even complex to begin with!
     The atmosphere oh the atmosphere, yes we get cool ship sitting on the side of the map and some beautiful 3D models of the map but oh my are the units and AI lackluster compared to the talkative peasants from Stronghold Crusader 3D and you know just reusing voice files from that.
     My god Estates, the trashiest crap to be introduced to this franchise. Plus explain this to me who the hell concerns themselves with land ownership when you're at war with the person who is supposed to own the land! Don't get me wrong I understand trying to limit inching tactics where you corner the AI, but that's what the danger radius blockage is for and you know fighting. If you really wanted to fix this then introduce a build animation and workforce for the building of buildings.
     To finish this off the AI, who in the good green Earth thought a AI that can grow, create units, and advance with no actual production to match was a balanced feature. I'm sorry but when an AI starts with 10x gold there are things he can do to jump start his economy but after he finishes his build and still has considerably less resource production than you but maintains the same acceleration as the start there is something wrong. I should not be seeing a maxed out army of steel wielding units when the AI has no iron production and practically no food after it should of already blew through its starting gold. I get it, it's a popular thing to do for these type of games to make the AI difficult without actually having AI good at economics, Stronghold Crusader HD did it, but holy crap did this game dial it to 11 and say yep that's balanced.

My closing thoughts, if you got a mod that removed the estates, added back the building features from Stronghold Crusader HD, and introduced better AI (or just neuter them with less starting money) the game would be a worthy successor. However, with where it stands it feels like a game built as a demo or the first title made before making improvements with just really good graphics. If you want a good Stronghold game and not bothered by graphics play Stronghold Crusader HD or older as they had good and more content, control, and felt relatively balanced. If someone gets Stronghold Crusader HD up to the graphics of this then this one would be like looking at a cheap knockoff!",1625161316,1625161316,False,0,0,0.48828125,0,True,False,False

The bad: graphics lacking in detail. Faces of soldiers are especially bad.
Camera is very restrictive. Compare it to ANNO 2205 camera, and you'll know what i mean.
There is limit on buildings. Hitpoints of towers are not displayed. Weird weather effects.
Comparing to original, game has been dumbed down in many ways. Many buildings are missing. no flags, no moats, only one type of church, no evil/good alignment things. Peasants no longer talk to you.
Graphics for the lords are made just as badly as for soldiers. Lords can go on attack. Looks especially funny when they are attacking wall with a sword. There is even enemy attack 'Lords of the desert' where only lords attack.
Original was work of art. This game looks like it's made by a 5 year old for a 5 year old. Can't draw or write. Wants action and cool stuff!

I then bought this on a special for myself and a mate to play. 10 hours in and partly regretting the buy as the game play mechanics are poor for something mid 2014.  The GUI is basic for units:  There doesn't seem to be an attack move command. Combat stances seem pointless outside of leaving units in place.  Formations are terrible at spacing units apart, and worse when combining mixed units. There is an Attach Ground command that shows up for when non-ranged units are selected. And randomly, mouse clicks don't interact with the object you're trying to click on (like moving units into Towers, or attacking siege catapults amongst a group of enemy units.   Some defensive structure seem to have no AI to them so you have take manual control to operate.  And the missions are terrible - Siege camps spawn often right outside your base along with units, even if you've pushed half up the maps.  And they seem to just upscale volume of attacking units based on how many units you yourself have on the map plus how long you've played for.

I don't care about the graphics, or if the animations are perfect. But it all just feels clumsy and badly balanced. Without like 20 or 30 woodcutters right at the start, it is impossible to build an economy. Who thought that it was a good idea to make a mill or a tavern cost 200 wood? For the stone it is similar, for a great tower you now need 220 stones. It just takes an eternity to get your castle and your economy going. Strangely, the AI manages to be ridicously fast at the start, even with equal allocations. 

The battles feel very strange. You cannot defend 10 of the weakest units with one swordsman anymore, because your swordsman will fight like 3 of them, while the rest just runs through him, which means little groups of elite troops are almost worthless if you want to defend your economy or your Lord. 

If you set your recruit point to a tower, for example to get archers or crossbowmen there directly, it happens quite frequently that they are stuck inside the tower instead of being on top of it. If an hostile unit hits the tower on which some archers stand, and these archers stand not exactly above the enemy, they will just ignore him. I mean come on, even units in Stronghold 1 managed to move on the tower in order to reach a target.

It definitly is an improvement to Stronghold 3, but that does not really mean much. To me, it just cannot reach the older 2D games.",1614804372,1614804372,False,3,0,0.511371731758117676,0,True,False,False

The voice acting is horrendous, especially compared to the old Stronghold and Stronghold Crusader. The graphics look decent in screenshots, but when animated they don't hold up. The old 2D games have aged better than this, and I'm not exaggerating. Gameplay wise, I could say a few things, but it'd sound like nitpicking. I haven't played enough to form a serious opinion.

I've played the original SC for a seemingly infinite amount of hours when I was a kid and had always imagined how the next part should look like. Many things I have dreamed of are now included in SC2, i.e., that you can choose the look of your lord/lady, can freely move your stockpile away from your castle keep (an addition from SH2) and that you can't expand over the whole map (which resulted in bad looking castles and lots of meta-gaming). Also, now some maps feature estates that you can conquer like in SC2 which make warfare more dynamic and challenging. Also, most AI opponents of SC are back here like Richard, the Sultan (now renamed), the Wolf and the Caliph (they sometimes feel like old friends, don't die?). Sure, the game lacks the original depth of SC for the sake of having more battles and tactics - mace men/crossbowmen don't need leather armor anymore (which doesn't exist here), you can't hire engineers or ladder men, and there is no moat. Still, these changes make the battles faster, and the economy is still challenging (i.e. churches need candles now which is a nice addition from SH2, too). Overall, I love what Firefly did with SC2.

I am a big fan of Stronghold series, and I have all of them. 
What I like about Stronghold Crusader 2 :
1. My eyes feel so relaxed than any other game. Clear graphics puts very low strain on eyes. 
(unwanted light effects or dark effects which hinders our vision, does not include in this game)
( I feel warlords graphics does not give me same relaxation) 
2. Game Mechanics is really easy to understand.
3. Its all about practice to make your army and economy strong. ( you will understand the stats!) 
4. The enemy messages make you feel like, you are not playing this game alone, even in single player.
What is missing ?
May be perfect in-game manual for stats like how many farms for peasant, health in number scale, etc. 
Well, I am a big fan, I have played all DLCs, I would have liked to have few more DLC releases in parallel in this years with development of Warlords.

Comparison to the previous version of the series.

Pros: The graphics have improved from the first version of Stronghold Crusader, Including the 3D Rotation and the graphics texture is more realistic than its predecessor, One thing to be aware is when you start a game, you can't build any buildings until you start with your stockpile and granary built first, so it easier to avoid making mistakes when starting  your stronghold and will be able to prepare yourself strategically better when you work on the resources and expand your boundaries, so in a sense it makes the game strategy more realistic.

Cons: In the option Menu you don't have an option for changing the game commands for the camera, assignment civil and military commands on the game significantly, and that makes the ability of using different buttons for certain crucial points of the game quite limited. Also there are far less characters than from the original game, and only two different options for the difficulty of the game.

Overall it's still a very good game that challenges you to train your strategy to achieve your goals and become a better warrior and commander on the battlefield and to manage spending and production simultaneously.",1575410870,1606792281,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Yes, indeed. King Richard was right: fighting in the desert is cruel, especially if you are facing an advanced AI with a dynamic gameplay; but unfortunately this is not the case. Stronghold Crusader II reveals to be an unfinished, unpolished and inglorious sequel that pretends to play on the nostalgia-effect, trying to catch the old fans of the series. A game where half the content are DLCs offering multiple Campaigns which are in reality simple skirmishes where the AI can still cheat. Despite that, the worst thing is the economic balance and the slowness of the gameplay: too many resources are needed to build and the game's speed is too slow (you can't set the speed unlike the other Stronghold games). Due to these problems, the new troops, along with their mechanics, are completely useless and you'll be stuck by using hundreds of crossbowmens and swordsmens to defeat the enemy. 

In the end, the game reveals to be tedious but enjoyable for people like me, stuck in a time where happiness was playing 2D's games on dusty computers.",1554503582,1606419092,False,1,0,0.486404567956924438,0,True,False,False

A bunch of flickering bodies, merged into one spot, can in no way be called a colorful battle, and this is how any battle looks here. The good news is that the battles are as dynamic as before, especially on maps with a lot of opponents.

And this is, perhaps, the only advantage of Crusader 2. Otherwise, the second part does not stand up to any comparison with the original (by the way, it is also not without its shortcomings). For those who want to plunge into the atmosphere of the Middle Ages again, it is better to get an HD reissue than pay for outright hack.

Pros: dynamic battles on the web.
Cons: paucity of content; the interface and graphics are outdated for a dozen years; bugs.",1605802396,1605802396,True,3,0,0.472693026065826416,0,True,False,False

Graphics wise it is definitely an upgrade, but the overall focus and balancing of the game is not what I would expect from an RTS. While the game CAN be fun, and certainly is for a lot of people telling by the reviews, i will focus on the Parts that broke the game for me.
Disclaimer: I have not played this against other people, i merely played singleplayer matches.

1: AI: While the AI is definitely an improvement over the first parts, it is not hard to recognize, that its buildings are mere decoration. By the time you have build your Storage&Granary, most AI enemies (most notably the Rat) have just thrown down their entire base in one go. Burning down their ressource production seems to do nothing to slow them down, so there is absolutely no point in investing units to herass the enemy and get a lead.

2: Economy: Personally, i like the new Interfaces that allow you to adjust food&taxes without having to click through multiple menues first. What this does not help with however is that the ressource costs of each building are inflated to such extremes,while some ressource output is reduced, resulting in a normal game starting by spamming 25+ lumberjacks to get your other buildings out without too much delay. With economy development beeing so time consuming now, it shifts the game from beeing an RTS more towards an Economy simulation with war as the endgame.

3:Unit Balance: This is the big one for me that made me quit.
A: Bows&Crossbows cannot miss anymore. They shoot pretty slow, but their arrows are on point, and can only be blocked by shields (which can be attached to walls, but not towers). Secondly, Ranged units of ANY type (yes even Crossbowmen) are weak. A normal or Arabic archer take about 5-7 shots to kill a spearman. Coupled up with their low rate of fire the Spearman can just run up to them and kill them in melee range on even terrain. What makes this worse is that Spearman can now Throw their Spear at range (again perfect aim) to take out the archers without even needing to get into melee combat. The Icing on the cake is that range bonuses through Height (Tower or natural terrain) seem to be non existant.
The Result: Spam melee units to block the enemy, and throw in 5-10 archers to fire from range is the best kind of defense you can hope for.


Conclusion: Stronghold Crusader II tried to improve on many things that made the first part so fun, yet  delivered a product that went the wrong way. The Tactical options are there, and very appealing at first, but after playing for a while a lot of options just are not usable because of the things i have mentioned above. Every mission i have played is a slow crawl of having to slowly build up an army against the constant attacks of enemies that cannot be slowed down in any way. Build more units then you loose defending your keep, move out to just overrun an AI opponent, then repeat.",1538872171,1599735170,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Right off the bat, I have to say that this does not feel like Stronghold Crusader 1 felt. Hell, it doesn't even feel like a Stronghold game. The UI feels clunky, the game is slow without the option to change it and there are no camera options like there were in the original. Units can get hidden by the bushes or by buildings, ignore when being attacked and are far too spread out, forcing me to manually push them together, not even the formations help, instead they make them move even slower.

Gameplay seems sluggish and slow, some of the reaction reworks confused me when I started to play even though I went trough the tutorial  (WHICH I CANNOT RECOMMEND ENOUGH), units seem fairly weak and take much longer to amass, resources seem to take longer to gain and the gold gain trough taxes is a lot slower than in previous games, forcing me to rely solely on selling iron. 

As a stand alone game, it's okay. As a sequel to one of the best early rts games? It's bad.

The game is a lot of fun, if you liked the original Stronghold Crusader, you will like this.  It is a step back in graphics compared to Stronghold 2, and returns to a more HD version of the originals.

I like...

The Skirmish trials are much like the crusader trail of the original, each DLC adds more skirmish trails which are well worth the price as they provide a significant challenge compared to the base games trials.  Some units can buff other units as well as a powerful templar soldier has been implemented that if you have the gold, an army of them is nearly unstoppable.  The campaign brought back sieges where you are only given a limited number of troops and much overcome a stronghold without the ability to get more.

A couple things I do not like about the game...

There are some unfair aspects to the game, such as it seems your fire does less damage to enemy troops than enemy fire does to your troops.  If an enemy AI lord is besieged, and has no troops that can spawn a small regiment at the base of their keep.  The old good mood bad mood with the turture devices and flowers and what not, has been removed making the only things you can do to make your people happy are food, beer, and religion.  The game is still kind of cookie cutter, almost every skirmish trial I have completed I beat with making bread, taxing high, and making templars, and filling a tower or 2 with archers.",1597474657,1597474657,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The reviews at the time though made me hesitant to buy it and then they announced Warlords and thought maybe I should just wait for Warlords. Well obviously I bought it on a really good sale which this game goes on sale for really cheap a lot. I was able to get the deluxe edition for around $15 when it's normally $80. As for the game it's self I have mixed feelings about it. The interface was completely redone. Some of the controls are better though anything that requires the wheel scroll is weird. The new interface definitely takes some getting use to.  I love some of the changes they made but there's other that I don't like and some that I hate. Here's a list.

Changes I like/love:
Infinite space out of one stockpile/Granary/Armory
Some really cool new units/siege equipment especially the rangers
Trebuchets can be packed up and moved
Siege Equipment already come with the needed engineers when made
Low taxes is the new popularity neutral instead of no taxes (no taxes gives you plus 5 popularity now)

Changes I'm kind of neutral on:
Spearmen can throw their spears (that sometimes causes them to be idiots and sit there after they throw their spear)
Wall building
You can only build one church
No fear Factor items
Pikes require Iron now along with wood
Leather armor no longer exists and all units that used it now used regular armor
Pig farms replaced deer hunters
Conscripts
Your king has way more health

Changes I don't like/hate:
Everything cost way more resources for example a mill cost 200 wood instead of 20
Siege equipment that was placed in towers (like the ballista) are no longer place in towers and are instead a wooden platform with legs that can be placed over wall.
Braziers cost gold
Moat and draw bridges don't exist anymore (I loved moat)
AIs are insanely aggressive which makes early game even harder then it already since they can perform millions of actions a sec and if they start with a lot of resources they will use every last bit allowing them to exploit the fact that they're a computer.
Most of the campaign missions have a time limit (I had killed all their troops and I was in the enemies keep about to kill their king but then time ran out so I lost and had to completely start over)

Overall this game is harder than the first Crusader and sigfinicantly different from the originals. That being said I still recommend it as theirs still fun to be had and i probably just need to get better to handle the increased difficult. DLC is meh and not really needed. I would never pay full price for this game though.  8/10 a mixed bag but not bad.

Because those are free version of game i am not able play multiplayer. And i Bought this game because i wanted to play multiplayer matches. But I really don't know why the multiplayer mode is not as i expected. Not very much people are online in the game.And if you got anyone in the game then Player will leave the game in the middle. No battle nothing. 
And the Last thing i want to mention is that weather it's the issue that i am facing that when i try to quit the game. i had to sign out from my computer to do anything.
Otherwise game is prefect. 
offline scenarios are well. 
but the developer should polish the game more to make it more better then now.
i recommend this game for offline game play but for online game play thumbs down.

For those that enjoyed the previous titles such as Stronghold 1 and Stronghold Crusader, this game a bit of a disappointment.

For those interested in the Stronghold Franchise:
- This version lacks polish and doesn't represent the wholesomeness experience of the previous versions. While streamlined, I would recommend the Stronghold 1 and Stronghold Crusader 1 over this if you want to get into the game.
- They are levying funds for Stronghold: Warlord so hold your wallet for this game
- 45$ for this old unpolished game is really too much, especially when it goes on discount for 4.50$ like during Steam Summer Sales. You can grab Stronghold 1 and Stronghold Crusader 1 as a bundle every-once in a while for 15$ max

For Fans of the series:
- Weak food balancing, the game is unplayable on anything higher than 1/2 rations
- Weak economy balance, you can make 10 bakeries, focus your workforce on candles and ale, sprinkle some apples, pigs and dairy farms here and VOILA! You can now go to max taxes while on 1/2 rations.
- Loss of polish, no need for leather its gone. All production chains were streamlined
- Your build area is restricted to a rectangle and there is no way of expanding it
- Lack of balance resulted in useless units and buildings, there is no need to produce swords, just make a bunch of armor and maces then mass knights and crossbowmen.
Ex1: Macemen/Swordmen and other units are now completely worthless in comparison due to the power/economic balance.
Ex2: Why bother building Bows at 100g +50wood per Bower when you can recruit Arab Archers at 6g a head?

The only time I would recommend this game is when you have friends that have a hard-on for 3D graphics and are willing to put themselves through voluntary torture and play this version because you keep telling them the 1st ones are better but they just reply that ""bro its old"" so then you have no other choice than to play a game you hate and then exploit it to show your friends how pointless the gameplay loop is... all while trying to enjoy a game that has been butchered by taking out all the finer things in it and leaving you with an empty husk of what it once was but packaged very nicely... @Namuskeeper",1594254696,1594254696,False,48,4,0.793149113655090332,2,True,False,False

I did like how they improved the way you can change the happiness of your populations by just increasing rations for not only food, but other services like church and ale.

Voice acting is worse than terrible, enemies just spawn troops from nowhere, terrible UI and less camera control features than in the previous games, less army control options. You don't build siege structures, you just hire them and they just spawn at the designated barracks like every other type of unit. A huge step back for Firefly, not like they made a worth Stronghold game lately.

I was a fan of Stronghold 1, original Crusader, and reached a peak of love for the series when Stronghold 2 came out. The game was complex enough, yet, easy to understand, some things were brought back from Crusader or Original stronghold but new stuff made it fun and different enough. And, even though things lacked in SH Legends I liked it for what it was. 

Since Stronghold 3 though, something bad happened. I don't know what, and I dont want to shit on Firefly Studios as a whole, but the games are disapointing to say the least. I first downloaded steam on my comp only to buy Stronghold 3 when it came out, Oh lord was I depresed. 

Back to this game. It feels like the devs aren't fans of the serie themselves. Campain or skirmish trails are empty. Custom Skirmish lacks everything. The new 3D graphics are old and I feel like the 2d games are better. There is nothing to build your castle, the honor system of stronghold 2 was removed, everything fun from old stronghold games was removed. 

It saddens me to say this, but this game is a cash grab. You are gonna have way more fun grabing the old Stronghold 2 or even OG crusader. This games feels like the demo version of OG crusader. Devs dont care, and this game franchise is dead since SH 3 or even Legends. 

This review is all over the place, but really, there is so much to say about this game that i rather not start for real. 

Rest in peace stronghold, I will remember you for the good old times.

1) Castle building is awful, not enough models to build a good castle.
2) They now sell the default Stronghold 1 characters as DLC. One of my favourite enemies (Pig) is sold as DLC. what is wrong with Firely studios? 
3) It is so boring. You don`t have anything to do in the game after 5 minutes of building a basic castle.
I say basic because there is 2 types of walls and 2 types of gates. You can`t even control the gates and no wooden bridge.
4) No fear factors ike punishments etc.
5) The peasants don`t speak when you click on them. In Crusaders 1 it was a good feature.
6) You don`t see any medieval life... The peasants spawns to work .They just wait you to assign a task, there is no life in this game. In Crusaders 1 there is a life, women walk around with babies, people go church, there are drunk people around, children play etc... It is good to watch them, but this game is like a taco without salsa. Guacala.
I don`t have any good point for this game. Don`t get it even with discount.

After playing through a few missions on skirmish trail, here is my updated review:

There are some annoying bugs, still not fixed, soldiers running in place and getting stuck and others standing still yet gliding through an area.  Attacking is a chore as you have to do it by solider type, range troops will stay still if you drag a whole group and order an attack with infantry in it.  The AI is very ruthless and always play the super rush game in attacking you.  Challenge is one thing, most of the time they send small groups which are major annoyances but easily dealt with.  Other times you don't get enough time to recover and other attacks are incoming even on easy difficulty.

Graphics and other mechanics updates are nice touches.  I enjoy the new characters in the DLCs and their new personalities.  I have fun with the actual building and economy portion of the game.  However not all buildings can be rotated which is annoying.

All the annoyances make this game even more grindy and tedious than Crusader 1 ever was.  All in all, make sure you do not pay full price for this game, ever.  Maybe 80-90% off.

I'll build our keep as far away from any natural defenses and resources as possible. Also, whenever you're attacked, it doesn't work like a siege. AI doesn't attempt to tare down your walls with siege machines. Instead, all soldiers of all types can claw at your walls with their finger nails? Had Mehmed II only known all he needed was a couple of spades and a dozen men to take down Constantinople's walls, he could have saved a lot of time and energy and skipped cannons entirely.

There is no real strategy or point to building walls or anything defensive, really.... Just have more men then they have and you win. Also... your soldiers aren't built in units? This game came out in 2014 not 1992, right? It takes forever and a lot of clicking to have any sizeable army.

Pros:

Solid looking castles compared to older crusader games 
Solid maps 
Gives you starting option such as a beginning peice time to biuld your castle 
Cool and different troops to biuld such as Men at Arms and Slave Drivers

Cons: 
The first stronghold crusader has 16 AI opponents while this game only has 8. Where is the Snake and the Pig? Oh DLC 
Bad framrate. I run Rainbow 6 and Doom at 60 FPS constantly. Once there is fighting in this game be prepared for 20-35FPS

The original was in depth enough to keep your interest over time but yet not require too much micro managing. I thought a nice balance for what it was. To win the hard battles, you needed to be able to problem solve, think more than just on the surface. It gave you a larger map, larger area to build, larger view of your map, and a game flow that made sense. 

This game has none of that. 
It is a different game with a similar name, some similar skins, and a dum*ed down UI apparently targeted for the 10 year old sector. It would have been better to just name this game something different altogether. 

Pros:
Better graphics
So redone it looks and flows like a different game
Wall connections looks better (srry, is this better graphics ?)

Cons:
Does not play much like the original, not even enough to earn the name
Smaller visible play area, smaller build area
Seems like smaller everything 
Apple orchards are so small there is just a building - no apple trees ???
AI always in rush mode
Your troops damage delt changed - much less
Your troops die quickly or hit points changed - much less
So redone it looks and flows like a different game, clunky as things are missing
Feels like a cheap, half baked, remake that insults the original
**90% off or even free with not help this game or bring our group back

Summary:
If you liked/loved the original, likely you will not transition well into this one. 
If you never played the original or if you played this first, then the original, well in either case it wont matter much.

Age of Empires did it right to keep existing community:
1. Improved the graphics yet kept the orig game play - HD version, 
2. Then enhanced what made sense with changing many small things that improved the game play, smoothed the bumps
3. Kept the FEEL of the original, yet modern updates, including for modern hardware and kept the existing community

Hints for FireFly Devs and Admins - 
If your going to create a different game, give it a different name. You fooled me into buying this based on the name. Now I will have FireFly Studios on the 'shady' list (money grabers??) from now on.
Upgrading / enhancing / making it better and progressing the name is one thing, changing it drastically / creating a new game is well,,, a new game. It therefore needs its own name. You could have run this one out in a series of its own, if it had its own name, as it still needs lots of work as its clunky and rough. But I know one thing, I will not support (buy) any other ""new"" Stronghold Crusader games, (neither will the groups I played with mentioned above) you have alienated all of us !!",1585944259,1585944259,False,35,0,0.711050570011138916,0,True,False,False

Plenty of unit types to be found, and the game keeps it interesting, encouraging the use of certain types of units depending on economic conditions. 

For players of the previous Stronghold titles, especially the first game, might be disappointed at the lack of a straightforward story campaign. While this is true, I forgave the game because the Skirmish Trails are fun and have kept me playing.

Its inherently evident that Firefly has not polished their 3D game making yet, and Stronghold Crusader 2 leaves a lot to be desired. That being said though, since its launch this game has been patched entirely in fan service, and they have brought it up to be a fraction of what the originals were, but the sheer nostalgia and some new mechanics make this game worth it. Full price? Definitely not. But on sale, if you're looking for a new RTS like Stronghold, this WILL fill the gap. One thing to mention, over the course of my 30 or so hours so far, ive experience numerous bugs and glitches, from terrible and delayed pathfinding AI, to people walking through closed gatehouses and getting stuck in walls, to broken sprites and full on crashes.

So like the Stronghold 3, Crusader 2 pays more attention to the battle, which makes me sightly disappointed. By the way, I really consider Stronghold 3 without skirmish mode as a waste of money.

There are new Arabic units, and some soldiers have special ability, which really makes your tactics more various. And it add a lots of fun to the battle.

The AI also cheats within every other aspect of the game. Only way to hurt them is by destroying it's barracks over and over again after you suffered through hours upon hours of bullshit... The whole economy is unpolished and building a castle in this ""castle building simulation"" is a complete pain in the ass. Performance too is suffering from time to time. 

I should also mention that troops buging out or just not working as intended is a common accurance in this masterpiece of a crusader game.

Somehow all that isn't even suprising if you consider Fireflys inability to deliver a game your community already gave you a perfect instruction for... The communication between them and their fans lacks quite a bit. Atleast they tried to improve since back then, the result we will see with Stronghold Warlords.

BUT they achieved to improve the AI... if you can call it that way...

To be honest it isn't all that terrible, you get a solid game at its heart. You [COULD] have some fun with it if you're the right kind of person, but the hell it's fucking flawed !
If you want a good stronghold experience stick to Stronghold 1, 2 and Crusader 1... Their not perfect but much more charming than that piece of incompetence made by Firefly-Studios.

Just for the curious ones out there...

Got it on sale for a very cheap price so my recommendation reflects that price (3 euro).
The game is quite fun and it mixes some of the good in Stronghold Legends and in the old Stronghold Crusader. No gamebreaking bugs detected in my playthrough although i mainly play the skrimish trails.

At the cost of 2 cheap hotdogs this game is a steal in the amount of time you get for the amount of cash it costs. You can peacefully build your castle or mix it up and siege your opponents castles. As a veteran Stronghold player (all titles except the weird online one) i recommend this game.

The game goes on sale quite often so just mark it as an interest and wait for the notification of a 90% sale :).

[i]As an teen I played the first game religiously, day in and day out. If I was not outside with my mates back in the early 2000’s then I was gaming Stronghold Crusader. After quite some years had gone I tried to jump back into Stronghold Crusader Extreme to light up the candle again, the nostalgia was high but just did not feel the same.

Now in 2020 I’m playing Stronghold Crusader 2 and oh my god the nostalgia and the feeling is back!
I’m enjoying every little detail and the new mechanics in the game, although the graphics are not holding up anymore. It’s still a joy to game this game again.[/i]

There is just so [b]much detail[/b] and tiny things that other game devs just miss, all these tiny silly and funny voice overs when doing basic stuff. Makes one giggle and keep on playing. You don’t find that kind of character in newer games, in newer games you say stuff you expect, here it’s like [b]Monty Python[/b] was in charge with full of that type of [b]“nonsense humor”[/b].

As for [b]gameplay[/b], they really kept it close to the original. There are or course new small mechanics but that does not change the feel of the game. It’s still a Stronghold Crusader game through and through, just looks bit better and just feels little more “modern”, not 2020 modern… But 2010’s modern.

[b]As for recommending the game,[/b] well it’s hard to say really mean I doubt teens now would enjoy it, but if you like Age Of Empire and games in the same spectrum then yes, you will enjoy this game as well.
[b]For others?[/b] I really don’t know, mean you could try it Steam has a great 2 hour refund policy and it’s not expensive game either, you could do the tutorial, if you like it then it’s a keeper if not, you most likely looking at a refund.",1429949257,1579894657,True,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False
232890,16267858,76561198064716135,266,64,1965,0,51,1615260959,"Lets start of by saying this that I am a big and long time fan of the Stronghold series, however this game really could use some love and attention from Firefly Studios. Lets also get the illusion of me hating on Firefly studios out of the way. I may be critical but in no way shape or form do I desire for them to put out an unsuccessful game. After all nobody wants that. 

The one thing that really bugged me about this sequal is that individual units still were clipping into each other that causes forming proper battle lines with archers in the back is not as effective as it should be.
For one this issue possibly promotes enemy units to just clip through your lines and attack the archers. This can be countered by micro-ing your archers away, but its just not as fun.
On a positive side traffic jams and congestion of foot traffic travelling in tightly built castles is no issue, but a weak counter argument to not fixing clipping issues and implying it was a design choice.
However, my most important point is that I wish (And I hope to see this in Warlords as I understand the clipping issue is remedied there) positioning of troops is valued and gives advantages or disadvantages based on whether or not your troops are on higher or lower ground than whom of which they are attacking or be attacked by, and also whether they are too tightly packed together creating congestion caused by poor troop micro management and lastly if your troops are attacked from multiple sides. A good example of this may be Total War, or even Ultimate general. Both of those games use large formations of troops that are all identified under one unit and its easier to create sides(flanks) for a large rectangular unit but I have an Idea I can't quite explain over text that I believe this would work very well for individual units. It would allow the game to recognise where your units are and create a mask over the majority of your clumped units and create a 'square' encompassing those units allowing the game to identify your formation's flanks.

For my conclusion, I am reluctant to inform you I do not recommend this title as the game play still felt as out dated as the first Stronghold Crusader maintaining poor AI, little innovation from the last, and lacking important bug fixes. I want to say this game is at best Okay as a decent time consumer. Initial survival over the AI in Skirmish Trails is the only challenge when facing the AI and challenge drops off immediately after you get set up. AI struggles heavily on more unconventional maps with winding paths and hilly terrain for more reasons than just because it does not understand how to take advantage of it. There are other reasons, however, I will cut this short.

I wish Firefly Studios well with Stronghold Warlords and expect it to be on the most popular page for Steam for a long time to come with what I have seen so far.",1433805406,1579880351,False,2,0,0.499659568071365356,0,True,False,False

I had to wait years until I could upgrade my computer to run it properly. Crusader 2 retains many core elements from previous Stronghold games, but also removed or simplified others, and so while not as complex and varied as for example, Stronghold 2, there are many features I really like about this one, like the units’ special abilities, and being able to heal your own wounded units. However, after a few hours of gameplay I became extremely disappointed by how they designed walls: they are extremely weak and can be knocked down by even weak melee units. It felt more like building a sand castle than an actual stone fortification. I really wish the developers would have at least added an option for stronger walls, but alas, that was the deal breaker for me and I went back to playing older Stronghold games. It was only recently when I discovered that you could mod wall resistance that I essentially rediscovered this game.

Is this game a masterpiece? Nooooooo! 

Just received a mail from Firefly:

1. Play the game
2. Publish a review
3. Win DLC!

So, since I already played the game, I am now publishing this review:
""The game is good. I already liked the earlier Stronghold games, especially Legends although noone else seems to like that. Stronghold Crusader 2 seems to be the best game so far.""

If you like Stronghold 2 or Stronghold Legends, then you will definitely like this game.  However, if you do not like those games, then you should probably should pass on this game.  

Game positives
1. You no longer have to worry about hitting the food or supply storage cap, because they have removed it.
2. Different, yet similar building and unit tech trees for the different factions (This did not exist in previous games)
3.  More unit customization, in the forms of attacks and being able to create mounted cavalry
4.  Ox carts transport stone and iron, and you only need 1 ox cart per quarry or mine.  (The first Crusader needed about 4 carts per stone mine)

Negatives
1.  They removed the ability to dig or fill moats, which was in the first Stronghold Crusader game.
2.  The game is ridiculously slow paced in comparison to the first Stronghold Crusader game.  (the length of time it takes to build one's castle, economy, and start producing armies is about twice the length of time it would be in the first Crusader game.  
3.  Monitory units/unit controls.  I am not referring to the difficulty of telling units what you want to do.  That is very easy.  It is the fact that I have to baby my units on the way to the front.  If I click somewhere, I expect my unit to go there in the straightest line possible, not stop 15% of the way there and multiple times after that.  It is very annoying to only have half of your attack force show up for battle because the units are being stupid.  That is perhaps the most annoying part of the game, and it can easily be fixed with a small game update.
4.  Map view.  When you select a location on the map, it does not necessarily bring you there the first 3-5 times.  Also, you cannot zoom the map out so that you can see what is going on on other parts of it.  Essentially, it is keeping you from being able to see what is going on if you are not actively focusing on that region of the map.  Also, you cannot zoom out far enough in the game.  You may or not be able to see the balistas on the walls that are targeting your army.  It is very annoying.

Overall, this game is a pretty good game.  If you can get it and all of its expansion packs for about $20 (American, not Canadian), then it is a worthwhile game to own and play.",1573963115,1573963115,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I wouldn't play it even if it was free and it is free this weekend.

I really tried again, hard this time, to give the game another chance, but as long as you have another lord to keep you defended early the ""strategy"" of the game is to make as many TEMPLARS as possible and storm the castle. I literally just made 50 templars and 5 seargents and rushed a WOLF castle that was expanded to the maximum, broke in and killed the leader. Barely lost like 10-20 at most.

i love FireFly Studios, i love Stronghold Franchise. Stronghold Crusader 2 returning to the dust and deserts of the Holy Land. 

Stronghold Crusader 2 is the long awaited sequel to Stronghold: Crusader, the original 'castle sim'. After 12 years Stronghold returns to the deserts of the Middle East circa 1189, with a new 3D engine and realistic castle destruction powered by Havok Physics. Crusader 2 will recapture the original game’s addictive, fast-paced gameplay and authentic castle simulation. 

True to its roots this new Stronghold will define old school real time strategy, combining RTS and city builder gameplay. Playing as a brutal Crusader Knight or Arabic freedom fighter, you must use a deadly array of troops and destructive siege equipment to decide the fate of the holy lands. Lead your forces into battle as either Richard the Lionheart or the Sultan of Syria in two historic single-player campaigns, with dynamic events such as tornados and locust swarms. Become the greatest Lord by managing your desert economy and seizing control of vital oases. 

To dominate the battlefield you will need to command more than 25 unique unit types, mastering their special abilities. Raise morale with the Sergeant at Arms, charge in with the Sassanid Knight, use Archers to launch an arrow volley or scale castle walls with the deadly Assassin. Once your skills have been perfected put them to the test in skirmish mode or take the battle online with up to eight human and AI players. Create teams, choose different AI opponents and design your own map in the ultimate skirmish or multiplayer game!

Imho the game is stilll one of the most horrible ones I've played.

+autobuy-function in the market is quite nice!
+visible limit of buildings/units and number of unused peasents is helpful!
+3D is a nice try
-3D graphics are quite okay...for a game that has been released a few years earlier....
-why does the rat say ""our father"" all the time? Am I now the brother of the Rat? Wasn´t the Rat the only Child in the de Puce family?
-the animated Lord charakters look silly, especially the Rat looks like crap (sorry, but they really look like that...)
-the animated characters don´t move their lips while talking, which looks quite cheap (even in SHC1 they did that at least)
-medival music is nice in medival games, but why is there some kind of arabic melodic metal? I dislike that...
-the citizens have no voice, but the Lord somehow has a ""voice"" (he makes a clicking noise when ordered s.th.)
-Ranking system in SH2 was quite good, but here it is missing (you start as a free man and have to climb up to become a Lord/Knight/whatever)
-in SH2 you had to take care of garbage and rats. This challenge is missing here...
-animation of units is cheap. They`re always gesturing the same simultaniously...
-the damage system is werid...e.g. catapults do almost no damage to riding units (or I`ve been doing s.th. wrong all the time)
-sometimes some units are not autoattacking...or when ordered to move some units just stop after a few meters and stay there
-I am missing gallows and statues in order to increase/decrease productivity
-WHERE THE HECK IS THE SPACEBAR-MINIMIZE-WALLS-FUNCTION??? This was so fucking helpful for constructing castles or sieges...
-siege weapons have unlimited ammo :/
-have fun doing the micromanagement with healers/slave drivers....
-stock pile and granary have unlimited space?
-sometimes units don´t say anything
-sometimes assassins are popped out of the game when jumping down a wall behind an enemy keep
-units can walk up cliffs and mountains?!

I am sorry that I can´t find any more positive aspects of the game.

I'm a big Stronghold and Firefly fan, but their games really haven't improved much since the first Crusader game. This is essentially the same game with a new skins, and a few more troops. What bothers me most are the bugs, the bugs that exist nearly 5 years after launch. Sometimes troops just get stuck on a building. Assassin's are especially frustrating. They're constantly getting stuck and/or not following commands. This never happened in Stronghold Crusader. So, in a lot of ways, this game is worse, which is crazy considering how long ago the first Crusader came out.

I'm still hopeful that Firefly will improve their craft. My fingers are crossed for Stronghold Next. Oh, and please, my gosh, hire a dang UI expert.

1.ภาพสวยดี น่าจะเป็นเอนจิ้นของภาค3เอามาปรับแต่งนิดๆหน่อยๆ  กำแพง หอคอย สวยมากๆ เวลาโดนหินยิงพาทิเคิลสวยดี ฟีลเหมือนภาคแรก
2.การสร้างสิ่งปลูกสร้างต่างๆ  เวลาสร้างจะมีตารางเป็นล็อคๆ ให้เลย ไม่ต้องใช้สายตาเล็งแบบภาคก่อน ว่าสร้างตรงหรือเบี้ยวอีกต่อไป
3.แมคคานิคเกม ในส่วนของsimulatorชอบมาก เพลินดีๆ แต่ต้องทำความเข้าใจนิดหน่อย เพราะต่างจากภาคก่อนนิดหน่อย
4.แมคคานิกเกม ในส่วนการรบกัน เข้าใจง่าย สวยดี เครื่องยิงหินก็ไม่ต้องคอยเติมหินแบบภาคก่อนๆอีกต่อไป คือสามารถยิงได้เรื่อยๆเลย
5.ในส่วนของโหมดสร้างฟรีสไตล์ คือฟินดี เพลินมาก  สร้างฐานไปเรื่อย แล้วก็มีปุ่มที่สามารถเรียกอีเว้นต่างๆได้ ตั้งแต่เรียกฝูงสิงโต,กองกำลังเล็กๆ,ไปจนกองทัพใหญ่ๆ ฯลฯ มาบุกเราได้เลย
6.ยูนิตก็ดูสวยดี อัศวินเทมปราก็เท่ดี ธนูยิงแทบไม่เข้าเลย เดินดุ่ยๆไปตีกำแพงเมืองได้เลย

โม้+ข้อควรรู้
-.แมคคานิกเกม นี่คือ Crusader ถ้าเล่นภาคแรกจะรู้ว่า  มันหมายถึงว่าเราจะเน้นซื้อทหารรับจ้างจากแคมป์  มากกว่าจะมาสร้างโรงตีดาบ,โรงทำหน้าไม้ฯลฯ เองซึ่งเสียเวลามาก
-.และเมื่อมันคือ  Crusader สิ่งที่เราจะเจอคือ กองทัพพวกถือคบไฟที่จะมาเผาฐานเรา เตรียมตัวรับมือมันไว้(ถึงมันจะฆ่าง่าย แต่อย่างให้มันเผาฐานเราได้ ไฟรามชิบหายเลย)
-.แมคานิกเกม หลักๆก็เรื่องpopulation ต้องบาลานซ์ดีๆ เพื่อจะได้หาทองได้เยอะ ซึ่งแต่ละเมพเราจะต้องสร้างหรือออกแบบการเก็บภาษีที่ต่างกันออกไป  พยายามทำให้populationอยู่ที่1 ให้มากที่สุด  นั้นหมายถึงเราบริหารเงินทุกเม็ดอย่างคุ้มค่า  ยกตัวอย่าง บางด้านเก็บอาหารยาก เราก็ลดปริมาณการกินอาหารลง(จะทำให้ populationลดลงด้วย)  แต่เราก็ไปเพิ่มอย่างอื่นแทนเช่นลดภาษี,เพิ่มการใช้เทียนแทน
-.วิธีเพิ่ม population แบบพื้นฐานก็คือทำให้มีอาหาร4ชนิดในแกรนารี่(ซึ่งก็คือสร้างโรงสร้างอาหารทั้ง4ชนิดเลยนั่นเอง  โดยตอนเริ่มเกมเราอาจจะลดการกินอาหารแล้วก็ซื้อขนมปังเพื่อให้มีอาหาร4ชนิดเพื่อเพิ่มค่าpopulation),สร้างโรงเบียร์,โรงสร้างเทียนเพื่อโบสถ์ แล้วก็การเพิ่ม-ลด การใช้งานต่างๆของสิ่งเหล่านี้ รวมไปจนถึงการเก็บtax 
-.โรงเบียร์และศาสนา  จะต่างจากภาคแรก  คือเราจะสร้างโรงเบียร์และโบสถ์ได้แค่ที่เดียว แต่จะมีสิ่งก่อสร้างที่จะเพิ่มการผลิต คือโรงผลิตเบียร์ และโรงผลิตเทียน ถ้าเราผลิดได้เยอะก็สามารถเอาไปขายได้ หรือเอาไปใช้งานได้เยอะขึ้น(ซึ่งจะเพิ่มpopulationนั่นเอง)
-.ตลาด ภาคนี้เราสามารถซื้อขายไอเทมได้เลยโดยคลิกที่สะตอกไพ,อามอรี่หรือแกรนารี่  ตลอดการสร้างตลาดจะเอาไว้ใช้ในเรื่องการตั้งซื้อขายอัติโนมัติแทน  ชอบมากๆสะดวกดี แต่ต้องระวังการสร้างหน่อยเพราะราคาแพง(500) รอรวยๆก่อนก็ได้
-.ถ้ารวยมากๆแล้ว ควรลดการหาเงินแล้วเพิ่มค่า population ให้เอยะ เพราะค่าpopulationเยอะจะทำให้ยูนิทเรามีเลือดเยอะขึ้น

ในส่วนที่คนบอกว่ามีปัญหา
-.ระบบออนไลน์  ผมไม่ได้ลองเล่นเลยก็ไม่รู้มันมีปัญหาการเชื่อมต่อจริงมั้ยไม่รู้
-.บอทที่ดูไม่ฉลาด อันนี้ก็คล้ายๆบอทของ Crusaderภาคแรกแหละ คือบอทแต่ละตัวจะมีสไตล์เป็นของตัวเอง เช่น การสร้างฐานหรือการโจมตีก็จะมีเอกลักษณ์เฉพาะ  ซึ่งโดยรวมแล้วมันก็ไม่ฉลาดจริงๆนั่นแหละ  คือฐานมันจะเป็นการสร้างป้อมเล็กๆ และมันเป็นแพทเทินเกินไป(มันไม่ใหญ่โตอลังการแบบคนสร้าง)  แต่ก็ยังได้ฟีลสงครามยุคกลางอยู่ดี คือการตีกำแพง ตีหอคอย ตีปราสาท
-.บอทโกง ส่วนตัวแล้วไม่ได้รู้สึกอะไรขนาดนั้น ที่คนบอกถึงแม้จะล้อมและตีสิ่งก่อสร้างของบอทหมดแล้ว  แต่บอทยังสามารถ ค่อยๆสร้างสิ่งก่อสร้างต่างๆได้ เลยบอกว่ามันโกง เอ้ยลืมไปหรือเปล่าว่ามันเก็บภาษีได้ แล้วก็ซื้อไม้เอามาสร้างได้ไม่ยากเลย ถึงโกงจริงก็ไม่ได้รู้สึกว่ามีปัญหาใดๆ ต่อตัวเกมขนาดนั้น

i was playing the first game when I was a child and this second version of the stronghold crusader is also very nice. The first game was harder and there were more units than this game.

You can use bread production or candle production to build a strong economy if you have limited resources.
It is better to focus on production, earning gold and buy units from mercenaries post..  It is not always feasible to build swords and armours. Usually the arabian archers and the swordsman are the main units to be preffered.

Most worse reasons why it's so bad:

-Soldiers formations are very buggy, they can't move normally, when I want them to form in LINE formation.

-Some soldier classes, like assassins can't move normally to the point, without climbing on walls with NO REASON, even if there's a lot of space for them to MOVE to the point, they're still climbing on walls, even if it's NOT NECESSARY!

-Everything is VEEERRRYYY SLOOOWWW or BUGGY, I don't know. For example, I built A LOT OF FOOD MAKING BUILDINGS, BUT people still can't make food fast, no matter how much buildings I built, THEY STILL EATING FOOD VERY FAST AND NOT MAKING ANY MUCH MORE TO COMPENSASTE, so I always have to BUY food additionally, because after 5 min. ""The granary is EMPTY SIR!"". WTF???!!! (Stronghold Legends was much BETTER).

-Very UNCOMFORTABLE building process with WALLS. Building process wasn't made correctly, it's hard to get mouse cursor to right place, to start building thicker wall or fixing it. (Stronghold Legends was WAY MORE BETTER).

-Not fair selling prices. Imagine, you buy a thing for 60 gold and you think you can sell it for half a price, like 30? YOU'RE WRONG! You can sell it JUST for 5 GOLD! Amazing offer yes? There's a lot of unfair things with selling.

-Very slow fire extinguishing from buildings, even with a lot of wells and tubs placed.

So I think it's it. There are many other nagative aspects, but those was most negative for me and I think it could be same for you.

Stronghold Crusader 2 is a game developed and published by FireFly Studios and is the sequel Stronghold Crusader

The game offers some pleasant graphics and really vibrant colours, although some ugly glitches here and there, it is pleasant all the same

The game does suffer with some repetitiveness at certain areas of the game but a fun game nontheless

Stronghold Crusader 2 overall, however, is a fun game to play in short bursts and a good strategy game to play!

Im happy to see that it has an updated version.

I really like:
-finally we can choose different lords with different castle types
-finally different towers for arabic and crusader lords
-finally  church and mosque
-the new knight and sergeant
-the horse and knight system
-we really got back some of the old maps

We would like to have:
-the good vs bad system back,
-decorations and flags back,with flags matching the player selected shield and possibly the units shields matching the player selected shield too
-the old map editor 100%,the new one is a shame

Suggestion:

-i would get rid of the slave,slave driver,healer and whirling dervish and i would use something like this instead of them:

+instead of slave - Muttawi (Religious volunteers who served as short-term irregular soldiers in Islamic armies)
+instead of slave drivers - Ahdath (Urban militias that played an important role in the defense of the Islamic world throughout the Middle Ages) 
or Igdish (A minor troop type of the 12th Century, the igdish were the sons of mixed Muslim and Christian marriages who were employed as policemen in major cities)
+instead of healer - Ghazis (Full time religious volunteers in Muslim armies)
+instead of whirling dervish - Faris (The Arabic word for horseman implied a wealthy mounted warrior who occupied a social role superficially similar to that of the European knight.)

-instead the mercenary post an arabic barracks and armory with similar weapon crafting buildings as the crusaders have but with arabic style

-able to select castle styles and lords separatly matching to the player selected race

-we could have a mercenary post with different kind of ""weaker"" units it would be a ""3nd race"" and lords like the rat,pig and so on will use them,i would put the slaves and the slave driver here

---------------------------------------------
*Edit after playing couple of hours:

-Big Cons:
-running performance poor
-walls and towers are way too weak,almost worth nothing
-buildings burn down real fast
-buildings catch fire really fast
-buildings destroyed fast fast fast
-siege equipments are way too hard to destroy and have very short range,you can send them to attack the enemy without defence like some kind of tanks before you kill them they will rip your castle into pieces
-everythings feels more faster overall

overall these things makes the game so stupid,these thing are way better optimized in the original game

I have to give a not recomanded for this,im not supporting it.
I dont like the way the new games are going by making everything stupid.Distracting the players attention with a faster game pace and no real value behind it.
At least it feels like in this game the view range and the maps doest got smaller or just slighly.You can zoom in and out pretty good.

Don't even bother using assassins, the fuckers are going to get lost or they will vanish into the ether until you kill the enemy king. Then they will magically reappear from inside the walls of the enemy keep.

-better graphics than Crusader 1
-better overall economy management (introduced first in Stronghold 2)

-a lot of the units (assasins included) just don't respond to orders and do whatver they feel like

But other than that, I still wouldn't recommend this game to newbies. That would be for Crusader 1, or Stronghold 1.

Feel free to read my very negative comment if you still wish.

---------------------------------
Lets start here: Firstly I want to say I am very unhappy with the outcome of this game. I payed cheap due to the summer sale. But even so, it didn't deserve the small amount I payed.

Ok, gameplay. I like the thought of new troups to make things more interesting. But even THAT you messed up. Most of em you don't even bother using due to the uselessness of them. I personally use archers and pikemen. Sometimes Knights/Swordsmen.

And the AI. OH the AI is something that is sooooo broken. The AI Attacks you almost instantly. Stronghold has always been a slower style castle sim. Which I loved from the first stronghold, crusader, legends, (A bit glitchy but still fun) stronghold 2. Somehow this game is worse than Stronghold 3. Like... Really? I thought y'all would learn.

Back to the AI for a second here. With the AI, they don't make their castle any larger/better after a certain point. Thus they are easier to fight (If you even made it though the BS start...).

And this is saying something: I personally like Stronghold Kingdoms better than this disgrace of a stronghold game. Not to mention you even MADE DLC. Are. You. MENTAL?! 1: Fix your game dammit. 2: Don't make DLC unless the game is great, or the DLC makes the game great. 3: Please go back when your games were actually GOOD. I feel very upset with y'all. Making Stronghold great is hard I know, but you could at least try harder? Maybe put more time and effort into it? One reason some indie games are great because they were worked on for months, years, and so on. So, for once after making two bad stronghold games, could you please actually give it your all Firefly Studios?",1500746131,1542927975,False,6,0,0.54476475715637207,0,True,False,False

Just like the original Crusader it keeps tension high by making defenses quick to blow up with the right tool, although still effective in many situations and keeping resources scarce, forcing players to fight over them.

It plays very smilar to the older games, but the gameplay has aged very well. What hasn't aged so well is the AI and the graphics. The AI is giving the player an OK challenge, but it needs superior numbers and resources to do that. The standard campaigns in this game give it that. Therefore singleplayer is challenging, although the AI usually acts very predictable. What keeps it interesting for me are the maps that always place you in new situations like having to fight uphill to gain control of a resource or being sandwitched between two enemy AI that are also enemies with each other. I haven't tried multiplayer.

The graphics are not very detailed, but everything has a clean look and is easy to distiguish. And the developers have added some nice flavor like Halloween customes for the peasants that are only in the game in the real time Halloween week! Sound is good, and there isn't a lot of dialogue.

The DLC is just extra campaigns and new bots, so you can buy it after playing all the vanilla content first. I recommend the game to anyone who is looking for an RTS with in-depth base building and likes to play defensively.",1540684288,1540684353,True,3,0,0.535365581512451172,0,True,False,False

First of Crusaiders 2 is not supoerior to the original. The economy is too slow for my taste, army comps are funky to get and it feels more like a grind then a ''rolling'' effect.

There are several points I would like to point out. Starting with the bad ones :D :D 
1. Okay, the game mechanics and some new units have been added , but I believe a lot of new features could have been added but the developers did not put enough effort in. Like day and night circle, limiting vision, Wolf could be someone taking advantage from that. I love playing against the AI. 
2. Also in the original crusader game, the AI speeches were always too off from the say and their body language, personally to me it looked like the same as the original. There was no improvement at all. 
3. They should have created some extreme version of this game too as a DLC. For someone, who likes to play with AI a lot, they do not scale very well and after first few minutes, the game becomes monotonous until you overpower and stomp them with a massive army. So the game pushes you to improvise only at the begining(the defensive part) and not at the end(the siege part). Just pointing this out for the developers, if they ever read the reviews :D :D . 

Now the good ones. 
1. The templar knights and some units from the mercenaries faction, have been given new abilities, which if used properly can be a deciding factor in the game. There are some specific counters which make the game more interesting. 
2. I love the music tracks they added to the game. It gives really good immersion into the game crusader setting. 

Overall i would still recommend this game. thumbs up.

It does has many new features and many improvement, but it looks like...too cartoonish?? Like, if you compare Saladin and Richard from the previous SC with this one, in SC I they're really looks more charismatic and immersive

And the soldier, graphic, design, and combat animation, probably Stronghold 2 is slightly better in that case IMO

I can play SC I all night long but somehow I can't do it with this one...I just don't get the feeling like I did in SC I

Yeah. It's so satisfactory to see how clumsy AI pass my 100 men to wipe out my towers. And if I made it to stabilize my ground (always an easy thing) I can attack with a horde of merely usless Siege.

My experience with this game, I was super excited to buy it on sale.
Played first campaign. I lost 3 times and quit playing. First time was just a test, second was to test new mechanics that weren't in the first one. The third was me playing serious and right before I beat the NPC. One of his soldiers strolled over to my castle and got stuck in my wall stairs. I couldn't kill, build, delete so my last try was defeated by bugged unit in wall.

Honestly, I don't really care about the bugged unit. These things happen but your army feels useless in this one. I just don't like the feel of anything.

As for me, I have had to overcome my initial disappointment with this installation, with Stronghold 3 likewise. While part 3 was made under pressure, this time it was supposed to go easy, but somehow it didn't. It's a bit tedious to play. 

- The campaigns are a huge disappointment. I wish there were more real campaigns available as DLCs, I never play the trails. The third campaign in Stronghold 3 is a big plus!

As I began this game I was somewhat skeptical about it, (seeing as sequels/expansions never fill the shoes of their predecessors) yet that uncertainty slowely faded away as I fell deeper into it's irresistible clutches. The campaigns seem well done and offers a good challenge very similiar to the original. The Ai responds well and the battle animations/audio is spot on if not better than the original. I see that fire still has a devastating effect on units along with traps. The only noticiable difference/concern for me is the colors present or lack of on farms/orchards and in general, the original had much more vibrant colors on orchards and dairies. The colors here that accompany the orchards/farms seem faded, like a old shirt that was laid out in the sun for too long, so it's not as pleseant to look at and hard to distinguish amongst other buildings which is kind of a drag. Everything else seems like the original, but I would recommend that the developers work on bringing some nice rich colors into this game, the original had very beautiful colors/decorations which at times almost made it feel like a castle sim building game where you would take pride into pimping out your kingdom before laying waste to Saladins huts. Overall I like this game and would highly recommend it to any RTS fan and any fans of the original, if your looking for a sequel to the original this is it, and once you begin you will feel right at home.  For the moment I would rate it a 8.3/10 relative to the original just because lack of color depth.

Tip for newbies or vets of the original, I have never had an issue with lack of resources in terms of food/wood in this game. Your best bet when playing is to first invest in 8-10 wood cutters in the begining of the game and your set for the rest, if anything I always have a huge surpluse of wood/food mid game prob 20 mins in. My personal max limit on apple orchards is like 3, and like 5-6 pig farms with 3 wheat field and 2 hops fields.",1527833128,1527978484,True,8,0,0.585853397846221924,0,True,False,False

I could even look over the long ""games gets saved"" pauses even tho this disturbes the game flew heavily.
What led me to downvote this game is the simple fact that it is cheating on you in custom skirmish mode. The build- up fase of the enemys seems to be a bit too fast *cough* but that wouldn't be the problem. A bit more of a problem is the fact that the enemy can cheat money. When his army is completely destroyed and he has no money and his warehouse is empty he can build up an entire army without selling any houses or anything else that could give him money (for example 20-30 assassins or 10+ swordfighters+ archers+ Landsknechte out of an instant).
What makes this game unplayable to me is that the enemys are teaming up againt you even in complete Deathmatches. In 9/10 cases I play a 8 Player Deathmatch at minimum 4! enemys team up againt me and sometimes they run over the entire map to do so.
It doesn't matter to them that they get wrecked by their direct neighbors at the same time and that just sucks.
In simple words- the K.I. is so broken that it gets unplayable on bigger maps especially as there are no outstanding combos (except attacking with a huge templar wave...)
I'll only play the campaign- hoping that it is a bit better and go back to the original crusader afterwards. The wasted potential of this game really hurts.

I've played Stronghold and Stronghold 2 also and I was happy with the extreme version of Stronghold Crusader too.

But this game sucks for the following reasons.

1) Way simpler than the first Stronghold Crusader. It feels like it is missing content.
2) Tons of buggy movement and a few bugs of other kind. For real now, how can you release a 
strategy game like this without even fixing this? ""Right Mouse Button"" to move = nothing happens 20-30% of the time. Instead the troops just sit there glitching. Also some minor wrong navigation meshes where your troops literally take the longest path to reach anywhere.
3)As for the graphics/siege mechanics compared to Stronghold Crusader 2, it just uses a graphics engine more similar to Stronghold series that is ""just ok.
4)The starting menu - UI is so poor.

I am gonna finish this game for sentimental reasons, but I don't reccomend it to anyone.

[h1] Pros [/h1]
[list]
[*] Long skirmish trail, custom skirmishes, campaigns, etc, much like the original Crusader.

[*] Religion and ale are simplified. No need to build multiple inns or churches now. Just increase the rations of ale and frequency of services.

[*] New units with unique traits and abilities, such as the Seargant at Arms, Ranger, and Templar Knight, plus the Whirling Dervish and Sassanid Knight
[/list]

[h1] Cons [/h1]
[list]
[*] Buildings are criminally overpriced here. 200 wood for a mill might be okay if it worked as efficiently as the mills in Crusader 1, which is not the case. Plus, 60 wood for a single wheat farm, and 50 for a bakery or brewery is absurd. You find yourself constantly out of wood in the early game.

[*] The animations and graphics are cartoonish at best. The voice acting is childish, and the AI lords have no real personality. Even someone like the Lionheart, one of my favorite AI opponents from the original, now sounds like he has his parts caught in a vice. It's hard to tell one opponent from the next, and their attacks, while potentially lethal if you aren't prepared, are for the most part copy and pasted.

[*] There isn't nearly as much of a distinction between archers and crossbowmen anymore. Crossbows have had their impressive damage watered down in favor of rate of fire, which begs the question, why bother if you need nearly as many crossbowmen as you do archers (read, not exactly as many, but still a substantial amount), especially since 
they now need metal armor instead of leather? (Though to be fair, leather armor never was a thing historically.) Their range also sucks compared to archers.

[*] Pikemen are no longer to be used offensively, and while their original intention may have been as a defensive troop, even in the first Crusader, I see very little reason to use them when Swordsmen or Templar Knights do a much better job in the late game. They can't hold their own against even a lesser number of Swordsmen.

[*] Tower-mounted siege is pathetically weak. Ballista hardly do any damage to units, and take a month to reload. Same with mangonels. Bad reload, low damage. Plus, they no longer go on stone towers. Rather, they sit on flimsy wooden platforms that can be destroyed if you sneeze on them. With the high cost of those as well, they aren't worth it.

[*] Wall-building is dumbed down to horrible levels. You literally have 2 selections, a curtain wall, and a stone wall. The curtain wall is more of a retaining wall, and enemies will tear it down in seconds. The stone wall is the classic double thickness wall with crenelations on either side, already done for you. While that may seem more convenient, it really takes the immersion out of the experience. You have one choice of gatehouse, a dinky little thing that offers no 
protection, and looks really sad. You have 3 choices of tower per faction (3 crusader, 3 arabic). They are far from exciting, and the largest one, the grand tower, is again ridiculously expensive at 220 stone, and while it does offer good height advantage, it's the only one worth purchasing in my opinion. So basically, you end up with a square box that has towers on the corners, no siege equipment since it's not worth your money, and walls that can be torn to 
pieces with like 3 catapult hits. Rather disappointing.

[*] No moats, which removes a strategic part of castle defense that I always took advantage of in the original.

I purchased the Ultimate edition for 80$, I was concerned I would regret it with all of the negative reviews I see, however, I have really enjoyed the older strongholds so I decided to give it a shot anyway and I was not dissapointed. I think its a great game and absolutely worth full price. 

I say ignore all of the negative reviews, this is a solid stronghold game with tons of content, and updated graphics, I have played roughly 15 missions and it looks like 30 - 40 other missions remain. If they had bugs or issues earlier they seem to have fixed them.

Pros +

Ultimate edition comes with an extra copy of the game to gift to someone to play against.
Comes with stronghold crusaders 1 HD.
Tons of content and missions, something like 8 campaigns and maybe 50 missions.
They seem to have simplified some of the micro managing like auto sell and auto buy resources with a market.
Walls can take much more damage than in the older versions (like stonghold 2).

Cons -

I used to play this as a teenager when it was new, and had so much fun building a strategy to play the game...they have the AI so stacked against the player now, that its IMPOSSIBLE to beat in the custom skirmishes (which are basically just you choosing a map and an AI opponent).

The AI stronghold has its defenses and economy building/built from the get go, so before you can even get your required stockpile and granary placed, you are already being attacked by a wave of troops...forget building troops! The game lets the AI spit troops out buy the dozen in rapid succession (and there is no feasible way there is enough peasants or money for them to hire..you can tell by the lack peasants standing around, hovels built, stockpiled goods, and you know how much money the AI starts out with).

Another thing that really disadvantages you (if you even can get an army built) is the damage ratio. You have to send 30+ of your troops to hack away at the AI buildings and you MAY knock them down after 10 min...but they run up to yours and barely touch it and it crumbles to dust. Speaking of running...the AI troops sprint everywhere they go and can cover a large amount of map in a short amount of time....while yours leisurely walk everywhere, even if being attacked! I just sat helplessly and watched about 15 AI troops completely obliterate most of my well armored army, and run around the map and destroy every single building I had, while what little I had left sauntered around behind them unable to catch up.

I used to really, really enjoy this game (and quite good at it!) back in the day when it first came out...but they have done something and completely ruined it.

Coming back to this game a few years later, especially after actually playing Stronghold 2, I've come to appreciate this game a lot more. Using Stronghold 2 as the adjustment into 3D Stronghold games from the original Crusader really helps a lot. Q and E don't work in Crusader 2 for moving camera however, so the mousewheel problem still persists. It's a lot more balanced and you can definitely set up defenses fairly well now. It does feel satisfying to play, and it's pretty difficult so it's very rewarding to get through some of the missions. I can honestly say I recommend it now even if you prefer the old Strongholds, just make sure you use Stronghold 2 to ease into the 3D games as it'll teach you what you need to know to gitgud here.

OLD REVIEW:

It's not a bad game, but it's certainly not as good as the original Crusader. The graphics are horribly optimized, the controls aren't fluent at all (turning the camera around with mouse wheel feels terrible, the x-asis isn't inversed and isn't inverted, also you use left click to select troops then right click to move them/attack stuff, feels so wrong in Stronghold), and it feels extremely slow paced without any way of increasing game speed. It takes ages to get food/wood/stone/iron/weapons ect. in, and everything costs way too many resources to build. Taxes come in slowly and there's no good things/bad things that I found. It isn't very balanced, either. It's extremely easy to attack and very hard to defend. Catapults (not even trebuchets) out range the highest archer tower and ballistae do very little damage. Walls crumble (and kill all your units on them) in 1-2 catapult shots that are built and start shooting within a few seconds. There's no way to repair towers or gatehouses. Archers on towers/walls are nearly useless. So you're better off building little defense and focusing on keeping your opponents on offense all game. Lords are extremely tanky and can be healed with a new healer unit, which makes the game more about bursting him down than getting passed his defenses which is no where near as fun as the original. Knights (Called Templar in this game) come in un-mounted and you have to mount them manually which is really buggy. Combat between troops isn't visceral and satisfying like it was in the original. Voice acting is atrocious, probably the worst I've heard in 10+ years. I am happy about no moats though as units weren't programmed very well to dig it out so it was a pain to fight against in the original Crusader.

A lot of these things can be fixed in patches but I wonder if Firefly will see them as issues at all.﻿ If you're a fan of the original Stronghold and Crusader, definitely give it a shot, you'll probably like the changes more than I do.

[h1][i]Welcome to my steam reviews of Stronghold Crusader HD and its sequel Stronghold Crusader 2, be sure to check out both reviews for both games and enjoy!

Cheers.[/i][/h1]

[code][h1][b][u]Stronghold Crusader 2:[/u][/b][/h1]   I’m just going to come out and say it, this is a very tough game to recommend, I would recommend it but, with all the problems in the game, I ultimately can’t even though a good part of me wants too. The sequel to one of my favorite games, [i]Stronghold Crusader[/i], this game was [i]Firefly Studios[/i] most recent 3-D foray with their stronghold series. They’ve struggled in the past with going from 2-D to 3-D and their stronghold games have struggled in this regard. Games come out buggy, limited and generally suffer from lack of polish. That being said, [i]Stronghold Crusader 2[/i] is the closest they’ve come to making a good 3-D stronghold game, it feels the most familiar and polished out of all of the previous 3-D titles and it has great potential if only they tweak a few things with the gameplay. There is a good amount here content wise, graphically the game is serviceable not the prettiest [i](I would like to see more detail in everything)[/i] but, the physics and graphics get the job done. The game lacks a bit of color I feel but, otherwise I’ve no major complaints from the games presentation, where it fumbles is in its gameplay, specifically the balancing of the game.

     I won’t prattle on too much, check out my video for some examples, the gist of it is the economy of the game is imbalanced, your expectations of what resources you can reliably gain vs what you have to spend to get your kingdom up and running is completely imbalanced. Woodcutters don’t bring in enough wood for the cost of some of the most basic buildings, same thing for stone quarries for building your castle and towers, same thing for food supporting larger populations, and again there’s a lot more here and there [i](for example, why can you spend more wood to repair a structure then what it originally cost to build, it makes no sense)[/i], the combat is slow and the unit AI seems stupid at time, just standing there waiting to strike the enemy, lots of problems in this department and it makes the entire experience frustrating and not fun. Strategy ultimately amounts to buying the cheapest units in bulk and swarming the enemy to win, rinse and repeat.

     As it stands, I can’t recommend [i]Stronghold Crusader 2[/i], it’s a [b][u]$49.99 USD[/u][/b] game and for the amount of frustration that exists in the game I would say stay away from the game till these issues are addressed in some manner. I hope the folks at [i]Firefly Studios[/i] see these complaints and maybe come up with a way to rebalance the game, the potential the game has is great and if they just got the base game figured out and made enjoyable I know a lot more people would change their minds about the game, I know I would.

-Thumb Down from Royial [/code]

[code][h1][b][u]Stronghold Crusader HD:[/u][/b][/h1] Coming to us originally from [b][i]2002[/i][/b], a spiritual sequel to the original Stronghold [i](also in HD and also amazing)[/i] one of the few games in existence that can claim castle sim as one of its genre tags.  [i]Stronghold Crusader[/i] is first and foremost a strategy game, build your castle, run your economy and stomp your opponents into the sands. The game offers a ton of different AI characters to vs, some easy, some challenging, all very distinct and fun, the strategy layer offering a multitude of ways to run your kingdom and build your army. Have an entire kingdom run off religion and ale? Go for it, use the taxes from your god fearing drunk peasantry to fund your army; will you use purely Arabian or Crusader forces, or mix them to completely destroy your opponents. It’s a fun strategy game, with a decent amount of depth, mixed in with great extras like map building, sandbox castle building and a ton of different scenarios or custom skirmishes. Multiplayer is a blast and pretty easy to setup, with it being in HD the game looks and runs great on newer systems and it’s cheap only costing [i][u]$9.99 USD[/u][/i] regularly. This is an easy recommendation from me, it’s not a hard strategy game to get into at all and there’s a huge community so there’s tons of ways to play the game or add to it, it’s one of my all-time favorites and I still play it to this day!

Looks and Feels like Crusader and Older Strongholds (Other than the Wood Cost of building things now >.<)
Crime/ that Stupid Honor System is Gone 
Low Tax's dont effect Happiness
Crusadeing/ Pillaging

The Popularity system is kinda crappy it goes stirctly by your current Happyness instead of the old 0 -100 Meter. (If youre people start starving, or something bad happens. People instantly leave. theres no Grace Peroid till you get under 50. Its shit hits the fan and people hate you)
Structure's are Wood Thirsty. I understand more people living in a hovel the closer it is to the Keep. But 60 Wood for a Friggin House is 10 More than it is for an Iron or Marble Mine -.-

P.S There are No Moats. If your mad about that. Than I have a Question.... your in the Middle of the Dessert. Struggling to find Water to Even plant your Crops.  Where do you think your going to fill the Moat with? The Blood and Tears of Your Enemy's?

Let's dive into it.

The wood resource is broken. 20 woodcutter shacks can't keep up with a few farms and hovels.
Then they cut all the wood fairly fast and there's no more wood on the map.
Enemy is spamming troops disregarding resource.
They build their base instantly.
The AI is bad.
The balance between taxes and population is really thin.
The difficulty of the levels is very unbalanced. Sometimes it's straight up broken. The enemy will block his barracks/mercenary camp and will spawn a bunch of troops that are stuck.
You are forced to buy wood at start.
You are forced to use autosell and autobuy on almost everything, since the resources balance is bad.
BUT! You're gonna have to sell things manually constantly because you should not be able to afford a market (500 gold?!) to autosell since you get yourself under constant barrage.
Enemy spams slaves to burn your woodshacks at min. 2
You're plaing 3v1, Sultana nags you for supplies min. 1 (AI allies are literally of no use)
Enemy sends catapults min. 3
You will have stone deposits outside your territory that you have little to no way of farming and no way of defending.
You gonna have to base your economy around something since you are gonna be lacking certain resource almost every time. Such variety and innovation from the original. I'm stumped.
And we got disasters now in the game.

The confirm button is messed up.
Override saved game is directly above the surrender button. It's kinda reacting slow so you think it didn't register, so you click again... aaand yeah, you figured out the rest.
Esc button does not do anything, you gotta press a darn button to back.
Cancel and exit buttons are switched. Unintuitive.
Often times unit orders get lost, units get deselected, all kinds of weird stuff.
Selecting single units is virtually impossible.
Manning carts is a pain.
Patrol function seems broken.
Stance is definitely broken.
Can't select units with the RTS stamples that have been CTRL and SHIFT since ancient times.
No attack move.
No shift queue.
You disable speech - there's still forced speech. Set music to 0%, restart game - have music again.


With the ammount of enemy spam the no repair/build mechanic when enemies are around feels broken.
Even normal difficulty is too hard. No way you can micromanage everything in the correct order even on Normal, unless you're a god or replay the scenario 10 times.
I'm not a god, but once I spent 4 hours on a single mission... With having hundreds of hours of experience in the original games.

I tried to give this game a chance but it's not happening. You struggle, you struggle, then you figure out the puzzle, the only possible way to complete the mission.
Screw that. And if you don't figure it out in time and just mange to survive, the struggle ends all of a sudden and you just win, because the enemy is out of resources.
There's no back and forth, no drama. You lose immediately or you live long enough and win without a fight.
Half the achievements are from their DLCs (which dont get discounted under 50% ever). That's the cherry on top for me. We should not support bad business practices, especially not when they are paired with a crappy game.

- cons: all of the above.
- pros: you can rotate the ****ing camera 360 degrees

However, if you've played the frustrating cluttered unpolished mess that was Stronghold 2 or Stronghold Legends, or the buggy, defective, retrograded Stronghold 3 which lacks multiplayer and skirmish modes, then you'll be more apprehensive. You'll know that the games simply don't work on this 3D style engine the way they did on the 2D one. Yet, Firefly won't stop trying to force it to work. Now, Stronghold Crusader 2 is better than Stronghold 2, Stronghold Legends and Stronghold 3 combined and yet it isn't half the game the original was. It's still somewhat buggy but what really gets me is how the combat and economy simply can't be enjoyed due to the fact that they either detract from one another or pigeon-hole you into just one boring play style.

I can't enjoy the campaigns or skirmishes. The game tries to force me to use tactics that don't work. Almost everything in the game is fairly useless except for hordes of siege weapons, knights, sergeants archers and crossbowmen. This forces you to utilize one or two different play styles. Besides, the original game was bad enough at this. In the original you'd win by using hordes of shields, horse archers, ballistae and knights with just maybe some pikemen to fill in the moat and macemen to slay the lord. 

I can't enjoy the combat. It's still just a few seconds to tear down a wall like tissue paper. Then the troops merge into a single point like a deck of cards and then in about 2 minutes you're either victorious or you're spending another 4-5 hours building the next wave.

I can't enjoy the economy. There's no option hold banquets or jousts. There's no option to be a cruel evil lord or a good big softy. It's not as though these play styles worked to well in previous games, but one can hope. To run the economy, you simply horde a diverse array of resources and use them the exact same every time. 

This game manages to add on the mistakes of previous games and then adds more issues by trying to squeeze almost the exact same sort of format into a 3D engine with some additional features that only serve to frustrate by adding to the amount of micromanaging required. Do yourself a favor and don't waste money on this game till it finally ends up where it's destined, the 5$ bin.",1503190270,1503190270,False,30,3,0.762963056564331055,0,True,False,False

Thats a fair first call, and honestly its not wrong. 
That being said, there is a different kind of fantastic castle building that SC2 encourages, with the larger buildings and cost adjustments from SC (eg; Mill costs 200 wood, making it a VERY expensive building, but it really gives it a much larger risk-reward value if you try to yolo rush a bread). The more expensive buildings and changes, at least in my experience encourages you to build a stronger castle to defend these valuable assets. That being said, its more of a ""Make your own fun"" kind of thing.

If you go into this hoping for a updated Crusader with better graphics and more features, you get about half of that. 
The game looks better and the camera control is better, however in the way of castle customisation its lacking (no happyness/cruelty items, they're just gone. AND NO MOATS!) 
If you go in with slightly lower expectations you can get some real enjoyment out of the skirmish campaigns (and there are ALOT of missions which is fantastic)

when I saw that Firefly Studio just released a copy of Stronghold Crusader with
a few unnecessary additions and so called ""better graphics"".

This game really lacks all the good things from the first Stronghold Crusader.
Gameplay has not changed much it has actually become worse compared to Stronghold Crusader.
A few new units and AI's thats bascially all there has been added.The AI's behaviour is just poor to say it in a polite way.
(Btw most of the new AI's have to be purchased as DLC.)

Random events were added to skrimish mode which was copied from Stronghold Legends.
Random events are probably just an replacement for the crime system from
Stronghold 2. I think the random events are unnecessary in skirimish mode.

The game has really been overhyped because of the ""good graphic"". I think the 2d graphic
from the first 2 Strongholds looks still better than this games graphics. The performance was also an
nightmare, not sure if patches have fixed the memory issue and crashes. 

This game has totally lost the Stronghold vibe. It feels more like a cartoon rather than a medieval 
RTS.

I do NOT recommend this game. I purchased this game right after release and I must really say I still feel
great regrets for wasting so much money on this game.

People who are interested in medieval RTS games should purchase Stronghold and Stronghold Crusader.
These two strongholds are up to this day by far the best Stronghold games in my opinion
Most of the other Stronghold games have been just a huge disappointment.

I hope this review has been helpful.
I sincerely apologize for an spelling or grammar mistakes.

Cons: It can be almost impossible to defeat at times. Particularly higher levels with many enemies. The worst thing is that the computer cheats!! Destroy the enemy’s farms, quarries, mines, etc. and miraculously, more resources will appear in the stockpile! Same with gold, even without any citizens for taxes! And all of a sudden, a couple hundred pieces of gold will be given to the enemy! The same happens if your army arrives at the enemy’s keep. ELITE troops will exit the keep and seriously damage your soldiers.

Its a piece of trash garbage game that was forcefully defacated unto the faces of its true loyal supporters and fan base, the people who brought you the orignal Stronghold that was beloved and missed were long gone during the unholy birthing of this atrocity.
I have played and deconstructed every stronghold and dozens of rts games back in the day and know what it was about each game that people adored and what it was that people despised. 
Stronghold Crusader 2 is the 8th game out of the franchise and a sequel to a release that came out 12 years ago, despite the huge gap between the 2 games. It is unquestionably clear that the predecessor is the better game out of the 2.

Newcomers to the Stronghold franchise may not be able to tell the severe lack in development, innovation and progress within the newer titles and most of the old core supporters and fans of the series are overwhelmingly biased and blinded by nostalgia to properly give a straight and honest answer/review of the game.

This is where i come in, i payed full price for this indie developed garbage that was spewed out by a studio that was on the brink of bankruptcy. I was one of those loyal supporters, i remembered when the developers required financial help and requested their fanbase for financial support to fund the development of the game.

And when the day came, Crusader 2 was launched. Thankfully it fared better than Stronghold 3, it wasn't a horrendous glitchy bug filled infestation that its older brother was.

It was fairly polished and seemed decent at the time, only to realize that a decade wide gap between predeccessor and successor was closed and fully explored in less than 10 minutes... 10 MINUTES!

There is literally almost nothing new about Crusader 2, it is the most barebones sequel to have ever been developed. It has the most reused and recycled content and material out of any video game i have seen.

-Units
-Dialogue
-Buildings
-Combat
-Sountracks

Sountracks are unremarkable, graphics are a joke and despite sticking to a simple 3d game engine the game is poorly and laughably optimized.
For 15 fucking years this franchise has been around and yet we see the same fucking basic units in every single game, fucking archers, spearmen, macemen, and swordsmen.
Archers, spearmen, macemen and swordsmen, again, again, again and again.
There is no variation, the game is deprived of creativity and has been picked bone dry.

The developers had a true and rare 2nd chance to re-spark and breathe new life into the franchise, Steam is a good and cheap platform for them to launch their game and they could have followed up on issues and add on future content and it was a great way to receive feedback and ideas to help the game grow and develop.

But once again. They proved their inabilty to give a fuck and they took the fans money and fucked right off, they could have made the game better with proper dlc, instead of adding much needed new units, soundtracks, buildings, mechanics, animals, maps, storyline, diplomacy system.
They just added apparently new enemy characters with different castle designs and a change in tactics and military approach. 
It is almost inhumanly inconceivable as to how little of an effort the studio put in, in order to crank out these pallete swapped enemies for the dlcs.

Despite being the latest installment for the stronghold series, Crusader 2 will only future a handful of new units:

-Sasanid Knight
-Templar Knight
-Sergeant At Arms (Status effect unit: Buffs Armour)
-Conscript
-Ranger (Hybrid Unit, archer+swordsmen/ costly and ineffective)
-Slave Driver (Status effect: Buffs Slaves)
-Healer
-Whirling Dirvish (Employs the strategy of a 5 year old to deal damage)(Has 2 swords and spins in circles)(facepalm)(OP,pls nerf)

This may seem alot to the uninitiated but it does not come close to the content value and depth of previous titles.

Economy and production are nearly identical to previous titles, it has not been tweaked or improved upon over the 10 year period. Just slapped on with new paint and good to go for the next new release.

Castle life simulation has been dialed down to non-existant, no morality system nor a justice system. Stronghold was inaddition to being an Rts game was also a castle sim. To simulate life in a castle, which Crusader 2 does not have... at all.
It abandoned that aspect of the game altogether cause it hopes to deliver a more combat and military focused gaming experience which it also fails miserably since Crusader 1 could provide both without issue and due to the mind numbingly dull and poorly balanced units and unit variety.

Sync kills animation is not something to be seen here, only present in total war and dawn of war at the moment.

Building variety has also been carried over from the previous title, each building has been redesigned ofcourse but the function and purpose remains unchanged.
There is no new buildings to be built and there is no variety for the current existing buildings.
Also buildings are still built instantly, i will let this one slide since Stronghold has been doing that since 2001, but for some reason it just looks weird seeing square 3d buildings magically manifest and appear out of nowhere in Crusader 2.

Castle towers feel like there are made out of styrofoam and walls feel like they are mostly composed off millions of lego pieces, seeing that a single catapult is more than capable of demolishing a 10 layer thick wall. Why bother?

Castles can only be built by 1 type of stone, no wooden walls or wooden garrisons nor any upgrade or improvement systems for structures.

Castle traps are lack luster and shamefully lacking compared to its predeccesor Stronghold Legends.

Farming buildings remain unchanged the basic 4 foods are still around: bread, fruit, meat, cheese. There is no variation with each food either and production for consumables remain the same. 4 farms, a baker and a windmill is all you need and is all thats available to you.

I would continue to shit on this game but there isn't much to shit on to begin with, everythings the same. Everything that was good was left out and everything that was added in and remained was lackluster, uninspired and resonates tedium.

The devs didnt even bother to further optimize the game to enable those with weaker lower end pcs to be able to play smoothly. Even with graphics set to lowest frame rates were still choppy, inconsistent and unstable. Gameplay is a joke for a game that was released in 2014. 

Do your self a favour and do not purchase this game, i wish i had written this review sooner. Do not trust any reviewer or any fan that says this is an 8 out of 10 game. ITS NOT.

To the uninitiated it should not be scored higher than a 5.5 out of 10 let alone 8, and if you are a die hard Stronghold veteran like my self who is not blinded by nostalgia, you will know what Stronghold could have been and what Stronghold was, and that this shameless piece of thrash is deserving of nothing more than a 3.5 out of 10.

When you take this game out and refrain from comparing to the other games in the series, this is a great stand alone castle building and war simulation. There are some pros and cons with every game, but this is a game I'd definitely recommend. 

The Pros: 
- This game really has the spirit of Stronghold: Crusader. It reminds me of my many crusades I went on in that game. 
- The game is hard. People give it a bad rating because they can't handle the challenge of a real time strategy game. Ideally, I try to focus my economy on producing bread and crossbowmen, but some missions just don't provide you with enough to get off the ground like that and you really have to think on your feet. That's a pro, in my opinion. 
- There are a lot of missions and expansion packs to keep the fight going.
- It looks and sounds beautiful. The graphics look great and the voice acting is fine. They really listened to the community and changed the voices where people complained (Spearman, Narrator, etc). 
- The map editor is very powerful, but with a steep learning curve. 
- The sandbox mode is great. Take as much time as you'd like to build a huge castle and economy, then destroy it. 
- The game feels very balanced and well tested.
- The game is way less buggy than any of the other SH games. 

The Cons:
- That being said, the achilles heel of Firefly; the game is still slightly buggy. When you have a small studio making massive games, it's bound to happen. Overall, the game is significantly less buggy than previous renditions, but below I list a few bugs I've found. 
- Perhaps they do this for balancing / to add to the difficulty, but the AI gets free troops. I've monitored the 'greatest lords' menu, see an opponent with 0 - 10 gold, but mass building an army right before an attack, or building catapults and walls no issue. I've leveled granaries and churches, yet no citizens flee their work stations. That was always a nice part of SH2, you could kill someone by cutting off their economy and preventing them from creating new soldiers. Really felt like a siege. 
- There's not as much depth (perhaps that's my SH2 bias). The skirmish trail is great, but once you beat them all, well, you beat them. You can spend time building in free play, but I hate how they limit it to one siege at a time, and they don't let you pick where the siege comes from. 
- They removed the free roaming camera. Before, you could look top down, zoom way in or out, or change angles, which was useful for video making and for castle building. 

Bugs I've found:
1. When I build large castles, I like to set units to patrol, one because it looks cool and two for functionality. However, the path finding messes up and they won't 'reach' their destination, thus stopping their patrol. 
2. Sometimes, you can build walls that are not passable and not even know it. If it is too close to a cliff, if there is a small rock or brush underneath, or if the ground is uneven, it will still let you place the wall but you can't access it. Either don't let us place the wall, or let us access it. The same goes for towers; I could only place 1 archer on a tower because half of it was over a rock which I didn't even realize. 
3. Speaking of walls near cliffs, I love that I can build my walls right into a cliff, however this causes problems when I'm on a plateau and trying to build my wall close to the edge to maximize my space. Sometimes, a wall will get built underneath the plateau, but it will be invisible, so you can't delete it or build above it. I noticed this playing the sandbox mission with all the bandit camps. 
4. I constantly get peasants who say they can't access their work building, yet they will either be in the building running it or just stand there even though it is clearly accessable. Usually deleting and rebuilding the building works, but it's a waste of precious resources. 
5. Every now and then, the game just crashes. It does this on both of my gaming systems, usually after an hour or two of play. 
6. Some troops don't seem to engage in combat correctly. For instance, when I put pikemen in ""Guard"" mode, they put their spears down, but units run literally right through them. 
7. I have trouble running with 3 monitors. Either the cursor goes out of bounds, or it gets locked on the wrong display. Putting it in and out of windowed mode seems to fix it, but it's annoying that I have to do that every time I load. 
8. VERY annoyingly, the AI can build anywhere... Including on top of your buildings. In one of the missions where you are allies with two 'Rats', I had a large wall around my castle, yet every time the Rat would go to siege, he would build his siege camp RIGHT in the middle of my walls. Once his camp was gone, the walls would come back, but any archers on top of the walls would be on the ground beside him. Also, I've had enemy AI place their stone masons and pitch diggers right next to or replacing mine, even if I had troops near by.  

In 2005, I bought Stronghold 2 in stores (back when people still did that) and instantly fell in love. I played it for hours on end; even built a respectable youtube following with over a million views from my SH2 videos showing advanced map building techniques, mods, and fight videos. I became hooked, and branched out and have purchased every game in the series, and will continue to do so to support Firefly and, occasionally, find gems like this. No game is perfect, but if you lower your expectations, this game is great for what it is and will definitely provide hours of fun.

The bad
glitches and bugs everywhere: if you angle the camera too far down and right the ground goes black all you can see is trees and whatever you have built to that point. many units glitch in and out

There are only 8 opponents to face in the singleplayer battles; whereas the original crusader had almost double the oponents.

This was one of those few games I'd constantly see either on sale or at the forefront of my store page. During the sale some month ago, I gave in and purchased it, having heard good things about the franchise. Although the generalised rating for this title in particular was 'mixed' at the time - note, this hasn't changed - I was curious to try it out. 

I'm a big fan of RTS games, ranging from CA's Total War, to Age of Empires, Supreme Commander, and even as far back as Emperor: Battle for Dune. This seemed to be a bit of a different take on the genre and this also spurred my intrigue.

Let me begin by telling you that my experience was mixed, much the same as the score status. But even though I enjoyed the game itself, I cannot recommend this. My reasoning comes down to technical issues and performance.



I thoroughly enjoyed the core gameplay, what very little of it I experienced anyway. The population/town management was fun, the combat wasn't too fancy, but enjoyable, and the soundtrack wasn't awful either. The Scribes voice becomes a bit obnoxious but he's handy to have around.

No, my issue comes with the games performance; visual artefacts like horizontal lines with certain settings enabled. A poor framerate (25fps average on a rig that can run The Witcher 3 at 1440p 50-60 fps), and game stutter. 

I'm not the only case for these problems, a quick online search yields a plethora of cases of others experiencing the same issues, some offer 'fixes' others are yet to be answered. Ranging from Steam launch options, to Nvidia settings, to driver reinstalls, nothing seems to help my predicament. Some of these issues have even been present since launch I hear. With the game being this old, whatever wasn't fixed by now never will be. 

This seems to be a hit and miss title. Whilst people complained that the AI cheats, which I guess I never really witnessed regarding my fresh hours of the game, my main issues came with its performance, and I cannot devote myself to a game that runs worse than some Pre-Alpha Early Access title with stock Unity assets. 

My time spent here was bittersweet. I had hopes for this game, and whilst the core gameplay was fun and it was something I found I could slog a few hours into. Unfortunately I couldn't bare to stand those hours dealing with a stuttering, lagging, visual mess.

My ultimate verdict: Pick the game up on a huge price drop, that way, if you experience what I have, the sting is far less than what it could have been.",1485680119,1485680119,False,3,0,0.516255855560302734,0,True,False,False

(Anyone who struggled through Stronghold 3 will probably understand what I mean). To quickly sum up what I felt like was a very mixed game, Don't spend full price on it.. (currently it'a priced at £30 over 2 years after release and £50 for 'ultimate' edition?!?!) 

At first I really enjoyed Stronghold Crusader 2 and my first 2 hours of gameplay flew by and reminded me of the original stronghold games, with complicated yet fun resource management and also enjoyable  castle building... However after a while the cracks started to show and basically this game really needed another 6 months in the oven.

The AI of the opponents is both relentless and dreadful. It feels like you are constantly being attacked by waves of enemies faster than they could possibly manage to build them. In campaigns large groups of enemies will suddenly spawn at regular intervals (sometimes literally on top of my own units), then will slowly march to your base.. ignoring anything and anyone in the way. 

After a while you realise that the relentless attacks of enemies was firefly's way of hiding that the unit AI is just awful and your troops will often ignore that they are being attacked or will casually wonder past enemies attacking them when not being controlled and just generally show no real intelligence whatsoever. I haven't played multiplayer but after seeing unit AI I don't think it would be a much better experience. (especially because the map designs are often... just... not fun.)

Stronghold Crusader 2 clearly has a lot of thought put into the design but it has a lot of issues that were never fixed. (some just really basic bug and annoying issues, but also the cripplingly poor AI). Instead of fixing these issues Firefly instead released multiple DLC campaigns and enemies (Which still face the same issues) and are pretty steeply priced. In conclusion sadly this felt rushed and unfinished, which seems to me to be s theme of just about everything firefly has released in the past few years. It could have been great fun but it's not, so maybe pick it up when it's heavily discounted or just play the original Stronghold Crusader because it's pretty much better in every way.

[u]WARNING!!: THE GAME IS 4 PLAYERS MAX IN LOBBY. [/U]

This review will basically help you whether to buy this game or not , however , although I am recommending this game , am going to be neutral mentioning both good and bad aspects of this game genuinely .
I have spent 100+ Hours on this game before I write this review , so please before you agree or disagree with me , try to complete reading this review.

[b]First of all , lets compare this game to the first version of it which is Stronghold Crusader 1.[/b]
[url=http://i.imgur.com/A32LLM9.jpg]An Example.[/url]

-Clearly , since it has been released in 2014 , this game is in 3D and has a better amazing graphics , you can zoom too close to the objects and can see them clearly in a good view.
-New lords and sounds in the game which makes it more fun.
-You can set a rally point for the army to go to it once they are produced.
-It has exactly the same buildings but in more realistic view , there\\\'s a Market now which lets u auto-sell and buy good on a limit you choose , instead of spamming mouse click to sell and buy allot of goods.
-There are no trenches anymore , which makes the game more possible unlike the sc1 where you can dig a trench all over your castle and block the enemy from entering it.
-You can now put your siege equipment at a point close to the enemy instead of those workers who u integrate with the equipment to make it work.
-They added allot of new troops in both Arab and Crusader army. Like for example the healer which makes u heal your army , Rangers , sergeants at arms,,, etc.
-Easier managment for the economy and goods from the panel on the top right of the screen to get more taxes. it tells you how much you produce and consume.
-A new feature of occupying free lands in the map to take goods from them , wasn’t in SC1.

[u]Pros (in general)[/u]
-The game is very realistic , there are 2 types of lords , Arabs and Crusaders , where both are very realistic in the army type and economy , for example there\\\'s a sheep farm and mosque instead of pig farm and church for Arab lords.
[url=http://i.imgur.com/SdcKnfB.jpg]Check here.[/url]
-The learning campaigns are realistic and Historically accurate , they are some about Antioch and Jerusalem , you should reach there and occupy it , you will enjoy the skirmish trials as well.
-The game offers 4 DLC which add 2 new lords in each dlc with their skirmish trials. so 8+8=16 lords with dlcs.
-Each lord has his own type of army and economy, and his unique castle design.
-The Multiplayer side of the games seems stable most of the time , you can play with others in wide options of peace time and what\\\'s allowed and not( Assassins , trebuchets..etc) . and it has a cool feature which is if the host was P*ssy and left the game , the game migrates the host to another player in the game so there\\\'s no interruption in the gameplay.
[url=http://i.imgur.com/C03lNot.jpg]Check here.[/url]
-Easy use of army and positioning\\\\lining them , with the attack mode which tells the warrior what to do with enemies.
-You will enjoy the soundtracks in the game , they are really exciting and fun.

[u]Cons[/u]
-The game is unstable yet , it still has some bugs in it and needs frequent updates, last update was on april\\\\16 , so expect a glitch or a crash.
-The cost of most things is generally high , walls for example will cost allot of stone , market and inn will cost much wood too..
-The multiplayer system is unstable yet , sometimes u won’t be able to join a specific lobby , or it will appear empty.
-The game sometimes doesn’t accept more than 4 players in multiplayer , so its 2v2 max.
-The army stops sometimes when u move it , or it goes back and forward again.
-The knights gets off their horses for no reason sometime , you have to put them back on it.
-The mantlet health is high enough , if you put your army under 100 mantlets , i dont think the archers on the towers can stop you while catapulting them under mantlets.
-The tower ballista damage is lower than the crossbow , looks weird for me.

[b]So shall I buy this game ?[/b]
Well , if you love strategy games specially historical\\\\medieval ones , and you think you are smart enough to build and manage a desert castle, yes [u]buy it[/u]. But if you think you can learn everything in the game and become an OP player in it in 2 hours , then [u]don’t buy it[/u].
There are allot of videos and guides there you can watch or read to learn how to have strong economy and military power.[url=https://youtu.be/duCpNlgRCEg]A good video.[/url]
Don’t look at the reviews percentage on steam store page , most of them are 1 lined review with no reasonable dislike. However, don’t buy this game unless it\\\'s on sales it gets really cheap, otherwise it’s too expensive and doesn’t really deserve its original price without sales.
One more thing , don’t buy the special edition , it really adds silly things for nothing.

The game is very addictive and you will enjoy it.
Thank you for reading!

Coming from AOE (1,2,3) and Starcraft - I was expecting something more in depth than RTS. Coming from Sim City and Skylines I was expecting more management. 

""Castle"" building is more like wall/tower building.... only inside a magical boundary on the map...meh. Once you have a basic wall up - stone is irrelevant. 

Economy/gathering is interesting, but Like most other games - max workers and build every type of food/low taxes FTW.

Building happens instantly and with no workers, same with troop building. If you have the gold...spam 100 units in 10 seconds.

I like the idea of making weapons/armor for your troops - but thats about the only thing it does better than AOE.
No stat listing, no upgrading weapon dmg/armor def. No technology tree.

This is basically ""regicide"" game mode in AOE. Kill the king...I mean ""Lord"".

This just makes me want to play AOE again.

This coming from someone who has played most similar base building empire games over the years.  Civilization, Total Annihilatin, Empire Earth, Age of Empires just to name a few.  This is the worst Ive ever had the displeasure of playing.

First the game freezes every few minutes.  Takes 10-20 seconds to unfreeze and start working again.  Usually at least once during a mission it will crash completely.  So save frequently.  I can't think of another game that crashes more than once in a blue moon.  So its not my system.  Besides the techincal issues its just a horrible game.

Why?  Long story short.  The tutorials are incredibly insuficient.  You get told to do something or take out a base with no idea how to build anything or what to do.  You generally have incredibly limited resources and time.  You can't build anywhere on the map except on a tiny area called your ""estate"".  Your resources are usually placed on the front side of your base and since you can't build off your ""estate"" you can't defend your most vital buildings.  One enemy makes in it with a torch (and yes they will run straight past your units) and your whole econmy burns to the ground.   The economy itself is a joke.  Its a very intricate balance of food, popularity, taxes and so on.  If you are too popular your population increases faster than you can feed them.  If not popular enough your vilagers abandon you so fast you usually can't recover in time.  Its incredibly hard to do the economy properly.  That said most players just exploit this horribly and bypass it all together.  They give their villagers ZERO food but tons of beer.  This makes the popularity meeter go through the roof and so then they can raise taxes to max giving them way more gold income than anyone would ever be able to manage playing the game as intended and then they can barely hold off the initial rush tactics of the clearly cheating computer oponents.  I say cheating b/c they dont have anything even resembling a meaningful economy but somehow they can dish out units 5x faster than you can with a fully function economy of your own.

So you have 2 options.  Get your ass kicked over and over by a cheating AI b/c you are trying to actually play the game with a proper economy.  Or submitt to the inevitability that you will alway use the beer popularity exploit that everyone else seem to.  Then you can technically win the missions but lose self respect knowing that shouldn't work at all and you couldn't win doing it the right way.  But... you can't win doing it the right way b/c the game developers are retarded and bumped up the AI dificulty to max.

This game was not fun.  Was incredibly frustrating, and was a huge disapointment to spend a few hours to finally find out that you can't even get through the tutorial without exploiting.",1482826210,1482826210,False,2,0,0.499024718999862671,0,True,False,False

Pros:
- It's fun if you like the original
- The graphics are much better 3440x1440p support
- Maintains the playstyle of the original

Cons:
- Not as much depth as the original
- It's got some bugs
- Economy is much slower, in the original you could dominate simply by making an economic empire, it's harder to do that in this game.


All in all it is not as good of a game as Stronghold Crusader. But it's a decent game and it does a much better job than all the other Stronghold games. It's got good maps, good castles, good troops, solid gameplay.

It seems it sacrificed too much for nice UI and the lack of need to build stockpiles all over your castle like in crusader. Some buildings are simply too expensive like houses and especially mill. But what I dislike the most and wanted fixed since the time of first stronghold is the very limited space on which you can build your castle. In crusader 2 it is even smaller than in crusader and you cant really get creative in building one. You will have most of your buildings for food or wood exposed outside of the castle walls which makes it very hard to protect them. I guess it gives some sort of reality into the game but this is one thing where I dont think it is needed.
Also the lack of restart game option is a bummer for me. Miss that a lot too. On the other hand the AI of enemies is good and the kings are unique which is nice + a lot of missions to kill some time.

It includes a wide range of civilian and military roles.
You have to balance the economic needs of your military versus the morale of your civilian population, the level of which goes up and down, largely depending on how much taxation they are being charged; however, their morale is also impacted by the amount of alcohol and religion you provide them with (not necessarily at the same time).
A high morale level attracts more workers to your settlement, whilst having a low morale level means that workers will leave you and head off for greener pastures.

The first game, while lacking in good graphics had a LOT more options for castle building, and management. 

       For Example, you could choose what kind of ruler to be. Feared, or Loved. Choosing Feared meant having torture instruments placed around your castle, and having higher taxes. This would reflect on your peasants' attitudes toward you, making them less happy but more hardworking.
       Choosing to have a more peaceful castle meant lowering taxes and having the option to places statues or flower gardens in your castle to make your peasants happier, but work less hard. Regardless this added a lot more immersion and made you really feel like a Ruler, instead of just the castle's contractor placing walls and buildings. 

While the graphics ARE indeed a large improvement, there seems to be a serious lack of unit types in this game. 
       Sure it has slaves, assassins, horses, archers and different types of swordsmen, but not much else other than the addition of the Sergeants, and conscripts (Crusaders) and the Whirling Dervishes (Arabic). I remember a time when we could make siege engineers at a Siege Guild building and have them man a variety of useful siege equipment, (Siege Towers, Ladders, Tower Defenses, etc)

It is easy to tell this game was rushed, and doesn't offer much except for shiny new graphics and the same old ""Can't place that there m'lord"" voice in the sky. Please please please devs, give us more to manage/produce next time you plan on releasing a game. What we have now is terribly bland, and basically the same as the last game. (With the exceptions I've listed above. 

The other thing that really bugs me too is the lack of inventiveness on the devs part with the AI enemies. They have the same washed up foes we fought in the first game, and maybe a few more (that cost real money to have by the way). I think this is very unfair, and more should have been done before the initia release to introduce these new enemies beforehand so that we wouldn't have to cough up our precious cash to BUY them. I wish I hadn't. (P.S. Whoever animates your enemies when they talk to you makes me laugh every time at how bad they are) 

The map editor is very simple to use and create wonderful maps, however. But like I said before, there is not a lot to work with, and sometimes even mods can't fix that. If anyone reads this, I would really like to say I do recommend this game, however it doesn't offer much in the way of troop management and castle building, other than placing a few buildings, collecting resources, and making weapons/ale/candles/etc. 

I am sorry if you disagree with me, but it is how I feel on how this game turned out. 

On the plus side, I once watched a tornado rip through an entire force of enemy troops which totally saved my life by the way. Had a rough start.

[h1]Neutral points[/h1]

[b]Multiplayer[/b]
- I have to say that I couldnt finish a single game vs a real human player. After a few attempts I can say the following things about the multiplayer part: [list]
[*]Starting a game is a pain. Multiple times many player joined the lobby at once so the game crashed. Also happened a few times when I tried to kick people. Getting a game started with 7 other players seems to be impossible.
[*]MP is not dead but you have to try many times until you successfully connected to a lobby.
[*]The few games I could play were laggy and crashed after some time. 
[*]Some options which can be set by the host can make it nearly impossible to siege a castle[/list]
- Note that I dont really have much experiences with Stronghold multiplayer at all so my statements about the multiplayer part are may not [i]that[/i] qualified.

[b]Graphics[/b]
- The game has a decent graphics but it is not overwhelming. When you zoom in you can see some nice details but textures are not that great. At all I would use the word ""average"" to describe the graphics of the game.

[b]Animations[/b]
- Also average. There are many tiny animations for the peasants which is nice but also the battle animations are not really convincing.

[b]Story[/b]
- A real story do in fact not exist but it bothers me not [i]that[/i] much in a Stronghold game. Campaign(s) are difficult like in all Stronghold games. At least they did not to the same with the black/white images like in Stronghold 3

[b]Miscellaneous[/b]
- People/peasants do not have a voice like in the old games which kills the atmosphere in my opinion. I liked it when I clicked on the people and they started complaining about their work, food, taxes etc. That made your castle looking more ""alive"".
- Game has a map editor which is always a good thing.
- Placing buildings works smooth and is pretty good - beside building walls cause this sucks..
- The units are not that balanced but there are many different units (they kicked out a few of the old units but also created new ones which are quite interesting).
- No more ""swearing on key"".. awww =(



[h1]Negative points[/h1]

[b]Bugs[/b]
- They fixed many bugs but hell there are many left.. and many of them are game breakers -_-
- If you use more than one active monitor you have trouble with the ingame camera navigation cause of missing monitor borders. If you switched to the desktop and back into the game while you play a round the map is bugged and you can restart the round.
- Units glitching though the walls, getting stucked, cant find the way anymore, ignores enemies. People get stucked while they work, they just dont work even when you have tons of the needed resources, horses (for knights) are bugged as hell and so on. 
- Of course there are game crashes more often than it should be.

[b]Gameplay[/b]
- The economy is slower than it should be, it works worse than it should be. Prices are not very well balanced in my opinion and sometimes everything get suddenly fucked up without a real reason (no major economy change, no enemy attack).
- The reputation system is also not very well balanced in my point of view.
- Everything is just slow. Building up a working economy, build an army, the speed of units - everything is too slow..
- Fire is too devastating cause units are slow and get fucked up by fire too easy.
- Dogs are buggy and completely useless. Also I miss the good old defensive traps and stuff. Fireworkers are useless they just give a shit while your castle is burning..
- Building and unit restriction is bullshit.
- Units are not very balanced (but it could be worse).
- Again no siege mode. Sad.

[b]AI[/b]
- As a skirmish player the AI is important for me. Sadly the AI has not evolved since Stronghold Crusader. The AI act dumb but the REAL problem is that the AI extremely cheats. They get free units all the time and the amount of units is just ridiculous. The AI also gives a fuck about the unit limit (well they can have a minus count of units but their castle is full of troops) which makes the game just unfair and kills a lot of fun. So sometimes you get just overran cause the AI spam their free units at you.
- The units act not very clever at all. Occasionally the troops ignore each other and dont attack. Sometimes they attack even when you tell them to stay. Often they keep running even if they are in rage and you told them to attack etc. The list is long so tl;tr: The AI is unfair and sucks!
- The castles build by the AI are ok. Not always functionally but I am totally fine with it.
- Without the DLCs you got not enough AI lords. Sadly they decided to rip many of them out of the main game and sell them in overpriced DLCs. Also many characters from the past are missing, the new ones mostly have no ""soul"".



[h1]Positive points[/h1]

[b]Maps[/b]
- Many maps
- Not all maps are balanced. Yes I know that some of them are designed to be unbalanced which is ok but only to a certain point!



[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
This one was a hard decision because the game is not that bad but summarizing all the points I have to give it a negative reputation. Things that also lead me to a negative review:[list]
[*]Stronghold 3 was a big, BIG disappointment and I hoped they would have learned more after that disaster.
[*]Since Stronghold Crusader they only produced stronghold titles which are average or ""not pretty good"". Stronghold Crusader Extreme is a scam, Stronghold Kingdoms is pure bullshit, Stronghold 3 is horrible, Stronghold 2 is meh, Stronghold Legends seems to be ok but I havent played it enough to say more about this here. Normally I would say that the company is bullshit but it seems that Firefly isnt that bad. Stronghold 3 is crap but they tried to fix it and as far as I know they got forced to publish the game in a unfinished status. Also they added extra characters for Stronghold Crusader for free after the game was out for a long time. They remastered the old games for a moderate price. Pretty hard to tell if Firefly is more ""good"" or more ""bad"".
[*]Their DLC politics with Stronghold Crusader 2 sucks. You have to pay too much money for too little content which should have been in the main game anyway. Big thumbs down here.
[/list]
So should you buy it? Again it is hard to tell. I suggest if this game is not a prior 1 game for you, you should wait until you get a ""complete edition"" of the game or until the game( + the dlcs) is very cheap in a sale. Oh and dont try to compare it to the old Stronghold Crusader cause you will just get disappointed.",1474490177,1475173357,False,3,0,0.409591317176818848,0,True,False,False

Crusader was one of the first games I ever wasted months of life addictively playing. And it's been all downhill from there. Stronghold 2 and Legends were both horrible. Stronghold 3 was respectable attempt at a game, but still it fell way, way short. And then we come to this. 

Stronghold Crusader 2 might be one of the biggest letdowns of my gaming life. Firefly has officially ruined their Stronghold franchise. They nuetered Castle Building. They threw troops out of balance. They took the balance out of the economy. Building up your economy is so quick and lacking in challenge that its turned tedious and boring. 

The game almost completely lacks a ""story mode"". The campaigns they do have are a quick joke. And, from what I think I'm observing, All of the single player campaing content is offered as 6 dollar chunks of DLC. It shouldn't matter though, because stronghold is all about skirmishes right? Well they've screwed that up aswell. Their maps all suck. Even the maps that echo some of my favorite Crusader maps are completely ruined. The only maps that are any good are player made, and at least we get workshop to facilitate that(this might be the ONLY thing you could call an improvement over the original crusader). Seige equipment and the whole ""seige camp"" approach over the old engineers guild is garbage. Seige units suck and their too expensive, but simultaniously present themselves as the only way to take on a well built castle which leads me to another thing. You produce way too much, and way too quickly, for the frankly tiny troop caps ive experienced so far. I was, in my second attempt at a skirmish, able to produce enough resources to churn out armies as big as the 250-300 what ever unit cap every 5-7 minutes or so(limited only by how quickly peasants become available). And yet that same army doesn't stand a chance against even a computer oponent unless you pick at them with archers and seige quipment for 15 minutes first. Which the latter makes sense, but if I'm producing resource as quickly as I am, I want to be able to use them to throw 2-3000 unit army at someones walls and watch the world burn. But no. 

In short, don't buy it, even if you want to complete your steam collection like I did. This game is garbage. You will not get 3 hours of quality entertainment out of it. And it will stain your respect for Firefly and the franchise.",1472931578,1472931578,False,13,2,0.596493244171142578,0,True,False,False

Is it as good as Crusader 1? Of course not. Is it worth $50? Certainly not. But for $10 I've had a blast with my friends playing co-op custom skirmishes. I can't speak for the single player aspect as my favorite part of any SH game has been the custom skirmishes, but I can say I enjoy the updated graphics and new troops in Crusader 2. 

Yeah, it's a bummer that they left out some of the troops from Crusader 1. 

Yes, there is the ocassional bug or random crash. 

But for it's current price of $7.49, and with some friends, I would certainly recommend this game. 

(I also adore the ability to start multiplayer matches via Steam, wish they would patch the other SH games to include this functionality so I wouldn't have to fiddle around with Game Ranger anymore!)

On the other, it's the best that Firefly did with the Stronghold series since the original Stronghold Crusader.

It ain't perfect, even after 4 DLCs still has some annoying bugs, the AI models and messages are completely uninspired, based on over the top stereotypes and the food economy seems to always be either ""BREAD BREAD"" or ""Buy enough apples for 1/2 rations"". On the upsides however, unlike the trainwreck that is Stronghold 3 it's quite playable and has surprisingly well balanced military troops, where no single unit can be considered useless. The AI does also put up much more of a challenge than in the previous games in the series and multiplayer potential is quite high.

All the bad reviews doesn't give the game a good reflection. Its my 1st stronghold game and I love it. I played ages of empires 3 for years and I loved it to bits.

The way the AI interact with you is a huge bonus. With age of empire , after a while everything feels the same and it looses some appeal. But with stronghold there's a new challenge every time you play. Even the AI are much more intelligent. This game gets a 8/10 from me.

Slight-Medium unbalencement between units
Glitchy

-Fandom Cons
Tries to make characters (*Cough Cough* The rat) grow up with you, but miserably fails
You can't get lines from the characters anymore
Stronghold 2 looks better than this 

-Middle Row
Core gameplay hasn't changed for the most part
Lack of variation (Although understandable due to it being an RTS)

-Pros
New Units offer great variety
Decent secondary art aesthetic (Secondary being non-gameplay oriented)
Music as usual hasn't changed since the original making an excellent atmosphere and vibe

   If you liked any other Stronghold game I would think you'd like this too. I sure do. Myself I'm kind of new to the Stronghold Series, having only discovered Crusader HD about 2.5 months ago. After looking 1st at this game, the reviews sent me back to the older verison. Which I really enjoy. Also I scooped the original Stronghold game to refine my skills. But I kept looking at this game. Having watched a few vids I decided to risk $9.97 Cdn for the Special Edition with the soundtrack while the sale was on. It's been money well spent! 

  It runs just fine on my older system and I've not noticed any bugs myself. There are some differences from the past version, however for me at least, the crucial elements of the game remain. Having read a lot of reviews regarding this game it seems the tough AI's are putting some people off. It took me a few days practice and watching vids to "" git gud "" enough to beat the first 2 Skirmish Trail missions against The Shah and The Rat, which I did last night. Looking forwards to more Skirmishes.

  Having got this at 85% off it's been a good buy. I did also splurg a little more and buy The Princess and The Pig DLC while the sale was still on. Currently have a Custom Skirmish raging on vs The Pig and am enjoying the heck out of it. The next Skirmish Trail mission has me vs The Shah and The Rat together. Ought to be fun.

I spent the full 60$ and would do it again. The AI is the best ever seen in a Stronghold game and the graphics are far superior. The new map editor allows the creation of great maps and I have spent 60+ hours on that alone.
Warning, do not buy this game if you want a strong campaing, there is only a series of skirmishes and very little/no story line.

Update: 

Here's the thing: If you're looking for a remake of Stronghold Crusader, then this most likely isn't your game. If you're looking for a cool RTS, then you could have some fun. There's a few buggy issues with the game which I'll log throughout my experience with it. I would, however, only recommend buying this game on SPECIAL. It definitely isn't worth the normal retail value.

5.5/10.

Mission: Saladin Learning Campaign 4
Collected the 500g cache behind the first wall. The gold cache registered as collected as the ""pop-up"" was visible. 
Condition: I used a catapult to knock down the wall and charged a Sassanid Knight in to collect it. At first, it wouldn't register as I assumed it was because there were enemy players near it? However, as I ran my knight out it did. This leads be to believe that A) The enemy got it, or B) It didn't work in the aforementioned condition. 
Result: My gold did not increase by 500.
Note: The timer on that mission is impractical (Medium difficulty). I always manage to make it to the last gate as the timer runs out. This was after trying both routes (high-ground and low-ground). 
-----------------------------------------------------

Update: 16/06/2016

1) The enemy (i.e. The Rat) is able to create units WITHOUT an armoury. This is further applied to having no GOLD available either, as we know it requires gold to produce units. I monitor his resources through the greatest lord panel. 

2) Trebuchets are highly effective siege units. However, the trebuchets damage versus an armoury is rather disappointing. It requires upwards from 10 direct hits for the armoury to be destroyed, whereas a barracks requires far less than that.

3) I’ve noticed that the healers (produced from the mercenary camp) sometimes don’t move after being given an instruction (i.e. to go atop a tower). The unit model implies movement (i.e. he is walking), but there’s no actual movement at all. It’s only until I reissue the command does he do it correctly.

4) Enemy magically makes resources appear out of thing air? I’ve noticed this on a few occasions now. This refers to my first point, whereby I monitor his resources through the greatest lord panel. He literally averages below 50g while I’m sieging him, but still managers to buy stone (and all know how &*#$ing expensive that is – which brings me to another point.

5) The economy is slightly broken. You can buy wheat from upwards of 150g. However, when selling wheat (presumably a scarce commodity based on the cost price) sells for 5-10g. How did you work that one out? You should implement some sort of economy system (i.e. selling dilutes the market and lowers the value received per quantity. On the other hand, buying wheat creates greater demand thus raising the price). It’s rather simple economics.",1465238585,1466105890,False,40,4,0.691366374492645264,0,True,False,False

Take that as you will. It's true - the games after Stronghold Crusader (now HD) are not very good. Stronghold and Stronghold Crusader are great games, if you can get past the somewhat annoying pathfinding. At times, enemy tactics get a little stale as well. These are problems with the originals, and they remain issues with Crusader II.

With Stronghold Crusader II, the spirit of the first two games really shines through. The added benefit of full '3D' rendering is that it's a bit easier to find a pesky enemy who's slyly hacking away at some random bit of wall. It's also successfully merged the wonderful gameplay and customisability of the original games with its new perspectives. Yes, things are *different* at times. There are fewer units, buildings cannot be placed in the same fashion (i.e. a fletcher will not change its shape when butted up against a wall), and there are arguably fewer construction possibilities overall. However, this does not detract massively from the immense amount of fun the game provides.

The game runs very well on a very modest set-up (this was less the case when it was first released). The Steam Workshop is a great place to find user-created maps, etc. On the whole, it's a really fun game - even better when playing with a friend.

This makes playing with AI a little unbalanced and unrealistic :(. This was not the case in the first Stronghold Crusader. To give you an example, at the beginning of skirmishes with computer lords you can see them training troops and completing walls with little to no stone in their stockpile and even with the starting resources set to Low. It also makes it difficult to win sieges in 1v1 matches vs AI as they can immediately rebuild their castles with no stone at all!!

A mostly decent castle rts with a few holes, some losses, but  many new features (including achievements).  I don't understand why some reviewers tore it to shreds, have they really played all of the Stronghold games?  It's definitely not complete trash and better than most of the lesser ""3D"" Strongholds for sure.

Gameplay: Overall, the game objective remains the same - build your castle and economy, make troops, conquer the enemy through a series of skermish trails.  Like Crusader I, the sequel also focuses more on wartime than peace-time - so you will find more war and defense buildings and less economy peacetime buildings. Too much disappointment, the Fear Factor system has been removed...seriously, what the hell? Production is stuck at slow as hell now.  Economic management has been improved with the lovely ""automatic trades""  at the market and finer tuned popularity management with supply adjustments all made in a single window.  You can also see your daily production & consumption levels of popularity supporting goods to be sure the production meets the need. Troops vary from many familiar to several new troops as well.  New troops include some most-powerful ""leader"" troops that will boost the defense and attack for certain troops around them - Sergent for Knights, Slave Master for Slaves. A few favorites from Crusader I were unfortunately replaced with new troops too .  Keeping them all and adding on would have been better...I miss the underrated rock throwers.

Difficulty: Difficultly has been taken up a notch as Enemy AI loves to rush your castle early.  Even the weaker known AI such as The Rat will provide a greater challenge.  Some players say the enemy AI cheats more too and spawns many troops regardless of how bad their popularity and economy are doing.  Mastering stategic defense early is utmost importance, troops (towers & crossbowmen) must be made before much of the economy.  Popularity responds significantly faster to your economy now with negative and positive ratings immediately affecting your peasants - i.e. the moment your popularity drops, workers start leaving in seconds!!  Also castles are more expensive to build with stone walls costing 7 stone each and stone curtains being 3 stone...stone stocks too low sir!!  

Performance:  The game runs fine until your castle starts filling up with tons of buildings (Bakers, Brewers, Hovels), peasants, and troops.  Then even systems with a Radeon R9 3GB+ will have frame rates of around 25ish.  This isn't a bad console port and they really should optimize the code further.  It's not horrible  and I still enjoy the game plenty regardless, but it is funny that my system also runs Fallout 4 around 45-60fps on max graphics... Many of the major glitches and flaws noted by early reviewers are now patched up and gone, however I do still rarely see the ""crusified troops"" glitch where they walk in a frozen T position for a bit or also troops getting stuck on the stairs. Also the audio for catapult rocks hitting stone structures and walls is overloaded and WAY TOO LOUD.

Visual:  The graphics are similar to Stronghold 3 and perhaps even better. The animations are about the same too.  The enemy AI FMVs have been completely redone with entirely new and goofier looking characters for classic familiar foes and many new adversaries.  The interface really varies from a crappy low res title screen of an assassin (come on, looks like crap) to a nicely done very zen feeling skirmish trail amongst the stars.  Some recycled troop graphics from Stronghold 3 for sure.

Audio:  A mix of half recycled, half new when it comes to effects and music - perhaps more new.  This is typical for Stronghold games.  Music really varies, but I feel it is not randomized enough and many tracks are rarely heard while a few are played too often.  Classic familiar AI features new voice acting that is a complete joke compared to the much more intimidating classic voice acting.  The Pig now says things like, ""No No No, that's ma land!"" compared to ""I WILL CRUSH YOU!!! I WILL KIWWLLL YOU!!!."" The Rat is also more dull and bore with phrases like, ""My father didn't like ya, I don't like ya either."" Blah.  The newer non-familiar enemy voiceacting (mostly arabic tyrants) does seem to be higher quality and more charismatic charm though.  Lionheart seems decent enough too actually.

Conclusion: A worthy castle sim gameplay for many new and veteran fans alike but nothing perfect or AAA.  Die-hard fans shall enjoy the new features plenty to make up for the loss of some favored features.  It's not the best RTS and there are flaws, but it's still pretty fun and easily to get lost in for hours.  Firefly always releases these too early in development, but I luckily began to play after much of the final development.  I'd say grab it on sale, and definitely wait for the DLC to go on sale.  The main game is tough and should offer plenty while waiting on the DLC.",1460909142,1460910355,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

reccomend this game. 

- Difficulty. The programmers confused cheating with difficulty. What this essentially means is the moment you have finally breached the castle walls, the AI will instantly spawn a very large amount of troops to flood you, then instantly repair the breach. 
- Economy. While you certainly have to tend to yours, the AI does not. Destroying farms, mines, quarries, food, does nothing to slow down or stop the AI. While it appears they are spending money, they are not and can always afford anything. 
- Rushes. The campaign is an exercise in defending against rushes. Remember the cheating thing? Combine that with a rush. Takes 30 seconds for a fully grown AI to be outside your castle with catapults, torches, and enough to kill your Lord, meanwhile your fletcher has not even gotten to his workshop yet. 
- Defensive ability. All you have to defend yourself are walls. That is it. No moats. Hoarding is killed by a couple arrows, and arrows tend to simply pass right through it. No real way to create a defence besides building more walls. Walls that have to constantly be tended to due the the sheer catapult rush the AI throws at you. No engineers to help either. And Walls are super expensive to build, which wouldnt be an issue if I did not require so much time to tend to them.

It was honestly one of the worst things I have ever played.

The economy, happiness and resource sides of the game are very simplistic and add nothing to the game. I only played it for a short time and knew that it was no good.

For a successor of Stronghold Crusader I, this is just a decent game. Why?

-Decent graphical updates
-Lots of free content, many campaigns
-New units and buildings
-More advanced AI
-Many detailed improvements

Now, sure, there are some cons as well. There still could be more variety in castle structures, controls are not always in favour of the player and eventhough it got a nice graphical update, it still is behind on the latest standard.

Good: 

-Sandbox controls: allows you to calls attack against your castle in free built mode (now called ""sandbox"" for reasons unknown..); that's good because you can really create freely your castle and then prove its defensive effectiveness.
-Funny thing: Huts gives you more people if they are built near the ""center of the city"" (your stronghold) ad are more expensive. I've always seen this appening in real life: it's common knowledge that in central park, NY, Rome near the Basilica, London near the Parlament houses are more expensive... and inhabited by a crowd of people..? It does not have sense: houses are cheaper far from the center and gives you LOT of citizens, that would have sense: cause a lot of citizens are a problem to...food? for example? 

Bad: EVERYTHING ELSE

-No intuitive control of the camera like in Stronghold 2: space bar used to focus from high have been removed, and neither it's used to pull down buildings as in the first games; you can not rotate the screen unless you click that stupid central mouse button.. why? Were Q and E obsolete..? Bah!

-MOST OF ALL: No control over taxes, no control over facilities such as tavern, church, etc (remember the bars in Stronghold 2? the level of speed of collection of taxes, consumation of foods, etc? Forgot them..)

-Absolute stupid mouse pointer for units: it's everytime GREEN, no changes when you point a crate of goods, walls, etc.. the result is that when you first start the game you'll hear the voice saying to you ""Sir, we've a crate of goods in the desert!"" (seriously, in the desert? Beduins now leaves their goods randomly in the hope they'll grow in the desert..?) and if you'll point that crate with a unit the pointer doesn't change, it's always the same. And so for everything.

-SPACE. A lot of SPACE. To built. Everything. And everything is.. smaller. In Stronghold 2 you were forced to manage the space you were given in every mission, and also in Crusader 1 the oasis were a limit to built a lot of things. And this is more...real. Make the game a little bit challenging. In the map ""a small oasis"" I've built so far 10 farms, 10 apple orchard, 10 sawmill, etc. It's a valley not a damned oasis, right?

-Building costs: In stronghold 2: hut=6 woods; in Stronghold 1: hut=6 woods. In crusader 2: hut= 65 woods near the center of city. Why? The speed of collection of resources it's almost the same, so they're just numbers without sense. The only difference is that a lumberjack is carrying an amount of wood that 20 bulls can't handle.

Seriously, no. I'll not play again this. I'll be back to Stronghold 2 and the Skirmish mode, honor system, counties, etc.",1459881417,1459881417,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Maybe some glitches like graphical ones and some lacks like not having short walls bother old players but still its great seeing our old beloved game up and running with new engine.So buy this game not only because of showing your love to stronghold series but also supporting firefly studios for their tireless efforts in making these series.

DLCs really bother the gamers because they are too many. Even mini campaigns had their own pack. BTW having just 2 characters and some castles won't be enough to make a DLC for it. Making a complete pack helped it but why they should put a copy of game  and some (useless) kingdoms pack in this wonderful idea and ruin it. only made the price unpleasant to buy . I hope developers  do something and put DLCs in a solid pack only containing them with or without the  game itself , with a logical price so all player will be willing to buy this wonderful game with all of its after season products.

The first crusaders was better in most aspects. Several of its features are missing from this game. Including happiness buildings which offered a nice way to decor castles. Building sizes are reduced which makes it easier to build. However, max number of buildings and limitation on build areas negates this change. AIs seem to be stupider and don't interact as much. When they do its almost meaning less, including responding very late after things happen.

Tutorials are too segmented. Eg collect wood & food, then collect stone & iron, then build weapons. The missions take longer to load then complete. Most should have been combined into a single eco mission. That then showed the player threw each party. Instead of having a single task that is very easy to complete.

--As a game--
Compared to most games these days its laking. Its a bit slow paced for having fast paced combat. Several features are not fully implemented. Some features are almost worthless to use. Random events seem to effect players more than AIs.

AIs tend to cheap a good bit. Including spawning units were units didn't exist. Putting out fires that would normal burn down player's bases. As well getting resources out of no where.

Sure, it's not as great as the original, but what sequeal to any game is as good?  The bottom line is that this game is still sound, and most of the bugs in the game have been patched at least to my general view.  Sure, some of the mechanics and things could be better, but hey, all games have their flaws.  

One thing I did want to bring to attention is that this game is still kind of buggy.  Things don't seem to line up super well and the actual units themselves can get kind of glitchy.  Other than that though, the game still provides me with lots of fun.  I bought this game on sale for 10$, and can say that it is worth at least that much.  But 50$? No thanks.  Get the game on sale.  I would wait for another sale like this weekends, or maybe up to half off at the most.  But don't pay full price.  This is nowhere near as good as something like The Witcher 3, which was worth every penny.

Hope this review is at least somewhat helpful.  It's still a great game and addition to the series, and they did redeem themselves quite a bit after the disaster that was stronghold 3.  So I personally would ignore all the negative reviews, as most of them complain about problems that existed in the original games, but of course they didn't have a way to comment for those ones.

I didn't understand how the AI could build a full wall around their tiny outpost and I could only build 1/2 way around.  I finally discovered you could buy stone and after watching them build I got that down.  By endgame my castle was still nothing more than a miniture fort still even hough I built a 2nd wall around my 1st.

This game was very fun for being free and then it was on sale if I wanted to keep it for $10 so I bought it.  Afterwards I read the reviews and watched the video.  All I can say is I wished my castle looked anything like the video.  The AI that defeated me wasn't even 1/4 the size of the castle in the video and it was bigger than mine.

So if you can play this for free or it goes on sale then get it, other wise it's a waste of money.

little off topic: Stronghold Crusader 2 is still way better than Stronghold 3, which I also got on sale hoping for a game similar to Settlers 6 (Settlers 6 is still the best medieval game I've ever played and this game is the 2nd Stronghold game I've played).",1459660034,1459660034,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It does somethings well that older Stronghold fans like myself love, but FireFly Studios continues to fail to make a high quality Stronghold game since Stronghold 2 (My personal favorite, but the originial Stronghold is great of course). 

Pros:
-Great soundtrack
-Graphics are absolutely OUTSTANDING and the best they have ever been. I thought Stronghold 3's graphics were impressive but SC3 takes it to a whole new level! It seems that FireFly has put immensive detail into every buildings, character models, and textures. But the most coolest part about the graphics was that you see the farmers walk into the grainary and physically put the apples/cheese/meats inside in their proper place; even the most smallest of details amazes me
-Some of the orginal voiceovers remain for the units inside the barracks (except the men at arms, they seem very unmotivated and poorly made).
-My personal favorite part was that when you try to place a building that requires wood, the same man continues to tell you ""We need more wood!"" That has been in the game since Stronghold 2 and it is absolutely glorious! The best part was when he said ""Oh I give up"" he actually gave up, left, and never came back. I absolutely lost it.
-The curtain walls return and it makes castle building fun as it should
-Buildings take up MUCH MUCH less space than ever before! This means you have more room to work with and place more buildings.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Cons:
-The absolutely dreadful housing system returns from Stronghold 3, which means the further you place a hovel from your keep, the less peasants you get. Which is absolutely annoying to play with when you want to play freeplay and make grand cities like before and all you can make are small huts that only support 2 peasants.
-The Arabian voiceovers are abysmal. The older voiceovers from the original Crusaders were well made. These voiceovers sound like somebody just screamed random words into the microphone. It sounds made up and racist really. I don't speak the langauge but some more effort could of been put into it.
-For some reason, Firefly will NEVER allow you to build walls or gate houses inside your estates. I never understood why. 
-Continuing with estates, for some reason in freebuild you can't even place buildings in them!! Even if you own it the game fails to put any buildings to enhance production or produce different resources!
-The game seems to limit you like a parent forcing a curfew at age 22. Any sort of quarry or mine can only have a max of 4 ox teathers per building. This is extremely annoying especially if they have a long walk to the stockpile. The game is forcing me not to be able to maximize my resources. 
-You can no longer put Mangols or Billistas on top of your towers. Instead you spend more wood resouces to put them on a half-fasted wooden platform. Which it looks ridiculous and poorly made. The design of this is awful.
-For some reason you can't place a carters post. The only have prebuilt ones for you during freebuild, but thats it. Really disappointed in that.

And also I've played this game both before the optimisation patch came out and after that. And I must say, I really can't join the obvious hate train on this one. Maybe you'll dismiss me after these words, but first hear me out.
Not only will I bring some closure on some of the infamous aspects the other reviewers have pointed out about the game in it's early stages, but I will also recommend you which Stronghold game you should look for according to your interests.

About the claims saying that this game is unbalanced. Let me point out that this game, is both warfare-wise and economy-wise, is more balanced than any other stronghold game that I've played. In older games, bread production was the way to go in all situations, and sword production was the thing you should go for, simply because all other melee units were simply trash compared to swordsmen and knights, removing the reason/need for more than half of weapon workshop options and the soldier options. Mantlets and horse archers were simply overpowered, and it was the best choice to amass them. In Stronghold 2, siege engines were so broken that you could defend a ""castle"" without building a single wall, or you didn't need to actually move in your melee units to kill advancing swordsmen, because they couldn't even get close. But in this game, you can see that all of those issues I mentioned above don't exist anymore.

In first crusader game, everything was so cheap that money virtually didn't cost anything after you've set your core economy in place, having thousands upon thousands of gold and not even being able to find a way to spend all of that was simply meaningless, and at the same time arabian units were simply way too expensive to train early on. But in this game, you can always feel the pressure of being short for money, from all the way from beginning to the endgame, as it should be. And this doesn't mean that it's impossible to build a rich settlement, there are actually new features that immensely help with that!

For example, in this game a market is not required to sell or buy goods, but still there is a market building option. Why? Because this market building provides autosell and autobuy options. And stockpile, granary and armory buildings have unlimited space. Honestly, these are the most important reasons why this game is actually superior to any other stronghold game (stronghold 2 didn't have unlimited stockpile). Anyone who've played enough stronghold games can know, that it's a pain in the ass both trying to manage the stockpile by selling excess stone so that your bread production chain won't crumble upon itself, and trying to command your units in battle at the same time. Let's say that you don't have iron reserves but you really need some armor in your armory. But you cannot stop what you are doing and buy iron because the enemy is keeping you busy all the time. Worry not! Just set some iron to autobuy, and the system is already set in stone. You just set your autosell and autobuy options and sit back and enjoy warfare while the money counts itself. The new minimap and UI are also way better than the older games. It's easier to spot units on map, and UI is customizable and you can see how much goods you have in your stores at the top of your screen all the time, if you wish so. The new popularity chart is vastly superior to the older games, aside from the default popularity displays, you can see both the daily income and consume of food, ale, and candles, so when you increase the rate of rations you don't have to pay attention to your granary all the time to figure out if they are declining or not. Which makes setting taxes and setting your economy a lot easier than it was in older games. Another example that points out that it's still easy to have a rich settlement: the default tax rate is ""low taxes"" now, and it doesn't exert a negative effect in your popularity.

Roughly all buildings are more than 2 times as expensive than it was in older games, and that is a welcome addition. It's a bit harder to spam quarries to get rich early on, and it's still possible. Now there is a reason to set up other types of food farms as well, and even at the beginning you are still able to set up bread production if you play right. And also multiple food types provide way more popularity bonus than it did in original games, now you can raise your tax rate by one level just by having all food types in your granary. So having multiple types of food production is relatively not something so useless contrary to how it was in original games.

Now, there are 2 more important melee fighter options alongside swordsmen. Sergeant at arms and templar knights, which (other than armor) requires pikes and maces, respectively. Sword production is not the only important weapon production anymore. In this game, european archers are better than arabic archers, so opting to craft regular longbows are not obsolete anymore. Horse archers are way more squishy and fire way slower while on the move, all archers are way more accurate and they do not miss horse archers anymore. Mantlets are way weaker to arrow damage, it's not possible to just create 100 mantlets and have an invincible army. Mantlets cannot go on walls anymore, so you can't just build one tower and a few archers and a mantlet, and have the most unbreakable defense ever. Knights, sergeant at arms, and arabian melee cavalry are all very expensive units, so training swordsmen does not become something obsolete when you are short on money. Some siege engines are way more expensive than they were in original games, and some of them are also even cheaper, making them relatively more balanced. If you want to have a strong army, you will have to train some of those expensive units, and that will constantly keep your economy in check and you won't be swimming in meaningless amounts of gold. Gold will be important throughout the game. All of the things I've counted by now clearly shows how more balanced and therefore, a better gameplay this game provides compared to previous games.

The siege engines do not knockback units they hit as they did in Stronghold 2 anymore. Even though it was fun to watch your hapless enemies in that situation, it was inarguably overpowered. However, siege engines do knock soldiers down from walls when they hit them, and that is an instant kill regardless of what type of soldier it is. (and in Stronghold 2, crossbowmen would survive those falls) This is much better, and more realistic.

Did I mention that the game got an optimisation update roughly more than 6 months ago? Yes, I already did. I must admit, the game looked promising but it was literally unplayable before the patch came out because of the massive FPS drops in skirmish games. But now, that's all gone, it only happens rarely when you are nearing the maximum number of buildings limit in a full on 8 player game. And it mostly depends on how strong your computer is, really. If your system cannot run some of the games that came out last year, it might as well be pretty normal that you are having problems while trying to run this game. For that, I would only advise you to upgrade your machine. Other than FPS problems, a lot of bugs the reviewers have pointed out are also gone as well, sure still a few might happen from time to time like cross positioned models, knights not being able to mount horses and archers not being able to mount war wagon while they are moving, but it occurs rarely and doesn't make the game anything short of enjoyable.

There surdenly is more action since you build larger armys and this make the castle defending and attacking more fun.
In general I like it.

However the graphics could need an update if the series are gona survive, including some new thinking such as trade with offmap countrys where we have to build ships and ports to cross waters ect.. In general larger maps would also be nice. In general the game need to evolve if it is going to survive.
I think much of the bad reviews the game have is not nessesary reflect the game that well.. Personaly I think it is okay but yes price level i would say is to high for a game that look and plays very much like in previous titles.. as I said the game need to evolve.

I was grateful for the chance to play for free for the weekend. Here are my honest thoughts.

First of all, it is NOT worth $50. Not ever. Not under any circumstance. It is an insult the game originally sold for so much.

It is worth $10, which is how much it is on sale right now. It brings up the first Stronghold Crusader on par with Stronghold 2 and Stronghold legends. Those games came out in 2005 and 2006 respectively. There are changes to gameplay mechanics (changes, not improvements), and slight improvements to the graphics. The models are relatively the same, with a few new units added. They work the same. The voice acting is still the same. The AI still follow the same patterns of play, and are beat with the same strategies. In fact, Stronghold Legends added 100x more to the franchise as a step up from Stronghold 2, than Stronghold Crusader 2 had in the 10 years since Legend's release

BUT, Stronghold 2, Stronghold Legends, and Stronghold Crusader 2 in and of themselves are really awesome games. They are a ton of fun to play, especially with friends. I'd highly recommend any of them at $10. Just keep in mind you are buying a clone of a 10+ year old game with new paint.",1459550799,1459550799,True,3,0,0.473820507526397705,0,True,False,False

By having played ALL the stronghold saga games i'm surprised how lot of people consider this game a better and improved version of SC1, i'm sure it's just the exact opposite.
This looks more like a medieval dlc of the sims instead of a stronghold game.
I'll just talk about the little i've experienced in my 111 minutes online and 10 hours offline gameplay:

PROS:
-There's ''Stronghold'' in it's title

CONS:
-optimization: i don't have a powerful gaming PC but it still satisfies the minimum reqs, and i still can't play the game at more than 20 fps into the tutorial
-graphs: ugly ugly and ugly, even Stronghold 2 had better graphics
-interface: horrible SC3 hud, more than half of the screen it's hud, can't even see what i'm doing because of the hud, the captioned chat covers what remains hud-free on the screen, why even bother making a game at this point, just cover all the monitor with an hud
-buildings: the proportions between walls/towers and eco building are completely wrong, walls are so thick you could grow a farm into them and towers are horribly flat
-castle building: the finished castle looks always ugly, there's literally no physical space for creativity
-units: they have been fixed but the cp still doesn't work 100%, and there are missing too many of them from the original one, they ofted wander around 
-economy: they have been rebalanced but they're still completely wrong imho, nigga 200 wood for a windmill whaaaaat
-ai: can't say that much, game crashes with 2+ ai
-price: no, just no

Keep playing at stronghold crusader 1 instead.

If you're looking for AOE 2 or RON or EE or anything similiar, this isn't it.

I think of myself as experienced, having played all of the titles listed above and conquered them on the hardest diff, including missions. 

Then comes SC2. This game is just weird. Certain building area's, food goes so fast, peasants are just moody fucks, and the AI just loves ninja's. 

There has to be ONLY one way to start your city out in this game. Like it micromanages the shit compared to RTS's like Starcraft 2 which are SLOWER paced then this game. If you can play this game on full speed and win, congrats, you know the trick.

I have tried. Several times since I bought this POS for 60 dollars long ago and I just can't do it. I install it, get my ass handed to me by AI in Skirms, either ""campaign based"" or just random and get rolled over.

I don't get it. I understand the different buildings and how they work, I understand the fundamentals of the game but the AI are just punishing. They either go super ninja after my king ( AKA when my shit ass army is out protecting my lumberjacks or farms ) OR go straight for my buildings ( AKA when my army is inside the castle trying to keep that dumbass king alive ).

It's not complex. I just don't enjoy games that require you to have ONE set starting build in order to survive. The pressure gets put on right out of the gate and they have like tier 5 units coming in with a set of 4 and can wipe 30 of my basic shit units within the first 5 minutes.

It's just brutal on normal. If you crank it down to Easy ( I THINK ) it becomes dull because they don't do anything. I honestly think the AI are a bunch of hardcore cheating bastards by how their base and amount of buildings vs mine within the first 3 minutes of the game looks.

- some bad animations
- totally other controls than in SHC 1
- No one like this sh**** zooming & map rotating
- ??? weapon/armor system (better in Crusader #1)
- more than 70% of this game is more worse than Crusader I.
- when you don't need help, AI already defending your castle
- when you play balanced game, Enemy AI already attacking you instead of attacking other allies, too.
- you can't build walls/tower/etc. anywhere => you have given place where you can only build buildings and your castle like in a Stronghold 1-3
- you can build building with catapults and rams everywhere on map
- your army is recruited from Barracks instead of slaves' campfire (like in a SHC 1)

When I first started I thought they could have done more with the graphics. I noticed they got rid of things like having honor to train troops, trenches/moats, gate with a draw bridge (I really liked it), and a lot of castle cosmetics such as a basket of rock to place on wall to drop on enemies.

I did like how they changed the way you do battle in skirmish mode. You can set it up to battle against every lord on the map instead of them battling among themselves. In other words they focus completely on you. That’s a really nice feature they added. 

They have some new troops or at least to me. There are some troops that throw fire bombs. They’re great for defending your gate. Get enough of them throwing bombs in one spot and watch enemies turn into crispy critters. Being able to download new maps in Steams workshop is also nice.

BUT the game crashes and acts funny too much for what they’re asking for it. For example I noticed there were a few troops sitting outside my gate that wouldn’t die. No Problem right? Well I couldn’t repair my walls and had to reload game because they were close to breaching my walls. Also, they were killing all of my bowman I had sitting in a tower. After reloading game I saw the troops in question all at once die.

Other things like dragging and dropping were you want to be on the map stops working after a battle. I'm so sick of having to reload the game for small problems. it does work but it seems the more I play it the more bugs I notice. The bugs must be like germen cockroaches because they can't seem to get rid of them and the game has been out long enough.

I felt I got ripped off myself and I bought the game on sale. It’s an okay game. But this has to do with whether I would recommend it or not. That’s why I’m giving it a thumbs down.",1455144332,1455254654,False,8,0,0.551189720630645752,0,True,False,False

- The gameplay and the units are still the same: build your castle, your army and defeat the enemy lords with your superior economy and military. It really feels good to command endless units in desert warfare, while fighting with the constant need for gold, popularity and supplies. SHC2 gameplay is a bit more stale in the economic side, but more mobile in the military side and the new units+buildings fit very much into it.
- The Skirmish mode is what carries the game on its back: largely customizable games against and with the AI and human players provide virtually endless possibilities. You can even work on the same castle with your friend, and the AI can be quite challenging even for veteran players with its offensive attitude. Creating and shaping castles on your own style is the true beauty of this game and succeeding in defending it gives a rare feeling of accomplishment, even from game to game.
- Player customization feels alright. You can choose your own crest, your own name and building style, and there is no more need for some casual play. However, there is no option to differentiate yourself more with i.e. some lifetime stats or ranks. There are achievements, sure, but they don't feel as much yours as some custom accomplishments, as everyone can earn them.
- In story and character detail, Crusader 2 is sort of a setback compared to Stronghold or Stronghold Crusader's skirmish trails. There is virtually no story in any point of the game, and AI characters have descriptions no longer than a few lines. While the game partially succeeds in hiding the importance of a story for playing skirmishes all the time, the skirmish trails still feel bland for not having at least an average storyline.

All in all, while Stronghold Crusader 2 may not appear strong story-wise, it delivers excellent gameplay and a great feeling for it. 8/10",1451781866,1451781866,True,4,0,0,0,True,False,False

""Place your stockpile sire!"" ~ Right in the nostalgic feels. 

I've been playing the Stronghold games on hard-copy ever since I was a nipper and I've spent untold amount of hours on these bloody games, over-throwing the wolf in the original campaign and making dozens of different scenarios in Stronghold: Crusader's customizable skirmishes. We won't mention Stronghold 2 or 3 however. So you can imagine just how excited I was when I see Stronghold: Crusader II announced! 

[u]First Impressions:[/u]
[list][*] Nostalgic feeling.
[*] Gameplay & controls are the same. 
[*] Graphics are the same as Stronghold 2/3. Hardly much improvement. If any.
[/list]

[u]Positives:[/u]
[list][*] Retains all the qualities of a Stronghold game. Have I already mentioned it's nostalgic?
[*] Plenty of campaign options and DLC for bonus content.
[*] Thankfully they've incorporated a custom skirmish mode, unlike some previous Stronghold games. 
[*] Multiplayer is fun - but testing. 
[/list]

[u]Negatives:[/u]
[list][*] They've removed some content; 
Such as when you click on a building, you could select between ""Bow"" and ""Crossbow"" for example. Now you need to build separate buildings for these and many other things you used to once be able to make your buildings multi-purpose.
[*] They've removed mini-video content of the buildings when you used to click on them. 
[*] There's very little that's new. This just feels like the first Stronghold Crusader - very disappointing. 
[/list]

[u]Overall:[/u]
This game is most definitely NOT worth the price it's been retailed at. I am a massive Stronghold fan and sure, they've had their ups and downs with previous games, but I thought they might've made this game the polished diamond of the series thus far - however, it falls very short of being anything better than the first Stronghold Crusader game.

I'm very saddened they haven't ventured anywhere new with the game. The units are the same, apart from a few new additional units you can purchase from the Mercenary Camp. Otherwise, they've taken A LOT of the content away and made the game feel very bare... No, I'm not even joking. 

I'd rate this game 4/10, it's very disappointing. 
They've gone nowhere new with it and even stripped it back, making it feel empty. Disappointed sums it up.",1451690718,1451690718,False,5,1,0.565037548542022705,0,True,False,False

I am a huge fan of the original game. This is just horrendous. 
Let me list a few of the biggest flaws. 

50/50 Building Limit? are you f*king kidding me? A limit? There was no limit in the first game, you could build as big as you wanted too. I was in a multiplier game, and then I hit this limit, I immediately exited the game. I will not play with limitations, my computer has 32gb of memory, 4.6ghz processing power. I can play multiple games at the same time and experience no lag, and yet I'm limited to a measly 50 building and 125 people, what the f*ck is wrong with you?

What do you think happened to Maxis with Simcity5 and their ""We will not build bigger maps"" excuse., they're no longer in business! Everyone was fired. And now City Skylines has taking over that arena with millions of players. and has no limitations. Its brilliant. best game ever made for modders. 

Ok, on to the next, There is absolutely nothing new to this game at all, its the same assets with 3d graphics.Which is fine, if it was made correctly. The graphics actually suck. They're pathetic, like they could of been made 5 years ago. The animations are just terrible. 

Bugs:
Mouse Disappears consistently.
Horse archers don't even shoot when attacked they sit there and die.

GAME IS UNBALANCED, resources take too long. And with a building limit, ultimately. you're screwed.You have like 20 apple, cheese, pig farms and yet you're running out of food for no reason (too slow)

The BEST part of this game, is the stone walls, the animation as its breaking down, and the building of how they interact with the buildings.

The game play is fun, and the supply chains are fun, but the central focus of the game is on combat. The combat controls and AI are pretty horrible,  There isn't even an attack-move command. Your huge siege force needs to be seriously babied for them to be even remotely successful, which makes many of the potentially more fun units useless. I can't even seem to figure out how to get my flaming hay launcher to actually shoot at invading troops. Also no range indicators on siege engines mean a lot of guesswork especially when there are height differences in terrain.

The game also just doesn't seem very polished. It won't even change the sound over when I plug in my headphones, I have to completely exit the game and renter for it to work. And unlike the 10-year old first game, you can't customize your castle's staircases, and it doesn't draw entraces to towers on your walls. Your units literally port up to the top of towers. You also have less options for putting things on the walls of your castles like trebuchets. Instead, ballistas and such are defensive wooden towers on their own, but don't even connect with your stone walls. Also gone are all non-stone castles, save wooden barricades that get burnt down pretty much instantly.

If you can get it on a large sale, I'd say pick it up, but this Isn't a sequel to stronghold crusader 2, it's a reskin of a 10 year old game, with nothing new and no improvements to AI. Not worth the price.

It's like they purposely set out to make the worst game ever.  Not only that but they took a concept that was really successful and tweaked it just enough to make it suck.  After Stronghold 2 came out I had high hopes.  I really don’t see how the franchise can continue with this big ugly pile of Sh#t staring them in the eye.  I mean, this game is so bad that if I was in a room with Hitler and a copy of this game and they gave me two bullets I would shoot the game twice in the hopes that no fragment of its existence could further taint the outside world.  Who ever made this game I just want you to know…..the day you made this a box of puppies died.  I own all but one of the Stronghold games but I am afraid this will be the last.  I have completely lost faith in them after this.  Here is why…

1. Building a castle is just not possible.  The block segments just don’t want to line up and sometimes when you build  gatehouse it just simply deletes wall segments that would connect it to the wall.  If there is any kind of incline or attitude to the building surface the game cannot compensate and the wall won't close up.  

2.  The economics in the game are so F&*%ed they could double as a Call Girl in Bangkok. They tried to make everything more realistic by increasing prices but failed to adjust for it properly.  With a zero growth population one min you have 400 food and the next it is all gone.  Stone, Iron, Wood, and food gather rates all fluctuate or no reason!

3.  Unkillable units.  Sometimes there will be a unit on a wall and it will be in such a position that it will not be visible to archers and your units can't reach it. This means that they can fire at you but you cannot get to them.  I have played the game for 11 hours and already lost 2 assaults in this fashion because the units get confused between two targets and just go back and forth.  

4. DLC….so wait, you want me to buy more of your crap after I see this broken POS? I have two words, Get F$%#ed! This is such a pathetic tactic.  If you are a game that is as good as AOE or The Total War Series then yes, you can hold content hostage because the game is good enough!  YOUR GAME ISNT EVEN CLOSE!   


I got this game on sale for 1/5th the retail price and I STILL regret buying it.  If you are thinking about buying this game, do not.  Take the money, wipe you’re a#$ with it and toss it in the toilet because that would be of more use and you would likely receive more satisfaction from that.

One issue i have though is there is Easy mode and normal mode not hard mode officially, but for me normal and easy are very far apart ie: easy is too easy but can take up to an hour plus to win latter maps and normal is too hard on certain small maps, there is nothing inbetween which does take away from the game for me.

 In normal mode u just seem to get an endless wave of troops coming at you so if you do not get a good defense up in lightening speed your screwed cause they just keep on coming and once they reach ur walls ur dead cause u cannot repair them while they are attacking your walls.

 So yeah the ai has very little tactic it either just does the slow mode on easy or a constant flow of troops on normal. But its still fun but not worth full price imo

I was a massive stronghold fan over the years, started playing at the original. So with many of the other die hard fans I was over the moon when they announced the new release. At the original price I was unable to afford it at the release, With the massive sale I had a few extra coins and decided to purcahse the game on sale.

After extensive reading of the reviews I decided that the risk is worth the price at sale, even though the sales warned against the game.

I was ver sad that I didn't listen to the reviews and saved a few bucks. Here is a quick review and a take about my experience.

The following is what I have experienced to date:

The Pro's:

Similiar game play with little to no changes to the overall feel of the game;
Finally able to afford the game at sale price,

The Con's:

Similiar game play with little to no changes to the overall feel of the game;
Litle to nonexistant single player campaign;
Graphics are pretty much the same;
Waste of money and time;

I started with the first stronghold a few years ago (maybe ten?) and loved the concept of building my own... stronghold! The economy part, the building and the fighting made a great balance in this game.
Then in crusader we had just to fight in deserts... Understandable, but personal I prefer lush areas much more. Anyway - the gameplay evolved with merchenaries and this game feeled even more addictive. (I played over 100h in an non-steam-version.)

Crusader 2 feels mixed to me, because of the lack of water ditches and tunnel diggers, the simplified gameplay for siegebuilders and just a few npcs before all of this overpriced ""a few missions more and 2 npcs"" DLCs.
The good side is, that this game now runs very smooth on my system (lagged a lot at the beginning, even with an gtx 770), we have an multiplayer with building A.I back and some of the missions are really challenging.

I would say - if you can get this game in sale, just try it.

-Random events negatively impact your popularity. Who honestly thought this was a good idea?
-No real innovation. The only new things here are the Templar Sergeant, the Slave Driver, the Arabian equivalent of the Crusader Knight, that stupid ass dude with the dreadlocks, the War Wolf (which is just a catapult with more HP) and the Hussite Clown Car. Weather is new, but it serves no purpose other than to hinder progress.
-No collision detection in an RTS. As a result, melee fights degenerate into blobs of stacked units flailing about.
-The UI. Why whoever designed the UI chose to ignore the perfectly sensible UI seen in the first two games and decide that the best solution would be spread all relevant information to the far corners of the screen is anyone's guess.

Game mechanics has changed, players would not be able to exploit all the little bugs and tricks associated with the old stronghold crusader. High cost of buildings makes mistakes more costly. The introduction of the healer unit was a welcome breath of fresh air which has helped to offset the impact of the nerfs across the board i.e. long cooldown between launching mad cows and more, which have helped to balance the game. Pikemen have now become strategic chokepoint units, something which makes pikemen more relevant as the ultimate defensive unit. Players can look forward to a certain degree of challenge when playing this game. (Coming from someone who completed the entire stronghold crusader series)

This game,in it's very core is the Stronghold Crusader. However certain tweaks and changes in the gameplay are showing.

Resource management is quite different and slow-paced compared to the original.

Some units are nerfed and some are buffed (Crossbowman are now Gods amongst soldiers and Horse Archers are not the harass units that will carry your game any longer.)

Some units that was added to the game ARE wonderful (Healers,for instance will heal your soldiers and Lord,allowing to sustain your army without depleting treasury and allow your Lord to get into engagements giving him a more active role in defence of your keep)

Some units are not. (Sergeant is an heavly armored unit that buff the soldiers around him.If mass produced,he just creates an army of Mary Sue's that is very hard to counter.)

The castle building system is atricious. For example,instead of putting your tower mounted siege weapons on the top of the castle towers which was one of the trademark features of the Stronghold franchise devs decided to put the on ugly looking wooden turrets that come with the onagers. You have no option of putting them on turrets neither. There are no ditches,which was just cringe for me. No low walls so you could stop laddermen from climbing up. Towers also give little to no protection for your archers against the enemy archers which are low ground. I have seen my 42 arabian archers get completely annahilated by crossbowmen that were low ground. Towers are in variety also extremely lacking. There are only 3 types of towers in the game. They all look like the defensive turrets from SC in varying sizes which was just extremely sad thing for me to see.

Good graphics makes watching your citizens work and complete production cycles even more fun. 

Housing system is also quite brilliant. Closer the hovels to the keep more population it brings to you (maximum being 8 and minimum 2) however that drastically changes their cost.

Variety in buildings were quite disturbing. Lack of chapels and cathedrels are filled with Church. There are no ''good and bad''  buildings from the original series neither (gallows,bear dance,gallows,statues...)

I would also like to state that besides the burning haystack throwing onager the mounted siege weapons are also pretty much useless.

This game is NOT the Stronghold Crusader that we played and loved years ago. However it is still worth a shot since devs are updating. I am hoping they will bring back the good old buildings from the original game and HOPEFULLY fix the atricious mounted siege equipments. This hope is the reason I recommend this. I guess being a die-hard fan also helps. This game is fun,however if you are expecting SC you will be dissapointed.

I bought the bundle this weekend when on sale. I am running windows 10 and cannot get a SINGLE title from this bundle to run properly or even at all! Crusader II runs, but i have the option of a BIG  UGLY 1024x768 resolution...OR... as firefly's support says I can DELETE my options.xml file EVERY TIME, BEFORE I FIRE THE GAME UP, to reset it to whatever my desktop resolution is. But then, when you exit the game, it re-writes the options file to the messed up settings and you start at square one again. LOL!!!!

That solution they provided merely makes the game run the same resolution as your desktop for THE FIRST TIME ONLY (as it recreates the options.xml file AGAIN). BUT THEN... sure its at 1920x1080 and looks to be all good but the MOUSE IS THEN OFFSET by like 10 pixels DOWN and to the RIGHT of every button in the game!!!!!!! You have to actually NOT point at buttons/things and PURPOSELY click in the wrong spot on the screen to make them click! Ridiculous!!!

Very frustrating. But it doesn't end there! The OTHER 2 titles that come with this awesome sale bundle price of $60(sarcasm there folks) do not run on windows 10 AT ALL!

Both Crusader HD/Extreme HD TRY to install ""game ranger"" (REALLY? FREAKING GAME RANGER?? for multiplayer???) Give me a break!  

Anyway, the gameranger install crashes because of a .NET Framework issue with compatibility in windows 10. So then the install process just crashes over and over again... the BOTTOM LINE IS...

NOT ONE SINGLE TITLE IN THIS BUNDLE WOULD RUN AFTER more than 3 hours of my time trying to hunt down solutions for these problems only to find out ... there ARE NO LEGITIMATE SOLUTIONS AT THIS TIME.

This studio has been leeching off the success of its games released over a decade ago. They have failed to come out with anything good in relation to the ""Stronghold"" series since those first two games. Don't take my word for it, look at metacritic. This game is not fun.

Lastly, Firefly Studios, you really disappointed me with your customer service. I ordered the game with a description stating that I *would* receive the bonus campaigns, but I never received them.

As a long time fan of the Stronghold series, this game was such a let down.  Yes, it is *technically* a Stronghold game, and it technically is the sequel to Crusader, but overall it is not even close to being on par with the rest of the series.

--First, the Good--

At its core, the concept of Stronghold is still the same here.  You'll start off building a settlement, gathering resources via a supply chain, ultimately crafting weapons to arm a force of soldiers.

There are familiar units: Archers, Macemen, Crossbowmen (Crusader).  Horse Archers, Slaves, Assassins(Arabic)..as well as some new ones, including the Healer and many other Arabic mercenaries not previously seen. You can build walls, towers, siege weapons and all sorts of defense mechanisms for keeping the black knight at bay.On top of that, many familiar faces return, such as The Rat, Richard the Lionheart and more.

The game is, of course, a 3d Model game, bringing the Crusader series at least one generation ahead.

And...that's about it.  Honestly.  If you were a fan of the original series, it may warm your heart to actually have some new Stronghold content to play with, but there really isn't anything new and exciting here.

--Now, the Bad...where do I begin?--

First of all, the game is somewhat broken.  There are plenty of times where characters models won't animate, and it's not uncommon for characters to simply float across the map in the standard model ""christ pose"" without any animation.  Even the oxen who carry the stone in the game would freeze when moving on an angle.  Stone walls are another mess.  Too often, staircases would end up with a wall piece right in the middle of them, creating a strange unrealistic graphical error.  These are only some of the visual phenomenen that occur while playing.

That brings me to another issue...wall building.  Not only do walls cost way too much in this game, but there is pretty much no room for creativity when building your castle.  In the original/Crusader 1, you had so much control over every little aspect of your wall design.  You could build walls of all different heights, staircase pieces, granulated walls all down to the very last square.  This gave us castle builders so much of a blank canvas that virtually anything was possible if we knew how to use those pieces the right way.

In Crusader 2, 90% of the wall building is done for you when clicking.  A wall piece is pre-built for you to include parapits on one side, a wall space, and parapits on the opposite side.  You can no longer just build a simple piece of stone wall, the basic building block (almost literally) of the original series' castle building element.  Sure, you can add towers and all kinds of siege weaponry, but the fun and joy of really creative a keep down to the last detail is completely lost here.

The cost of walls adds to another huge gripe with this game...balance.  It's my understanding that a patch has re-balanced some of the economy issues, but the game is still WAY too unbalanced when trying to get your city up and running.  Too often I find myself running out of resources right at the beginning of a match, even when set to give myself a huge advantage over my AI counterparts.  For example, a windmill in this game costs 200 wood.  In the original? 20.  So it costs literally 10 times as much here.  That would be fine, except woodcutters don't harvest 10 times as much wood here.  They harvest roughly the same amount as before.  

This leads to a TON of waiting around to gather resources right from the git-go of any match.  Sure, there was always that element in the original (as with any RTS), but there is a considerable difference here.  I feel like I'm not getting anywhere, even though I have what would otherwise be the basics of a civilization in place.

Ah, civilization...a thriving, breathing melting pot of people going about their daily lives, each contributing to their society in their own way, all while maintaining their own unique personality...yeah, Stronghold Crusader 1 was a fantastic game.  Say goodbye to that here.  

I mean, sure...you get to see the workers doing what they do in 3D, but it's not the same.  Peasants say NOTHING when you click on them.  No Monty Python-esque man impersonating a woman ""morning your lordship!"" or ""no taxes is good taxes, that's my motto!"", just silence.  No adding flowers, maypoles, dancing bears, gauntlets, guillotines, stretching racks...good/bad popularity control is just gone.

Speaking of voices (ha), this might be one of the most dissapointing aspects of Crusader 2, and I honestly didn't see it coming.

The voice acting in this game is TERRIBLE.  I mean that in every sense of the word.  I have friends who can do cooky voices that would have been better candidates.

A great example is the men-at-arms.  Remember the way they sounded in Stronghold 2?  They were dopey lummixes, and rightfully so given their rank.  Or how about their original counterpart, the spearmen?  They were rough, working class fighters ready to stick a spear in whatever you tell them to.

Here's what I want you to do:  We're gonna do a test.  I want you to read the next sentence I say in quotes out loud.  Don't use any exciting voice, or cooky impersonation, or anything.  Use your normal speaking voice.  Ready?  Okay, say this out loud:

""Man at arms, ready.  Close ranks.""

Congratulations!  You've just landed a gig providing voice over work for a video game! 

The level of enthusiasm in these vocal takes can only be described as the bare minimum.  Without trying to be funny, I've found myself honestly wondering if they simply had one of the programmers provide voices.  As annoying as he was, we all have to admit that at least The Rat had a memorable personality.  His voice has now been replaced with some Joe Everyguy off the street.  You'll forget him as soon as you end the game.

To be fair, I need to point something else out, though, about the voice over work, and that's that there are a lot of recycled vocal takes from previous games.  Archers still sound like archers, crossbowmen like crossbowmen, etc.  However, it's about 50/50 as far as which characters use the classic voices, and which use Joe Everyguy.

It might sound petty to be so bitter about this, but as (I'm assuming, since you've read this far) you are a die-hard Stronghold fan, then you KNOW how important the voices are to this series.  They are the character, the personality and the life of the game!  They're what make you feel like you are controlling living, breathing people of all different sorts, whose lives hang at your fingertips!  

The original games did all of that in spades, and they weren't even 3D rendered!

--The Bottom Line--

I haven't played much of this game, but I'm fairly confident that won't change.  I could go on forever about the other issues that are impossible to ignore (such as the buildings and terrain feeling like they're from two different games), but I feel I've beaten my own horse to death here.

From what I gather, a team of less than 10 people programmed this game.  I don't mean this review as offense to them specifically.  They created a game, like they said they would.  They accomplished something that I, of course, haven't...but it's almost like giving credit to Nickelback.  I may hate their music, but at the end of the day they're creating albums and I'm sitting behind my keyboard judging people.

That being said, it doesn't mean that I have to LIKE Nickelback.

That was a bad way to end this review. Sorry to take a punch at an easy target.

Judge me all you want for that, just please don't buy this game.  It's something you can't take back.

-Les graphismes bon ok ce n'est pas le plus important mais c'est a peine plus beau que stronghold 2 sortit en 2005 ! Pourquoi diable firefly s'entête à faire leur jeux en 3D?? Ils n'y arrivent pas ! c'est mal optimisé pour ce que c'est et c'est moche , vide... ! Un belle 2D aurai été grandement plus bénéfique .

-Le gameplay mon dieux que c'est lent ! sauf pour les IA bizzarement mdr tout est plus chere que le premier ce qui tue la fluidité et la rapidité du jeu qui étais bonne dans le premier quand on connaissais les ficelles de l'économie. BIensur le nombre de troupe est ULTRA LIMITE et merci qui ? merci au moteur 3D qui pue...
Certain élément du premiers ont disparue comme les douves , moin de construction pour les défenses du chateaux : pas de tour carré , ronde , de défense ext.. juste une de guet , tour moyenne et grande et pis basta au final les chateaux se ressemble tous plus ou moin bof ! 

-Le son bah rien d'extraordinaire mise a part les voix qui nous donnes envie de nous jeter par la fenetre avec l'ordi mdr
Les voix sont RIDICULE , déja un peu dans le premier mais ils avaient leur charme ! la c'est vraiment d'un surjoué ! et puis bon dieux quand le scribe annonce un message de l'ia c'est vraiment craignos exemple : Vous avez un message de richard... mdr on parle de richard coeur de lion pas de richard le pagu du coin ! bordel sa c'est du détaille qui fais tache !

I recommend this for the following people: 

Never played a Stronghold game and is interested in giving it a try.
Looking to scratch that Crusader itch but cant stand the previous games graphics.

I do not recommend this for anyone looking for something new in the series. Firefly studios has failed to do anything substantive with their series and its following ever since the first Crusader was a success. This Stronghold proudly follows in this manner.


The following did annoy me a bit:

The UI is clunky and outdated. Things are hidden away or put in obscure places that dont need to be.
Pathing is terrible. The pathing example for first time coders, 'Ants' on Netbeans does a better job.
Units dont seem to like being on walls.
Quirks from the previous Crusader like the tongue in cheek humour from clicking on peasents is gone.
Unit graphics are over all poor.

To me this just seems largely reflective of the gaming industry as a whole. Lacking direction and decisiveness specifically in regard to a singular vision.

While I agree with the complaints regarding the cost of the game and the DLC, this would not put me off recommending the game, nor would the removal of some units and the slight dumbing down of the strategy.  In my opinion this is more than made up for by the major improvement to the wall and castle building which now works well and looks really good.

I am running the game at maximum settings and it is running very smoothly, although I cannot comment on multiplayer as I do not use it for this type of game.  To be honest, I would be very happy playing the game but for one thing.  The camera.

When buidling, it would be really usefull to be able to tilt the camera, but I realise adding tilt could be rather difficult.  The ability to zoom out much further than at present should however be feasible.  At present, even on minimum zoom, you can see only a small fraction of what is happening around you.  Even with a fairly small castle being attacked on several sides, you can spend more time controlling the camera than controlling your forces, it is almost impossible to take in the big picture.

To start off, I am a fan of the series. I played 'Stronghold' and 'Stronghold: Crusader' (and a bit of Stronghold 2) quite a few years ago and have rediscovered them again on Steam recently. While the two classics have been made compatible with newer hardware and are still fun to play (and are a no brainer if you find them on sale), you cant help but think they could do with a complete remake. I think this is the closest we will get for now...

When I first saw this game, I practically ignored it. Having experienced 'Stronghold 2' and 'Stronghold Legends' in the past, I knew the series wasnt in the best place. I also read/watched reviews of 'Stronghold 3' when it came out and decided it wasnt worth getting. This game being in the Steam sale caught my interest, and I decided to research it a little. I then decided it looked alright and went ahead with the purchase. Having bought this and played several hours, I have already decided it was definatly worth it!

The gameplay, unlike the other sequels, resembles the original two games, in my opinion. Although it may be basic in some areas, it is still enjoyable and i find is well balanced between the economy and combat aspects (you need to work efficiently on both to win). The graphics, while not too impressive by todays standards, look nice, and again, resemble the original 'Crusader' in some ways. The sound effects and voice acting can get a bit repetitive and annoying, but im sure these can be turned down/off in the options. 

Although the game comes with several Campaign trails, I only played a couple, and then went straight into custom games, so I can't comment on them. There are plenty of maps to choose from, depending on the amount of opponents. There also seem to be lots of community maps too (which is a strong point of the original 'Stronghold'). The AI can present a real challenge in certain games and situations, but also can be too easy at lower difficulties, but I guess you can tailor the game to how difficult you want it.

Overall, I am enjoying this game from my first few hours, and it has restored a bit of confidence in the series for me. Hopefully, the amount of community maps will continue to grow, and I will continue to enjoy the game. Its not 100% perfect, but if you are a fan of the original two games, I would say this is at least worth looking in to.",1434936308,1434936308,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The devs said over and over while the game was in development that they were trying to recreate the fast paced skirmish mode feel you got when you played the origional stronghold crusader. While this is a good intention, the end result pretty much adds up to the enemy sending countless waves of small suicide squadrons to your castle CONSTANTLY, never bothering to create larger seige forces as a reaction to your castle growing larger. It is flat out tedious. At the end of a skirmish match when it says you killed literally around 3,000 enemy archers, you just want to smack yourself in the face.

They also majorly streamlined the popularity and economic systems from previous games, so now keeping your people happy is as simple as making sure they have food. Making money boils down to making ridiculously high numbers of breweries and candle shops so your peasants are happy enough that you can raise your taxes. So your castle will always be the biggest candle factory and beer company in the Holy Land. Thats very realistic.

Apart from that, they also decided to take out the funny little things your peasants said when you click on them, which is kinda sad, and they descided to release more AI opponents two by two in DLCs, after only giving you an insulting eight opponents at launch, while the origional Crusader gave you eleven at launch. and for this high price? its a rip off.

In stead of simply mining for your bread, SHC2 has you grow the wheat with one building, turn the wheat into flour with another, and then has yet another building which turns your flour into bread. 

This is pretty much the most decisively different feature that sets SHC2 apart from other similar RTS titles. Other than that, the game is all about right-click attacking with your troops. Look up some game play on youtube. Literally, what you see is what you get.

I then saw this game on the Steam Homepage and got overly excited. As a kid I played many RTS games and there have not been very many that seem to grab my attention now. 

After playing the game it met every expectation I had. I wanted something more in-depth with castle building and walls. For the fact that you can actually place troops on top the your walls was amazing, as most of the games I had played just used walls as... well walls. The game also takes a fair amount of time to win each battle, there are times where you can rush in and destroy their base in a matter of seconds but I enjoy the difficulty in destroying others. 

If you are looking for an in-depth Castle Building RTS this is the game for you!

I have been a fan of the Stronghold series for a number of years now and have put countless hours into each game. Crusader 2, in my opinion, is a good step forward and remains true to the spirit of the epic games before it. There are differences between this and the original; however, to me it is just as enjoyable (now if only I had a pc that could run it on higher than low graphics).

Some points of the game:

-It can be difficult to grasp for someone who isn't already familiar with the series.
-The new animations are great!
-It is much more difficult to keep your peasants happy than in the previous crusader. This might make it more difficult, though it also adds a new, realistic element to siege warfare in the game since it allows you to ""starve"" your opponent, so to speak.
-The newly added troop and building limit is disappointing to someone like me who enjoys building up a gigantic army and then wiping out the rest of the players who cannot resist my shear numbers. Although, if you play with a more active, offensive style, you are unlikely to reach it in an average game.
-The price is way too high at the time of this review. I would say it's worth $30, but not $50 like it is priced now. Wait until it's on sale.",1432402608,1432402608,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Well, it lacks some of the original depth. Compared to other Stronghold games, Crusader 2 is extremely focused on the military aspects of things. In a way, I would consider it like Legends: a game that was focused on the combat aspects of the series rather than the castle building. Given that, I would say that it did the job reasonably well.

Whereas prior Stronghold games would ease you into the action, Stronghold Crusader 2 gets you in immediately. You have a dedicated tutorial and a tutorial campaign, but those are no more than the first two or three missions in the other games. After that, the campaigns themselves thrust you right into the thick of it, giving you most of the arsenal quickly. It has to: there's only a few single player campaign missions, and they're not the most complexly designed.

The real meat of the game is the Skirmish mode and trail, which was also Crusader's main focus. Given this, it's sensible that they focused a lot of their efforts on it as that was what people played the most. And it's certainly fun - you'll be pulling your teeth out at points, but that's true for the old games as well. It gives a full gamut of challenge - from simple walkovers with guys like The Rat (as always) up to brutal fights of attrition with top grade AI like The Wolf (who, true to form, throws the latrine at you once the game is underway).

Although there is a challenge, unfortunately much of it comes from just flinging stuff at you. The AI in stronghold was never smart - it finds paths it likes and keeps hammering those points until it breaks or they run out of steam and have to try again. So if you can figure out the AI's general pattern - something most players have done if they've followed the series so far - you can actually fairly easily pin it down and destroy it.

So, your real challenge will likely come from multiplayer. I never touched it myself - I always liked Stronghold for the castle building and the like - but at least there you'll be up against the same tactics you use to send the AI home. That's not to say that singleplayer has no value - it will put you in challenging situations, but it will be more of the being located in a difficult position rather than clever troop movement by the AI.

Presentation wise, the music is solid as ever with plenty of good work from Robert Euvino. The graphics are solid, though I find I usually had to lower them due to my laptop. The background art is also a nice touch; while it's not Richard or Saladin kneeling in prayer as a CGI cinematic as we had in Crusader, it conveys a different kind of mood - and that's fine, Crusader 2 is of a different tone than the original.

If you're looking for a plot, there isn't one. The campaigns have a little story, but it's generic and the singleplayer campaigns are more ways of getting your feet in the sand than anything. The AI character personalities were sadly lacking the charisma of the original game. In some cases it they managed to recapture the original, such as with The Caliph. But other fells flat, such as The Rat or some of the new entrants like The Slave King . Most European units reuse the old VAs, but the new unit voice actors are definitely living up to the originals, with some just flat out gnawing on the scenery, such as the Sergeant-at-Arms. Which works, since that was part of what gave Stronghold its original charm: it was happy to gnaw on the scenery and chew it up to add some flavor, without quite going so far that it can't be taken seriously.

But with the AI characters... for the most part it did not translate. Saladin, the Calpih, and the Shah (replacing SC's Sultan) came over quite well, and Richard did as well though he did lose some of the charisma. Others... didn't really work well. The Rat has the same VA as your grunt Men-at-Arms, and worse, in the Princess & The Pig DLC, the Pig got the same VA, which really did not work at all for him. And from Firefly it's surprising considering that by now they should know that people have a lot of nostalgia; I expected a bit more from bringing back The Pig of all people.

Though, the AI characters do at least play to the original style. Richard spams lots of heavy armor and is an offensive character, Saladin's castles are still pains to get through, and the Pig was actually perfectly replicated with adjustments for different build requirements. They may have a similar end result, but each character brings something different to the party.

Although non-worker peasants no longer walk around your castle, the buildings still have details like rugs or work tools. And no longer is everyone using the same art style that had led to odd situations like Saladin putting up churches with Christian symbols on them. Instead, the game has two different styles of building (primarily applied to your castle fortifications), one for the Europeans, and one for the Arabians, as well as a few reskins and renames (IE, the Arabic factions use Sheep Farms instead of Pig Farms) to fit them thematically.

As to the new content in the game that lacks a counterpart in the original: Special Abilities also added a very nice touch and all the abilities were perfectly reasonable. They did not get in the way and were for the most part useful - Pikemen can actually be the traditional anti-cavalry charge unit now, Macemen as your shock troops live up to it more, and the new Whirling Dervish adds a nice counter to lots of cannon fodder units besides properly set up pitch ditches. The weather I found to be more annoying than anything, but as far as adding more of a challenge to the game they work great.

Overall, I found that Stronghold Crusader 2 is a solid game if you like macro gameplay - general logistical and economic strength feeding into the tactical battles rather than micromanaging every unit. You will be winning or losing based on the health of your castle's economy, and your ability to replace, reinforce, and produce armies. An army marches on its stomach, after all. And being able to build up strong armies is definitely one aspect of the games they brought back in full force.

However, while the battles are definitely of Stronghold flavor, a lot of the rest of the game is missing what made the original games so good. The little touches - children and their mothers loitering around the castle, peasants having an assortment of comments when you click on them based on goings on (they have none in this game), the ability to beautify or terrify the castle with good or bad things, etc. - those are missing. This does admittedly save on the higher graphics compared to the original system, but still, if you really want the full Stronghold experience, I'd recommend one of the older games. Crusader 2 does have Free Build, but without the above it really just feels like a fortified base camp rather than a living, breathing castle town.

To end this review, my advice as a customer to Firefly going forward: Nostalgia means that Crusader 2 is up against a tall order - the immersion especially. Stronghold won a lot of its praise from immersing the player into the Middle Ages, and hit that right balance of humor and severity. Especially when bringing back old characters like The Pig, it's important to recapture it. It's not just the words spoken, but the delivery. Stronghold Crusader 2 had all the tools to live up, no, exceed its predecessors. But it failed on delivering the immersion in full like the original game could. I don't know if that makes sense or not, but while it's clear that the game is the result of a lot of hard work, sometimes it just doesn't pull in. But that's a customer's two cents; take it or leave it, it's an opinion in the air.",1432347606,1432347606,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

A lot of people will complain that this game isn't a true castle sim, and they'd be right on that account.  But, this game plays true to the roots of the original Stronghold Crusader, a fast paced strategy game where you conquer the desert sands for gain and glory!

Pro's:
 - Direct upgrade from Stronghold Crusader in many ways
 - there is actually value to using food other than apples or bread, as was the norm in Crusader
 - keeping your peasants happy is more engaging than ""swamp them with bread and churches""
 - new troops add flexibility to gameplay
 - horse archers + shield wall is no longer an invincible combo
 - soundtrack is phenomenal
 - Ox carts can now transport both stone and metal
 - 3D environment is very nice

Con's:
 - steep learning curve, even I struggled being a 12 year veteran to Crusader
 - the only weakness to Templar's is fire, they mow everything else down
 - siege weapons are now ridiculously expensive
 - AI is a bit unbalanced to make up for their bad tactics
 - not a true castle sim, more of a castle multiplayer/combat game

I get that the devs gave it a shot. The game has a heart. As someone who throughout the year followed firefly studios, it is clear that it is now but a shadow of what it used to be. With very little resources they wanted to do their best.

However, as hard of a shot they gave, to me, everything just fell apart from the very moment you start the game, and here is why:

The artwork is just sad. Egyptian hieroglyph looks better than what we see here. 
UI is terrible, it feels very alpha. *cough* look at that type font *cough*

No economy, just a lifeless corpse of a castle that spits out little clones to either attack or defend it.
If you wanted a sim, like me, you wont see people chatting and going about their lives, there is no micro management. Nothing to see. Where are the citizens, the animations?

Take SH1, just awe at the amount of detail that it had, moss in the walls, cracks in the wood and stone. Even wind ffs.

Unfortunatly, you cannot stop and think: is this just a SH3 reskin with less bugs?

Is it a waste of time? God no. The gameplay is bland but at times, you may find some joy in it. Fans will do a fair bit of it out of pure nostalgia. Smashing walls can be fun.

...I shouldn't have done that.

Stronghold Crusader I is a game i played many dozens of hours, single- and multiplayer. Building a castle and prepare to defend it against hordes of enemies was always thrilling. The economy system was decent and the overall look had a lovely style. With such experiences of the first part, I simply couldn't wait for the next part, expecting new content, 3D graphics and more depth in strategy and tactics. Now i played Stronghold Crusader the Second for some hours, tried multiplayer and singleplayer. All I can say is that it has way too many flaws to give it a positive review. It's simply because of the economic system. The only profitable food source is bread, wood can be bought so cheaply on the market that woodcutter lose their sense, candle maker produce candles without any resources... I simply can't understand how they can design such a system.
The military part on the other hand is actually pretty good! The selection of the units allows great tactics for invading and defending. Archers on towers are darn difficult to kill, but there are ways to overwhelm them. Fire is still a big thing on this game, thankfully! You can still harass enemies in different ways without big attacks and every unit has weaknesses and strengths. I can't get mad at losing when I got dominated with great maneuvers.

But even if the wargame of Stronghold Crusader 2 is nice, it still feels like there's a big hole in the game. I am never satisfied when I am done building a castle because it pretty much looks the same every time: A weapon factory running on bread.

- estates. I want to build castles anywhere I conquer. What is the point of estates? It just really turns it into capture the flag and a limited base building area.
- wall attack is still hard. Bring back the seige towers!
- engineers. They used to be a resource, now they come with the units which are too cheap.

and it's positives:
- its solid. you feel like defending a castle, and walls are a welcome defence in any strategy game.
- it's fun. Even the character animations have humour applied and you feel a sense of enjoyment in creation and defense of your creation.
- it's hard. The campaign gets gradually harder making you come back for one last go, go on just another attempt.
- a thing of beauty. The graphics are 3d but have that old-school charm of the original.

The game is intuitive and everything makes sense and is relatively straightforward to control, e.g., to increase happiness in your town provide enough food, lower taxes, and increase ale!

Loved the original and missed playing it with my partner. So, we forked out the $s on 2 copies so we could play together. Has been a total disaster so far. 

Problems I'm facing: 

* Game is totally unbalanced, so between super hard and completely impossible, even when you make the setting easy and in your favour. 

* Lots of glitches. Eg. Enemy soldier glitched and was stuck on one of my walls. I couldn't kill him,  repair the wall  or build anything near it. Basically killed that match for me and my partner. 

* Game is super laggy. 

* Difficult to select and place items. Sometimes have to click on something multiple times for it to be selected. Very jumpy when placing items. Will end up putting items not where you indicated they should be, so can't make optimal use of space.

Its like all the fun parts of Age of Empires II in terms of castle v castle warefare and economy management. The logistics side of things is much more important here as you must carefully manage your resources lest you totally screw yourself over (run out of food, money, weapons).

It is much more siege-like than other RTS games I feel. Don't let the trailers fool you, no one fields armies that big. Most maps don't support forts large enough to generate such armies and it takes an hour+ to even get to the start of that scale of things. Most battles are small, between packs of units and such. Finishing long before reaching epic war levels.

Additionally - It is a slower paced RTS, which I think is nice. You really must siege your enemy to win. Its almost impossible to storm a castle in one go. Instead you need to take control of resources, starve the enemy, wear them down, and then launch multiple assaults that push progressively farther and father into their defenses to get to the lord.

So, if you like those things, then yay, you'll probably have fun.

Lastly, my chief complaint is that the AI is absolutely aweful. There's no difficulty controls at all. All AI are just what they are. They are also braindead and cheaters. I've burned all my opponents' food, iron, and stone only to watch them continue to send units at me without bothering to rebuild those resources. Lemme tell you... no food = no troops. Its like fighting someone from a scripted campaign where troops are just auto-generated for the story. Its atrocious. 

This is a complicated game to learn. The economy is not like other strategy games and is hard to master. I've never had a problem beating the AI, even on my first aweful try where I ran out of food and had no iron for half the game.

For the only good figthts, you'll have to PvP. That's a big disappointment for me cause I hate RTS PvP. As such, I can't tell you anything about what options there are here for that.",1427369346,1427369346,True,3,0,0.522471904754638672,0,True,False,False

1. those who know the old game, know it well.  That means the most frustrating thing will be learning how to play this new game where it does not match the old one, and there are lots of differences, especially in the convenience corner.  It irks me for example that I have not found yet any way to change the speed of the game to give me think time, and that a lot of my old tricks won't work any more.

2. but in the end, many suffer from the same addiction problem as I, which is we really liked the old game (even with its pittiful AI), but have also played it till the cows come home and there is nothing left in it for us.  When I bring up a scenario in the Crusader I already know how it will go and how it will end, no surprises.  So we have little choice but to get the new game if we want to get a new fix.

3. another dissappointment for me is the apparent lack of campaign missions.  You will recall from Crusader  there are 100 missions, 80 across only two of the campaigns.  This new game has maybe 15.  So there is little replayability here.  This leaves us to look towards multiplayer (maybe a good thing) and playing the computer in freeplay (like starcraft though not as good).

So I have to say, I think FireFly would have done way better if they had just taken the old Crusader game, enhanced the AI in it, and created another 50 mission campaign that they sold as DLC for that game.  @10$, everyone who played the game would have bought it.  Well... there is still time.  If they want to do this they will find a willing audience for it.

I am going to recommend the game, in part hoping that it might be like Stronghold3.  This game was immediately hated too, but for those who thought about the game and what it was really doing it turned out to be much better than originally thought with a more sophistcated resource and industry change in it that I think added depth.  It was a successful attempt to keep the old game feel, but add new options.  But  you have to be patient to see it.

So Stronghold Crusader 2, not an instant hit, not a lot of single player replayability, but if you are looking for a stronghold fix what choice do you have.  Maybe it will grow on us.",1427310115,1427310270,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

I realize this is a ""remake"" of an older game, but the control scheme needed to be remade to be a bit less dated and clunky feeling. There's no attack move vs normal move, there's no queing up actions, and your soliders just do weird shit all the time and don't always listen to you. The ""formation"" thing is totally broken as it will slow your units down by a good 25% because they simply don't move if they're out of position. Your units sort of engage whoever they want to engage and they will engage enemies even if you tell them to flee. There are no hotkeys btw; you must use the UI to do every action.

The economy component is convoluted and hard to manage. Most of the time you're just totally guessing as to how much food your producing and how much gold you're making. Boosting ""happiess"" is a shot in the dark a lot of the times as well. I like that there's so much going on with the economy, don't get me wrong, I just don't like that you have little feedback as to the output of each building and the current demand.

I have played Stronghold, Stronghold 2, and Stronghold Crusader. They are all really great games and I feel that this game is just as good as those.
     Mechanics wise the only gripe I would have with this one is the way houses are made. The closer your house is to your Stronghold the more populated the house becomes, however it also increases in size, so therefore it costs more wood. This isn't a problem on big maps where you can build a house on the border of your territory and it only adds 2 to 3 peasants to your overall population and costs less wood, but in small maps it's difficult because you don't have enough room to make those smaller houses, and all of your houses end up being big with 6-7 more peasants added to the popultaion which naturally means you have that many more mouths to feed, so then you need more farms while the map already has little room to spare.

Troops will run back and forth and never go to the point where they need to be. I don't mind the differences from the first Crusader id just play that if i wanted to its the crashing and bugs that get me. 

I think This game has good potential but is just too annoying to play. The least the makers could do would be to fix some of the bugs and The crashing There is no point in even playing if you know the game is going to freeze or crash.

Yes the graphics are nice..the building models are cool etc. But the AI is TERRRIBLE...you will notice that i have not completed even 4 hours of playing this game. This is bc it is so damn unfair...I could not even complete the tutorial missions because i kept dying bc the AI cheats like crazy/ or the mission design is terrible. 

I have played RTS games for years and this is by far one of the most frustrating games i have ever played in my entire life. The tutorial missions suck because they don't always explain why you should do something. Additionally some of the mechanics in this game are stupid...i build a huge catapault behind my castle walls...8 archers approach my wall and kill the catapault by shooting THROUGH the wall somehow and destroy a huge defensive structure that takes a lot of resources to build. 

In the territorial mission i got stuck on, within minutes of starting you are faced with constant attacks. They tell you to use your horse archers to harrass the attackers as they can fire and move. So i did...repeatedly. Ya that works to a point (bc sometimes they stop randomly and die, and after enough time while your trying to fend off the repeated attacks with your archers, you need to also raise your defenses and then build an army capable of destroying the enemy castle. 

Even with a literal army of those archers, and some frontline infantry and catapaults...the enemy base is structured in such a way that to get your catapaaults near the walls to destroy them (so your melee guys can get in there) the catapualts must enter archer range..and subsequently get destroyed as your trying to manage them, defending against the constant attacks, while trying ot push your own attack. I lost this mission repeatedly, even after i attacked the AI's economy in the first few minutes of the game (destroying his farms and all other buildings/workers outside his walls). 

I like a challenge..but when less than an hour into a games F$%&#@@ tutorial and i am constantly having to reload and reload..its just ridiculous. Oh..and did i mention that the AI on YOUR side is just stupid? 

You have oil pots laced around the map..your flame archers are the only ones who can set it off..but you have to micro manage EACH one and get them to fire at the oil patches you placed earlier..individually..while being attacked from multiple sides....this unit is the only one you are given in the mission to start the fires...yet you must tell them to start a fire individually (the fact they are near a place to start a fire and enemies just walked over it is not good enough...). Which wouldn't be so bad if you didn't have people attacking you from 3 sides at once. 

just writing this review is making me relive the annoying and frustrating experience that was trying to ""play"" this broken, unfair, unfun, rip off, totallly poor excuse for a game. A game is supposed to be fun...minutes into a game when your yelling at the $$%$ screen because you keep dying in the tutorial...its not any fun period. This is not a game...its like internet trolls got together and created something they called a ""game"" to just @$#$% with people who wanted to have fun. 

Avoid...this..game...at...all...costs. you will regret it if you dont heed my advice. i plan on never giving this developer my money ever again...total garbage!

You know what wasn't so good? Stronghold 3. You know what is comparatively better? Stronghold Crusader 2. Be warned, there are a few 'day one' glitches and bugs, but nothing game breaking and unfixable like in SH3. As stated in other reviews, the game does feel a bit clunky as of now, but I believe these issues can be ironed out in the next week or two. Take note of the system specs, because my desktop meets the minimum but not the recommended and it's definitely noticeable. Assuming you have that, both die hard fans and ones new to the series won't be disappointed with the options to start with. Skirmish mode, (hooray!) multiple campaigns, and sandbox are all playable. I also like the new art style and updated graphics. Overall, it feels like an updated SH:C with more features, hopefully more to be added through DLC. (Additional units, both new and rebooted AI, all new campaigns, etc) In addition, the Arab lords no longer have to build churches; mosques have finally been added. A small thing, but really helps with the balance between Crusaders and Arabs. 

     The game takes a different spin on how it approaches the Crusades, and now the 'right side' is whichever side you're fighting for. There's no 'good' side, as both sides view themselves as freedom fighters locked in a righteous struggle against the infidels. 

     There is multiplayer, but I have not tested it yet, so take that with a grain of salt. I somewhat agree with the opinon that Firefly sacrificed some content for a more realistic game, but that is not nearly as off-putting here as it was in SH3. I'm excited to see where Firefly takes SH:C2, especially after the SH3 letdown, and hope to enjoy this game quite a bit in the future.

EDIT: (Since day one was quite a while ago, and the above review is outdated) I don't think considering this as a solid 'yes' review would be correct. Firefly has put in effort to fix the bugs, but the game is still not optimized. As stated in other reviews, really expect those performance drops during sieges. The game does feel somewhat lacking in certain aspects, namely graphics and troop types. As a fan of the Stronghold series since Stronghold 2, (which is still a really fun game for its shortcomings) I will say that, given the price tag, this isn't a 'gateway' Stronghold game. New to the series? Play the original Crusader, or Stronghold 1. Enjoy skirmishing? Stronghold 2 has an above-average skirmish mode, and a nice, easy to use map maker as well. It's not the trainwreck of Stronghold 3, but Stronghold Crusader 2 still mediocre.",1411434841,1421558715,True,151,1,0.725648701190948486,2,True,False,False

[b]Introduction:[/b]
As a big fan of Stronghold 1 and Stronghold Crusader 1 I was really happy to read and see, that a new Stronghold Crusader was planned and what the devs wanted to do with it. After just a mediocre Stronghold 2 (and yes it was, at least in my opinion) and the disastrous Stronghold 3 (and yes, IT WAS) it's no wonder, if people are a bit sceptical about another ""try"". After watching pre-alpha gameplay and the dev diary I could see 'the old crusader 1' in it. The devs wanted to go back to the roots and that's exactly what I wanted. Therefore I have decided to throw in some Euros into the gambling house (preorder) and to cross my fingers, that Firefly won't mess it up this time or it would be their last game for sure. Long story, short answer: this time they could deliver!


[b]Pro:[/b]
[list][*]the old 'crusader feeling' from the past!
[*]it's always fun to build castles and to destroy the stuff of other people
[*]rebalanced and new units (no more unstoppable horse archers)
[*]smarter construction of buildings
[*]learning campaign + skirmish trails will offer ~30 hours of singleplayer fun
[*]custom skirmish battles with AI possible (and you can change your own color now too)
[*]VERY hard final skirmish trail mission (yup, it's fun for your brain)
[*]working multiplayer
[*]a lot of maps (the old classic maps of SHC1 are also planned to be added later)
[*]map editor
[*]Steam Workshop support is planned
[*]good soundtrack
[*]you can throw several animals through the air
[*]some of the old german voice actors are back
[*]the release version was very playable with only some minor bugs (my experience, maybe not yours)
[*]the devs actually care about the game and have further plans for it
[*]you can brew beer, germans love beer[/list]


[b]Neutral:[/b]
[list][*]mediocre graphics (it's not bad but it isn't too great too, could be better, but I don't care that much about it)
[*]not much visual variety...because of the crusader setting of the game which means desert, desert, desert, some palms, some oasis, some rivers, mountains and have I already mentioned desert? (that's no contra)
[*]no moats anymore (I miss them, because they contribute to a more challenging defense, but let's be honest...moats don't make that much sense in a desert)
[*]no leather armors anymore (crossbowmen need and wear steel armor now, macemen need no armor anymore)[/list]


[b]Contra:[/b]
[list][*]not all promised features are in yet (Coop playing as the same lord, strongwall option)...but they will be added later
[*]little lags in multiplayer, if there are a lot of units running around
[*]main menu artwork isn't that great
[*]horrible ingame info-vids of the AI players, when they decide to attack or want stuff...poorly done!
[*]the AI hasn't changed much...they can be pretty tough, but they're predictable, don't act that smart and cheat
[*]no 'good karma' (monuments, garden, ...) and 'bad karma' (gallows, cages) buildings anymore [popularity bonus of church services, beer production, food and taxes is still in]
[*]no laddermen anymore (no tunnel diggers too, but I don't miss them, because they were bad in the original)
[*]I REALLY miss the voice reactions of the peasants, if you click at them[/list]


[b]Conclusion:[/b]
Stronghold Crusader 2 isn't revolutionary. Nothing spectacular has changed compared to Stronghold Crusader 1. Some new stuff got added, some stuff has been changed, some stuff got cut out and everything is presented with new graphics in 3D now. As a yummy topping you're now able to play Multiplayer with no problems or workarounds. There is some stuff I really miss though. Is it bad, because there's no major advance? No, not if you ask me. Why should you change a formula, which works well? All I wanted was a updated version of Stronghold Crusader 1 with a working multiplayer via Steam, nothing more. And that's what I almost got. I'm happy with my purchase and can recommend it to all the old fans of the old Stronghold titles, which share my expectation. If you're looking for brand new mechanics and stuff, then you won't be that satisfied.

-Pros 
It's apart of the stronghold series
Similar controls making the learning curve minuscule

-Cons
Soundtrack is not as immersive as previous releases
Mildly irritating bugs (i.e. Attemping to place a building next/below another requires reselecting and repeatitive clicking untill you find the ""sweetspot"")
Storyline/Singleplayer is very dull and does not leave me feeling I am doing much different verse the last mission.


Overall I cannot recommend this game to someone looking to drop into the stronghold series as this is a sad addition to the Stronghold family. I can on the other hand recommend this to a previous Stronghold series follower simply because, as previously stated, it is a stronghold game and still has a very distant feel to it.

Currently I very much enjoy this game, however this game is rather difficult to master, and the balancing of resources and the strategy you slowly develop takes a lot of time for you to properly enjoy the game.

     I wont lie, I was a little dissapionted with this game when I first stared playing, I was a big fan of its predecessor 'Stonghold crusader', this was by far one of my favorite games when I was younger.
Pros and cons:

PROS- The graphics in-game have been updated, although not as much as you might hope for, especially for the fact that the old one came out 12 years ago.
- It is much harder to appease the peasants who flock to your castle, this does make the game a bit more challenging when it comes down to 'laying siege' to an enemies castle, at least in multiplayer. You can starve your enemy in a manner of speaking. 
- There are new units, athough most of these are nearly identical to the predecessors, using some of the same quotes and one-liners.
- The walls fall down in 3D, instead of dissapearing, 
- Destruction of castle walls and towers, looks better,
CONS- the Opening menu was a major dissapointment, i dont really know what i expected but the predecessors kicked ass compared to this new one.
- The new AI sucks, really sucks, (eg. the enemy computer always gets free siege equipment) 
- The graphics aren't that imppressive for the amount of processing power it takes to run the game.
- The price tag for what you get is practically extortion. 
- If you arent familiar with the game it is quite hard to understand the mechanics of the game, depsite the introduction campaign/scenario
- The new voice acting for the AI is just generally annoying, in my personal opinion they should have used the old voices from the last game.
- The mulitiplayer menu, is the same as the opening menu, a dissapointment
- There is a building and troop limit, whilst understandably for lower end computers is unchangeable, but there should be a way to adjust it.

All in all the game leaves you feeling a little underwhelmed, to be honest if your thinking of buying this game do yourself a favour and wait until a sale, save yourself the dissapointment of spending a lot of money on something that isn't quite up to standard. 
I do know that Firefly are releasing updates and extensions so hopefully in the future they may be able to fix some of the problems, and annoyances.

However, I do not find my money wasted on this game. As a fan of the stronghold series and a proud owner of all the games (save one that I'm not too proud of...you can guess which), I will happily say that this game is the first stronghold game to not be a total waste of your time since 2002 with crusader 1 itself. On top of that, I highly recommend buying this if for nothing else than supporting the small indie studio Firefly Studios in hopes that, now without their 2K publisher forcing release dates on them, we can begin to see some proper sequels in the stronghold lineup to recover from...a troubling past, to say the least. Perhaps a stronghold 4, or even the possibility of a Legends 2 (Don't kill me, we all know somewhere inside we want a better legends :D)

With gamespy down, this is also the only remaining stronghold game besides the abysmal pile that was stronghold 3 to have functional multiplayer without the assistance of a 3rd party tool that can sometimes, to inexperienced users, be a large pain in the ass to use properly. So for crusader multiplayer with ease, this runs through the steam servers allowing you to simply invite your friends and such as you would for Team Fortress 2 or something.

Buy this to support firefly and enjoy the first stronghold game in 12 years to not suck right out of the box...or download in this case.

It's an easy game to get into, not because of simple mechanics, but because of mindless AI that is easily exploited. Numerous times, I've been ""seiged"" by cheating (a LOT of cheating) AI where, by having a single tiny hole in my castle walls at the very back of my castle, the enemy sends everything they have through that hole, walking past, through, and over traps, defenses, and archers. Never once have I really felt a challenge from the AI that wasn't related to their massive economic cheats.

The bugs are relatively ok, I haven't encountered any major, gamebreaking bugs (nothing like SH3's ""dogs walk up ladders"").

Pathfinding: Walls are to be seiged or used by archers, nothing else. One of the first campaign missions asks you to seige a small, minor AI settlement. It is defended by 2 towers with a handful of enemies. My first approach was to amass as many small units as I could and send them up to the towers to kill the archers. However, my units were completely incapable of using new fangled technologies like ""stairs"" to the point their 5(?) archers killed 20 of my units because no matter how many commands I gave them, ""stairs"" and ""walking"" became too complex for them. This was only the 2nd or 3rd mission, a tutorial mission, that was rendered impossible to win because my units literally could not walk to the enemy.

Hardcore fans and achievement hunters will be the only ones who will appreciate SC2. The ""Campaign"" trails are back from the original. They offer no more than a series of AI skirmish challenges that vary in difficulty. There's a dozen or so tutorial missions the have some kind of ""Narrative"" but I use that word loosely.

Melee Fighting: Winning consists of massing a blob of units into another player's castle to kill thier avatar ""Lord."" I say ""blob"" because the units clip into each other It's not pleasing on the eyes when a group of a hundred pikemen can't be distinguished between a single guy. To make matters worse, during a fight they all clip into smaller blob. To make matters EVEN worse, a well placed pitch pot can decimate a group of hundreds.

Castle Smashing: The castle walls are no more than ten feet high and seem as strong as paper mache't. A few catapults can blast through a wall very quickly.  Probably why they removed ladder men and seige towers from the previous games. They added ""ragdoll"" physics, when a unit is arrowed they will tumble off the wall, if their foot doesn't get stuck and trap them hanging like maniquins for a few seconds before they disappear. When a tower falls with units on top the ragdoll levitates like Wil-e- Coyote holding up a sign before they fall to the ground.

Themes: The music is the only thing done right. Really great Crusade feeling soundtrack. As for the two religions, a lot of care was taken to avoid controversy. The Islamic Saracens dont eat the ""pig"" food ration (they grow sheep farms instead) and don't drink Ale, another handicap seeing as how they can't gain the happines benifits from Bars, and no other feature was put in place instead. Churches and Mosques are only distuinguishable from a little moon and star above the Mosque.

The game seems to be missing basic features of any RTS game. Diplomacy is nonexistent, your enemies are either your friend or foe, with very little interaction other than death threats and begging for your resources. The learning curve is pretty is medium, but the game does rely on a sink or swim mentality, help balloons would be nice to help you build the proper traps and units. 

Very limited construction. Your keep is not upgradable, it’s a simple tower that you can build up with walls and towers, but the keep itself never adjusts in power or in aesthetic. The building options are very limiting as well with now upgrades to work for, and very little reason for expansion beyond your walls. 

Overall, the game will hold your interest for a couple of hours before getting old quickly. I would wait for a sale before purchasing, not worth the full price.

The developers tried to copy the positive aspects of Crusader 1 and improve them with new features.
However, instead of ending up as an improved version of the first Crusader, the game became a much more RTS-like title. which plays much more different than Crusader 1 than I expected.
What the developers did is basically simplified the whole castle building to a state where almost every building makes sense. This gives the game a much more fast-paced gameplay in the Skirmish Mode.
Compared to Crusader 1 or SH2, the units also seem to be better balanced. Spamming Horse Archers or Knights is for example much more difficult than in the previous game(s), because they can now be countered easily by macemen or whirling dervishes. 
The whole combat system in general is improved by special abilites the units have. So instead of having useless and useful units like in Crusader 1, the game has offensive and defensive units with their own abilities. This gives armies a certain variety that can also be seen in games like Age of Empires 2.
I also feel like the current AI Lords are way harder to beat than in Crusader 1:
When the Rat is building catapults (so his sieges are not completely useless ;D) and the Wolf builds a stronghold that lets your castle look like a hovel, you know shit just got serious :D
But despite these aspects the game still has many flaws that need be patched and improved.
The most important would be performance improvement and bug fixing.
On big maps with many opponents the framerate drops under 20fps even on good PCs.
Also knights are sometimes unable to get on their horses or units stop moving entirely.
In terms of balancing there are still some things the developers need to change:
They already lowered the wood cost of woodcutters in previous patches, but there are still some buildings that seem a little bit too expensive, for example the market that becomes unvaluable through its 500 gold price or mills that cost 200 wood each (guys I want my awesome bread empire back :D).
Despite that they need to add some more NPC Lords( Ssssnake plz :D), Units and buildings that are missing ( for example ladders, tunnels, moats, Gardens and voice overs for your peasents). 
All in all this game is different from the Stronghold games. It may not feel that much like a complex castle simulator anymore, but more like a well balanced Strategy Game with castle building elements.
Fact is, there aren´t many games today that have this kind of gameplay, so Crusader 2 has a unique gameplay.
Depite its current issues I recommend this game to everyone that likes strategy games and/or the stronghold series, but keep in mind that there are patches coming that may be improving the game that much, that games like Aoe2 or Command and Conquer have a serious competitor.

While the graphics are not top notch nor cutting edge for a castle sim/medieval warfare title they{especially coming from a small gaming studio} are more then adequate.

The gameplay is quite simple......Build a castle/ecomony as well as an army then go looking for something to kill. While the game is fun in single player i do consider multiplayer to be where its at and it is interesting seeing all the different build and play styles that players have to offer. 

The game while good is not perfect and still needs some small balance and bug issues addressed. Knights cannot cross bridges w/o dismounting their horses which is odd considering that trebuchets can and they weigh more.
Multiplayer also needs some small balancing issues as it stands right now it is way to easy to get a thriving economy using candles/bread/ale. Dervishes also seem to be a bit OP.

Ideas for the future....
As far a s DLC goes a European map pack/unit pack would be something i would definetely get behind. More lush green forested maps......longbowmen possibly added as a unit.

I wanted to love this game. I really did. After only three in-game hours, I can [i]honestly[/i] say that THIS is not a Stronghold game. I've tried looking at it from all angles; seeing it as not a continuation to a series that was plagued by Stronghold 3, but as a sequel to the Stronghold game that stole my heart - Stronghold: Crusaders.
Even as such, this game fails to deliver. Nothing was built upon - [b]nothing[/b] - and if I were to be honest, I would even go as far as to say features were removed. Good features. Important features. What you've been left with feels like the Civilisation game released on the Xbox marketplace; it's cute, but not a full fledged Stronghold game.
Where are my Engineers? Laddermen? Tunnelers? Moats? Why is building my castle so... generic?
I wouldn't have minded a re-skin of Stronghold 2. Nor a remake of the original Crusaders. Given this as the alternative, I would've honestly rather pay an additional $54.99 (CAD) for Firefly to just add Skirmish to Stronghold 3, not release a half-game riding the coattails of previous successes.
Will I continue to play? Yes. I refuse not to. This game may lack... everything... but damn it, if I want simplicity and don't feel like an RTS like the AoE series, I'll play this.
Will I recommend this to friends? No. Friends, fellow fans, I've played scapegoat. I've lost this round. Continue reading if you're interested, I'll try to go more in-depth.

 [*]Slower Resource Gathering (resulting in longer, uneventful games)
 [*]No actual Engineers (I guess peasents just magically know how to man ballistae, trebuchets, and so-on)
 [*]Poor enemy selection (The new enemies already feel generic)
 [*]Many Stretched Textures (it may look pretty, but not as pretty as it could)
 [*]Weird in-game stuttering and freezes (Before anyone explodes on me, blaming my rig, I have no issues running Shadow of Mordor on high at 1080p (60fps avg.), or Endless Legend, or Stronghold 2 or 3, or Tomb Raider)

First of all, if your a fan of the series, wait till this game goes on sale. For a big name game being just released, this is pretty sad for the most part. The graphics are good, not great or at least not great compared to other games you are paying for these days. The battle side of the game is pretty frusterating... The units move very quickly and instead of using ""strategy"" to bring a castle down, pretty much need to just throw overwhelming odds of troops to win each battle/castle. Bottomline, not much strategy is necessary. Like city building? This game isn't for you either, it could take you hours to get your castle built and tweeked just the way you like it but it will get destroyed in seconds. The walls basically buy you a minute or two to react or they are coming down. 

Overall, this is a $20 game or less, not up to date with today's standards. The AI is also horrible, its impossible to play against them, you basically need to build up a defense ASAP and hold off their waves they are sending at you while you build up a wave of your own, they essentually have unlimited resources too which is annoying. The game is pretty laggy too which is sad, I exceed all of the requirements and even toned back the not so great graphics so I'm guessing this is still alittle buggy. 

Even if the AIs are fixed, the overall battling is poor and lacks any strategy. Its hard to experiment with troops when their impact is only noticed if they have armor or not. Overall... buy this on sale.

Update 10/17

They updated the game, they fixed the resources issue for AIs (They seemed to have unlimited before) They did not fix gameplay performance however... still very glitchy, some aspects have gotten worse. Some units glitch and glide across the map now. It would be a huge improvement if they would just slow down the speed of units and attack of units, its hard to use the features/benefits of the units when the units move and attack so fast, by the time you decide on troop placement, the battle is probably over and the winning side is clearly winning.

This series is the best Castle Sim RTS out there. With Crusader 1 being dear to my heart, and with the last title in the series, Stronghold 3 being a colossal failure, I, like many longtime Stronghold fans, was trepidatious as to how this title would pan out. Upon seeing mostly positive reviews I scooped it up and haven't regretted it since. 

I have seen negative reviews complaining about some of the elements of the original being taken out. So what, you want the exact same game again? Sure things were omitted, but things were also added too. The siege equipment is much more varied and detailed, and the castle defenses offers fun alternatives, as just a small example of new material.

WHAT I LIKE:

Economy and Food Balance & ease of interface with this aspect - this element is enough to make it challenging but does not require constant micromanagement while out pillaging and rampaging.

New Troop options - offers additional new units through both the barracks and mercenary post that are worth trying. Slave Driver, anyone? A couple Whirling Dervishes?

New and Entertaining Siege Equipment - ever wanted to watch a rotting camel carcass splatter on your enemies' castle and minions? Now is your chance!

New AI Characters, plus the classics

Skirmish mode!!! Hours of fun. Hours. 

Devs plan to add more content as they go

MY CRITICISMS:

AI is better than facing a mouth breathing 10 year old, but could be better still. Its really not bad, and I haven't faced everyone yet, but like the other titles most of the AI have a routine and once you figure it out that opponent is less challenging. But the skirmish maps balance that by creating difficult combinations of circumstances and oppenents. I just finished a skirmish map facing one competent opponent and one incompetent, and they had twice the starting resources as me. It was very challenging at first to get an economy, food production, and defense as they ransacked me and I had to start several times before I found an early approach that worked. But once I did get established, it was just a matter of time until I felt comfortable with the size of the army and siege equipment to finish them off. I realize how difficult it would be to design an AI like this, but some adaptations expressed by the AI late game would make that part more challenging.  

Graphics aren't blow-you-away fantastic. I've seen this complaint in other reviews and I won't deny I have more graphically astute games in my collection. But I have always chosen gameplay and an engaging challenge over graphical perfection and for me this title does just fine with the graphics it has. Could they be better? Yes. Do they need to be? No way.

More content, although from posts I have seen it sounds like the devs will be actively adding to the game in the future. 

CONCLUSION

For me, the pros have far outweighed the cons and I have no regrets with the money & time I have put into this title. I can't wait for a couple friends to get it so we can get medieval on each other's castles.

Stronghold crusders 2 was advertized in such a way to show a rich story [Or at least I, myself found that after the great fights] However that little video you find in the trailer cannot be found anywhere inside the actual game.

I don't believe i even saw a castle that resembles something in the trailer inside the game.

The campaign was remarkably short and could be completed within one or two days if you're experienced at all [Which most of us are] so the campaign is really not worth even looking at.

The multiplayer aspect seemed quite nice 'Hey, you get to build a castle with another person? Great!' If only you could not duplicate resources whilst doing so. Woopdie do.

Do you guys remember the stronghold 2 multiplayer? All the small fighting guilds that shot up to battle eachother whilst having fun? 
That does not exist here, It's more like the time around a year after the release of the game, one or two hosts actually waiting to play someone.

I'll spell it out for you however: [Remember this is an educated estimate] Only around fifty people own the game.

Now, I'm sure a large amount of people actually bought this, But the multiplayer is so empty that either they got chased off by the campaign and demanded a refund or they took one look at the multiplayer and said 'I'm not waiting ten to twenty minuites just to play a game'

The characters in the game, You know the rat and the other guys?
It just seems too easy.
The animations of the characters are also quite flawed, a little like they used a really old animation software. [It can easily be improved]

The voices and sounds seemed as if they were copied over from a previous game, it would have been nice to have thoughs get changed up.

Did you know messing around with archers get thier old voice, and then suddenly if you are lucky the voice suddenly changes? Quite interesting, I actually found out myself about ten minuites ago.

I'm surprised you actually read this. I didn't put too much time into it as it didn't seem a worthwhile cause.

	I really wanted to love Stronghold Crusader 2, but I don't. I was disappointed right from the start. I will address my issues in the order I came across them. Forgive me if I sound petty but I had such excitement for this game and to come across an intro that looks like it came from a 15 year old game was utterly disheartening. I tried to push the fail image of two poorly animated warriors, one who vaguely looks of jack sparrow, out of my mind upon entering the game. The menu seemed ok, nothing wrong at first glance. Looking at the single player options though I was again remorseful. Hardly any missions and nothing that matched the wonderful historic castle mode from the first game. I played every castle in the original stronghold and hoped to see it return with an Arab twist but foolish me. I then chose to see how the game play was. I gasped when it loaded, it seemed like a direct copy of stronghold 2. To say my excitement was dead is an understatement. Pretty epic though, you killed my desire to keep playing this new game in fifteen minutes.
	Somehow I managed to keep going despite this sickening feeling in my stomach. I think the final blow was the stunning lack of features I had come to love. It baffles me how you choose to keep such a mundane feature like STAIRS on the barracks but completely destroy all the cool towers and their features. I thought that being able to put troops inside towers was one of the coolest features. Putting siege equipment on large towers a no-brainer, to now be left with stupid ballista scaffolds.... WHAT?! Those would be a great addition to have but not the only option. If you would finally add wooden palisades from the first Stronghold and create some further options with that, then you might have a great set of features. However like I have come to expect from your company you bring more disappointment than Bungie's new story free MMOFPS garbage. Not to mention the lack of innovative wall traps, stone baskets, monks, leather armor, wax for candles (currently material free production), siege towers, diggers, ladder men, moats, workers who repair walls automatically, short walls, and one of the most annoying the ability to lower building height so I can avoid everything getting in my way. Have you tried to build walls it your own game? It can take like 30 seconds to get the wall icon to appear in an area because it is on a corner or near a building. Unless the idea is just build a square and forget about actually making an interesting castle..... IN A CASTLE SIM. Pretty sad when you can't improve on a game you made almost 15 years ago.
	I got the game so I could play it with my wife. Stronghold crusader was one of the few games we enjoyed together. Besides for the new one lacking anything exciting or innovative, we need to deal with the worst optimization I have ever experienced. I bought two new computers in anticipation of this games release. To say it runs like dog excrement would be praise. Playing this game over steam with anything over three players on lowest setting is impossible for us. The only thing I have to say to you as a company is this. You are just as useless as EA and Activision if you think you can phone it in like this and promise to make it better with DLC. Why should I give you more money to fail? These things should have already been in the game! It is clear to see you took the mass market video game cookie cutter formula. Make a game and promise how awesome it will be. Focus test everything, then remove every part that might confuse a simpleton.

At first it's simple structure seemed likeable to me, only to realize the maps are horribly designed for Stronghold Crusader 2. You have to build your mines completely exposed, with no way to build fortifications anywhere near them to defend it, leaving you constantly buying iron, stone, and even sometimes FOOD. Yes, that's right even the oasis seems to be terribly misplaced. On some maps these disadvantages are fine, because it could prove a challenge that veteran players are looking for. However for the masses, I cannot see how this was a good move.

While it may not bother some, however it should be noted that the characters from the previous series who make a come back in this one are no where NEAR alike that of the original Stronghold, or Stronghold Crusader. You can't tell me that they can't afford better voices and animations for SHK2, everyone I've seen who liked the series purchased it immediately. Stronghold Crusader is better in many, many aspects in not only animations, but also the looks of said characters even noting the pixelation. Their voices also fit the part well, and the actors did an exceedingly wonderful job at sounding convincing. However for SHK2, their lines are corny, their voices sound unconvincing, (as if he wasn't talking about the same subject that he was) and overall their cut-seen is horribly tacky. It gives you a big, ""So and so time.."" and transparents to a scene with two warriors, they clash blades and.. that's all. Yep, that build up for nothing.

But let's get out of the pit of despair for a bit. They have some new units, to which are likeable. Such as the Ranger, who is capable of both range, and meleee combat, though not an expert at either.  They updated the graphics... for the most part. (again not on character models, ie when the rat portrait comes up when he's mad/attacking you) They have a simplier, clever system. Although I think overall for me this is good, this can be debated on highly. I just now thank the game that I don't have to focus on rebuilding economy/walls constantly when I'm being barraged with enemies.

If you're certain about purchasing this game, just keep in mind I was too. Overall I regret it as it stands, but if they fix the animations, voices, script for lines, and maps, then we'll start talking. In comparison to Stronghold Crusader, this game has very few gameplay hours, unless maybe you're a PvP-focused person? Not too sure how well PvP works in this game, but considering the maps.. I imagine not too fun since your economy being smashed is nothing you can really control. Unless you love fighting field battles.

Very good game but there could be improvements. A few bugs need to be fixed and things like laddermen, tunnels etc. could be included. Also I would like it if there were seige equipment that allowed you to transport troops across water, as in the crusades alot of troops were beached by small boats.
Would also like it so there is a setting to allow/disallow certain buildings and troops. (there is already this setting in  map editor but it would be nice if it were used in a lobby where the host could make it so certain buildings can/cannot be built etc.

Other than that. A great game. Amazing work. I would say this is value for money.

The graphics are a little issue between low and high, if your rig can't handle this game on high, everything is exetmely low res, and it can heavily impact how the game feels. If you can run high, everything is pristine and beautiful. There seems to be no middle ground.

So far I have encounted very few bugs, tho it seems the community has ran into quite a few problem's. Most I have not meet myself. The worst that plaged me would be a few crashes, and troops getting stuck on walls. 

The gameplays is very bang on to Crusader quick paced, tho some games on large maps can drag on for a little while so prepare for an hour or two fight. 

But all in all, it is a great game, I haven't enjoyed stronghold so much since Crusader 1. I would give this a game a 8\10.

- AI is too bad. They only attack in same way whole game.
- No forced attack
- No moat (Srsly Firefly? No moats?)
- Can't pick which kind of lord (arab/european) you play in Sandbox mode or options
- No 45 degree rotation for buildings, which was one of the VERY few good things in SH3
- You can't determine which goods, and how many, your estates deliver
- Bird's-eye view missing (Very important! Especially for building)
- All the lists are missing, like the ones showing all your units, where your gold came from etc. etc.
- Where is the map maker?
- Can't close/open gates on your own
- TOWERS DON'T GET DOORS WHEN WALLS ARE ATTACHED TO THEM!! (this really pissed me off, as I am a person who cares a lot about such details, which is why I really stressed this point when I made my suggestions list for SHC2 while it was still in development)
- There is no restart button
- Building limit and unit limit is WAY TOO LOW
- When you play with 8 players the unit limit is WAY too low. What am I supposed to do with 140 units? Even after only 3 players were left, I could still just build 333 units, that's not enough to be fun!
- Same as above goes for buildings too, the limit is way too low
- Couldn't find a strong walls option when playing against NPCs
- Walls are TOO WEAK!!! One guy on Metacritic said it feels like they're made of chalk, which is absolutely true. They are in fact so weak that they're pretty much useless, combine that with the missing moats and you can't have any decent defense
- Horses die way too easily, which makes knights almost useless. I once sent a large group of knights into an enemy group of archers, and most of them lost their horses before arriving. They need to be a LOT stronger
- the marker on the minimap that shows where you currently are is too hard to see, it's very thin and black, should be changed to red or something
- When you click on a unit that was sent out to attack someone or something, you can't see what he's going to attack, the marker should come back
- Peasants and workers don't talk anymore
- I really miss that one feature from SH2 where you could zoom out farther, but couldn't build anything while you did it (the button was an eye in a red circle or something like that). It was nice to be able to see your whole castle in that mode
- No torture buildings (or the opposite of them)
- Not enough new soundtracks - I don't mind using a few good, old ones, but I've only heard like 1 or 2 new soundtracks as of now

Found in other threads:
- No ladder men or siege towers
- Only one kind of keep



Other Bugs:

• Siege camps
• Walls aren't deleted properly
• Unresponsive units (they don't listen sometimes)
• Camera 'jumps' sometimes when moving around the map
• Some video options glitch the graphics, lines in middle of screen and such
• Ranger animations are messed up - they hold the bow sideways away from them leaving one hand empty...

Suggestions:

• Fix UI
• Add usable gates
• Engineers, add them
• Remove siege camps
• Soldiers walking from camp site to barracks
• Replace defensive turrets with old ones
• Stronger walls
• Nerf range on fire throwers
• Nerf arabian archers (their range is insane compared to regular archers)
• Up the damage from fire
• Voiced peasants
• Bring back the videos for buildings (doesn't matter if you rip them directly from Crusader, they look great)
• Longer peace time (60 minutes)
• Less slashing animations for pikemen (it feels odd)
• Remove negative popularity from random events
• Remove ALL events when turned off (including winds)
• Count build distance with player keeps instead of areas
• If areas are kept, increase color opacity
• Add numbers on players and their keeps when choosing a map
• Target your own units with attack
• Round towers
• Improve menu UI...The font, oh the font...
• Perhaps fix the Rat, he feels way too gentleman like, dumb him down
• Fix AI so they can actually defend their castle and attack in a proper way
• Increase building and unit size. Remove buildings already present on map to increase this?
• More NPCs running around - chickens, drunks, peasants, kids to make the place feel more alive",1412213761,1412213761,True,0,0,0.484375,0,True,False,False

Once you get past the horrible front-end, you'll find an addictive and highly engaging RTS in the style of AOE3, with a highly developed castle building element. The economy echos the Anno games too, but in a much more streamlined form.

In-game graphics are good, with nice character designs, and some good animations. Castles look well planted, and the environment is fairly interesting.

Voice acting is as excellent as ever, but it sounds like clips from the older games have been re-used, including much of the fantastic music (possible the best I've heard in any game).

The game has currently dropped a lot of the whimsical characterisation of the peasants, and certain popular features, such as the castle enhancements and punishments, have been left out, but crucially, Crusader 2 plays better than the original Stronghold. City management is easy and rewarding, castle designing is incredibly simple and flexible, and the siege element is the best in any RTS yet.

---

Set back in the 1100's after the Great Crusades, Stronghold Crusader is set in the Arabian middle eastern region for this installment of carnage, mayhem, and humor. There, nobody can hear you scream as a group of other Lords only wish to see your existance end short, and your head on their mantlepiece.

Unlike the Stronghold series, Crusader is focused more on fast action combat over castle building and development, as your castle's only purpose is to sustain an economy strong enough to crank out troops faster than those around you, and to protect your Lord from the opposition.

- The Campaign is a series of challenging scenarios in skirmish format, where you overcome challenging environments, terrain, and the enemy Lords who use them for their advantage to hamper your ability to obtain victory.

- If you wish to have control of the fight, single player skirmish mode gives you a map roster, your opponents, your starting resources, and everything else.

- If you aren't feeling combat-ready at the moment, the freebuild just gives you an empty board, unlimited building limits, and control over the random events and your prosperity.

- Multiplayer is a no-holds barred slugfest, utilizing Steam Network for multiplayer, seamless and lagless gameplay ensures that every battle is enjoyed from start to finish.

This game is supported by Firefly Studios for future bug squashing and feature additions through Steam downloads.
---

Here is my take on the game so far.

The Good:
- The graphics are great, smooth and well detailed. You can zoom right into the action and get the feel of the action.
- Gameplay is seamless, and encourages fast paced action.
- Game is well developed and for the most part, bugs are crushed.
- Future updates to look forward to.

The Bad:
- Economic system feels too much like Stronghold Legends than Crusader.
- Doesn't run well on lower end hardware (AMD A-10 APU)
- Many elements in Crusader has been excluded in Crusader II
- Not as many maps or AI players to choose from compared to Crusader I

Overall Verdict:
I was a bit disappointed in the map selection for the game. I was hoping that Firefly would remake and re-release old maps under the new engine. Also map size in many maps feels too crowded.
I also didn't like the map limit, you're only allowed a certain amount of buildings and troops in a game, and it redestributes as opponents are killed off. The building limit seems unnecessary as in Crusader 1 you could fill your ""Estate"" to the brim with buildings and stuff.
Many things aren't included in this that Crusader 1 players might know of, like engineers constructing equipment, moats, tunnelers, and various other quirks.
This game uses the unbalanced economic system that Stronghold Legends and beyond is built off of, many things are way too expensive and depend on the market to obtain, especially wood. Woodcutters huts are too large and do not pull in enough wood to satisfy any need in a castle.
On the flipside, farms are smaller and you can have more farms per grid square than Crusader 1.  There are a new grade of siege equipment you can use as well as a few new units in the infantry you can utilize.
Castle wall construction is seamless and things connect nicely, even bringing back being able to use your barracks as an access to the walls

Overall, despite the things that are missing, and the uncopious limits that do get annoying, the game is worth buying and playing, especially if Firefly Studios releases more content as they did in the old Crusader 1 (Retail OEM had less maps and opponents too, but the special edition had more).",1411441295,1411965066,True,6,0,0.515795648097991943,0,True,False,False

Years and years ago I was an avid Stronghold fan. I had the warchest which came with 1, 2, and Crusader. Didnt pick up Legends till years later and liked it, but not nearly as much as the juggernaut that was Stronghold Crusader. After the abysmal dissapointment that was 3, I was ready to give up on the series. Then I saw this...

I was first struck by the asking price. 50 dollars is a lot to ask for a game like this, but if it means what is (supposed to be anyways) a more modern and updated version of Crusader, then the asking price is worth it. Only that is not what I bought. What I bought was another farce.

The reasons it sucks:
1 - Lacking in depth - where did the happy/sad castle adornements go? why cant i build monks at the church? why take out units for that matter? why are there so many weapons shops when we used to be able to dictate what weapons the shops made? no leather armor for that matter?
2 - combat is ridiculous - no engineers guild? what is the deal with the seige towers? anyone else notice how freaking fast all of the troops run? enemies are way too persistent in their attacks as well.. why the hell cant i build a moat anymore? and just how exactly do i even use the horses in my stable?! 3 seige weapons are just slightly bigger versions of the catapult..
3 - maps - maps lack any creativity whatsoever. none of them seemed very fun to me. 
4 - characters are no longer fun - I remember the good ol days when the skirmish leaders were entertaining and had distinct personalities. now theres not as many to choose from and they seem like perverted versions of their former selves. troops as well...no more ""WE ARE THE MACEMEN"" or ""HEEEERE COMES BESSIE""
5 - bad AI - I cant tell you how annoying it is when I'm building up my castle and all of the sudden my teammate builds a seige camp in the middle of my town. (For that matter, why do we even need seige camps!? they should never have changed the engineers guild mechanic)

All in all it seems like all the devs tried to do was improve graphics and make the game more fast paced, which is something it DID NOT need. The original Stronghold Crusader rules and moves at a perfect pace. Perfect.

SHC 2 is a very good stronghold game, for me it is somehow a remake of the first crusader, with some elements changed, to the better or to the worse depend on how you see it. The overall vibe of the game is really cool and feels so much like the first game. Overall the game is very enjoyable, and offers a lot of game modes.

Firefly Studios rigorously distanced themselves from Stronghold 2 when promoting this game, and rightfully so, the former being a disaster of a game that tried too many things with too little map space.  Firefly also touted this game as being a return to its roots, Stronghold and Stronghold Crusader.  Unfortunately, while the same level of complexity in the game was restored, many gameplay elements leave something to be desired and are lacking.

My first con for this game is the maps.  My favorite maps in Stronghold Crusader were:  I can't remember the names, but hopefully anyone reading this that has played Crusader knows which ones I am talking about and then continue with my review:  1) The map in which one player is in the center on top of a hill with all grassland.  There is then one player in the top left, and two in each of the other corners.  Grasslands are available in the corners and along the sides for a bit.  2) A Friend Indeed I think its called, 6 player map, you start within screen width of your ally, most of the map is grass.  And a map where it is all a dense forest with little to no Iron, 6 players.  As one might gather, I have a preference for maps in which food is plentiful but one would be hardpressed to defend the vast area, allowing one to strategically build casles rather than strategically defend a small scarce (or non-existant) farm land.  Stronghold Crusader 2 does not offer this option.  All of the maps have either small amounts of grass, no grass at all, or have it right next to your castle so you cannot build walls without surrounding the grass or building over it.  The fact this game does not offer maps such as that dissappoints me.  The game tries to make it easier to gather food by increasing each facilities output (I only need 4 wheat farms and 4 bakeries to support a population of 60), but that takes away from the experience for me.

Next, they tweaked how castle defences work, for the worse I think.  One cannot build castle artillery on towers anymore, instead requiring wooden towers that are placed over straight sections of wall.  This would be tolerable, if one could place these wooden towers diagonally, since I favor walls on the corners of my castles.  In Crusader I would favor the strategy of building many large towers on the corners of my castle and stack them with balistae.  Not possible here.  They also changed how military units work: removing the need for leather armor on macemen, requiring metal armor for crossbowmen, etc.  Not a big deal maybe, but these small things made the strategy for me.  On top of that, a small group of bowmen can kill a similar number of knights' horses, nutralizing the appeal of mounted knights...I would expect horses in armor to have smilar health to a pikeman, not fall to ~2-3 arrows.

The ""estate"" system they have decided to keep is also an irk of mine.  You cannot build walls in areas that are not assigned to an estate.  In some cases, this means you cannot build walls 10 squares away from your castle. (~1/4 screen width).  This is very annoying.

They also decided to keep the same graphics of Stronghold 2, Legends, 3, etc.  I find it ironic that the sprites of Stronghold Crusader look better than these new graphics.  I also find it semi annoying that there is no unit collision.  Lack of collision kills the strategy of melee on melee formations and blockading.  I recall numeroues times I defeated opponents that had a superior melee force by just running a majority of my force past their units, since that is an exploit with this system.

Ok one might say, I should expect changes in a sequel to balance the gameplay.  I don't think these things are balanced.  I find them to be a pain (balistae towers) and unrealistic (unarmored macemen).    Because of all of these unfavorable changes, the lack of map variation, etc, I cannot reccomend this game to any of my friends.",1411870932,1411870932,False,65,0,0.52818596363067627,3,True,False,False

First, I would like to clarify this is from the Point of view of someone who has been playing Stronghold since the first game came out, and has consistently played every single installment to near completion - Aside from Kingdoms, which is mediocre imho. Maybe you'll agree, maybe you won't - Anywho, this is how I felt.

The Good:
- Solid skirmish mode, much like older renditions of the game.
- Very old school Crusader vibe/feeling to it. Remake successful.
- All of the new units are interesting, aside from the slave driver - Which I don't care for.
     - New Unit special abilities are cool and add depth without overpowering or ruining units.
- New Siege engines that are also interesting and for the most part useful.
- Resource caches, Lion Dens, Outposts are all neat additions to the old crusader formula.
- Varied AI characters like the original and a promise of DLC Lords in the future.
- Really like the ""curtain walls."" I was skeptical of them until I used them in a trail mission.
- Took the good things from SH3 while leaving out most of the bad things.
- Neutral territory reminds me of the old territory system of SHC.
- The new buildings (like the wooden barricades for example) are interesting.
- Genuinely enjoyable game with as much replay value as the original.
- New ally system where allies mood affects how willing they are to do your bidding.
- Departure of Free form SH3 buidlings. Return of efficient, grid-based building system.
- Better physics, especially in regards to arrows - which bounce off and break on walls.
- More realism, such as troops pulling out pick axes and tools to smash walls down.
- Beautiful destruction physics. I've gotten into trouble from watching castles go down.
- Unit costs fixed or improved (Assassins especially brought back to reasonable price!)
- Much simpler Editor than SH3, albeit still with as many options.
- Able to play as other lords, and even choose what your lord looks like in skirmish.
- Buildings change when playing Arabic or Crusader Lords.
- Genuinely enjoyable game. Can't even lie, I will put 100 hours or more into this, easily.

The Bad:
- Stone is completely unbalanced. Walls cost 7 stone just for 1 square
     - So, 100+ to make 15 Tiles of wall! WTF? So even a basic castle is 500 to 1000's of stone.
     - Furthermore, walls also break much quicker - Causing lots of problems in the heat of battle.
- Buildings have ridiculous costs, which is ridiculously high (200 wood for a Market? Seriously?)
- Bare, boring, pathetic campaigns - So much for paying $10 extra for ""additional campaigns.""
     - No campaign is longer than 4 Stages, and the mini campaigns are Only 2 stages long!
- Cavalry units cannot attack buildings anymore, making them significantly less useful.
- All of the Special Edition Features (cost an additional 10 dollars) were pathetic at best.
     - Half of the artbook is on the official site for free, and it's only about 20-30 pages.
     - The two mini campaigns take 10 minutes, and the 10 shields speak for itself in lame-ness.
     - Only redeeming thing was the soundtrack. basically you paid 10 dollars for an old OST.
- Missing the things introduced in SH2 that were memorable, like feasting, honour, etc.
     - While many did not like those features, I feel like the economy is really bare without them.
- Mediocre Maps. Crusader only had 3 or 4 maps I didn't like, this one has 3 or 4 I do like.
     - Many maps don't have any resources available, or are too unbalanced to enjoy.
     - Pretty much need the Map Editor if you want to have truly good maps.
- some glitches and crashes, though this is to be expected.
- pathetic sized unit caps and building caps. 
     - At 1 v 1 it's perfectly fine, but even 4 player matches feel very tiny.
- Bland building selection, needs more towers, bastions, etc. SH3 had so many options!
- Overpriced with the promise of even more (paid) DLC in the future.

All in all, I feel like the game as a whole is really good - But I feel like it is horribly overpriced. 50 Dollars is too much. I felt like none of the features I got in my ""special Edition"" were all that special, and were not worth 10 dollars more. I feel like this game would've been much more fair to be sold at around 20-30 dollars instead (Crusader was 19.99 when I got it on release). Do yourself a favor and try and get it on sale, or at discount - it is a very fun game and I will keep playing, but it is incredibly over priced - Especially the ""special edition"" which was anything but special.",1411801320,1411802046,True,615,17,0.932011306285858154,4,True,False,False

I enjoyed playing sandbox, map editor, as well as some easy peesy skirmishing. It was a very peaceful game where you could decorate the castle and have a wonderful time. I had multiple copies to play with my family and friends.

This game is absolutely a worthy successor to the first.

The feel, music, and sounds are all there, but with an impressive addition of far better graphics, new units, and different enemies to face. But to compare to the old one, the resource grabbing system, map editor, sandbox, and 8 player multiplayer features are still there, as well as new defense features. Multiplayer is solid, with the ability to save your game and continue later.


Some detriments that I sort of feel dissapointed about are the ranged units ranges, they seem rather long for the map sizes to be so small in comparison. Granted, the map sizes is about the same as the first crusader, it's a big map, but for small maps ranged units could literally snipe resource points from your own base.

The game was just released a few days ago, and there have been no crashes or game breaking glitches I have run into.

While loading it up, I was prepared for the worst (based on the mediocre Stronghold 2 and disastrous Stronghold 3 release) but after playing for a few minutes I was surprised at how much I was enjoying it. 

Crusader II fully flushes out what they were trying to do with the Stronghold 3 economy. Every building in the game is expensive yet does its job well, meaning you'll constantly be weighing different strategies. Limited oasis space makes these decisions even more difficult yet rewarding. Is it better to tie up valuable space with hops farms to create ale, or make candles safely within your castle but then spend the resources on the much more expensive church? Of course, you have to defend yourself from constant attack while making these decisions.

The greatest improvement in this game over the original is the difficulty. While not being at all welcoming to newcomers of the series, veterans should be pleased at how much time you (usually) have to invest in every match before claiming victory. The AI attacks early and often, and truly grows stronger as the game progresses (much stronger). They know how to defend themselves as well. Compared to the original, you will need a much larger army to kill your opponent with a single siege. 

This review is already longer than I intended but I have to touch on the combat balance as well. It is exceptionally well done. Every unit has a clear purpose and fills that role well while ignoring all other tasks. Archers, for example, are excellent against non-armoured units but next to useless against swordsmen (especially if they are escorted by a sergeant) and even conscripted peasants with pitchforks kill them easily with melee. I could come up with an example for every unit type but that would be redundant. Suffice it to say, the combat feels excellent.

Wait until it goes on sale. This is a $15-$20 game. 

I played for 5 hours straight and experienced everything the game had to offer. 

The maps are small, the graphics are a decade old, the gameplay is very dumbed down and overly simple. There aren't that many buildings to build which means a really simple basic economy. 

The campaign is so damn boring, I usually find myself just sitting there waiting for it to just finish. 

CASTLE BUILDING is awful. Your walls cannot completely approach water, it just ends and then people walk around it. Your walls are easily destroyed. I played a sandbox game and had it completely beaten with hundreds of population and I didn't feel challenged once. 

I wanted my small settlement to turn into a large castle town, but instead I just got a haphazard mess of random buildings with no real purpose. 

There would need to be major changes, radical changes in future updates to make this game worth it.

It honestly feels unbalanced and even easier to destroy castles while many units feel useless like defensive siege towers. IMO it is better looking then previous games but does not offer a game changing experience to the title. This feels more like a update then a new game. 

No Siege Towers / Ladders??? Really... 
You can insta build a siege camp just outside of enemy territory and insta build as many weapons as you can afford and demolish an enemy castle in less then 10s this supports amazing game play... 

Multiplayer is riddled with hackers making that whole experiece worthless.

The game has some very shitty new ideas and terrible ideas from previous games.

UPDATE: I have 14 hours in this game and out of 9 friends who own the game the one who has the second most time in the game has 1.5 hours. Save your money unless you are a diehard fan of the Stronghold Games.

So good things first. I didn't come across that many bugs. Some graphical and physical artifacts happens here and there but not everywhere and game was stuck once in between loading missions but again no serious bugs. It is not easy on you and you need to come up with a few long term and short term tactical plans to achieve anything. Still a bit idiot proof compared to stronghold 1. Less resource dependencies which is a good and a bad thing.  A few extra units and unit abilities spice things up. That being sad some units are missing as well. Economy and military balance is all right. User interface was not a buzz killer for me usability wise. Easy to adept. 

However it really takes a while to get used to extremely primitive graphics and artwork. I am not even sure if they really hired any full time artists at all to work on it. Graphics are 3d but looks so beginner level almost like a school project made it's way to the market. There are good things here are and there which seems like bought online from 3d model sites and placed in a worst composition by developers with other unrelated stuff. The desert theme everywhere is so boring after a while. Landscapes are low in detail and looks very plain. You don't have any other option than playing in the bare desert. No signs of a decent story or a flow. Indicators and reports are barely understandable. 

So I feel a bit ripped of cause this game definitely needs more than patches and updates. It needs a complete overhauling. And to be honest I wasn't really expecting that much. My expectation was to have stronghold 1 experience with modernized graphics but other than being not 3d stronghold 1 was a much better game on every aspect.

Let me be clear by saying I don't hate the game and its actually quite fun but my main issue is it feels half done. There aren't too many bugs and the game runs smoothly on either of the systems I've run it on. (A desktop with two year old parts and an average laptop that's around four years old. When I said the game feels half done I mean to say that the game feels flavourless and at times even dull. The art, animation and design are fairly basic and simplistic; one of my biggest disappointments is the lack of interesting voice acting from the computer opponents to the humble peasants that populate my castle all the voice acting is bland or in the case of the latter. totally absent. The music is half recycled from the original and half stereotypical pseudo middle-eastern. With only 8 AI opponents there isn't a large number of challenges and it was disappointing to not see the likes of the Pig or the Snake. The appearance of familiar opponents like the Wolf and the Rat was welcome but I'm confused why they recorded new voices for those two characters when many of the units (European Archers for example) use the exact same voice recordings from the first Crusader title. 

All in all Stronghold Crusader 2 is a solid game and quite fun to play but in my own opinion it doesn't live up to either the hype or the legacy of the original Stronghold Crusader.

It is a real time (midevil) strategy game set in the Middle-East Crusades. Stronghold Crusader 2 is the sequel to the critically acclaimed original crusader which sets you back in the middle east versing some familiar foes (Rat, Lion, Shah, etc) and some new comers to the series.

As this game came out recently (September 23rd, 2014) it can obviously be expected that there are some minor bugs that occur (such as small series of lag, misplace of troops, etc) 

In comparison to Stronghold 3 this game is far better as it has a better hosting connectivity, less troop lag, and improved physics. 

Massive armies, easy to lay castle wall design, and town square layout design makes this game far easier to play. I have heard mixed reviews of this game- but after 6 hours in my first sitting I can say that it brings me back to the days of the Original Crusader. With massive armies, tactical maps, and strategic footholds- I am impressed with my first hands on experience. 

I would recommend this game to those who loved the original crusader as it is very much like the original.


Pros: 
-Ability to amass huge armies of up to 500 units.
-Ability to heal units using Arabic healers
-Quick place buildings in a easy to use square metrics system
-Smooth wall building and stair integration
-Army formations (Columns, Lines, etc)
-Variety of siege equipment bonuses
-Map variety
-Skirmishes mode
-Build your own multiplayer maps

Cons:
-Small community available
-Easy to defend (turtle) castles
-Some connectivity issues
-Soldiers sometimes bug out when you are replacing features of your castle (i.e. Barracks/Gate into wall)
-No Moats
-No Tunnelers",1411582532,1411670972,True,2,0,0.467722088098526001,0,True,False,False

What a mistake!
IT IS MISSING MANY THINGS FROM THE ORIGINAL!!!!!
No laddermen
No seige towers
No moats
No engineers! to use, build or put into your seige equipment. This changes gameplay massively, as it used to take time to get decent wall defences, because you had to first build the engineers workshop, produce engineers, and build a big enough tower, then build a ballista/mangonel etc on it, and then put your engineers in them for them to function. Now i just buy a bloody ballista tower as soon as the game starts and it begins shooting longrange hail marys from the get go.
What about PIMPING my castle... **** in 2002 i could put flags and the likes around, not in this remake.
No EVIL / NICE system in the castle. Gone are the days of building dungeons and setting out heads on spikes to scare your populace ****less so you can tax them etc... this also kills gameplay in a big way, that was so much of the fun!
Have to agree with most of the other comments.. The WALLS come down like polysterene blocks, so effortlessly and quickly.
Maps are tiny, one of the only flaws in original also. but its 2014 youd think they could have fixed that!!! Makes it annoyingly irritating to have resources far from castle so you can NEVER fully have your castle emcompass everything. You are always rebuilding or defending your resource buildings out in the middle of nowhere.
No more leather armour
No info when you scroll over buildings etc
No more peasants saying provocative gestures when u click em
No tunneling men?? that ive seen
The AI keep repeating the same tripe over n over again, its 2014 ! get a heap of new sayings in there not just 1 or 2 !!!
AI is not improved, they do the same **** over n over again from what ive experienced.
Economy is broken. Just build candlestick maker buildings and sell them at market and basically dont have to build any other resource buildings cause you can buy goods at market from candlestick profits!

Ahh the list is endless.

IT HAS LESS THAN THE ORIGINAL !!!

To be honest I am a bit disappointing with this game, as this is the game that used to bring me hours and hours of fun in my childhood memory.
Sure I used to be a big fan, and I will undoubtly pay you the money I owe you (I have to play pirate version of the game when I was a child). So I am not expecting a big improvement or anything, as least please just be as good as the one I used to play. But it is not, countless game feature that has been removed, even art works and CGs are not as good as its predecessor(But thanks god you keep the music as it was).
I will say this game is unfinished, the ONLY reason that is comforting me is I can use Steam to play with my friends instead of playing with myself as ten years ago, Yay.
BTW, if you are adding those features you used to have in DLCs! I WILL NEVER TOUCH ANY GAME FROM YOUR COMPANY!
========================================================================
总的来说我对这款游戏很失望，可能是因为前作对我影响太深吧。小时候没有网络，没有钱，我就玩着盗版的单机，一玩可以连续玩好久好久。
不过说实话我也对游戏行业的续作有些了解，知道成功的续作并不多。但是这款游戏不仅没有新的东西，许多经典的兵种啊特色啊CG什么的都被删除了- -，失望之余更多的是费解，我实在是不知道为什么。
总之吧，我买这款游戏的原因差不多就是有因为玩盗版前作的内疚感，算是还帐了~还有就是这次可以跟朋友玩玩多人模式。。虽然游戏是阉割过的，但是也挺不错
最后说一句，如果开放商打算把那些特色作为DLC加进去的话，我是绝！对！不！会！买！帐！的！",1411595539,1411596297,False,12,0,0.523438632488250732,0,True,False,False

I was playing games when DOS was still around and when Age of Empires 1 was the new thing on the MSN gaming zone.  My video game history encompases every genre but primarily focuses on Strategy games, FPS games, and the occasional RPG.  Stronghold 1 and Stronghold Crusader were essentially the same game with a different atmosphere and some unit changes.  Both were excellent games and the sucessors to follow did not so well.  Stronghold 2 was mediocre at best, the fantasy mythic Stronghold and Stronghold 3 were bad.  
Firefly split from their old publisher and became their own, just as many developers are doing these days because publishers like to add their two cents to game they know nothing about.  Stronghold Crusader II takes what the original did and improves upon it further.  The music and sound and very similar from the first and well done.  Some of the original quotes from the units are still there as you move your catapults and archers.  The villagers no longer speak to you when you click on them, instead it simply tells you what they are doing.  
One of the things that made Stronghold so great for me back in the day was destroying the castles and watching the walls crumble.  The massive armies going at it with each other and heads rolling.  The physics in this game are much improved as to be expected.  When catapults slam their boulders into a wall bodies standing near the point of impact are screwed.  See those thirty archers in a tight group?  Well now they are at the bottom in a pile where they belong.  Trebuchets have great range and destructive power and still need to be setup while the catapults have less range and can be shot by archers. Overall the military feels well done, especially that mace men frenzy charge that leaves nothing standing as they spit and scream their way into battle.  
While on the topic of military, some things have been reworked.  The laddermen are gone, which wasn't really a surprise, who ever used them anyways?  Moats and tunnelers have also been removed. At the time of this review sieging a castle isn't an easy task.  Strongwalls are not an option but the time it takes for any military unit to chip away at a wall or gatehouse isn't worth that route.  Almost your entire military force would be dead while they were picking away at the walls.  While I would still like the strongwall option, it works well as it stands.  As said before, catapults, trebuchets that fire boulders, cows, camelheads, and pigs, a bigger version of a catapult, rams, firecarts, and troop carriers are all the siege units.
Archers have remained the same but the crossbows no longer use animal hide as armor.  The swordsmen are still slow but the knights can get horses to get them from point A to point B quickly.  There is a new unit called the Sergeant at Arms which gives a bonus to troops within an area of effect, this can boost your other swordsmen, pikes, or whatever else you got nearby.  Of course, the higher military units cost a fortune to field but can essentially soak up arrows while your catapults lay waste to the walls and mace men haul tail into the base to wreck everything.
While building a military you will notice that you run out of gold quick unless you run an efficient economy.  Churches, breweries, and extra rations are all ways to keep your citizens happy to so you can generate more taxes.  The market will let you auto-sell and/or auto-purchase items.  This can be set as high or as low as you want.  Iron, stone, wood, pitch, all the basic resources sell for the least while the armors and weapons sell for the most.  Unlike the previous Crusader game, Inns providing ale do not need to be spammed but rather you adjust how much ale is consumed much in the same way as you would food.  This will increase happiness to get you the desired level but just make sure you have the hops farms and breweries to accomodate the usage level.  Churches act in much the same way in that you only need one but have to provide them with candles.  Once again, here you can adjust how many candles are used for the desired happiness.
So far I have played through the tutorial and the lionheart campaign.  The story isn't that great but the game does a good job at preparing you for harder battles.  Some are so difficult that if you don't complete the level quick enough the army forces become so numerous it is a massive chore to keep them at bay while you invade.  Additionally, I have played many skirmish matches, which is where the game is at for me.  I like setting up from scratch and playing massive 4v4 battles.  The game hosts 8 players, human or computer.  As in the old ones, the rat is the worst player while the wolf and some of the new comers bring a better challenge.  I have only had one crash to the desktop at the time of this review and that was right after intial installation and launching of a skirmish.  I loaded that same map again a second time and it worked fine.
That brings me to the bugs.  Most people were holding off on this game because of the reputation Firefly has.  Since Firefly is now technically a ""indie"" developer as they separated from their publisher, I would like to take away the fears of  purchasing this game.  Other than a few issues with selecting units or them getting stuck in a gatehouse I haven't had any issues.  Below are my specs just in case you are wondering and want to compare.

i5-2500k OC'd to 4.4 Ghz
16 GB of G Skill Ripjaws RAM
Dual 7970 Radeons
EVGA FTW Motherboard
2 OCZ Vector SSDs in RAID 0
1200 Watt PSU gold from Corsair
H100i CPU Cooler

With that setup I have no issues.  Some people have reported problems while others have not.  I am not sure how well they maintain their computer or what they have going on, as a system is going to be different from the next.  I run a tight ship on mine and have zero problems with running the game.

Final Thoughts:
Stronghold Crusader II is a well designed game that is being constantly updated with both fixes and soon to be new content.  On their forums they have laid out a plan on how they wish to progress with supporting this game.  It appears as though their heart is where it should be and a fleshed out game was designed.  Is it worth 50 dollars is the next question?  I would say no, 30 or 40 dollars maybe but not 50.  There isn't enough new content to justify the price but if you are a big fan of the original then price might not matter much to you.  I waited for 24 hours and looked at what people were saying before I purchased the game.  I hope this review helps you decide for yourself but please watch YouTube videos of the gameplay and try to find the glitches some are talking about and the ones I spoke of.

For those that are unsure if they should buy or not, i would say yes you should. The game has a great mechanic which ensures realism, like when you fire a catapult stone on a wall you might knock of archers or other units killing them instantly. It is filled with fun things when creating a custom skirmish like adding random events that may give you bonuses or penalties, depending on your luck. 

The game is packed with action, strategy and economy. You have to watch everything from ale distribution to how many candles you make. As in previous stronghold games the key concept is always there, build a castle worthy of your people and destroy other lords and their castles. There are some things you might have seen in earlier Stronghold games that is missing in SC 2, like moats but again, you are in the deserts and where shall you get enough water to fill your moats? 

Some may have said the game is bugged, unstable or lagging. This is of course factors that you find in any game that have just been released, but if you have noticed, a patch was recently released which has removed a lot of the lag. Improved the stability and fixed other bugs that have been there, so you can expect a stable and good game. 

Now, what about graphics? Many sees graphics as an important part of a game and i can understand that, SC 2's graphics are quite good, i have not tested the highest levels of graphics due to lag but from what i have seen the graphics are quite decent. Of course they could be better but that would inflict on stability and general lag, remember that a strategy game's mechanic is a bit more advanced than a first person game, they have to take in mind of big a game can end up to be, the troop counts for an example, so unless you got a really good and expensive gaming rig you might not manage to run the game on perfect quality without experiencing lag. 

So, what else to tell about the game? Well, the game is a massive upgrade as a sequel to stronghold crusader 1, you got more units with fun abilities or gameplay, like ordering your archers to fire a volley on the enemy, sending macemen to run over an attacking force creating havoc or maybe send explosive burning wheelbarrow things towards the enemy. There are loads of units to explore and tactics to learn. 

Is there no cons? Well actually, there is some cons to the game in my opinion, like 3 units i used to love in stronghold crusader is gone. These units are the tunneler, ladderman and siege tower. I do not know why the siege tower or ladderman was removed as they were a core part of the medival strategy to attack castles but i guess the gamemakers have their reason. Other then that, you might think some of the animations of the units are stupid or weird but that is kinda up for the individual to decide. 

So my conclusion is: This game is worth the money, it is not as expensive as all the other games in it's genre. It is filled with all the fun you could want as a Stronghold fan or a general strategy/castle sim fan. It has interesting combinations of units and tactics making each game a new from the other, especially in the multi player. Fun AI's to battle. A nice setting and decent graphics. + a fantastic soundtrack. I will give the game a 7/10, but if you really want to know how the game is, try it out. See for yourself how the game is, read others reviews and make a decision, i know i don't regret buying it and i recommend it to everyone. I hope you will buy it and enjoy it as much as i am.",1411436657,1411565826,True,5,0,0.477192193269729614,0,True,False,False

The ""economy"" is so simple it's pathetic: build something, then everything else is done automatically, you're done with it for the rest of the game.

Combat is atrocious. Only thing you can do is right click: right click to move, right click to attack. Beyond a 5 minutes ""tutorial"", the game doesn't teach you how to play. There are no tooltips, no stats: how do I know (if I'm ignorant and/or new to medieval RTS) the difference between a pikeman and a swordsman ? I don't.

Let's talk about the graphics now... Well, PC games had better graphics in 1998. And let's not talk about the UI. Or the intro cinematic. Remember Warcraft 2 intro cinematic ? You've got an idea of what I'm talking about. 

Oh and the maps... well, they look like a 10 years old kid made them in about 15 minutes each: most of them are squares within squares on a squared map. If you love symmetry, you'll love them. Nothing more to say, except it's pathetic.

As if it wasn't enough, the game is also full of bugs. I only played a couple of hours and already found a few:

- I once build a building on a place where cactii were growing. When you place the building, the cactii do not get razed, and they block the way, preventing my peasants to reach their working place.
- Walls. This game is about building strongholds and castles right ? Better be careful then because if you make a mistake, good luck fixing it. About half the walls I placed couldn't be erased. You just can't target them...
- Game was running somewhat smoothly (thank god, I got a beast computer) until I set some buildings on fire. It might be the cause, or it might be a coincidence, but the framerate dropped to about 2 fps from this point on. After about 5 minutes of this shit, I gave up.

Lets start with what's good. There isnt too much changed from the original. More or less the same units, same buildings, same game mechanics, also the music is fitting (well, its the same as in SHC). So, how can this be a bad game?
Graphics. Everything looks washed, tiny and small. Units look the same. Original SHC looked much better in my opinion. You cant differ. AI was bad in SHC, it hasnt improved much. Enemies just ran at your castle walls without any tactic at all (and they seem to use the same routes more or less everytime they attack). I cant figure out how to rotate buildings. Is there any hotkey? Are there any hotkeys at all? I dont know, the game doesnt tell me and there is now way to configure anything. There is not much new content. You even got nearly the same enemies you had in SHC1. There are bugs. Like catapults standing right in front of you shooting at your walls but somehow you cant destroy them with archers because they overlap with that enemy construction camp.

I played Co-Op with a friend on Multiplayer and had a blast. I think they did a great job and it takes me back to the begining days of the first one (minus the moats :p). It was fun playing as long as we were on voice chat. Not sure how you could possibly play Co-Op without talking to eachother. One person handled the logistics and the building, while I handled the military aspects. I also built all the miltary devices I needed and they built the walls. I would simply state I need gold for x and wait for my partner to grant it to me.

Some minor things:
I wish catapults would take out troops. Maybe it needs more testing but it seemed I couldn't use my catapults to take out troops.

If you play as co-op on a single team and the host surrenders the game, the second person is left in the game and made host. I think that it should surrender your partner as well but there might be an argument for the way it is now.

I would really like to play the Campaign on Co-Op. It would make for a more engaging game, as playing deathmatch gets old after awhile. I'd rather sandbox build with eneimes on the map or play the campaigns with a story line. That would be the ultimate.

As far as features go, it's hardly an improvement over SH 3 (e.g. still no moats which the original Stronghold Crusader) - basically, this is SH3 with a desert paintjob or SH Crusader in 3D but half the features cut.

Skirmish maps seem extremely small, but given the limited number of buildings, limited number of defences (e.g. just three towers) and much smaller buildings (e.g. the church is now the size of two houses, instead of 20) it might work out. Still, you're not gonna be able to build any ""castle"" worthy of that title.

Edit to add: Commanding units is extremely cumbersome, and precisely placing them on walls is nearly impossible since the icon turns from ""move"" to the stairs/""man walls"" icon.

Just starting with the basics, menu set-up and game customization: 

UI:
The user interface is somewhat standard faire - bottom menu bar, mini map, pop-up tooltips. But even these are lacking. The minimap provides little detailed useful information and is a general blotchy mess - there are no 'pings' to deliver location information for any contextual information provided, the representation of units and buildings on it is pixellated like you wouldn't believe, and for the size of the screen that it covers is basically an eyesore in the corner of the screen. Not that this is any different from the rest of the UI - the main displays for buildings and unit types are incredibly bland, the artwork is horribly un-inspired, and the tooltips provide very little actual information as to what capabilities anything brings to you. You cannot re-bind bind keys. You do not get a running list of resources that are available to you; you must hover over either a building in the action bar to view buildable resources available, or hover over your food/ale/perishable resources in the top right bar (because this couldn't all be done on one bar?) to see what you have left. Even with your perishable items, the game does not calculate total usage/production over time - only immediate production with immediate usage, so you have a harder time trying to figure out the optimal number of any production buildings you'll need to use.

Graphics:
Anyone that doesn't believe that graphics don't provide for gameplay is fooling themselves. The graphics need to match the setting, and this is something that Stronghold Crusader 2i is also lacking in. Playing the game on its highest settings, you will legitimately feel like your machine was transported ten years in the past. There is no reason for any game being released to look as poorly as this one does, it even performs poorly - there is no unit collision in a $50 game released in 2014? Regardless of how hard either of these things are to implement, you're charging full price for a game that does not deliver full-price accomodations in anything, and the extremely, extremely dated graphical and physics engine showcase that like nothing else in this game. 

Sound:
Aside from the lackluster voice acting, the actual scripts that the units and characters use in the game is chuckle-inducing at best and absolutely, ear-gratingly, cringeworthy at worst. This begins with the very first playthrough of the game - while the initial tutorial Scribe voiceover is not bad, every other aspect of what the game uses for units and sounds is. Wall crumbling? Sounds like build-a-blocks falling with a microphone placed next to them. Battle? *clang clang*. The music is absolutely stereotypical for both the time period and the game, which would not be bad, if the music weren't so low-quality, and if the music didn't randomly stop playing at times leaving your ears to drown in the abyss that are the original soundbytes of the few other things happening around you.

Gameplay:
The gameplay itself is one of the only saving graces of this game, and that being said, its a literal re-cycle of the last Stronghold Crusader. Even so, that gameplay has its merits, and when the sieges get going, there are some enjoyable moments. Besieging Castles, when the lackluster gameplay and units come together like they were originally intended, becomes fun, well-paced, and engaging. The problem is, that this does not happen often. The game itself is buggy, unit animations are terrible, and the control scheme is just as bad. 

All in all, this is an extremely disappointing outing for what was a very promising line of games, Stronghold 3 not included. 5.5/10. I would not recommend this game to anyone, not even with a sale, as there is just better out there to be had right now. While the gameplay remains a constant throughout the playable games in the series, the latest iteration is not a step in any direction but sideways for the franchise, and for the cost, you're better off going with a less buggy, more complete version of the original in HD.",1411491002,1411510150,False,8,0,0.437847226858139038,0,True,False,False

Boy was that a bad idea after playing the game. 
(i havent touched the multiplayer so i wont comment on that part)

I'll list some of my pros and cons about the game so far:

Cons:
------------- In General -----------------------------
-Menu, really simple (looks too ""clean/old fashioned"") [maybe just me? but thats what i thought]
-Artwork, Seems a little simple and cartoony for this sort of game.
-Options, Severe lack of options customisation! No controls changing! No advanced graphic settings (for a 2014 game).

-------------Moving to gameplay now---------------

-Unit Pathfinding sucks. utter terrible. (could be improved with a patch so wouldnt worry too much)
-Wall building system is terrible, i could place a wall then try to delete and not work.the wall is still there! (probably a bug)
-No moats! What happened to Crusader 1's moats??
-Everything is over simplified by a lot compared tot he original.
-No tooltips or explanations ( have to look on game wiki but i think the devs are being lazy here)
-Graphics in general,Textures are horrible! for a 2014 game
-LESS buildings than the original, YES, LESS STUFF, (isnt the point of a sequel is to expand the original?? not take stuff out!)
-Maps arent well designed, not many trees, not enough grass etc.
-Expensive! Everything is so expensive and selling doesnt get you much, (maybe needs a balance)
-They got rid of the happiness, decorations system! (sandbox without decorations?! thats suicidal)
-Units dont look as good as they should for a 2014 game, (maybe i should include this in graphics?)
-Right/left clicking was weird, cant change controls for these.
-Building against a natural ditch or water doesnt work very well, wall might cut off randomly without the battlements.
-Natural disasters!! Who the heck thought it was a good idea to include this??! (well at least you could turn it off xD)
-Did they recycle voices from the original? (i dont really mind but might not sit well with some people)

Pros: ( lets end witht he happy stuff)
-AI changes were much better than the original, although they still fall for the same tricks used in the original.
-Likes the market auto sell system!, nice touch!
-Got the same old Crusader 1 feel to the game!
-Liked some of the new defensive attachments.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Somethings devs might want to consider:
-INFORMATION! Add more tips! 
-When your resources are low make it blink or something!
-Can still repair walls instantly while enemy blowing up walls with trebs.
-Add moats back in.
-Maybe try some better graphics? ( dont know if its possible at this point).

Also just a note to the devs!

We love your work, we dont mind how long it takes to come out, be it 10 years or 20 years but please make it a great game worthy of the firefly title. I know you guys can do it from seeing crusader 1. Keep up the good work!

That's some seriously bad news for a game whose main feature is the fact that it's an RTS that plays out across entire deserts, on small ""Kingdom of Heavearn""-style maps where your stompy swordsmen, plodding archers, speedy horses, catapults, and even sling thrower units have scarcely vanished over one horizon before they come swarming over the other. ""How much,"" I asked, ""do I have to pay for a version with normal 2D maps?""

But then you start zooming out, and begin to realize that while you're able to see more territory, the curvature of these tiny castles means that you can still only see a fraction of the playing surface before you have to spin the camera to another position over the desert. It's a fog-of-war you can never dispel; even when you have intel coverage of an entire desert, your situational awareness is severely reduced.

Those big problems would be enough to make Stronghold Crusader 2 a flawed-but-fun experiment. What sinks it, tragically, is the lack of care and attention shown to the details and player aids. For starters, there’s little in-game help, and what's there is worse than nothing. I launched the tutorial to see what I was missing, and was treated to a low-res YouTube video that seemed more like a pitch for Stronghold Crusader 2 than a guide to playing it. Note to developers: Googling unofficial Stronghold Crusader 2 wikis to learn the basics of your game’s controls is not an appropriate substitute for a manual, and promo videos explaining the rudiments of RTS games are not substitutes for a tutorial.

To Stronghold Crusader 2's credit, the ""picture-in-picture"" option makes it easier to juggle two things at once, and does a great job of giving multi-monitor advantages to single-monitor users. On the other hand, it's not as good as actual multi-monitor support, a feature that’s desperately needed but does not seem to be supported. In fact, I think my preferred setup for play would be one of those banks of security camera monitors - maybe then I could see all the angles I need to..

Even more unforgivable is the lack of a save option, either in single-player skirmish or in multiplayer. (There’s no single-player campaign.) This is a big game and, like a lot of its predecessors, things can drag on for more than an hour as up to eight sides bash away at each other. Yet Stronghold Crusader 2 gives you no option to save your skirmish or multiplayer game to pick it up later. That's a shocking oversight, as is the fact that you must be online to play even a single-player skirmish.

On the other hand, it's in keeping with a general ""half-baked"" quality that pervades Stronghold Crusader 2. There's no faction design, just different skins for the all-important Crusader units who lead identical armies of swordsmen and archers. Maybe faction design matters slightly less in this style of RTS, where mass production and weight of numbers carries the day over individual unit tactics, but the lack of variety is still disappointing.

Even the good ideas end up going to waste. Stronghold Crusader 2 has a promising ""Crusade Trail"" mode in which you lead your faction from keep to keep, headhunting other crusaders, unlocking new siege equipments, and conquering territory. Trouble is, it's paper-thin and once again badly executed.

The ""strategic"" layer is no such thing. Your choice of where to go and who to fight is entirely meaningless. It is effectively solitaire. Second, you only have access to a fraction of the siege equipment tree. You have to expand your options by exploring the galaxy as your conquer it, and choosing which siege equipments to keep and which to permanently discard.

That's a nifty idea, except that it's so restrictive as to be annoying after a little while. For instance, in one mission I ended up stuck on two deserts, but I was siege equipment-locked out of the sling thrower combat units I needed to clear the space above my AI adversary's final stronghold. My unarmed transports were swarmed by his sling thrower interceptors every time, and I could never establish a foothold. So I had no choice but to build a barrage of 14 trebuchet cow launchers and just spam the desert until, by blind luck, I nailed his Crusader. It was a 100-minute match, and 40 minutes of that was just waiting for archers to finish. I guess I could have built giant siege engines to smash one siege tower into another, but only on certain maps that have mineable quarries – and that would’ve taken even longer. Besides, I don't think I had that siege equipment, either.

Sadly, that was one of the better solo games in Crusade Trail. The AI doesn't seem to know what to make of the limited build options, and rarely put up a fight. Too often, I'd find the enemy Crusader just running around the wilderness, waiting to get mugged. In a skirmish, the AI held its own, but the Crusade Trail adversary seemed to have trouble building a factory. It's just no fun playing such an opponent, so what could have been a gentle, easy way to learn to play turns into a slog from one arabian keep to another.

But the biggest problem with Stronghold Crusader 2 is that it's nowhere near as good as the games its consciously aping. Stronghold Crusader, made all the way back in 2002, is still better than this game. Either of the Extreme Crusader games (and especially Extreme Crusader: Forged Alliance) leaves Stronghold Crusader 2 in the dust, and they're a whole lot cheaper. There is simply no reason to play this game when those others are still better in every respect.

In all, It's okay.

First this that I noticed before even starting the game I couldn't find a control list, so no rebindable keys.

Some of the units move like they're robots especially the rangers.
The soundeffects are dull to say the least, a landing trebucet stone gives to sone of someone dropping a little rock from 1 meter high.

The game prommises to be a fast paced game just like the original, but wth the over the top building costs and slow gathering of goods the game quickly grinds to a halt.

A lack of different camara option like the top-down build view is irritating to say the least (They could have added it but in that case I couldn't find it because there is no list of controls anywhere).

The original had more content in some area's like the possibilty to build gardens and maypoles or torture machinery.
But it does have more units in comparison to the original. It's also quite nice the see that some units have a special ability, yet they prommise every unit has a special abbility and this maybe true, but I couldn't find it with the archers and swordman.

And then there is the biggest flaw, the graphics.
I plaued the game on the highest settings and still was disapionted, the game just doesn't look good, it look allright but not like a game from 2014 should look like. 
The game I played was on a mountainy map, on which they tried to make some dust being moved by the wind, this was the biggest fault the could have made, it looks terrible the glitches though everything and looks like shit. 

There is practically no ballencing in the game, They said they wanted to spend extra time on that, but certain units are just flat out OP.

I was really hyped to the point where I actually pre-purchad the special eddition, biggest mistake in my live, this game isn't finnished and should have never been released in this state.

Try avouding this game until it gets a has been updated to a resenable standart.

Let's start at the beginning. The intro...

The intro looks like it's from 2006 or 2005 or even older. The animations are choppy and you don't even get the purpose of it. At least I did not.

You can give your email to get another 10 icons... yeah, I mean shield icons. Such an amateur way to get subscribers to their newsletters and stuff. (You can uncheck those though) But you still get into their system.

In the mainmenu, the announcer starts with ""Welcome to Stronhold Crusader 2 my liege."". O K.

The menu is just nothing like Stronghold Crusader 1's. It looks amateur, simple and hell, there are not much of skirmishes. The menu itself is just, I don't know, confusing? I don't know why they chose the drag and drop team arranging, but it sucks. When you select a map in the menu, there is a slight delay which is irritating. I guess it is because of loading the minimap of the map, but whatever.

The voice acting is... well... you better check it out yourself. The peasants has no voice, nor image like we used to in Crusader 1. (Nor does the workers by the way)

The fact that they changed Lionheart's character, makes me sad. He used to be my favorite character in the game, but now... they ruined him. They changed his voice too.

Also, the announcer keeps telling you what is happening, if an enemy is attacking, you are going to be noticed. I also found hard to see what's going on on the battlefield as there are 3-4 players fighting, and you just can't distinguish the units' colors.

The UI is horrible, nothing like Crusader 1's, you just search for things mid-game, but that is not a problem, because the game itself is so slow in pace, that you can go out and cook some meal while you are waiting for resources. Building your castle became horrible, you can no longer twist the stairs, nor you can get your men at the wall through the gatehouse. Which seems more realistic of course... but eh.

Estates... yeah well. I captured an estate on one of the maps in custom skirmish, but no one gave a fuck about it. From the estates, oxes(I guess) deliver resources to your main state, and yeah, guess what. They are slow.

(I have rechecked and found that you can click on the minimap and it goes there, but only if you don't move your cursor, not even accidentally.) 
If you thought at least you can click on the minimap to move the camera there, you are going to have a bad time. You can only drag the camera with the minimap which is what the f. I was very surprised, so you got to scroll around.

There are dashes indicating the end of the map, which you can't hide, or at least I did not find a way to do it so. Bugged the hell out of me.

No collision detection! HURRAY! Although this can ease the gameplay, and makes the battles easier, it would be still nice in 2014.

So the main reason I played only 30 mins after paying 35€ is that I can't stand the pace of the game, the stronghold 2 like graphics and the whole UI design it is just horrible. Don't judge by the videos they put on the store page. Check a real gameplay on youtube or something.

Don't buy it until you are sure that you want this. Waste of money in my opinion. Thanks Firefly for ruining the Stronghold Crusader series.",1411468045,1411493325,False,22,0,0.495165139436721802,4,True,False,False

Good pace and balance, buildings a good size, easy placement, graphics options, scaled tutorial missions.

My only hope is that the $50 I spent on Stronghold 3 have gone towards making this game as good as it is, and that the $50 I just spent on Crusader 2 go towards a celebration party for a job well done.

-Not to many new features as I have seen.

the bad stuff:

However i think the graphical issue has been improved even tough some things are VERY unrealistic; units glide over the terrain. Mounted siege equipment does not need engeniers and the woodne construction magicly comes to life. The smelter now has limited only 2 engeniers?? many of the figthing soldiers and some shooting soldiers were the animations simply don't match.

And some game mechanics...
Stronghold 2 had some of the best ideas that simply had to be balanced to working conditions...
-The crime scene easely could been implanted if it was not so complicated and big.
-The lords kitchen with parties (and the lords wife!) in the keep was so magnificent (but leave it there cuzz when the lord leaves the keep the problem with stupid sneak attacks is to great) ashame to not do that! You could have easely made him eat the same food as your peasents and give a bonus in gold or popularity or somehting like that when you feast. In SH2 it was also awsome to see the armys march first into the keep on the stairs and only then upstairs.
-The removal of fear factor is realy a shame since everyone wants to pick the side of either the evil lord or the good lord with both its benefits and penalties.
-The original mechanic of priests was so creative why do you have to make it almost the same as the inn?
Converting peasents lead to some care over the population this game initially don't want you to care about.
-The houses are way to big or they should have had more people living in them (like double or so)
-Farms are to small and to less productive. Making a farm bigger and more productive make  amore interesting side.
or perhaps just build huts and let workers plant there plants on the land themselfs could also be great
-on original SHC it was the same but i still think arabian troops need a weapon cost as well.
-i miss the function to flatten ervything so i have a good layout of my castle
-better zooming in and out would have bene great
-the hoarding on towers is bugged and stays on the same hight as normal walls
-Magicly appearing siege camps and magiccly let an entire army of catapults purr out??? seriously i tought you had learned your lesson about that! when someone is not paying attention and you build a siege camp behind there castle evrything lies in ruins in less then 30 seconds... The engeniers system like in SHC1 was fine it only needed to be able to build easyiers more siege equipment. p.s. NO ladders??? no siege towers????? no Moat??? wtf!!!

Also the city simply didn't feel as lively as the original stronghold crusader did. Everything goes to slow the peasents jobs are very boring and the city is pretty empty. The original crusader had problems with not being able to build over people but it least it had mothers caring over children, children playign around, drunkers getting wasted and simply more people that did more interesting stuff, Let people enjoy your castle to... (the apothacary could have been healing your lord and your peasents and make him wandering about). The economy also goes far to slow wich can easily be solved by doubling EVERY peasents there walking speed and there spawn speed. perhaps an auto create soldiers function could be a great idea to

The good stuff:
-Graphics are well updated despites the poor animations.
-You can now choose some apearance to your lord and by it how the keep looks. Choosing from christian or arabian lords result in building either square towers or round towers wich is an excelent way to make the castle look instantly diffrent. (if u realy want to spoil fans why not make a custom outfitter to create an own lord with custimizeble loadouts from helmets armor weapons and mantle... Fans would LOVE this)
Also the churches for christian lords and mosques for arabian lords are well done(despites there mechanics).
-Some units ability's are a good way to increase the way how your soldiers want to react to threats and gives more influence on the outcome of a battle.
-Everything is VERY WELL organized really compliments on this one! You can on multiple ways see and adjust some of the most importent things about your economy, also the market with auto buy and auto sell option while you can buy and sell everything from the beginningin there respective storage depot is absolutely well done.
-Infinite store space in the stockpile and granery, perhaps unrealistic but for smooth gameplay this is a must and you have did it great! (however the stockpile being a square rather then a straight lane would have been even better!)
-How the flying cows, lions, donkeys, and camel head explode on impact when launched from a catapult awsome!!
It would have been SO MUCH greater if u used more of the same gore with the fighting troops (meelee fighters cutting other soldiers heads arms and leggs off) I know that in 3d gore is more difficult but it realy could have been better done.
-You need only one church and one inn and the effects are custimizeble. This is a good way to keep castles more realistic but it also makes the castle more boring.
-You can now create walls without een auto platform for units to walk on, now you can create mulitple layers of walls without auto connecting all of them!
-the iron mines are much better done! longer and nice animations but the birng up more iron every turn. (this would also have been great for the stone quarry)
-The fact that people always can get to there working spaces due to narrow corridors.
-The greater numbers on popularity and economy resources are also much better done
-The continious increase of gold true taxes gives you a much better vieuw of how much gold you get from them.
-The prices of the market realy encourges you to make everything yourself and not producing to much since selling it is hardly worth it, however it would have been nicer to see a changing market based on what all the people buy and sell in the market to see more rare materials and more common materials result in price change.
-Reduces range of archers catapults and averything that fires SHC1 realyt had a problem there with archers that kills people on ranges a sniper rifle would hardley do the trick.

So overal i will say i still reccommend this game but i do hope the developers are not going to do something else cuzz this game needs lots of updates and perhaps an expansion or 2-3 before it will be realy good. I thank you!

The game literally feels like they patched the original to be in 3D. In addition all the new features really do bring as well more to the same experience - you can have your traditional horse archer setup but you can also throw in the new units and abilities to let you truly take over the battlefield - Because unlike most sequels it has not made your traditional strategies obsolete.

The graphics are in the same art style as the original game and flow quite well, I do not have a very strong system but it does run like butter on it - it may not be the most intense graphically, but it is very pleasing to the eye. As well the campaigns are varied and interesting - there are a series of tutorials as well as 'learning campaigns' that let you learn the ropes of the existing and new features.

And then there is the trail - they have come back with a vengeance - you'll be spending a lot of time trying to get through them because of one reason. The AI. The features of the original return, skirmishes, AI in multiplayer and all that. I've played one match and I was soundly defeated - the AI knows how to utilise all the units and their strategies perfectly - but not so much that they appear to cheat.

If you're a fan of the original, this is more of the same - but better. I would fully recommend it.",1411431183,1411431183,True,10,0,0.53525698184967041,0,True,False,False

Being a big fan of the original Stronghold and Stronghold Crusader, I was very much looking forward to a sequel to one of my favorite games. I was hoping for a more streamined game from it's predecessors (Stronghold Legends, II, and III) that would bring back the well-paced and simple fun of the original (not that silly extreme game). I will admit I did worry some when I noticed one of the devs had a Stronghold II (or III) box in his office, but my hopes for this game were high. My heightened hopes were a result of incresingly better games by Firefly being produced since the abysmal hole of  a game that Stronghold Legends was, a game so bad it melted out of computer and through my floor into the basement. 

Sadly,  for Stronghold Crusader II the developers seemed to have decided that realism was much more important than convenience, and have made a pretty, slow, and clunky tactical game. I decided to make an 8-way on the 'Insanity' map (a practice I commonly did in the original), but got so bored of the game that by the time you see I've played I honestly wished that I was playing the other Crusader instead. 

The graphics are nice (at least compared to, say, Stronghold Crusader I), that is, until my intersected walls have turned into a honeycomb of chest-high fortifications. However, the camera is worse than it was in Stronghold III, as it has a slight lag to it and it is still obnoxious to look around objects. What was so bad about the option to flatten tall objects in the original that they don't want to include it in later games? Again, it seems convenience was cut out for more of the realistic history lesson. Because an ugly Englishman punching a Sultan in the face could have actually happened.

Perhaps the most annoying issue that occurred was about my farming operation. Back in Stronghold Crusader, and even in Stronghold III, I could use two wheat farms to support a rather decent population (as long as they had proper support from the local bakers and mill-children). Here, I kept running out of food because my three farms were insufficient for my 16 peasants. Turns out, my mill had no access to the stockpile, despite being purposefully built right next to it. In case you ask, no, I was indeed smart enough to leave access to the entrance to the mill, but the game hadn't realized the fact!

I don't recall ever asking myself when playing Stronghold I: ""Gee, I wish I could have to align ever building properly before it could be used instead of just plonking it down and getting on with my life."" I suppose it does allow for creative detail, but it seems so useless in comparison when I could focus less on perfecting my building alignments and more on insuring my strong economy and bashing some knights in. I understand that when making a 3-d game, it is necessary to make exact entrances to your buildings, but perhaps you give single buildings a little breathing room or four-way accessibility instead? Still, it is easier than it was in Stronghold II, so this is just nitpicking.

The focus on realistic castle-building causes the pace of the game to slow to a creep, the intermittent lag makes enjoying your work obnoxious, and even it's new and improved designs fall flat and are prone to bugging out. Now, I think I'm going to go play some of the original instead.
