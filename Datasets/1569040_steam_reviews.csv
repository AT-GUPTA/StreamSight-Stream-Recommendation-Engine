This phantom has been hunting this game and the back of my head for a lot since i've started, but in my last campaign, i just had enough. On year 1 of a Schalke 04 campaign, i ended up, luckily, to the semifinals of DFB - Pokal by knocking out Borussia Dortmund, which i thought was a lost cause. In this semi-final, i was up against Bayern Munchen. Now, i don't savescum or stuff in this game, except when i missclick something, but this time i decided that i wanted to win this round by force and then lose or whatever in the finals, just cause i thought Bundesliga would have been less boring without Bayern continously winning over and over, and by having Eintracht Frankfurt or Wolfsburg win the DFB Pokal, they would have had a little boost of money to become more threatening next year. Well, guess what. I have, by now, replayed the game against Bayern Munchen 90 times. YES: 90 TIMES. It did not matter the tactics, modules, substitutions, score at the end of the first time. NOTHING. EVER. DID. BAYERN WON EVERY SINGLE MATCH WE PLAYED WITHOUT MOVING AN INCH. Now, we all know how pretentious or hard it may sound from a Bundesliga 2 team to beat such a giant, but still, considering i unexpectedly won against a top tier team like Dortmund, and that in real life, Bayern even lost at round 2 by a Bundesliga 3 team, plus considering the fact that this game is SUPPOSED to include some degree of rng, i expected to win, even by a miracle, just once against Bayern, and at a certain point i just refused to give that game up and started truly experimenting how hard Football Manager series is scripted, and that's the conclusion: 90 GAMES, 90 DEFEATS. I don't know if i'll keep trying this madness or just drop the game entirely since it's so blatantly scripted it makes any normal player puke, but at least i'll just share my experience with you so that you'll know what will be expecting you inside every game of the series.

- Most of the training sessions seem to not work (give any affect), yet one spends hours setting meticulously a training schedule. SHAME on you producers for misleading us!
- Team B / Under 23 system is broken; players do not evolve when playing friendlies.
- Players' happiness is just a joke, especially their playing time mechanics, which is super frustrating with a busy schedule.

At first I was happy, but the longer I play this game the more I realise how broken it is. 
Honestly, a lot of lazy coding in there, bugs, and broken mechanics, which can't be spotted immediately but only after many hours of playing, testing, and observation. Here is my beef with the producers - you try to fool me into thinking that making something in the game makes sense and is working, while in the script nothing really happens!

The problem is that casual and new players will not notice much due to the overwhelming amount of details, bells, and whistles. So they rate the game high. It feels complex and detailed at the start but then all you can see is a simplistic, boring, repetitive Copy/Paste script.

Some more examples:
- Team and press interactions are just junk.
- Team dynamics changes often seem random.
- All that the opposing team needs is higher attribute players + high pressing = your goalkeeper will never manage to pass the ball and will always catapult it away even if the fullbacks sit free and available. Tactics and team instruction do not have any effect here.
- Visuals during the match are also hilarious. The moment you play against more skillful players, suddenly your own players behave as if they have been transplanted monkey brains just for that one match and cant make a simple pass while not even being under pressure.",1675530507,1681562165,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I run into this problem each year, even with overpowered tactics (the very best I can find on the net).  I usually play with middle board teams in 2nd division championships, wining comfortably against superiors teams but (almost) always losing against inferior teams.

When I used to play it, I used to leave it open in the background while browsing and stuff. I even used to forget it running and go to sleep! 

The Football Manager series has lots of pros, like some depth and tons of replayablility, but its cons are obnoxious enough to merit a downvote as far as I'm concerned. My biggest gripe with the series is that it is released every single year as a new game with a AAA price tag. Do the annual upgrades or additions justify a AAA price tag of a new game? Not even remotely. This, alone, is so low, obnoxious, unethical, lazy, and predatory that it deserves a hundred thousand downvotes.

Other cons for the game include bad optimization or lack of responsiveness, regular loading times that definitely could've been eliminated or at least shortened with smarter code, outdated graphics, horrendous animations, and an obvious lack of user-friendliness in the UI design, like too many clicks to achieve things that could've been achieved with half the clicks if the developing company stops being greedy and hires competitive UI, UX, and user-friendly design experts to help design the interface and the whole game.

The main reason for the ratings being generally positive on Steam is the addictive nature of the game for some players, which makes those poor addicts keep buying the game for full price annually instead of demanding these crumbs of improvements as DLCs or expansions. The second reason is the players who try the game for the first time and give it a thumbs up; those are justified in their rating sometimes, but I hope that they change their rating once they realize that there are zero expansions, and next year's release shows up with the predatory price tag that hits them in the face and wakes them up from the addictive stupor. Oh, but even then, it could be too late to raise awareness about this scheme, because the developer asks Steam to hide the older Football Manager games from searches and only show the current year's release with every new release. You know, just in case you had any suspicions about their predatory policies.

If you are a diehard fan of soccer or football itself and its players, which is one of the main reasons you would play this game, then I don't think I can benefit you beyond what I wrote above plus adding that you may want to buy an older key for the cheapest price possible or try the game as part of a game pass to which you subscribe for [other] reasons. Football Manager 2022, for example, would allow you to experience everything worth experiencing in this series without paying the highest price for the current year's release. However, if you like these types of games generally, my strong advice instead is to try, put your money in, and play Cities: Skylines. It is an even deeper strategy game with [actual] graphics and from a much more ethical developer.",1673305297,1673355702,False,5,0,0.53465801477432251,0,True,False,False

The downsides are that they lost the rights to certain teams, leagues and competitions. So they either have a different name or an abbreviation. Japan and Germany National sides are still unplayable. My biggest gripe is the way you now have to access the U23s and U-18s side for your team. Before it was on the left hand side. Now you have to take a few extra steps to get to see both sides.

newgens faces sucks. Zealand's mod is solving this, but it needs to run some manual actions each season regularly. For some reason, I had to choose players or staff faces, never worked both.
Scouting UI is very unfriendly. Scouting itself works ok but managing more than 3 scouts really sucks
Mentoring sucks - some drag and drag, and not rearranging after removing/adding player would be nice
Removing league level sucks, it takes extra year. If you start playing 9th or 8th premier league, performance issue in second season is huge even on strong machine.
Some conversations are difficult to predict the result, end season for example. It would be nice to have some basic guideline how much ambition you have, and how much team expects.
Atracting strong players are quite difficult for low reputation team. And it is also difficult to build reputation without strong players. The priority is: general team reputation, champions league or lower, current ability of players, salary and status, position in league, potential of other players.

Match Engine works well. I had to switch camera settings, in old editions TV view was default but in this edition it was a different view which looks like a tactic whiteboard, but when I switched it back then it was exactly like the old editions.

Haven't encountered any errors in-match, which used to happen with the older versions, so I think they have improved that side and more stabilised the game.

I'm not really a sports fan, only a casual one. Football is one of the few sports that I occasionally enjoy. This game is not for me. It is for people that are hardcore into clubs and who want to get deep into it's management side. So when you read the following, remember that my opinion is based on me not really caring too much about the sport and that I expect somewhat more casual gameplay.

I tried to like this game, and tried it twice. First for 10 min then refunded it, the second time I watched some startup tutorials and got it again and tried it until my first season practice match, then refunded it.

I still could not deal with it. Way back in the day I had played the ""original"" Football Manager on Commodore. It was basically Pong with more bars, and some basic management of the bars (the players). Google Pong if you have to. No not bong..., Pong! 

Management back then was simple, you sold and bought players, stadiums, and some other few basic things, that was it. It was mainly about the matches. Matches made money, you could buy better players, won more matches made more money bought more players, you could play it half asleep and still win. 

In this here game you can delegate a lot of the ""boring"" management but then you lose control over what is going on and after a seemingly endless time of just clicking through a flood of management tasks and choices to make it, finally culminates in a match. The management is pretty deep, the media is on you all the time with their opinions, the players aren't doing their jobs unless you give them an encouraging slap around and there are lots of fluff tasks that give content to your every day inbox.

I was ready to deal with all the clickery, having gotten the impression that at least the matches would be very well animated (as that seemed to be advertised and reviews from fans had said that the realism of the matches was at the highest level so far seen.)

When I finally managed to ""yes to everything""-myself to the first match the big disappointment came. 

It felt kind of lifeless. The options for how a match was shown felt unintuitive. I could either watch the entire match in whole (90 mins!), or let it be shown in different types highlight cuts that didn't make much sense to me, (not even their nomenclature made much sense). The players moved in a typical computer animated way (not really that fluently), the passes were very linear, the animations seemed few, the audio seemed to be taken (yet upsampled) from the original FM from the Commodore, (especially the kicks, all sounded exactly the same, with exactly the same volume every time) it was just annoying! The graphics weren't what you could expect from this day and age either and I had maxed everything out.

I don't know, I expected better. This is not a cheap game! This is still basically a text based game after all. Not really much effort had been spent on the match graphics and animation, and the sound is absolutely sub par and seriously on a level from 30 years ago. This is definitely a cash cow, which is actually kind of typical for EA. High price for lackluster content.

If you love the sport and want to feel you're doing something meeningful in your spare time, good for you, you probably enjoy this. But for someone like me who wants to just casually fiddle with a team and pretend to watch a leage on demand where the team you cheer for eventually wins, it's not good. Not for what you get, not at that price, and for that it feels like I'm back at work, as it seriously feels like work. I prefer to leave the job at work and relax at home. 

And even for people exited for this kind of game a more realistic price would be $15. That's it. Compare how much work must have been put into one of the later Assassins Creeds, compared with making a graphical interface for a lot of databases, some counters, some randomizers, slap on some shoddy 3D graphics where you don't even control anything as the gamer, add a little bit of freeware sound effects and you're done. Nah... you are being robbed. 

Think before you buy, and watch tutorials on how to start it up, because you will without a doubt have to spend many hours getting through the first management phase until you get a bit of a feel for the game and by then you might well have passed the refund time. I can bet EA made it so on purpose so you wouldn't get a good feel for the first whole game cycle before 2 hours (more like 4-6) so you couldn't refund it in time. EA put more effort into making it non-refundable than into the matches. Sad but typical EA. Don't buy if you aren't a football nerd with at least level 90.",1666416925,1666416925,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Not recommended because it feels like nothing has really changed except nicer design and some data shit. All players has always demanded enhancement of actual gaming experience itself but SI never has done that. Devs wait for the mod to come out and put that in their next version like every time. Bravo! man! Bravo~

The state of the engine currently although FAR from what it could be , is nevertheless fairly decent and is actually amazing if you compare it to certain other engines.
My only clear complain at this moment is they need to tweak out certain aspects like :
ability of goalkeepers and distribution of goalkeepers.
I have seen ridiculous scripted games where average goalkeepers on about 110 ca manage about 20 saves a game etc.
I would not complain if the goalkeeper was say Donnaruma or Allison but when some poo on about 110 current ability makes like 50 saves a game that is just unrealistic and unbelievable. Also goalkeeper distribution is really poor and it doesnt help if you have a GK with amazing distribution to launch counterattacks. For instance if u set to distribute fast he would probably just instantly launch the ball somewhere randomly and loose possesion for you.
Besides that *MINOR* tweaks could be called for in the engine but all in all it is MUCH better than the crap I have seen before. Certain factors come too much in the play like reputation of clubs influences your results too much etc. but nowhere NEAR the extent of some previous football managers. IN fact i'd say in RELATIVE terms this engine is quite well balanced at least in comparison to other engines.

I've played almost every version of this game, starting with the Championship Manager series. The game has changed so much over time, and for the most part the changes have been improvements. That having said, looking at recent years, a lot of changes have not been improvements and the focus is on the wrong things.

I'm not going to beat around the bush. The graphics are bad for a 2022 game from a big developer. You can bring all the arguments to the table that you want, it doesn't change the fact that the graphics are simply not good. I, too, celebrated when the graphics changed from 2D to 3D and I thought it looked good at the time. Years later, and the graphics have not improved at all. Any other game, literally any other game in any series has improved their graphics, except Football Manager. You may argue that FM is not about the graphics and that its power lies in being an amazing ""spreadsheet manager"". However, years ago, they put all that effort into creating a 3D engine, so I would argue that SEGA does care about the graphics, but they put their energy elsewhere. Which brings me back to my original point; the focus is on the wrong things.

I see new features and announcements of changes in the media interviews, more data, a deadline day feature, squad dynamics. Do these things really improve the game? Are they features that people keep using? That people keep coming back for? I've used the deadline day feature and don't see the appeal. I don't see how it makes the game better. More data? More dynamics? You can have all the data and statistics you want but you can still simply download a tactic from the internet and go an entire season unbeaten. With a downloaded tactic. One tactic that fits all. And no you don't have to pay attention to dynamics, or pay attention to training, or the data hub, or all the added statistics, just get a tactic from the web and you're good. Is it wrong when a downloaded tactic can do that? No. But it doesn't make sense to keep adding stuff and features around statistics, information, more buttons, etc. etc. when all you really need is a good tactic.

Meanwhile, the game looks like it was made for the PS1. 

To put it into perspective; PES Club Manager had better graphics (unreal engine) and was just as enjoyable. It was all about managing your club, had plenty of tactic tweaking and statistics, but didn't go overboard with it. And the matches were fun to watch. It makes me sad to think a mobile game looked better than one of my favorite series of all time.

This is why I don't recommend buying this game. And I won't be buying FM23. 

The game has plenty of features. The game has plenty of data and statistics. Let's focus on the graphics once again. Let's try to make the game look good. It doesn't need a yearly graphics update, but man, it's been 13 years since we first saw this 3D engine.",1663098514,1663098514,False,3,0,0.480754107236862183,0,True,False,False

Match engine is much better than last years, although it still has a lot of work to be done. Don't despair if you suffer a goal because your defender passed to the goalie instead of clearing it out. It happens to me and everyone quite frequently. Less frequently the better your team is. With Ipswich Town, I was suffering goals like that every 2 months give or take. At Liverpool, I've only suffered it 2 or 3 times over 8 years of in-game time. Nothing game breaking but it sure can ruin cup runs and possibly league titles. 

I would like to see the role playing aspect expanded if possible, maybe something you can do with your money or social interactions with other managers or players. I feel there is a lot of potential on the role playing side and less on the football side as it is already at a very high level of detail.

It is hard to avoid the question that makes you try to answer how the hell did developers created such a huge content?
Althought there is not many similar games in the market I would strongly suggest FM 22 to any gamer that likes playing this type of games. I believe the game needs to repeat itself a little lesser though. I want stuff like, footballers having night out missing the training, small surprises you need to deal with. Lesser complaints from the players when bigger clubs ask to sign them. And of private life stuff add on. Game is good but it should also make u smile now and then. Ways of boundings between club members - footballers should be more diverse. Legendary players should be mentioned in a way that makes them look special. More interesting stuff needs to be added. Without making the game too much complicated. I can safely say the optimization is very good. Enjoyed the game thousandfolds.

Since 2014 I've been pretty much settled with the FM franchise, I've been playing Football Manager 2015 for the past 7 years, and after giving FM2022 a shot I think I will simply continue playing FM2015 for another 5 years at least.

[b]I do not understand how is it possible that Sigames keeps simply UIwashing the same exact game[/b], with the same exact issues, and selling it for €55 season after season, even though it's been a while since they don't even have to pay for FIFA and UEFA licenses because someone will just mod them out for them.

I believe the match engine hasn't improved a bit in 7 years, besides tiny adjustments in the animations. The training system is still quite annoying, so I just skipped it and delegated it to my coaches. The tactics are exactly the same as they were in 2014, with really minor changes, and they still have the same issues. They assume, for instance, tikitaka style must be played pushing the game through the center of the field, while in reality Barça and the Spanish team always used open wingers and really tried to make the field as wide as possible. Because of that, if you want to succeed in this game, you have to go for Italian catenaccio and counterattack or for a Premier League direct attacking style.

[b]The press conferences were already annoying in FM2015, and they are even worse now[/b]. Sure, they have more options now, but that only means you waste more time reading the new questions and answers and picking the ones that you will be repeating forever from that moment on. Plus, you now have a second press conference after every match. [b]Another thing that you will most likely delegate to your coaches[/b].

There are even several aspects where I find the game is worse than FM2015. [b]Contracts are a nightmare. There is no room for negotiation whatsoever[/b], players have their demands and you must meet them or they will leave. Plus, their demands often make no sense. [b]I've had several players asking for 20M yearly salary contracts, which I denied, and then they signed for different clubs for just 10M[/b]. Rookies ask for insane amounts of money or protagonism. One of my rookies, 17, refused to even discuss his new contract because I refused sending him on loan to a 2nd division team six months earlier, while he was playing regularly and won the triplet twice with my team. My team, by the way, is the richest and is at the top of the ranks in prestige. [b]Truly seems like the constant whining of the players is just another way Sigames has found to make players spend more hours playing[/b], just like the exhausting press conferences and so on, but there is really nothing pleasant in negotiations or discussions with players whatsoever.

[b]I'm truly sad there is no real competition for this game to actually push some improvement on it[/b]. Sure, it's a very good game, it was 10 years ago. But it's still the same now, almost exactly the same as it already was in 2011. How is it possible that this franchise keeps charging €55 for every single UI rewashing, and how is it possible that everyone keeps buying it year after year? That is simply beyond my understanding.",1640980788,1661255055,False,28,1,0.696389555931091309,0,True,False,False

Update after playing another 48hrs of playing the game, and yes it is junk has too many issues (no better than the version before as core game remain the same).

The graphics have a way to go but I'm sure they'll nail that with years to come in this franchise. The gameplay engine also could use some work but they are also working on that. Will get better with time. I also wish you could customize the runs that players make more. You control the tactics by setting team-wide tactics as well as a very specific positional instruction for each player. However, ideally you would be able to set up different types of custom plays in a sense. For example, if your wingers are getting marked tight, instruct them to come short to receive the ball, bringing the full backs out and creating space behind, then instructing the playmakers to play into that space behind rather than to the feet of the winger. Stuff like this would obviously be complex to code into gameplay I assume, but hopefully in the future of the franchise (for me at least).

I recently went back and played (for reasons passing understanding) CM97/98, CM01/02, FM07, FM21 Classic, FM21 regular and this all side-by-side over a week. Sure, the 'classics' have their charm - but FM22's tactical flexibility and variety (there are many ways to be successful) and ability to either tear through a season or go ploddingly slowly if you want make it very adaptable to different playstyles. 

The community support for the game - especially through Facepacks, logopacks, skins etc - and the constant tactical advice released by the SI Games team all mean you're never too far away from a helping hand and/or something to add more realism to the game.

My most recent playthough involved the OZI skin (I think!), the huge global facepacks and logo packs, updated kits and the 22/23 EPL squad updates and it's like a brand new game.

I still waited for it to go on sale 50% off which is only fair if you have to by a new version of this game every year....actually looking forward to FM23.

It feels like this is a buggy early beta build, not a fully released product. The match engine is the most unrealistic so far, with the only viable tactics in most situations being some form of pressing, short passing system even in lower leagues where this type of tactic shouldn't be possible. No matter what happens, even the worst teams in the league have completion percentages of 85% or higher, which if you know anything about football you'd recognize as being a bit absurd (maybe that would be normal for the best teams, but when the worst team in the sixth tier of English football is passing with 90% accuracy, you know something is wrong). Sometimes defenders decide to just wander off and are nowhere near the play. You can't play with anything other than a high defensive line, as crosses are way too effective this year. The transfer system is a bit of a mess, with players complaining about asking prices even when the interface says they should be happy with the asking price. I've had players throw a tantrum about their price being too high when a dozen teams were willing to meet it and the agent said it should be fine. Expected playing time vs accurate playing time is glitched, and sometimes the player who has started each of the dozen league games you've played so far will complain because the game thinks they're only being used as a squad player. Then there's features like ""dynamic youth rating"" which were misrepresented by SI (youth rating doesn't actually change except for very rare circumstances), who then give snappy responses when called out on it. SI's reaction as a whole to any criticism of the game or reports of bugs usually boil down to ""not a bug, you just don't like our game being realistic"", even when it's clearly an unrealistic bug, which is disappointing coming from a developer who is usually very good about interacting with the game's community. If SI would have re-released FM2018 with updated squads and called it FM2022 I would recommend it in a heartbeat, but I just can't recommend this game as is. If you really want to simulate last season, buy FM21 and download one of the third-party roster updates, but skip FM22 and hope that they do a better job with FM23.",1657741736,1657741736,False,16,1,0.662867069244384766,0,True,False,False

I've been a long-time fan of the series, and the last version I played was FM20. I didn't follow for a while, noticed FM22 on sale so jumped in.

God it's...different.

So, no more customising your manager - for some reason you're unable to select languages spoken anymore. No more adding image of your face to generate a (somewhat) believable model of your own face in 3D. There is no more timeline of past events below the game screen, so you could click any event and get an immediate reply of an in-game incident. This was a staple of all FM version I played since FM12...it was there from probably earlier versions. How tired are your players? Who the f** knows. No more % of their stamina, you now have a picture of a tiny heart so take a guess..maybe it's yellow, or orange, or red - take a pick. Default skin is terrible - with colour schemes all over the place. Fired-up player is purple for some reason, those that seem relaxed and convinced the win is coming are red. You just have a tiny icon to work with. No more setting up info screens that update automatically: opponent formation, player attitude, stats, etc. Ass-man suggestions?? Available only during periods between highlights, but NOT when you pause the match. Generally information is all over the place. It's harder than ever to keep track of your own players. There's SO MUCH information available now, new graphs etc, but all of it is so hard to get to grips with. I know that some of these options were removed in FM21 maybe or sometime before even, but it is so hard to follow what is happening in FM22. This is a lesson to me. I will never jump in blindly to buy another FM before actually seeing it in action, online on YT or otherwise. Such a shame..",1657233045,1657233045,False,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

There are some problems with it though. The dynamics/player interactions system is completely screwed. Players will get angry at the littlest of things, and often you are walking a tight rope when interacting with your players. The transfer-list value is completely screwed, and your players will come to you if you offer them out for even the most minute discrepancies in value. Keeping your players happy while also winning is far more difficult than it should be. This area of the game is more like a dating sim than a football sim.

In the same boat, the transfers this year seem like a complete toss up. It really feels like it's down to luck trying to either sell players for their value or get players for a fair value. Loans seem to be near impossible to secure without a senior affiliate. 

The staff meetings are completely useless. All they've done is taken what used to be a single email and put it in a long step-by-step meeting thing that takes far longer than it needs to. If you like to get really involved in the game, often times they will suggest things that aren't helpful or opposite to what you're trying to do (i.e. get a player to train a completely different skillset to what you need). 

The same goes for the transfer window meetings. I'd personally rather it just come up in the scouting email.

For each thing I dislike about the game there's about 100 I love, so take these with a grain of salt. But this year the improvements outside of the match engine don't really feel like improvements at all.

It's still definitely worth buying and a lot of fun.

I find something in most games I play, you really need 2 versions of a game, one for people getting into or enjoy the simple game, and another that lets you test the limits of the game. everyone should be able to play this game on any computer but that also shouldn't hinder modern day gaming pc's. Also I would like to see players who have a break through season ski rocket in price and stats like irl.

If you are or will become an FM player you will be able to answer those questions:

1. Your team is first in the league, you are well prepared, have maximum morale and will face the last team in the league on your territory. What will happen?
a) Of course you will win
b) It will be an even match
c) The worst team in the lague will stomp you 3-0.

2. What does Offensive and Defensive mentality do?
a) Offensive means you will shoot on goal more giving you more chances and Defensive means rival team will have more trouble scoring.
b) The opposite.

3. Can a player be mad at you of you praise his good performance?
a) No, that can't be.
b) Yes he can.

4. Is it possible to have rival team scoring penalties against you 4 matches in a row?
a) No, there's surely an option to tell players to be extremely careful.
b) Yes there is such a possibility and it's not that rare.

5. Is it possible to predict when enemy team will score?
a) No, just like in real life, football can be unpredictable.
b) Yes, you sometimes know when enemy team will score and you can do nothing about it.

6. Is it a comming thing for the Goalkeeper to pass directly to the Striker, and the Striker to run alone at the goal to score?
a) Probably extremely rare.
b) Probably happens sometimes, especially when your defenders suck.
c) It's a common way to lose goals and lose matches.

So I gather I have spent more of my waking life playing this game than scratching my balls.

If you love it, you love it. I love it. I conduct mock interviews with TV pundits while I sit on the crapper. I shake hands with doorknobs that represent my vanquished opponents. I stay up to all hours just to get in one more transfer or tactical tweak. I am a lost cause.

Don't come from FIFA expecting to jump in. This is less a game than a life-style decision. But if you like the RPG elements, you will be rewarded for your patient efforts.

It has its flaws. I will never understand why they employ chimps to program the player interactions in this game. I praise a player for training well, only to see him react by threatening suicide. Encouraging the team from the sideline with a gentle ""let's go boys"" see them crawling into balls and crying ""overwhelmed by the feedback"".  Popping a bottle of champagne in the dressing room post Cup-win and some numbnut is in the the corner ""confused"" and ""demotivated"".  

I can only assume the programmers are so starved of actual human interactions they think this is realistic.

I see a great deal for a transfer listed English player and while I'm not allowed to sign any more non-eu players for the current season that just finished, I know I'll my non-eu quota will increase for the new season so I sign him. June 30th, my quota for non-eu player resets and now, July 1st transfer window opens and my new player arrives... and I can't register him because reasons. So now I have a player I can't use, who'll eventually get upset because he's not playing and ruin morale, I can't offload him because he just signed (and despite mountain of evidence to the contrary, SI refuses to acknowledge that people who signed a contract in the past 6 months would still be willing to sign elsewhere) and I'm screwed out of chunks of my quite limited (as I'm managing a football club, not an oil state) transfer and wage budgets. 
Save ruined, thanks SI.

I play Espanyol, I have a great first season, I finish in EL spot. In the first season I brought in Scalvini on a 2 year loan with option to buy. He's on a youth contract at Atalanta so he can't be registered in Spain because his wage is too low, but that's not a problem, because players 18 or younger at the turn of the year can play without registration and he turns 18 in December. Ahead of the second season he's still on a youth contract so he still can't be registered, but now he'll be 19 at the turn of the year so he can't play without registration anymore. I guess I'll have to trigger my buy option early, right? Nope! Even though the transfer is set to immediate, the stupid game will not allow it to go through until after the loan runs its course (so after the season) even if I terminate the loan after using the option but before the player accepts and confirmation pops because reasons... So now I have a young player who can't play for an entire year, which will ruin his development and he'll eventually get upset because he's not playing and ruin morale. Or I get to pay for my option, terminate his loan in the vain hope that he'll get at least some minutes back at Atalanta and when I get him next year his development won't be completely ruined and still have to buy a CD for this season. Or I get pass on my option, terminate the loan and then spend x5 the option to bring him back. Neither of these is great for a limited transfer budget and silly me, I'm again managing a football club rather than an oil state...
Save ruined, thanks SI.


So that's 2 saves ruined after 1 season and who knows how many hours invested on each because Sports Interactive are too incompetent to implement rules properly. Seven. Fucking. Months. After. Release.

It essentially feels like the same game with minimal improvements and similar problems. It can still be fun when the AI isn't completely broken, which is far too often for my taste. 

You can only take so many instances of the AI goalies making superhuman saves while your skilled keeper just stands still as opponents put routine shots by him before you start to despise the game. The defensive AI needs a TON of work. I'm seeing Premiere League defensive backs passing back and forth in front of their goal before handing the ball to an opposing striker for an easy goal FAR too often. Some games your team will look like world beaters and the next they will literally be incapable of completing basic passes to each other. It is infuriating and tactics seem to have little to no bearing on your team's performance too frequently. At least add more media interactions so I'm not spewing forth the same canned responses we've been using for years now.

Pros:
+ Youth/Growth system is largely realistic
+ many roles that players can take
+ many ways of going about with your team and build your squad
+ your manager lives until f*cking eternity... you can therefore simulate thousands of years!

Cons:
- time consuming
- Oldies can't have a second spring (i.e. Vardy, Quagliarella, ...)

My 150 hour run from Serie C to Serie A with Palermo was just torpedoed because suddenly no one wants to sign for a newly promoted team that used loans. Trimmed the fat off the team, old players and decided to start a-new with a few select players which would carry the torch for the club.

Forget about it, only 3rd division players would play for me. Not even released players that have nothing to play for would give me the time of day.

Lower league management has been in decline since 2012. Getting promoted means all your players suddenly want quadrupled contracts when they barely are fit to play as it is, your assman tells you to pick a team then the quick pick sends you with another team.

It's just a huge convoluted mess that a lot of people justify as hard when it's just arbitrary and insane, like a two faced monster.

The only good thing that comes out of this game is the ability to simulate into the future and laugh at the hilarity of what the game considers plausible in 20 years.

There is also a massive community around the game posting mods, face packs and custom databases on the steam workshop, which opens up even more opportunity for customisation.

Football Manager stands out in another key way, you can simulate (provided you have a good computer) as a far as you want into the future. This is not the case for other football games such as Fifa. The revamp of the online aspect of the game this year is tremendous, it has created a more user friendly way to play with your friends on the game.

The main thing that i personally love about this game is anything can happen, you can take a team from the Vanarama National League (5th tier of England) to Champions League glory. You can see your hometown club get to the Premiere League. There are endless opportunities in this game and thats why i strongly recommend it.",1648652873,1648652873,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

-New transfers have been updated.

-New UI elements, which no one asked for, which are horifically implemented and drastically reduce all QOL regarding the game. Their biggest UI additions include even MORE clicking to complete the SAME tasks as FM21! That's right, ladies and gentlemen, we have hidden very common UI elements like ""request scouting report"" behind ADDITIONAL MENUS! Now instead of scouting a player in two clicks, you can do it in four!

-Four to five new in-engine scenarios which seem REALLY refreshing and cool upon first viewing! This is why the match engine ALWAYS feels ""refreshed"" and ""updated"" when you're first trying a new FM. Unfortunately, after the first 30 or so matches, you realize that this is all the game has to offer and these ""new"" scenarios quickly become as stale as the previous version

-""Real life elements"" like VAR! Do you fucking hate VAR in real life? Now you can fucking hate VAR in-game, too! SI realized that VAR was incredibly scripted AGAINST the player in the previous version, only being used to disallow goals! Well, fear not! Now it's the reverse! Every single goal where the linesman doesn't raise his flag gets to be VAR checked just to give the goal! So immersive!

I do like that there are more options with the interaction with players. I like how, so far at least, the AI is not completely off its rocker when it comes to purchasing players. As always, I do love watching the matches.

It is very frustrating that my shot to goal ratio is 9 or 10 to 1 while the AI has the ""wonder strike"" almost every match, 1 shot, 1 shot on goal, 1 score. It is almost like a broken record. I can have players 3 to 4 levels above my opponent (yes, I use the level 10 custom DB and the editor, only to mother-lode a team so I can bring them to the top, yea, my way of playing) but no matter who I am playing, all of the sudden their GK is stopping 15-20 shots on target and my much better GK cant stop one. I know, tactics and all that, but it happens way too often. Sorry, longer than I meant for a review.

But yes, I would recommend the game. It is what it is supposed to be and what it does, overall it does well.

if these stats sound fun to you then this is the perfect game for you.
The shots to goal ratio between you and the cpu controlled teams is so vast.  They will score with the their only shot on target, a 45 yard screamer from an impossible angle. You will then miss 6 open goal and have 3 pens saved. This can happen once in a while i agree, but not every game!

1) it is remarkable how the strikers miss 1 on 1s while under no pressure
2) almost every other through ball is pulled back for off-side
3) goal keepers catch almost everything and rarely spill anything...and if they do the strikers just stand still let the keeper/defenders clear it
4) the board negotiations are pointless...they never agree to what you say
5) transfers are dodgy...rarely ever can you negotiate down the price of a player.

Press, counter press, pass into space, attack!

They are all you need, why have a nuanced tactical system, when everybody ends up using the same tactic. Also the age old problem of players viewing your club as beneath them - which is nonsense because footballers will go to China if the money is right. So, my Nottingham Forest save, I tried to buy a few players who, despite my Forest being in the Champions League, felt Forest were too small. But look at PSG, in a dull league, not once come close to winning the Champions League, yet they can attract anybody for the right $$$. Also, you have Newcastle, they've never even come close to qualifying for the Champions league and yet they can attract any player form anywhere. 

FM is a little scripted, I think we've all seen how the computer is determined to have you LOSE certain games. As an experiment, I saved reloaded a game I had against Watford. In other fixtures Man United beat Man City 6-1 (Manchester United, despite not having won the EPL in a long, long time, are still destined to win the Premier League again and again, they're massively over rated) but I lost 2-1 to Watford, they got a 92nd minute penalty. So I reloaded and changed my tactic entirely, still lost 2-1, with Watford having the same goalscorers and a penalty, but in the 82nd minute. I reloaded with a different tactic and a completely different team, still lost 2-1, Watford still got a penalty and United kept winning 6-1! Fifteen times I reloaded the Watford game, I lost 2-1 thirteen times, drew twice and United kept beating city 6-1 or by at least 3 goals.

It's scripted, so why buy a game that is about managerial individuality, if the match results are preordained?",1646400292,1646400292,False,4,0,0.473629027605056763,0,True,False,False

However what else can actually be added content wise without it being just clutter? If the community had their way with these types of games every game would be 160gb and require a NASA computer. Less is more. 


AI transfers can be pretty rigged against you, however, real life transfer fees are lower than what people think they should be (I blame fifa for that), especially if its a player you want binned, you're obviously going to get less than market value and teams low-balling offers, if you're getting rid of a player surplus to requirements, then why expect teams to pay big bucks for him, you deemed him not good enough in the first place!

I've seen so many complaints about the match engine, especially about strikers, personally, I've no issue, its pretty realistic to me, change your tactic/player instructions before complaining to SI, previous FM titles it was extremely easy to get average/low level players to get 60+ goals a season in the top flight and now people are complaining because it's hard now? So much for realism.

The game is meant to be a SIMULATOR, hence why it's kinda hard to get your non league players to play a 4222 asymmetric formation and win the Champions league by season 5. It would never happen in real life, so why call the game broken when you can't do it in a game that's marketed as a realistic football Simulator?

But yes, the game has flaws, scouting especially, is the game broken? No, it's very much enjoyable, it's as addictive as crack, but it's not going to be a cake walk because as mentioned above, it's a simulator, if you want to win the champions league with MK Dons go play fifa if you're not going to have the patience and expect instant success.

Maybe after a dozen more updates it'll be close to playable but until then, just run a 4231 pressing tactic and enjoy unlimited success.

Nothing says realistic gameplay like running out again Man City with a single winger and one CB to then beat them to a pulp. Now THAT is quality gameplay!

Some minor new features, no multi-monitor support, no sandbox mode, team-talk goals between 46-49 minutes, a lot of woodwork, etc. Your typical Football Manager. And I don't mean it negatively. No competition, no progress. And it is rather good considering circumstances.
Usually, people complain about the match engine. But this year it looks fine for me (note that I started playing from version 22.2), except maybe long throws. When a player with an attribute 16 regularly throws to the far post and makes 6 assist that way during the season, it's suspicious. But fun anyway.
The polished and perfect interface was always FM's strong point. But not this year. Unlickable dialog options when interacting with players, in-match tactics screen issue when it throws you back to match, messed sorting in pre-match squad selection, and many other minor glitches that'll piss off both seasoned and new FM players.
But one thing stands above all - insane agents. You talk to the agent, and he says - yeah, the player is very interested in joining your team, go on! You make an offer, then contract talks start. The agent presents his initial demands, you click accept. And he responds: ""WTF, dude? It's unacceptable!"" If you try better options, those will not work too, in most cases. 
A game-breaking bug that ruined many good deals. Earlier reports dated three or so months ago, and it's still present. Therefore, ""Not recommended"" until it's fixed.
If you can ignore it, it's the same old FM with a slightly crippled interface.

Update: sign and leave a player on loan until the end of the season is horribly broken too.",1644796711,1645062980,False,1,0,0.487770974636077881,0,True,False,False

Comments elsewhere have suggested that the fair solution (for gamers) would be releasing a patch every season with an update of players rather than a whole new game. As can be seen, I've given plenty of hours to this edition so I think it's fair to say that these observations are based on a significant amount of experience with the game. 

1) Transfers. With each edition, this gets more and more skewed in favour of the AI. You will rarely if ever sell a player for close to their valuation, yet any attempts to purchase an AI player for less will be rejected. The loan system is even worse, with negotiations only possible on your loanees, not on an AIs. 

2) ME. The match engine hasn't improved and with every patch, something changes to ruin your previously developed tactic. There was a brief moment when FM22 came out that strikers finished one on ones, but that was clearly too realistic for SI so that was 'fixed'. Also good luck defending against the inevitable 30 yard effort from the opposition player who hasn't scored all season...

3) Other: The game is riddled with annoying little flaws; the board scores are ridiculous, the inability to negotiate objectives is infuriating and a backwards step from previous versions... don't even get me started on the ""dynamic youth rating""! 

In conclusion, I don't feel I can recommend this game anymore. I've had every edition since the switch to FM and it is without a doubt that there has been little actual improvement in the way the game plays. Yes, there's been ""new features"", though the usefulness of the analysis is dubious given the inevitability of some of the match engine gameplay. Unless FM23 offers a radical overhaul and massive improvement in the areas above, I think my time playing this game is over and that is one of the saddest realisations a gamer can have!",1644918004,1644918004,False,261,15,0.850903868675231934,0,True,False,False

Honestly, it is not very different from the 2021 version (or any other version, for that matter) except it seems to be a lot easier for some reason. I'm at the end of the second season and I barely lost any games. I don't think any of the other Football Managers were ever that easy and I've been playing this game since it was called Championship Manager.

Also, they seriously need to improve the dialogues and the players reactions to them. Some stuff just doesn't make sense at all. The pep talk before the match, for example, first off, I don’t think they changed it since God knows when. And the players react to them exact the same way every single time. I honestly only choose one option and all the players get extremely excited and motivated by it. What the heck?! And if they don’t, all you have to do is say you have faith in them. LOL it’s honestly hilarious! Then, the shouts during the matches. I honestly think they players’ reactions to the shouts are completely random.

Still about the dialogues, the individual conversations are extremely limited. I always build a strong team and I like to rotate my squad a lot, so everyone plays and they’re always fit. When players get upset about not playing as much as they wanted to, there should be an option to talk about the squad rotation and try to convince the players of such. But you can only agree to the players demands or force them out of the team. This is just one example of how limited the dialogues are.

The tactics are also very limited. You cannot really create what you want in there. I mean, don’t get me wrong, they really did an awesome job with the game mechanics and all, but you can’t create a specific play if you want to.

Anyway, bottom line is, you don’t need to buy this game if you have the 2021, or possibly even the 2020 version. It really didn’t change that much. Just look for transfer market updates and you’re good to go.",1644674438,1644674438,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

- The players (mostly) shouldn't only just aim the header to the goal / net. If they aren't good with their heading, it will go out as a goal kick. So i prefer if they can just try to win the ball rather than just heads the ball and got a goal kick. There are cases that they can pass the ball to teammates (which i have seen it myself).
- For me, the animation is good. But,, for the GK role still a bit meh. When 1 vs 1, the GK movement still not good for me. Maybe it depends on the player ratings in their GK role but i dunno.
- I dunno what else that i need to write or maybe forgot what else i should write, so there u go for my review i think.

I recently fired up FM17 out of curiosity, and found the experience so much more streamlined. No more meetings that could have been emails. No more performance evaluations with the owners about whether I'd signed enough Portuguese players. No more forcing the latest updates from the Canadian Premier League down my throat by automatically going to the News and Around The World pages. Less staff members with vague titles whose jobs I don't understand. No more debriefings after meetings telling me ""Actually players don't like being yelled at."" FM17 ran faster, so less downtime waiting for the game to process. FM17 allowed me to focus on the core engagements of the game - trying to fit tactics to teams, finding and signing talent, developing players, and a reasonable amount of man management. FM22 is certainly more realistic. But that realism looks suspiciously like an actual job.

There are aspects of FM22 that I missed. Dynamic youth rating is definitely an intriguing feature, even if its implementation is contentious (I think it was correctly implemented, but clearly some people disagree). The player valuation system and transfer market is much improved. I do like that player development is more variable, even if in the moment it's frustrating when the wonderkid I'd put all my hope in doesn't turn out. All these require a level of adaptability previous versions of FM just didn't ask of you.

LOSC Lille are playing in the final of the Coupe de France, a competition they haven't won for 4 decades. 5 years ago, they were in Ligue 2. Yet here they are, in the final of a major competition after so long. It's tied, 0-0. The opposition, perennial title contenders Olympique Lyonnais, had dominated the match up until star midfielder Alexandru-Mihai got sent off in the 69th minute. Since then, it's been in deadlock, no side offering much offensively. LOSC striker Koutan gets a strike chalked off in the 84th for offside, and now it's in extra time. It passes quickly, no chances either side. That is, until the 119th minute of 120.

Pierre Gicquel was born in Lille in 2033. For all his 17 years, he'd loved the club. His parents recalled the glory days of the club to him, culminating in title glory in 2021. His entire life, he'd dreamed of being the one to restore his club to greatness, to have the captain's armband while carrying the team to national, even worldwide, glory. From a young age, the staff at LOSC knew he was special, even being touted as the next Kylian Mbappe. Small, a mere 5'7, but incredibly agile, he started out as a striker but quickly found his place as a winger. He tore up every youth division he played in. Now, here he is, 17 and it's his first professional season for the club. Gicquel has played a big part in the team's first title challenge since 2021, but to start the cup final, he was on the bench.

With the minutes winding down in extra time, LOSC's Dutch winger Ibrahim Jabbie was exhausted, and there was an obvious choice waiting in the wings. Gicquel stepped on the pitch, and if the weight of a city was on his shoulders, he didn't show it. 

It's the 119th minute. There's 1 minute of added time. It's the last attack of the game. Gicquel and right-back Balek are exchanging passes on the wing. Suddenly, a hole appears. Gicquel sees it, and swiftly dodges inside before the defenders can react. He cuts to the edge of the box. He's on his weaker left foot. He doesn't care. He's 25 yards out. He doesn't care. All he cares about is this city, this stadium, the one he grew up in the shadow of. The stadium whose visitors now all stare at him in awe. This club, the one he's been sitting in front of the TV, watching, supporting, following, for every day of his life. 

Pierre Gicquel strikes the ball. Everyone in the building knows where it's going. Top corner. Completely unsaveable.

Gicquel became a LOSC legend that day. Everyone knows that someday he might grow up, he might leave, he might even force his way out. None of that matters. On one sunny day in May 2051, football was the winner, and Gicquel was its vessel. Perhaps it's just a game. But in that fateful moment, that game changed lives, and gave the world a story to be told for generations to come.",1642565115,1642565115,True,126,28,0.842582046985626221,2,True,False,False

Finally it has come that they just lie their way into making people excited by a false promise. They lied about Dynamic Youth Ratings and so thousands of save games which was build around this concept can be thrown into the bin instantly.

But fear not the next edition will be literally the exact same way as the last editions. No genuine risks being made by the development team. It's sad really you got a development team full of sensitive middle aged men who can't seem to take an ounce of criticism they will defend their product to the death even if they are in the wrong.

I feel like paying for Football Manager right now is a gigantic waste of money and time. Every year it will be the same game with features that you don't really care for. A few years ago a feature was announced to be a NEW SKIN COLOUR (Exciting Purple woo!).  Sure it's Football Manager so the game can't really change  much. But in reality this is just a 54,99 euros Transfer Update and it will be like that consistently without change. Save your money or at least wait until sale if you are genuinely desperate to waste money on Developers who clearly have no intentions on taking risks anymore and just make the same stale game that just could easily be an update on the last 4 editions or so..

But this version is probably the worst experience I've had. The game remains to this day very buggy, the Pre-Game Editor remains to this day broken and several important features are unusable as they ruin the data with any change you make and the game overall feels more like a full time job than a video game, with unnecessary time consuming features that add no flavour to the game, the User Interface has taken a nosedive since FM20 with information scrambled around the screen rather than focused in one place. 

Overall the game is worth the trouble only if you do not have an earlier version. I prefer playing older versions like FM09, FM12, FM20 than spending my time with this one.

I wanted to give it a fair shot as this is the first review I write, but I can imagine that several important bugs that have been flagged from Day 1 will remain unresolved with the next update.

This game has certainly improved with the data hub and the 3D engine is improving year on year.
However I don't really like the tranfer system. E.g, Sam Johnson was running out of contract and I couldn't approach 2 sign. But other teams can. That is fair sport interactive/Miles. But u can in lower devision. Still mess up.
+ if a player doesn't want to sign a contract. U should still be able 2 offer them 1(showingwhat they wouldlike). Like real life!

Overall a top game.

I got this game for the first time in four years, the last one I got was FM18. Perhaps the incremental changes don't look like much if you buy every edition, but for me, it was like buying a whole new game. Firstly, the game runs smoother than FM18 did on the same machine, which is a huge reflection of how well the processing works.

 I've played a season with Arsenal so far, and got top 4, but I liked the realism aspect so far. I started off badly, and until my tactics bedded in, I wasn't scoring much, and was losing games. I was in the relegation zone in October, and barely top half in December. With only one signing and no real change, I got top 4, with  some tactical tweaking (I'm pretty terrible at it, so it wasn't even a huge change) and just letting the team get used to each other and get used to the tactic.

It's much harder to implement a pressing system, and so far, I might be wrong on this, but not pressing all the time is probably the way to go. Really enjoying it so far, and it's a challenge. The shouts system has been revamped, this may be older than this game, like I said, first one since FM18, but it's nice to see shouts have an impact in real time.

My one gripe with this is the Dev Center. I don't like it really.",1641082237,1641082237,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Even though you do have to update most the of names of the leagues yourself and you need to download faces and badges of most players/clubs, it makes the game slightly better and feel the bit more realistic.

This year is the best football manger has been with the new animations makes the match engine smoother. Players values are now within a range so it makes trying to buy a player more realistic and players who play through injuries now wear protective equipment. It's the small things SI are doing that are making these games better year after year.

I hope SI continue to develop this game series more and more as progress is starting to seem it's slowing a bit. This year's game feels a bit like Football Manager 2021 and that felt a lot like Football Manager 2020.

For a while I have been doing the career mode on fifa and it was good but not realistic, I couldn't watch the match, there were limited leagues to join and boring music in the background. I then saw my dad play Football Manager one day and it looked quite complicated so I asked my dad if I could have a go, he said yes and I created a new club. The thing I really enjoyed about that is the  custom logo, the way to create players, the nickname, where the club are from are from, who are there rivals...ext:. That was only creating the actual club. How much fun do you think I  had playing the actual game?

There is only one thing I would recommend for a future update or Football Manager 2023, maybe more realistic sounds when in matches as you can only here the crowd cheering or booing when something good is happening or bad and then it turns into nothing. 

Apart from that, Football Manager is a good realistic and joyful game to play.   9.5/10   :)",1640592983,1640592983,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

1. Board beinga against everything no matter what I get you supposed to put points in these traits but I mean come on Im a club legend and never went crazy over the transfer budget and at times sold more than brought. But I ask for something simple as upgrade youth recruitment board ready for me to quit? I took over Paris FC brought them and made them contenders vs PSG and i say may I please get more transfer money because 5 mill isnt goign to cut it against PSG. And I get a no is a bit unrealistic
2. Take this how you want but players staying at small clubs. I did a save where Sesko stays at Salzburg for like 5 years that makes no sense. Or you will have clubs with world class players not forcing moves out for reasonable prices. in todays market players arent staying at Salzburg and will find an agent to get them out of the club look at Dembele, Erling, and etc 
3. Matching Simming this might be a hot topic since this is the premise of the game but let me say the match simming in certain leagues I havent tried EPL or a La Liga. But Ligue 1 and Bundesliga I get people are going to say they dominate those leagues irl whats wrong? my save in Ligue 1 if your team doesnt do have a invincible season its ggs PSG will win the league by more points. In my save PSG has only lost If i remember correct like 10 games in league for 7 years straight thats insane. Makes building teams from the ground up take decades I just started winning with ASE and we have a good team with big name players and etc. And we have bad games does PSG ? Nope they win everything.

Is Football Manager worth the money for the time spent playing it? Yes. 

Is FM22 anywhere near the version of FM it should be? Nope. The Data Hub is a great concept. Too bad it shows you all the bugs in the data collection system in one place. Passing Webs work this year, yay! But you see formations listed incorrectly, games reported as won that were lost or drawn. 

Player morale is as broken as ever. Team Meetings make no sense. The players have no ambition and can't look at a table to see where they've just finished the season before and believe they can replicate similar results. Ever. Players will tell you what they want, you do it, and then say you broke a promise with them. If this happened once in a great while, you might put it down to player personality. But not multiple times, with many players, almost every year. 

I can't say I don't enjoy the game. But I enjoy it less than any version previously. Despite the fact the Match Engine looks better than it ever has. In a data-driven game, the data you receive matters. And FM doesn't report it reliably to the player right now.",1639527254,1639527254,True,0,0,0.45606696605682373,0,True,False,False

Unacceptable for a company producing same game since 2005. Actually I gave up on this sh*t and didnot buy in 2021. But this year I wanted to give a chance it only to face same problems + new game engine (heading goal simulator). This is the last time I bought this sh*t.

It's already my most played FM ever and it's been just a month.

It's a small change but the Transfer Deadline day has actually added so much more immersion and is a great feature.

Also the offers you get from agents, players, staff etc, the overall transfer system has had little updates that have made a big impact.

The Data hub I don't find myself looking at too much other than seeing that I score 99% of my goals from crosses or corners. I know some people will likely enjoy looking at every stat possible though so it's a cool addition.

1) The Match Engine feels extremely easy to abuse 
2) Setting up ""Set Pieces"" is archaic and needs to be updated in the next version of FM
3) The Data Hub is interesting but lacking (you are for instance not able to filter it to different tactics)

The Preference that SI has for especially the English League seems even more outrageous in this version compared to how little love was put into many of the other leagues. If for instance you are playing in the Danish League: 

1) The ""New Feature"" Deadline Day isn't implemented (in fact the last version of FM had a better ""deadline day feature"" then this years version - as a countdown window isn't in game it just skips to next day. 
2) The Stats of players are mind boggling inaccurate – this is the case for both senior and youth teams

Well...as a full grown adult that has bee playing this game before the age of ten...
I am quite happy with this years version. The team gestures add another element of emotion to my coaching and I wish that will continue to improve. Also, some mere AI into answering press conference questions with my own typing, can be fantastic.

Yet the main reason I am happy with this years version, is because of the reduced price.
I believe that IDIOS has listened to its loyal fans and understood that you cannot demand a high price for every yearly version made with minor changes, and thus make the minor changes more affordable for loyal fans.

I hope next years version will have the same price, and even a lower one...if the improvements and changes remain minor.
Thank you, and I do indeed ""Love this Game!"" - NBA Trademark? :P :)

There are major bugs/glitches in the engine like endless passing between defenders, wrong animation at free kicks. unrealistic long headers or shots from players lacking the respective skill

There are major unbalances in the way the team reacts to various stuff, it is insane how the players react at times and in normal circumstances.

Ever since then I've been playing FM as soon as I get home from work. I am addicted. For a beta, I'm surprised with how few bugs there are. Of course I've heard of some big bugs, such as the player registration issue. However, I have not come across this bug so can not comment. But I can guarantee that will be patched by launch. 

The bright white of the inbox in previous games was an eye-sore. I'm glad they've changed it and made it a dark theme. Much more pleasing to the eyes. I also love how the team you pick can change the colour scheme.

They've completely overhauled transfer deadline day with makes them much more intense and pushes you to making deadline day deals due to the whole structure which I find satisfying and adds spice to the save. Especially considering in previous installations, my transfer deadline days were always quiet. This time, I always manage to get excited for deadline day.

Now some cons, 
The staff meetings seem like a fad. They're interesting for the first couple meetings but then they get boring. I would like the option to keep it as a summary rather than a meeting. Of course the meetings are more realistic but they get more and more repetitive. So maybe they can add to this to make it interesting every meeting. Or at least different.

other than this, I absolutely recommend this game!

You will manage various characters with attitude and ego that strives to make you mad.
You will experiment with different tactics and strategy to find the OP strat before enemy somehow learns how to break it and make you repeat the loop again.
You will fight enemies with more money, better stats/skills, and often able to charm away your best characters with money.
You will have people expecting you to defeat stronger enemies, win all challenges, and eventually dominate the world.
You will be a hero...oh wai- I mean a football manager (again)! 

Side note - I skipped FM2021 so this will be a considerable change from FM2020. Overall, it is fresh enough for me but I probably wouldn't think it is a release/change good enough for those from FM2021.

Pros:
+New details and feature (e.g. data hub with stats and data like xG and xA that tend to confuse you till you go read/Google it out).
+Changes are streamlined to make it more faster for changes/tweaks to be done on the fly (especially during match game time).
+Enjoyed the in-match control and maybe it is just me, but the VAR decisions (as annoying it could be), it is quite a fair bit of fun too.
+The good bit of FM fun is still there despite the X-th iterations.

Cons:
-FM2022 Ole is not the same as per his real-life equivalent (at least in my beta version), hahaha.
-More and more clubs getting licensed and if you don't mod it or add in the pics/emblems/logos into the game, it is really annoying and you simply will not enjoy it as much. 
-The randomness can sometimes be overwhelming to the point that you wonder if your physios are asleep or your players are simply fragile glasses that broke at the slightest contact...
-The numerous conferences/journalists will bore you as you choose the fake lines to make your whiny players happy. 
-You might not find enough changes/improvements despite the X-th iteration of release, and if you never enjoyed the past FM, chances are, it is unlikely for you to enjoy this too.",1637938646,1637938646,True,1,1,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

All of that is pointless too. Hire all your own team. Pick them out to perfection. You still have to deal with stupid meeting where the board are trying to get you to hire literal morons. Don't go to the meeting about the stuff you have already spent hours working on? Get ready for your board to try and hire literally the dumbest people on earth that your still have to deal with. Why? I said we don't need anybody! 

Has your 3rd goal keeper been complaining about how he doesn't play...as a 17 year old? Important players want you to solve this pathetic problem with a player that has never even played a single min for your 2nd team let alone the 1st. Like, I don't think my first team 29 year-old Brazilian striker gives a shit about my 17 year old youth team hire from a month ago not playing in the first team. Think he might be more concerned with scoring goals for the first team. You know?  

Hire a player who 2 days later wants to leave so they can get picked for the National team for the world cup....1 month away. Um...ok, sure. I arrange everything to your liking. Literally, I let the player organise their OWN transfer and they reject it...their own deal...they made...to leave the club...to play in the world cup...they no longer want to play in apparently. Lol. Dumb as it gets.  

Striker hasn't scored in 12 games with 40 shots on target. Me - ""I think you need to focus more when in front of goal"" My striker - ""How dare you say that to me!? I think I have been playing well and your expectations are unreasonable. This meeting is over!"".  LOL. Like...the fuck? Imagine having the stones to say that to your manager after 12 games of no goals and you get like 5 shots a game from inside the box. Please somebody take this guy off my hands! Anything! Oh actually the board won't allow that so anybody want him for the unreasonable amount my board want for them after I signed them for a literal pittance. 

Do things like pressing defence even do anything? Opposition just passing it around their backs for literal mins? Tell your team to press them. Does basically nothing as far as I can tell. The opposition will still be free to just pass the ball around and your players will just sit back and watch.

You've been delivered a crushing defeat that mathematically removes you from Champions league contention...in the 5 week of the season...with so many more games to play. Not even close to anybodies position being decided. Does this game have any idea what is actually going on? Or does it just give you random information it thinks is correct? Who knows what to believe.

This game is stupid like that. Just doing lots of pointless stuff that makes little difference to the overall outcome of different scenarios in the game. Information isn't even correct or relevant. I wouldn't recommend buying it right now. Wait a few months for them to fix this mess with all the player and backroom staff interactions. Besides that.

The Match engine has small improvements, something that should have been worked on last year and added to the game, much of it is just the same as last year and I think they dont know how to fix it. thats just my opinion. The database is just a rework with an extra feature added in that you will barely look at. This at most along with the data update should have been at the most a DLC for 5 bucks compared to last years game nothing else was added but a Wideback CB (WOOOOOOW) Yes Im sarcastic cus Miles Jacobson should be ashamed and fired for releasing this as a new game. Never mind your team getting beat down everytime a transfer window opens the Transfer system is a complete disaster and so unfair to the team you run especially a small team. Dont let him fool you when he says report bugs in the forum.... Its there game and most every bug they know about. They've lost control of the ME and transfer systems, what a disgrace. To put the transfer window debuff on the team makes it even worse. (Get RID of it). Let the players play how theyve been numbered or programmed in there stats to play with a lil room to go both ways. This game in no way is worth 50 bucks. Its lucky if its worth 19.99. Of course the FANBOYs will not dare go against the power that be (Miles) and post or say there true thoughts. But I predict a huge drop off of the game being streamed on any platform quickly with just the diehards or money earners doing there best to keep there income coming in. 

I'm sorry but after 5 years and at least 15000 hrs in this game. Once you get past the minuscule ME changes, you realize theirs many they still haven't fixed. The data Hub is not something your gonna care about for long and everything else is just fillers or at most add on's to whats already been done which you also will not care about. The transfer system I'm gonna wait til after then game fully comes out but in the 5 years I've been playing it would seem to me it took them a few weeks to make some changes through it together. I cant even play it right now I'm gonna go back to 21 where its almost the exact same game and continue with my save there. I'm so disappointing by what has been put out here. I really thought there would be major innovation to get excited about but its just not there... The newness wheres off real fast. I will review again after the full release and change my review if I feel its worthy because of my love for the franchise and eat my words if SI can produce!. Sorry SI Its and automatic cash cow for you with little innovation because you got no competition. 2 out of 5 stars as it stands. If you have 21 keep going if you can stand getting through the windows which just drags teams down every year. There truly taken the fun out of this game. SI Change my mind!!!

I guess this goes without saying, but 22 is my first dip into the Football Manager franchise. 

While I do think the general tutorials could be better, especially with regards to proper contract and loan negotiations. Or better yet for new people have an option for your GM to suggest a starting point for newer players in negotiations. That said, I did not feel like it was that much of a time commitment to get the bare essentials down and grow from there in regards to everything else. Make no mistake though, there is definitely a lot of depth to club management on and off the pitch. Most of which you can delegate to your a.i. staff if you wanted to however. 

The game engine is done quite well imo, while there are a few issues I have, (like the hit collision isn't super convincing), the games are more or less interesting enough to watch in real time should you choose to do so. I typically do, and a large bulk of my hours reflect that. Haha

As for a personal con, laughable to most probably, but I wish the USL-C league of the United States was playable/manageable. 123 leagues and the one team in my area isn't manageable. MLS has been fun however. Although I have learned way more about registration rules than I ever wanted to! Haha

The match engine feels smooth, and the players feel so alive. The amount of lovely passing moves I've scored has been top notch. Besides this, players make inaccurate first touches, which helps gameplay massively. The game, when making a dedication to play more open type of football, feels awesome. Players get tired if playing a pressing style, which is much more realistic compared to previous years.

Besides this, transfer valuations feel absolutely perfect in comparison to previous years. Last year, players would be extremely overpriced relative to what they were worth. Now, they are more realistic, with a more realistic overprice compared to before. Clubs will accept bids accordingly if they need the money. The transfer deadline day, despite being laughed upon when first announced, is a game changer. If you love harry redknapp, and want to do a bit of wheeling and dealing, the game allows you to do that. Players, much like in real life, become available on deadline day, and the transfer market feels less static, which is awesome.

The Data Hub is well put together, and if you love those Tifo IRL scattergram videos, this place is perfect for that. It's lovely knowing all the different stats of the players, and it helps you make the proper tweaks to tactics if needed. The Data is easy to understand and is explained well, so anyone can understand it.

All in all, Football Manager 2022 is a strong improvement in Football Management from the previous iteration, and the game continues to grow from strength to strength.",1636784490,1636784490,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Outside of this aspects of the game are just broken. Its super easy to keep your players since you can convince them their transfer value is higher than any team is willing to pay for them. Injuries to players has been randomly upped since FM21, Developing youth just doesn't work anymore. The match engine is hardly improved and still as unrealistic as previous games. Players whining about playing time even though the game itself lists their playing as the contractually agreed time or even higher! Taking literally weeks/month in game to scout a player (which on the surface I think is fair for young obscure players), but then returning with a report that's almost as masked as it was prior to the scouting...

The game itself is superb It is so cluttered, and the graphical parts of the game are more fitting of 2011, not 2021. The regen & manager faces are still awful (despite Miles wearing them as some sort of badge of honor - they look terrible) and the backgrounds on the stadiums just ruin any visual aspect of the game. Neither of those would take huge amounts of resources to improve but make a massive difference. There is a huge modding community (that SI continues to make life difficult for) that do a much better job than SI and they all do it for free anyway.

As for the menus, they are 5 years out of date - there are several things you have to go through many menus to get too when 1 click would do a job. It would not hurt them to strip it back and make the menus simpler, and group the information inside that. For several years now they have just added new features ontop of the current menus and it makes them cluttered and unorganised. I would be happy if FM23 consisted of absolutely no improvements, just a major UI / UX redesign, it would make such a difference. 

The little gripes: The price range feature is stupid and once again just adds more layers to an already cluttered UI/game. It just gives you more information than you need.

The squad/transfer menus are so buggy and haven't changed for 10 years, anybody that has tried to create their own squad/transfer view will know what I am talking about. It is like it's only mini game inside the game just trying to rearrange the views. 

Overall the game is superb and the best football game by a long way, but it is starting to feel like a game where they have added 10 years of updates on top of a game, instead of making a new game. The game is cluttered and you have too much information that you just don't need. A proper UI/UX redesign next year please SI.",1636644196,1636644330,True,46,0,0.838412106037139893,1,True,False,False

The match engine in particular (especially with the new animations) feels much more diverse and fluid. 

Whereas in FM20, it often times felt quite predictable what would occur throughout the match based on the stats and the highlights, and often times I'd find myself rather accurately predicting the outcome of each and every highlight; FM22 feels FAR more diverse in both the types of highlights you'll see, as well as being far less predictable in terms of what's going to happen in them. 

Not to mention that the various additions and quality of life changes to things like scouting reports, the way data is presented to you, and even the recruitment meetings and just the general look and feel of the menu is, whilst a little bit jarring at first, really intuitive and a very nice and clean way to have the information presented to you. 

If you haven't played an FM game since FM20 or earlier, I'd definitely suggest picking up FM22, its still the same FM game we all love, but just much more refined and polished.",1636636149,1636636149,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

If you played FM 21, this review is NOT for you
*

I played all the FM games except for FM 18-19 and FM 21. Fm 17 was a big no-no for me in terms of how similar it played out to the previous games and, I decided not to buy 18 and 19. I picked up FM 20 on epic for free just to check if there was any improvements or not, but it was totally similar again. So that's why I didn't buy FM 21. 

So when it comes to FM 22, I really couldn't hold myself and was missing the FM spirit a lot. I read a bunch of reviews on steam, so basically, everyone was saying it was a copy of FM 21. The catch was that I never played FM 21, so buying FM 22 would be a good experiment for me to see if they changed something from the previous games... And I tell you this;

Fm 22 is a HUGE improvement to any other FM games I've played, especially FM 20. It might very well be a re-skin of FM 21, but then again, I have no idea about that game, so it's totally a must-have if you want to see some changes and improvements to layouts, 3d effects, some AI improvements on negotiations, matches and what-not. 

But keep in mind that it also seems like it's coming with a bunch of broken features as well. Gegenpress is simply broken, late-time scores are super frequent, the set-pieces are a big issue in terms of how easy you can score from a far-post, 16-17-year-old youngsters bug you a lot if you don't include them in the Europa/Champions league squads, meaningless press questions before Europe matches like what I do think about a certain manager from my league getting sacked etc. 

However, I really liked what they did with post-game match analysis, engaging staff and a less-stressful inbox. I recommend this game to everyone who hasn't played FM 21 but played the previous titles. It seems like this year they've learned a good lesson.",1636560701,1636560701,True,3,0,0.563492059707641602,0,True,False,False

- Data Hub is nice to see strengths and weaknesses of your next opponent
- Transfer market values are more vague and have a span
- 3D Engine is a little better, lots of small tweaks and this is only the start I assume (since they got rid of the ""players move on a disk"" restriction)
- If your players haven't got a ton of stamina, just playing gegenpress all the time is going to become a problem  after roughly 60-70 minutes. At least with Werder Bremen ;-)
- tired players now also become more inaccurate with passes and shots
