And the COD games that come out today are crap Treyarch have got a few loose screws i think because they can't seem to make a good game anymore black ops 2 and 3 are good there the only ones really worth playing provided you have a ps3 or ps4 because and COD games on pc seems to sh-t itself and all you get is hackers that got no skill. And black ops 4 don't even get me started on that because that is complete crap, the game shouldn't even be called black ops 4 like what was wrong with Gobblegums than they come up with the idea of changing the whole game getting rid of all the classic perks and getting rid of all the good guns like you cant even tell a good gun from sh-t gun Treyarch get it right FFS. Going back to the original Black ops don't waste your money id rather spend the same amount of money on COD Black ops 3 better graphics, better community and you get the most out of your money while you still get the classic maps from the original, but i would only get that game on PS because you only run into the same problem on PC, hackers, can't even get a game, honestly wouldn't even waste your money on the crap get on PS game runs alot better and more chances that you will get a game.  ""Final Thoughts"" Well it's safe to say that ill never buy another COD game on PC because it's a crap experience, Come on Treyarch get someone else in the driver's seat because clearly you've forgotten how to make a really good game but they won't listen because all they see is dollar signs from the 2 year olds that play their game today, and i thought Rockstar Games was bad...

It's definitely grittier than the previous COD games - it has some disturbing themes including torture and brainwashing.  But for those who can stomach those subjects, this game took COD to another level.
It still has the characteristic multi-perspective gameplay where you play different characters throughout the story, but it all centers on one character who is forced to have flashbacks by his captors so they can attempt to extract the information buried inside his mind.
The gameplay is smooth and the controls are intuitive enough where for the most part you don't need many tutorials to learn how to play.  When you enter a unique sequence like piloting a helicopter the instructions will appear on the screen so you don't have to try figuring it out.  The enemy AI is solid - they're more adept at throwing back grenades and using their mobility to fight you (some of them even roll around) in this game as opposed to the previous ones, so it's not as easy to clear rooms.
The atmosphere is realistic and intense - a lot of ambient noise (music playing from radios, nature sounds, etc.) adds to the environmental immersion.  The action music is effective, though there were parts where it drowned out some of what is spoken or yelled so having the closed captioning turned on may be a good idea if you're able.  There are a lot of different environments, from air battles to ground battles in various outdoor/indoor settings, and underwater travel.  
The storyline is decent - a bit confusing at first but towards the end of the game everything comes full circle and starts to make more sense.  But who cares right?  This is COD - just shoot first and learn later.

Old review from 2023/01/10 sucked, so I'm rewriting it.


I'm a huge fan of the [i]Zombies[/i] game mode (really nice arcade game mode) and I'm satisfied with playing [i]Black Ops[/i] on single player. Every now and then I still have fun playing this game due to how challenging the zombies are. In this review, I'll cover the following aspects: Linux compatibility, DLC prices and offline playability


[b]First, this game runs decently on Linux (tested on Debian 12 as of 2023/12/06).[/b] All you gotta do is go to the game's properties and enable Proton by checking [i]Compatibility[/i] -> [i]Force the use of a specific Steam Play compatibility tool[/i] to get it to work. You may come across some issues, and I'll name 2 of them: [u]moderately lower performance[/u] and [u]game freezing[/u]. Because of the game running through Wine (this game was not built for Linux), performance is reduced considerably compared to when running on Windows on a same machine. Also, when a level is loading, the game may freeze and then I have to restart it, but it's not a big deal for me since it doesn't affect gameplay so much. Otherwise, there are no critical issues. Xbox wireless controllers are supported.

[b]Second, the DLC Zombies maps are pretty nice, but the prices can be quite elevated[/b] and some of their associated easter egg quests can be achieved only with 4 players. If you're in for [i]Zombies[/i], expect to play alone. Furthermore, I suggest you buy the [i]Rezurrection[/i] pack first since it contains 5 [i]Zombies[/i] maps; the 3 other packs contain mostly PVP maps and only 1 [i]Zombies[/i] map per pack, so wait for a sale.

[b]Finally, the [i]Zombies[/i] and [i]Campaign[/i] game modes can be played without any Internet connection with a little bit of tinkering.[/b] The devs pressure its users to avoid changing the config file, but in reality there is no danger if you know what you're doing (for example, changing key bindings to load specific maps, thus bypassing connection to the servers but forcing single-player). Sure, you can break the game if you change settings improperly, but it's not hard to learn. There's a few guides on how to play [i]Zombies[/i] without Internet, so check them out.


With all that considered, the game is playable on Linux with the help of Proton, you should wait for the DLCs to be on sale before buying them, getting a chance to participate in a 4-player [i]Zombies[/i] game is quite nice, and the config file can be changed to make the game playable offline. Heck, there's even a [i]Zork[/i] text-based game hidden in [i]Call of Duty: Black Ops[/i]. Good job, Treyarch.",1673390258,1705954066,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Immerse yourself in the gripping narrative set against the Cold War's tense backdrop, where historical events blend seamlessly with creative storytelling, delivering an unparalleled combination of intense action and a compelling storyline.

Having conquered the campaign on Xbox 360, reliving the experience on Xbox One, and opting for the PC version for its enhanced graphics, I can confidently assert that Black Ops boasts the most outstanding campaign in the series. The storytelling prowess showcased in exploring the psychological and emotional facets of warfare remains unmatched, making Treyarch's creation a timeless standout even after fourteen years.

What sets Black Ops apart is its enthralling single-player campaign, thrusting players into the shoes of Alex Mason, a CIA operative grappling with amnesia on a mission to uncover a perilous Soviet plot. The campaign unfolds through Mason's fragmented memories, blurring the lines between reality and brainwashing. This distinctive narrative structure, coupled with espionage-worthy twists, transforms the campaign into a pulse-pounding journey complemented by exceptional voice acting and cinematic finesse.

The graphics marked a significant leap forward at the time, delivering detailed environments and characters that seamlessly kept pace with the game's fast-paced nature. Commendation is also due for the impeccable sound design, capturing the realistic clatter of weapons and an evocative score that elevates the immersive experience.

Black Ops revolutionized the multiplayer aspect, introducing groundbreaking features such as the COD Points system and Wager Matches – innovations that have become staples in the franchise. Meticulously designed maps accommodate various play styles, and the extensive customization options for gear and loadouts showcase the game's commitment to player choice.

The Zombies mode stands out as a highlight, offering a delightful co-op experience that skillfully blends horror elements with a touch of humor. Its addictive and entertaining nature provides a refreshing alternative to the main campaign, adding an extra layer of enjoyment for players seeking a different flavor of excitement.

If you're looking for fun and engaging gameplay, look somewhere else. The gameplay in the campaign is, like any other cod game, stale, repetitive, and sometimes frustrating. 
However, the gameplay isn't what kept me playing until the end of the campaign, it was the story.
What felt confusing at first, became one of the best plot twists I've seen in a game to date, and I played to completion just to see what the ending was (i won't spoil it, i recommend you find out for yourself).
Although the gameplay and graphics have not aged well, it's still worth a shot if you're wanting a well-written, dark story.
7/10

Multiplayer/Zombies:
First thing I'll say about multiplayer is DON'T PLAY MULTIPLAYER (on an unmodified game client).
The game is riddled with malware exploits in multiplayer, you'll need to download 3rd party software like plutonium in order to play it safely.
When you play multiplayer safely, its generally a great experience and I will be playing it again, along with zombies.

Set against the tense backdrop of the Cold War, this game offers a unique blend of historical events and creative storytelling, captivating players with its combination of intense action and a gripping narrative.

I have completed the campaign on Xbox 360, replayed it on Xbox One, and then purchased the PC version for its slightly improved graphics. I believe the campaign is by far the best of the series with unmatched storytelling that delves into the psychological and emotional aspects of warfare. Fourteen years later, Treyarch's baby still stands out as one of the best.

What makes Black Ops so memorable is its engaging single-player campaign. Black Ops throws you into the role of Alex Mason, a CIA operative with amnesia, on a mission to uncover a deadly Soviet plot. The campaign unfolds through Mason's fractured memories, blurring the lines between reality and brainwashing. This unique narrative structure, coupled with twists and turns worthy of a spy thriller, makes the campaign a pulse-pounding experience complete with top-notch voice acting and cinematic flair.

The graphics were a significant leap forward at the time, with detailed environments and characters, all running smoothly to keep up with the game's fast-paced nature. The sound design deserves a shoutout too – from the realistic clatter of weapons to the dramatic score, every element adds to the immersive experience.

The multiplayer aspect of Black Ops brought fresh excitement to the series. It introduced innovative features like COD Points system and Wager Matches (where you wager your points against other players), now staples in the franchise. The maps are thoughtfully designed, catering to various styles of play, and the customisation options for gear and loadouts are impressively extensive.

Zombies mode is a highlight, offering a quirky yet challenging co-op experience that perfectly mixes horror elements with a dash of humor. It’s addictive and fun, a real treat for players looking for something different from the main campaign.

Rating: 9/10

In summary, Black Ops is a standout entry in the series. It's an experience that weaves a compelling narrative with engaging gameplay.

-Gameplay: Pretty stiff but decent at the time. Huge problem was FOV but I could not be bothered to do the extra steps to fix it. Some guns do not feel like they hit at all and lack the punch. Being a game of some years, it actually is quite a decent shooter. AI is very crap so do not expect a lot from it. There is too much ammo available so spray and pray is actually a good strategy. This obviously harms the game but who cares.

-Campaign: I was surprised how good the story was, even though the campaign was not my cup of tea. It is quite short and can be completed on veteran in less than 6 hours easily. There are obviously frustrating parts in the campaign in which you need to know where spawns are and what triggers them. This could mean an easy train of AI running to you or getting swarmed by them. 

I found the levels very diverse in locations and time periods, and it just does not work at all. I loathed the jungle levels because I did not think they were that good. There were other levels that just felt ridiculous to the point that I had no idea what the story was. When your game makes me not care about the story that much, that says a lot.

Also hated most of the vehicle on rails that ""CoD"" loves to shoehorn in. Very unnecessary but they do sometimes make it feel epic which is obviously what they are going for.

-Zombies: I do not know why people play this mode. I am surprised people are still playing zombies til this day. It is not good at all, it really sucks. Not only is it expensive to buy the DLC to get all the maps, it is a chore, A BLOODY CHORE to do the achievements. They take forever and are not worth it. If you want to 100% this game, just avoid it. Easter eggs are absolutely dreadful to do and zombies in general is very punishing to the point you will be retrying several times. 

-Price: It is very expensive even discounted. It really is not worth to buy it but, I will always recommend to play at least one ""CoD"" game because they are usually good quality FPS. I would say pass on the black ops series. 

-Story: There are famous actors in this game which really improve the story telling. Unfortunately for me, the story plays around with psychological elements and that might work for some people, it does not work for me. Found the whole numbers thing quite mediocre and how the story wraps up is quite a mess. Now, it is a ""CoD"" game so compared to other games, it is really good. Probably the best compared to the rest of the ""CoD"" license which is sad.

-Bugs: It is an old game and it still has several bugs which are annoying. Good luck to you and I hope you do not find any. Mostly is triggers not activating which means reload checkpoint or worse, restart. A restart in zombies is absolutely painful meanwhile the campaign is harmless.",1704505998,1704505998,True,1,0,0.497925341129302979,0,True,False,False

Call of Duty: Black Ops, alongside Modern Warfare 2, represent the absolute highest of highs. I will start by saying that it is ridiculous to charge $40 for this game that is now 13+ years old, there are known security issues with the multiplayer (which can be fixed by playing on Plutonium), and I must say that the sound design of Black Ops 1 is pretty weak.


Okay, now that the negatives are out of the way, where to even start on the positives?
13 years later, the game still looks great. Black Ops is just dripping with style. Yes some of the character models are somewhat janky by modern standards, but it was never enough to take me out of the experience, and is only really relevant in the campaign anyways. Speaking of which...


Black Ops 1 features the absolute best campaign to ever be in a Call of Duty title. This game does not just what good games do, but what good movies do, and drop small details everywhere- making you notice just one or two more things every time you play through, making you want to play  through it again. MW2 also does this, (""since when does Shepard care about danger close?"") but to nowhere near the level of BO1. I seriously cannot praise the campaign enough, and am going to stop here to keep this review from being way too long.


The multiplayer is also incredible, and you can still find a couple lobbies (both on and off plutonium) to this day. The way that CoD points work for unlocks makes it my favorite multiplayer progression in the entire series, even more than BO2. I really wish Wager Matches still existed, alas those servers are gone, and are just a memory now. RIP gun game and one in the chamber... 


Last, and probably MOST, is the zombies experience. BO1 is peak zombies, if you want the classic experience. Yes, WaW is OG, but you can just get all the WaW maps in BO1 by simply buying one dlc pack, which also gives you Moon, one of the most replayable zombies maps ever made... And with possibly the best zombies Easter Egg, aside from Origins. Really, every zombies map in bo1 is fantastic. Don't listen to the people that talk bad about Moon, or Shangri-La, play them. It's worth it. I will admit that Moon in black ops 3 is significantly better than BO1, but oh man Shangri-La and Ascension are so much better Black Ops 1. Especially Shangri-La, it still looks dark and gritty while mainting the beautiful sun-lit forest vibe!


That's enough ranting for now. The moral of the story is: wait for this game to go on sale, then absolutely grab it (and at least the rezurrection DLC) and never look back.",1704492619,1704492619,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Call of Duty: Black Ops stands as a testament to the franchise's commitment to delivering heart-pounding action and engaging storytelling. The game takes players on a roller-coaster ride through a gripping narrative set during the Cold War era, featuring a mix of historical events and fictional scenarios that keep players on the edge of their seats.

The single-player campaign is a standout feature, offering a well-crafted storyline filled with twists, turns, and memorable characters. The narrative seamlessly weaves through different settings, from the icy landscapes of the Ural Mountains to the chaotic streets of Vietnam. The missions are diverse, ranging from stealthy infiltrations to intense firefights, providing a satisfying variety of gameplay experiences.

The graphics and sound design contribute significantly to the immersive atmosphere. Visually stunning environments and realistic character models bring the game to life, while the impactful sound effects and a compelling musical score intensify the overall experience.

Multiplayer remains a cornerstone of the Call of Duty franchise, and Black Ops doesn't disappoint. With an array of customizable loadouts, diverse maps, and a range of game modes, the multiplayer component offers hours of addictive gameplay. The introduction of the iconic Zombies mode adds another layer of excitement, allowing players to team up against waves of the undead in various creative scenarios.

The game does have its share of criticisms, including occasional spawning issues in multiplayer and some predictable story elements. However, these minor flaws don't detract significantly from the overall enjoyment of the game.

In conclusion, Call of Duty: Black Ops successfully blends a compelling narrative with intense gameplay, delivering a memorable experience for both solo players and those who enjoy the competitive nature of online multiplayer. With its high production values and thrilling content, Black Ops remains a standout title in the Call of Duty series and a must-play for fans of the FPS genre.",1703387629,1703387629,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

It's a good game, not flawless (the worst AI I have ever encountered in a video game, some controls and a few hitboxes can be a bit too wacky and the information shown in cutscenes, like maps and names, aren't always right and can change between cutscenes), but quite good. Had fun with it, story was really really great and the gameplay wasn't bad either (except for the helicopter missions and the sprint mechanic). I wish a few missions would have been a bit longer, because I enjoyed them so much. The survival modes are a lot of fun aswell. The higher difficulties sadly felt a bit shitty because friendly AI wouldn't do anything but block and sometimes even shoot you and grenades didn't do jackshit aswell. Decided against playing it any further on Veteran, it just got annoying over time.

They took away Xlabs, Sm2, and soon will take away Plutonium which are all the ONLY safe way to play these older CoDs.
Opening any CoD prior to IW will result in a chance for people to gain access to your pc. 2 security breaches are known:
CVE-2018-20817
(SV_SteamAuthClient in various Activision Infinity Ward Call of Duty games before 2015-08-11 is missing a size check when reading authBlob data into a buffer, which allows one to execute code on the remote target machine when sending a steam authentication request. This affects Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3, Call of Duty: Ghosts, Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare, Call of Duty: Black Ops 1, and Call of Duty: Black Ops 2.)
CVE-2018-10718
(Stack-based buffer overflow in Activision Infinity Ward Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 before 2018-04-26 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via crafted packets)
These are some things they can do even if you just boot up the game and get to the menu:

We need to take these CoDs from ""Positive"" or ""Mostly Positive"" to mixed or mostly negative""

There are multiple facets to why this installment in the Call of Duty franchise is worth playing, even years after its release.

Storytelling is a crucial element where ""Black Ops"" shines. It deviates from the straightforward military narratives typical of the genre and opts for a more intricate plot involving espionage, mind control, and covert operations during the Cold War. The story takes players through various historical moments, blending fiction with real events and locations, which adds a layer of depth to the gameplay. Players find themselves in the boots of Alex Mason, navigating through his unreliable memories, which serves as a compelling narrative device that keeps players guessing.

The gameplay in ""Black Ops"" is as tight and responsive as one would expect from a Call of Duty title, with satisfying gunplay and diverse combat scenarios. The game introduced new features to the series, such as the dolphin dive, which became a fan-favorite movement mechanic. The missions are varied, including stealth segments, intense firefights, and vehicular sections that break up the potential monotony of shooting.

One of the game's standout features is the inclusion of the ""Zombies"" mode. This cooperative gameplay mode tasks players with surviving endless waves of zombies, requiring teamwork, strategy, and quick reflexes. It's not just a throwaway addition; it has depth, with its own set of narratives and easter eggs that have spawned a dedicated fan base.

Graphically, ""Black Ops"" was impressive at its time of release and featured detailed character models, varied and immersive environments, and robust animation work. The visual presentation supports the game's gritty and tense atmosphere, immersing players in the chaos of war and the claustrophobia of covert operations.

The multiplayer aspect of ""Black Ops"" is another significant draw. It built upon the successful formula of previous titles with a wide array of maps and modes, customizable loadouts, and the introduction of the COD Points system, which allowed players to unlock weapons, attachments, and cosmetics. The game's competitive scene was lively, with a skill ceiling high enough to keep players engaged for countless hours.

The sound design deserves praise as well. The weapons sound powerful, the voice acting is top-notch, with performances that bring the characters to life, and the soundtrack by Sean Murray is fittingly epic, enhancing both the campaign and multiplayer experiences.

In conclusion, ""Call of Duty: Black Ops"" is a comprehensive package that offers a gripping single-player campaign, an addictive and innovative Zombies mode, and a multiplayer experience that's both accessible and deep. It's a game that set a new standard for narrative complexity in shooters and delivered a wealth of content that keeps players returning to it even a decade later. For these reasons, ""Black Ops"" is a must-play for fans of the genre and remains a high point in the Call of Duty series.

7/10

[h1]Intro[/h1]
Black Ops probably has one of the most interesting stories in the Call of Duty franchise, with quite a few twists, turns and mysterious moments. It's however, not the best when it comes to difficulty balancing, weapon impact and tone. That last one, leans on being too edgy.

[h1]Positives[/h1]
+ Good story.
+ Mod support.
+ Great soundtrack.
+ Good replay value.
+ Good weapon variety.
+ Weapons have decent impact.
+ Good aesthetics and graphics.

[h1]Negatives[/h1]
- Micro-stuttering.
- Heavy flinch when getting shot at.
- Enemies prioritize the player over the AI teammates on higher difficulties.
- You can only stare at characters being beat up many times until it starts to come off as edgy.

I would say buy it but the price is too high for a 13 year old game so, go about that any way you want. (OLD REVIEW)

Campaign:

Right so, this game has the best campaign in the whole series, amazing story and great locations, it reminds me a lot of full metal jacket in a way (same way cod 4 is like jarhead). Reznov and dimitri petrenko makes a return which is pleasant and the whole brainwash plot with mason is an easy 10/10 for me.

Multiplayer:

Love to play with my buddies, the customization is a huge upgrade from mw2 and the maps are masterfully crafted, and besides the audio being recycled for explosions and shotguns its really REALLY fun, dlc is also worth it.

Zombies:

Rezurection is an absolute essential, that old waw engine was very glitchy and all the new maps are AWESOME, especially moon and kino der toten, now my fav zombies map, origins, isnt in this game but this game overall is great in terms of zombies

Overall:

I give it a 10/10, best game in the series, solid campaign multi and co op mode, the price is too high for a game released in 2010 but thats my only gripe.",1645948664,1698496662,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Ouch, this has aged badly. If you've played today's great open world games, this one almost feels like an on-rails shooter.

Pros: 
* varied maps (jungle, ice, cities, caves, ... . Some special sections in vehicles, with bad controls though)
* graphics are okay for the age, and it works with modern screen resolutions (2560x1440 in my case)
* shooting is fun for a while

Cons:
* very restricted level design and gameplay: you rush forward in a tiny corridor, while lots scripted stuff (mostly explosions) happens all around you. No exploration, no secrets, no point in looking left or right (health auto-regenerates, there is no armor afaict), just rush fowards to next waypoint that is always 15m ahead and updates all the time. the game micro-manages your every step.
* annoying cut scenes, some of which can't be skipped, especially near the end of the campaign.
* extremely one-dimensional view of the world and of war, even for a video game
* gets repetitive very quickly
* no way to change language. bought in Germany and have to play in German, despite operating system (and thus Steam) being set to English, and every other game in my library is in English. Sub-standard.

I haven't got the chance to try all of the call of duty games but it's on my to do list. 
This is my first review and I'm counting on writing more positive review.

First, Call of duty is one of my favourite shooter of all time. It's immersive, and the game play gets your heart pounding every step you go. You have multiple difficulty you can try and it makes the game very challenging. I find it a good game to get your reflex going and gain experience, accuracy quick for the next call of duty game :)

But these games are rife with security issues which Activision shows no interest is fixing. They continue to sell their broken games at the expense of the consumer, all while issuing cease and desists to the dedicated community members who create clients preserve these experiences and make these games safe to play, all while providing no alternative.

DO NOT BUY THESE GAMES ANYMORE. They're dangerous to the safety of your personal information/PC and Activision has no intention of fixing they're extremely broken products.

This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you were supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he helped me. Loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my husband had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well.

This compared to any Call of Duty game that tries to features a convincingly gritty atmosphere setting is absolutely no-match. [i](No, Black Ops 2 is more of a Hollywood-ish gritty way which is not even close to convincing)[/i]

Gameplay wise, compare the game difficulty to previous Call of Duty games I've played (CoD4: MW, CoD: WaW, CoD: MW2 and CoD:MW3), this game definitely is similarly punishing as WaW, except with slightly lower player health and exclude ridiculous firefight from Fall of Berlin.

Gunplay wise, its Call of Duty, what did you expect? But of course it has some new weapons to play with such as the crossbow, the dual-welding weapons and some uncommon weapons, but noticeably some weapon animation are downgrade from previous game, [b]especially the mosin nagant reload animation, who in the hell is so damn lazy to only put one animation on both empty and chambered reload animation?? WaW did it better than this bro[/b]


Story wise, alot of previous game characters reappear like Reznov and Dimitri while some new character introduced such as Hudson, Mason, Woods, etc. All of them are used very wisely and memorable. (No, I won't talk too much details about the character, because it will be too long)

Flaw wise, there's nothing much besides the poor implementation of shader warmup due to last minute port from console to PC and the OST of the entire game (exclude some 3rd party music, those has its goods for certain gameplay), like seriously, I don't even have a favorite theme or main theme to admire, everything is just feels like a hacked together of parts of story with its own vibe to it.

Overall, Call of Duty: Black Ops is by far the most outstanding in terms of Call of Duty storytelling in both convincingly gritty ways and also memorable way. I can't use any better word to describe the story haha.",1696062467,1696130894,True,1,0,0.503875970840454102,0,True,False,False

* THE NUMBERS MASON! The campaign is a mess. Almost legendarily so, but I hadn't been paying attention. It's using all the tropes in a massively over-the-top manner without adding anything of substance. The setpieces might be intense, but only some rise to the level of ""that's a pretty cool idea I guess,"" Nothing has weight, nothing is really important. There's a rocket in the centre of the map? Presumably it'll blow up in some way, but it won't be very important. You get in the fastest plane in the world? You literally get to look at a static video feed. You'll get yelled at a lot, mostly for things you hadn't done and that you didn't care about. Are the shooty-bits fun? Not for long - as with the rest, it holds zero weight, the enemies are numerous but not interesting. You'll get blown up. They'll get blown up. It's very brown. 

* ""The zombie mode is absolutely inspired"" probably isn't the sentence you were expecting. It's completely at odds with the campaign in both tone and (mostly) mechanics, but it does work. I'll fault it for not feeling fleshed out. It was clearly a fun side project that paid off, but it could've done with some polish in terms of level design and variety. That would've added to its longevity: as it stands, I'll soon uninstall it and probably not reinstall it ever again.

This game is structured very weirdly, doesn't take place in ""real time;"" so far, all the missions are flashbacks prompted by some unknown interrogator using a voice modulator to grill him from a remote location, perhaps in another room in the place where our hero is being held captive and tortured. It seems rather pointless since, so far, all the ""action"" are of events that are in the PAST. I read something someone had written describing this as a Point & Click game, but that person obviously doesn't KNOW what a Point & Click game is—this is NOT a Point & Click game.

Too, it's not exactly an open world game; it's linear and derivative, kind of predictable. No incentive is provided to encourage exploration of the gameworld that we have been introduced to; there don't seem to be any rewards for attempting to take alternate paths or make different decisions. You don't take point all the time, but are required to follow someone, with no idea of what their specific plans or agenda is. You don't really get to make meaningful decisions.

It's clumsy and primitive, even for a game released thirteen years ago. Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas was released in 2004, six YEARS before this game, and it is most definitely not linear, is VERY open world, and non-linear exploration is not only encouraged in that game, it is REQUIRED to be decently entertained...in stark contrast to THIS game.

Oh, and there's this weird audio thing going on with this game where the cutscene audio tracks get louder and louder and louder, making it necessary for me to mute it to 16% system volume (I don't want to get evicted for disturbing the peace).

I'm going to keep playing it for a while to see if it improves any, but I am NOT optimistic. 1996's Lara Croft Tomb Raider adventure, the flagship of that franchise, was more sophisticated and thrilling. This is a retro game, but even so, it's pretty damned sorry.

Stack-based buffer overflow in Activision Infinity Ward Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 before 2018-04-26 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via crafted packets.

CVE-2018-20817
SV_SteamAuthClient in various Activision Infinity Ward Call of Duty games before 2015-08-11 is missing a size check when reading authBlob data into a buffer, which allows one to execute code on the remote target machine when sending a steam authentication request. This affects Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3, Call of Duty: Ghosts, Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare, Call of Duty: Black Ops 1, and Call of Duty: Black Ops 2.
Bo3 is also included as it does not protect you from any security breaches.
For anyone who isn't experienced with this kind of thing, RAT stands for ""Remote Access Trojan"".

POSTED: JUNE 26
Good game, one of the best in the series but I can not recommend.
DO NOT BUY.
While it is still possible to play zombies safely with the use of community patches you can not play public servers safely and activision are actively removing safe ways of playing the game.

*DO NOT OPEN ANY COD PRIOR TO IW*
They took away Xlabs, Sm2, and soon will take away Plutonium which are all the ONLY safe way to play these older CoDs.
Opening any CoD prior to IW will result in a chance for people to gain access to your pc. 2 security breaches are known:

Write negative reviews to warn others not to spend any money on these CoDs (which are mostly overpriced for how old they are as it is)

In November 2010, the gaming world was treated to an explosive installment in the highly acclaimed Call of Duty franchise: ""Call of Duty: Black Ops."" Developed by Treyarch and published by Activision, Black Ops took the first-person shooter (FPS) genre to new heights, delivering a gripping single-player campaign, a robust multiplayer experience, and a fascinating narrative that weaved through the clandestine world of the Cold War and beyond. In this review, we'll dive deep into the elements that make Call of Duty: Black Ops a landmark title in the gaming industry.

Single-Player Campaign:
Black Ops introduces players to the enigmatic Alex Mason, a CIA operative whose mind becomes the focal point of the narrative. The campaign is a rollercoaster ride of espionage, betrayal, and mind-bending plot twists. From the bleak confines of a Soviet prison to the intense battles in the Vietnam War, each mission is meticulously crafted, providing a compelling narrative that keeps players engaged throughout. The voice acting, particularly Sam Worthington as Mason and Gary Oldman as Viktor Reznov, is top-notch and adds depth to the characters. One of the campaign's standout features is its ability to seamlessly blend historical events and fictional storytelling. This approach adds a layer of authenticity to the game, immersing players in the complexities of the Cold War era.

Gameplay and Mechanics:
Black Ops maintains the signature Call of Duty gameplay mechanics - fast-paced, responsive controls, and intense firefights. However, it also introduces some innovations, such as the addition of the ""Create-a-Class"" system, which allows players to customize their loadouts and tailor their playstyles. The campaign offers a healthy mix of stealthy infiltration missions and all-out action sequences, providing variety and keeping players on their toes.

Zombies Mode:
One of the most celebrated features of Black Ops is the introduction of the ""Zombies"" mode. This cooperative game mode, set in various locations, pits players against waves of the undead. It quickly became a sensation, spawning a subculture of dedicated Zombie slayers. The mode's depth, challenging gameplay, and the mystery of its intricate Easter eggs added immense replay value and turned it into a hallmark of the franchise.

Graphics and Sound:
For its time, Black Ops boasted impressive graphics and sound design. The game's visuals were a significant step up from its predecessors, featuring detailed character models and immersive environments. The sound design, from the sharp report of firearms to the ambient noise of war-torn landscapes, added to the game's overall immersion.

Narrative and Themes:
Black Ops' narrative is a compelling blend of conspiracy theories, political intrigue, and personal vendettas. It explores themes of betrayal, loyalty, and the gray morality of covert operations. The way it integrates historical figures and events into its fictional storyline is a testament to the game's storytelling prowess.

Legacy:
Call of Duty: Black Ops has left an indelible mark on the gaming industry. It set the bar high for future Call of Duty titles, and many fans still consider it one of the best entries in the franchise. Its influence can be seen in subsequent installments, particularly in the emphasis on storytelling, and the enduring popularity of the Zombies mode.

Conclusion:
In summary, ""Call of Duty: Black Ops"" (2010) is a remarkable achievement in the FPS genre. Its gripping single-player campaign, iconic Zombies mode, and captivating narrative make it a standout title in the Call of Duty franchise. Even years after its release, it continues to be a beloved classic and a shining example of how a well-crafted FPS can captivate players with its gameplay and storytelling.",1692900850,1694000604,True,1,0,0.502304136753082275,0,True,False,False

POSTED: JUNE 26
Good game, one of the best in the series but I can not recommend.
DO NOT BUY.
While it is still possible to play zombies safely with the use of community patches you can not play public servers safely and activision are actively removing safe ways of playing the game.

*DO NOT OPEN ANY COD PRIOR TO IW*
They took away Xlabs, Sm2, and soon will take away Plutonium which are all the ONLY safe way to play these older CoDs.
Opening any CoD prior to IW will result in a chance for people to gain access to your pc. 2 security breaches are known:
CVE-2018-20817
(SV_SteamAuthClient in various Activision Infinity Ward Call of Duty games before 2015-08-11 is missing a size check when reading authBlob data into a buffer, which allows one to execute code on the remote target machine when sending a steam authentication request. This affects Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3, Call of Duty: Ghosts, Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare, Call of Duty: Black Ops 1, and Call of Duty: Black Ops 2.)
CVE-2018-10718
(Stack-based buffer overflow in Activision Infinity Ward Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 before 2018-04-26 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via crafted packets)
These are some things they can do even if you just boot up the game and get to the menu:

Two years later, Black Ops brings that standpoint to a HUGE high, as this game was hyped to the brink and shows why it was so damn good, to this day, even.

Black Ops released with a fantastic marketing campaign with multiple badass trailers and media practically everywhere around the world. Everything about the game was great, and its Zombies brought the game to it's fantastic final stand, even right when MW2 took the spotlight.
Black Ops had the same fantastic golden era CoD aspects it offered, but improves on every one it already formulated in WaW.

Black Ops' campaign was PHENOMINAL. I thought World at War had the greatest campaign at that point, but oh boy, Black Ops' storytelling is just outstanding. Everything is much more polished and pretty than the gritty World at War. Another incredible voice cast that have high praise shows Treyarch can once again write a dark and surreal feelings of war while also adding onto the era they wanted the game to be in, the Cold War. I was introduced to Sam Worthington here and now every time I hear him I can't help but smile thinking of his role in this awesome game. Gary Oldman returns for another absolute banger of Viktor Reznov again, Weaver and Hudson's impact overall is cool and Hudson's frustration towards Mason and the numbers is such a eye-opening and memorable moment. The entire mysterious vibe that you get right from the start is so interesting, that the only way that I would want to stop playing the campaign is if I got mad by getting killed so many times in firefights. Every mission was unique, a totally different experience from the next, it questioned your sanity, I wanted more every time I played, and when it ended it was all totally worth it. The campaign is a MUST PLAY. Even if you never liked or played the campaigns in the past.

Multiplayer was also great. The ""Golden Age"" of CoD was so fun to be a part of, but some may say hackers and modders ruined everything the old Call of Duty's had to offer. But that's when PC comes in. Even if modders ruin your console experience, a good reason to buy the PC version is simple: Lobbies. Even if there are lobbies filled with people who fly around with god mode, you can always find one with admins and you can favorite it to play it at any time. I love that so much, I enjoy Multiplayer so much more now than ever. The only problem I would say is be prepared to hear that same goddamn explosion sound effect every minute of play.

Even if I bought World at War mainly for Zombies, Black Ops improves on the zombies phenominon. Both regular maps are equally fun and more challenging than the past, as it was a sort to improve on the average zombies player's skills. Not to mention Dead Ops Arcade, which could never have been added to the game and still would've affect my review of this game. The sheer ATTENTION and DETERMINATION Treyarch put into Black Ops made everything worth the ratings and fun everyone has had. DLC adds to this wonderful game on it's own, but at a iffy price that should be lowered considering it's age today. Not to mention all four World at War zombies maps ""remastered"" into it's younger game engine, making everything look more gorgeous than it already was.

In summary, if you're looking for a Call of Duty experience that fills all three components of it's day, story, multiplayer and other addons, get Black Ops. Everything from the previous installment is vastly improved on for the better. Classic!

Black Ops was really the peak of Call of Duty for anyone who wasn't just in it for the multiplayer (for them it's probably Modern Warfare). A game so successful in fact that soon Activision may be releasing a sixth sequel some time next year and permanently alternate between Black Ops and Modern Warfare titles. When it came to the campaign and especially the zombies, this game had a magic to it that no other CoD game had ever achieved before or since. This game started off with a bang, adding Kino Der Toten, a spectacular map that worked perfectly with the zombies gameplay, with wide train-able areas, long passageways to escape the hordes, an amazing soundtrack, and so much more that just screamed the fact that Activison was listening, and willing to improve things from the perspective of the people who played the game.

After that we just kept getting great map after great map--maps so good that even 6 years later, they would be staple maps included in the Zombies Chronicles series, a series which of its many maps only included ONE single map which wasn't from this game. Kino may have been a staple, but it's far from the only classic map this game provided: there's the equally brilliant Ascension, the claustrophobic ""Five"", the exploratory Call of the Dead, the classics from WaW (of course), and the bizarre Shangri-La. I still don't fully stand behind the price that they're charging for this game on Steam, but there's no denying that the game itself is one of if not the essential Call of Duty game, and one that can still be played to this day with its immortal zombies maps--they keep on remastering them for a reason!",1688686622,1688686622,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

I swear to god though if they send a cease and desist to the Plutonium mod makers like they did to the other mod makers that kept the older titles alive I will be furious. Those mods literally patched security vulnerabilities that gave people root administration abilities into user's computers. Activision is too lazy to patch themselves but has the time to shut the mods down that kept the game safe for people to play online and kept the game alive. Horrible company but great title. Newer COD will never capture the older community because they lost their roots that they once had. COD is now just a cash grab and rushed content filled with stupid skins and micro transactions. This is why I quit the newer Modern Warfare and Warzone and will never purchase another COD again. Same BS different name of the game.,1688307242,1688307242,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Pros:
+ Good storyline and plot twist.
+ Memorable characters and great voices acting for them, especially Reznov (Gary Oldman) and Frank Woods (James C. Burns).
+ Quite good soundtracks (but personally, WaW done much better), plus Sympathy for the Devil.
+ Entertaining Multiplayer mode.
+ Zombie mode, nuff' said.

Cons:
- Gun sounds are something that need to improve, and most of weapons (almost) have no recoil at all.
- Fast-paced video game also comes up with a fast-paced storyline and (some) scene transitions. Everything you can find from many action movies can be found here also.
- A decision to kill some of the old characters just to make us hate the villians.
- Strange and robotic battle cries (especially enemies), also gibberish Vietnamese.
- The bloody pop-up scene when players are injured is quite harder for the players to figure how much more damage they can take.
- A huge TONS of historical inaccuracies and other mistakes, mostly appeared in the term of firearms.

Here is the list for those who interested:

Uniforms and models
- The uniform of Tropas (should be Cuban's FAR instead) MUST be changed, the original uniform with camo pattern is very incorrect for 1960's. Interesting source with pictures (Spanish): https://aquellasarmasdeguerra.wordpress.com/2012/12/06/algunas-armas-utilizadas-durante-la-invasion-de-bahia-de-cochinos

- Spetsnaz's SSh-68 helmet should be changed into SSh-60, since they just start producing in 1968.
- The M88 olive afghanka (around 1983-85) and black afghanka (1991) pants shouldn't worn by Spetsnaz in this game.
- 2nd pattern lifchik chest rig (1988) shouldn't worn by Spetsnaz, the Tropas and the Op 40.
*More info for Soviet uniforms: https://equipment.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Soviet
- KZS camo suit (1975) is worn by the Spetsnaz, it should be 'KLMK' instead (1968, both regular and winter versions). For appropriated camo patterns: http://camopedia.org/index.php?title=USSR

- RD-54 backpack and 6B1 vest would be great additional equipment for Spetsnaz units.
- From all above, Spetsnaz in Vietnam missions should all wear KLMK uniform with proper gears. And optionally either white KLMK or 2 pcs snow camo cover (like in WW2) for them in WMD mission.
- Spetsnaz in Baikonur, Rebirth, and the last missions should wear proper service/regular uniforms.
- Lack of faces variation for every Vietnamese. Also lack of uniforms and models variations for VC and Hue citizens.
- Appearance of VC models with bandana should be reduced. And VC models with a black pyjamas should be increased.
- In Defector (Hue), VC should appear together with NVA forces (but in a smaller number).
- German SS, regular Soviets soldiers, and SAS men in the Project Nova mission only had 1 uniform model, and also 1 equipment/gear (except surrendering Germans that were killed by Kravchenko).
- From the Project Nova mission, Ushanka (Fur hat) for the officers was corrected, but incorrect for the regular soldiers (same with Vorkuta guards).
- From above, regular Red army soldiers are worn M41 Telogreika instead of the corrected M43 ver. 

Weapons and attachments
- You can see the list of ANACHRONISTIC weapons and replacement from here -> https://steamcommunity.com/app/42700/discussions/0/1638662230361512213/

Vehicles
- The Castro's Cuban late 1960's BTR-60 should be changed into BTR-60P or T-34-85.
- Mi-24 Hind (1969) can be seen in 1968 missions (quite acceptable, since we can assume them as prototypes).
- Fictional Soviet half-track in the Project Nova mission. It could be GAZ-60/65 or any kind of Era-appropriated ZIS tracked vehicles.
- German Sd.kfz.7 with a fictional snow cutter in the Project Nova mission (quite acceptable).
- NVA's T-55 tanks should be replaced by T-54B.

Others (including other non sense stuff)
- Different outcome of what was happened with the South-East Asia in the Black Ops universe with out any clearly explanation. In the cutscene sequence, Devs make it looks like Vietnam and possibly the whole region was finally occupied by the Communist in February 1968. Which is very contrast with the reality.
- As a part of Treyarch's revisioned history, seems like MACV HQ in Hue is fully captured by the communists.
- Although it was fit for the scenes, the song Fortunate son and Sympathy for the Devil are anachronistic (pretty much disappointing).
- In Defector (Hue) mission, after Mason recovered from the tank shell explosion, Reznov keep follow right behind you. But after the building's 2nd floor collapse, Reznov will suddenly appear in front of you instead.
- As from above, Reznov also walks into an exploding NVA tank like nothing happened.
- Fictional Limestone peaks/mountains around the Hue city.
- In the end of the Defector (Hue) mission, at the opposite side of the Perfume river should had some buildings and a line of the Citadel's wall far in the background. 
- Also at the end of Defector, Mason should had said ""Dragovich"" as a final sentence before ending the mission. But possibly because of Dev's mistake once again, he said it before Woods jump into the PBR for no apparent reason.
- In the same mission, Vietnamese announcer speaking a TOTAL GIBBERISH Vietnamese.
- Quite over-exaggerate on how NVAs kill civilians during the Battle of Hue. Their prime targets are the government officials and those who seem to be 'TOO FRIENDLY with USA.' The game are somehow represent like NVA were ordered to kill every civilian on sight.
- From above, Bowman should translate the announcer words like: ""Kill every civilian in this (American) building"" instead.
- In Numbers mission, Hudson left Dr.Clarke dangling in the air instead of pulling him up. It almost looks like an intention to get Dr.Clarke killed.
- In Payback mission, Kravchenko's bomb was detonated so quickly, both Kravchenko and Woods shouldn't survive by the explosion.
- There are also Vietnam war's video footage after 1968 in the game. Including the Fall of Saigon in 1975.


UPDATES: There should be more units for Soviet troops (gotta thanks Gicombat for this too). You can check them from here: https://www.deviantart.com/fereise/art/COD-Black-Ops-Revisioned-Soviets-Updated-962764718



In conclusion: [b]6/10[/b]
Very interesting storyline and quite fun to play, but also come along with a vast number of unacceptable mistakes, especially in the term of weapons.

[i]Call of Duty: Black Ops (2010)[/i] is one of the best Call of Duty games of all time. Even after 12 years since its release, the game holds up surprisingly well with good graphics and fun gameplay. If it wasn't for Multiplayer having a low player count and security issues, this game would still be be a truly complete package of a game. That said, even without Multiplayer, the game still mostly feels like a whole package with Campaign and Zombies available to play. 

[h1]CAMPAIGN[/h1]
The Campaign is just as amazing as when I first played it and I've come to appreciate it even more in recent years. Being able to play as an anti-hero character, taking on secretive Black Operations set in 1960's Cold War/Vietnam War is still one of the coolest concepts and ideas for a Call of Duty game that it boggles my mind that it took them an entire decade to fully revisit that era with [i]Black Ops Cold War[/i]. Sam Worthington, Gary Oldman, and James C. Burns all did phenomenal jobs in their respective roles and are still some of the best characters in the entire franchise. 
One of the things I've always loved and appreciated about Treyarch's Narrative team is their dedication to fleshed out lore and immersion across both Campaign and Zombies. Being able to read a ton of lore and backstory from the intel you collect, as well as being able to read hundreds of emails and messages at the terminal in the main menu area brought a while other level of immersion to the story and world of Black Ops. Speaking of the main menu, it's hard to talk about Black Ops and not bring up it's main menu. By far one of the coolest and most iconic menus in any video game to this day. Call of Duty: Black Ops still remains tied with [i]Modern Warfare 2 (2009)[/i] as the best Call of Duty Campaign to date. 

[b][h1]ZOMBIES[/h1][/b]
Without a doubt the biggest reason this game has stood the test of time is its Zombies offering. Call of Duty: Black Ops is the best of the Classic Zombies era, with six original maps, four [i]Call of Duty: World at War[/i] remasters, and the introduction of Dead Ops Arcade. 

[b][i]Kino der Toten[/i][/b]
One of the most iconic Zombies maps of all time. Even though I personally find this map to be overrated in retrospect, especially when compared to [i]Der Riese[/i], it is still a fun map and is a map where I have a lot of childhood memories on. Also, [i]115[/i] is still the best easter egg song in all of Zombies. 

[b][i]Five[/i][/b]
[i]Five[/i] is one of the most overhated and underappreciated Zombies maps ever made. Originally intended as the main launch map for Call of Duty: Black Ops, Five takes place in the Pentagon and puts you in the shoes of real life historical figures such as John F. Kennedy and Fidel Castro. The map is a hybrid of the missions [i]U.S.D.D.[/i] and [i]Rebirth[/i] from the Campaign and is a tightly knit map with minimal space for training. The map also introduces a new boss called the Pentagon Thief who will steal your primary weapon upon getting close to you. I love when maps like Five and [i]Shangri-La[/i], are designed to actively work against you and make getting high rounds very difficult and maintains that inevitability of failure. The main problem I have with Kino der Toten, and why I find it overrated nowadays is that, with enough patience, you could easily get to high rounds by utilizing an incredibly boring strategy that is the very opposite of fun. Five perfectly encapsulates what Zombies is about and I think it deserves more respect. However, with all that said, the map is absolutely not without its flaws. The map's main wonder weapon, the Winter's Howl, is not that good and is only useful for slowing down hordes of zombies. However, that is the only big issue I have with this map. Overall, it's a really good map and criminally overhated. 

[b][i]Moon[/i][/b]
While all the other Zombies maps are great, I'm gonna skip to the final map in the game, [i]Moon[/i]. Despite a lot of major flaws with this map, this is still one of my favorites in all of Zombies. Serving as a culmination of everything that Zombies introduced up to this point in regards to gameplay and narrative, Moon elevates all that with a very unique and cool experience. Moon introduces a few new, gimmicky features like the Hacker and, of course, Zero-G combat. The map's wonder weapon, the Wave Gun, is fun to use. Flaws aside, a lot of what this map introduces is really awesome and I think it deserves some appreciation. 
However, the thing that makes this map one of the coolest and most iconic in Zombies is how it concludes this arc of the Aether story. Moon fills in all the gaps in the story leading up to the beginning of our character's journey and ends it off with a literal bang. After Richtofen takes control of the Aether, the four characters are then ordered by Dr. Maxis with unknowingly sending rockets towards earth, blowing it up. This map does a great job concluding this arc of the story and setting up the next one for [i]Call of Duty: Black Ops II (2012)[/i]. 
Overall, Moon is a very flawed map, but it is one that I personally love, and I also feel was vastly improved with its remaster in the [i]Zombies Chronicles[/i] expansion for [i]Call of Duty: Black Ops III (2015)[/i]. 

[h1]CONCLUSION[/h1]
Overall, [i]Call of Duty: Black Ops[/i] still remains my favorite game in the series for it's amazing Campaign, and its addicting Multiplayer & Zombies modes. Even though Multiplayer isn't worth trying to play today, I still recommend this game to anyone who hasn't played the Campaign or Zombies.",1495820397,1687057390,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

POTENTIALLY EXPOSED TO VULNERABILITY CVE-2018-20817

https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-20817

With XLabs being killed off by Activision, Plutonium and likely H1 next on the chopping block, there is no safe way to play this game or any other Classic CoD on PC anymore. Activision wants you to completely forget about their legacy and go play their newest game and buy tons of bundles.

MWR is exposed to CVE-2018-20817, a massive security risk allowing hackers to execute Remote Code Executions and gain control of your PC to upload malicious files just by playing online and matching with them ingame, nearly exactly like it happens with Black Ops 2, 3 and every other Classic CoD from 2007 - 2018. While H1 is still around for now, it's likely going to be taken down not long after Plutonium goes. The game itself also suffers major issues outside of the vulnerability, including an issue where the game will not launch unless set to windowed in safe mode. Even if H1 somehow survives Activision's cease and desist onslaught, the multiplayer servers are almost always dead even with the client. I would have recommended buying this for SM², but of course that got C&D'd as well.

If Activision won't consistently update these games, and won't let the community fix them, they need to be taken off the store. This and the rest of the Classic CoD Games are practically malware at this point with the lack of updates.

TLDR: Don't buy or play online, you risk being ratted and having your PC controlled or info stolen from RCEs by doing so.",1686552519,1686552519,False,4,0,0.523386836051940918,0,True,False,False

(CVE 2018-20817) (high vulnerability, CVSS score of 7.5 & 9.8) cod games affected: mw2, bo1, mw3, bo2, ghosts, aw. these games are not safe and either need to be fixed or taken off of the steam store. 

activision refused to address this issue, while third-party clients like BOIII, SM2, IW4x, S1x, and IW6x stepped in to fix the problem and made the games safer and more enjoyable to play. BOIII, SM2, IW4x, S1x, and IW6x all received cease and desist letters from activision forcing them to remove their clients for games that activision no longer supports.

The most frustrating aspect of this entire situation is that activision's decision to take down these clients stems not from a genuine intention to fix the games or release remastered versions. Instead, it appears to stem from their disapproval of people enjoying their older games, rather than pouring their hard-earned cash into the dull, uninspired, dispassionate sorry excuses of games they've released in the past 7 years, characterized by poor development, management, and resource allocation by a company valued at over 52 billion dollars.

Remember that AAA game studios now are not what they used to be, they were once owned and/or managed by nerds who were passionate about their work. but now, a majority development studios have all been bought up by greedy cooperate companies who only look at their games and studios as a financial metric.

I've accepted the fact that the cod franchise is horrible now, and i choose not to not play their newer titles. However, they're basically strong-arming the few thousand remaining players of these titles into either playing against bots in the few games they have that support it, switching to their new titles or quitting the multiplayer aspect of the franchise as a whole.

Old review: This game is Okay. The story is okay. Zombies is fun but annoying how you only get 2 maps for it without buys the DLCs. Multi-play is dead and doesn't work and half the maps need the DLC. Just go buy a new Call of duty it's better than a dead game and the price they charge for it. I'm deffintly getting a refund and buy something else.

If you are interested in retaliating against Activision after their recent moves, join gamers in reporting the COD games MW2/MW3/Ghosts/AW/BO1/BO2 on Steam with the message: ""Reporting due to an old unfixed security/privacy vulnerability CVE 2018-20817.""

CVE-2018-20817
(SV_SteamAuthClient in various Activision Infinity Ward Call of Duty games before 2015-08-11 is missing a size check when reading authBlob data into a buffer, which allows one to execute code on the remote target machine when sending a steam authentication request. This affects Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3, Call of Duty: Ghosts, Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare, Call of Duty: Black Ops 1, and Call of Duty: Black Ops 2.)
CVE-2018-10718
(Stack-based buffer overflow in Activision Infinity Ward Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 before 2018-04-26 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via crafted packets)

And this game certainly isn't worth the 40 dollar price tag, or even the 20 dollar price tag when it's on sale, not 13 years later. That said, the campaign can be pretty fun and the story is more creative and interesting than most other CoD games, but there are still significant problems.

I think there are points where the story isnt communicated well through the cut scenes and becomes difficult to follow. Some of the levels are just nightmares to navigate. I also think the audio design in this game is poor. The guns sounds like they're plastic nerf guns when they're being reloaded. The gunfire sound effects are also terrible. If you're in a mission where lots of guys are firing at once, it sounds like gravel being poured into a metal bucket constantly right in your ears.

If you've got friends to play multiplayer with, then you'll probably get more enjoyment out of that if you like the multiplayer from the older CoD games. But, there's just not much here that aged well or is enjoyable to go back to in 2023, at least not for the price this game goes for on Steam. 

If this game was cheaper, I'd probably recommend it, but I definitely regret spending 20 bucks on it, because it honestly just doesn't hold up as well as I hoped and it isn't as good as I remember it being on the ps3.",1683490997,1683490997,False,0,2,0.466839402914047241,0,True,False,False

No?
I will
10/10 Story, 10/10 Gameplay, 10/10 Graphics. I recommend playing on normal, or whatever is right below Hardened (it doesn't come to mind atm), if this is your first COD. If not, buck up. Enemies hit like a MF, shoot you in impossible ways, and frankly make your life hell if you don't go over your surroundings properly. The story can be confusing if you don't pay attention, I had to look up a story-line video cause I didn't pay attention. Gameplay makes you feel like a badass when you aren't getting your shit kicked in, I personally love the chopper and boat segments. Graphics look really good, can have some goofs occasionally. Things not loading in properly, popping, or just blurry textures. 
I got this on sale. While it is a 10/10 game, I don't recommend paying full price. COD goes on sale often just wait, you won't regret it when the time comes.
Btw, if Woods won't stop just screaming something about trenches and VC just flood over the lines, it's the barrels, the barrels are the key. I got stuck for like an hour on this not knowing what to do

First of all it is not worth $40.

1. Too easy, even on veteran, just a very easy game in comparison to WaW. Although WaW was so hard it was broken on veteran. It's far easier than all MW games.
2. Story is bad. Maybe it is just me, but reliving memories of a crazy guy that has Reznov as a hallucination isn't that interesting. WaW was interesting, it had a story, and characters that we cared about...
3. Too many unskippable cutscenes. Often would just walk away from my computer to wait for a cutscene to end.

Mason is the CIAs best guy, their number one man. So they *check notes* send him on a suicide mission during the bay of pigs to assassinate *my man* Fidel Castro.

Turns out, castro was one step ahead of us; as he had sent a body double to lay some pipe in his bedroom, if you know what I mean. 

I show up. Murder the body double, and my colleague brutally murders the pretty young woman accompanying the double. Yet somehow that's castro's fault. Because my character is fundamentally unwilling to face the consequences of his own actions. 

Anyway, after singled handedly killing 200 to 300 men. women, and children in Cuba I try to hop on a plane to make my getaway...oops... wrong decision it turns out the Cubans *Crafty as they are* have blockaded the runway with trucks. 

So I do the only logical thing, hop out the plane, and run toward a machine gun mounted along the runway, which I then USE to blow up the trucks on the runway. 

At this time I'm feeling like an absolute bad ass who pays no attention to the laws of physics. 

And I'm captured by the Cubans, and they're SO DONE WITH ME, that they ship me off to a Gulag in russia. Which, fair play to them, I am already guilty of numerous war crimes and I certainly deserve to be in jail for all the children I've just orphaned for american imperialism. 

In this Russian gulag, and old russian man convinces me we can just murder every gaurd in the facility and run away *see Not all russians are bad*, and hey why not? I've already solved all my problems with murder up to this point, why not conscript a bunch of imprisoned fascists into my murder frenzy. 

Honestly, this game has you commit a lot of war crimes, and requires you to do things which defy the laws of physics. In that way I think this game is an excellent tool to understand american foreign policy.

The campaign offers a thrilling and engaging story, and the multiplayer and zombies game modes provide endless hours of entertainment.

However, it's surprising to see that the game is still full price in 2023. With barely anyone playing it anymore and no updates or patches in years, the price should have dropped significantly. Even though the game is still enjoyable, it's hard to justify paying full price for it in today's market.

Despite this, I still find myself playing the zombies game mode regularly. The gameplay mechanics and level design still hold up well, and the mode offers a unique experience compared to the more recent releases of Call of Duty.

Overall, Call of Duty: Black Ops is a classic game that has stood the test of time. It's a shame that the price hasn't dropped to reflect its age, that is my only complaint about the whole game.",1631659522,1681026147,True,2,0,0.513340473175048828,0,True,False,False

It was released in 2010 and is the seventh installment in the [url=https://store.steampowered.com/developer/callofduty]Call of Duty franchise[/url]. The game is set during the Cold War era and follows the story of CIA operative Alex Mason, as he tries to uncover a conspiracy involving mind control experiments and a Russian defector known as ""Nova 6"". The game features both single-player and multiplayer modes and has received positive reviews from critics and gamers alike.

The gameplay in Black Ops is fast-paced and intense, with players taking on the role of Alex Mason as he completes a series of missions across various locations around the world. The game features a variety of weapons and equipment, including assault rifles, shotguns, grenades, and rocket launchers, which players can use to take out enemy soldiers and complete objectives. The game also includes a number of vehicles, such as helicopters and tanks, which players can use to traverse the game's large maps and engage in combat.

One of the standout features of Black Ops is its ""Zombies"" mode, which sees players fighting off waves of zombies as they try to survive as long as possible. This mode has become a fan-favorite and has spawned numerous sequels and spin-offs. The game also features a ""Combat Training"" mode, which allows players to hone their skills against AI-controlled opponents before jumping into the multiplayer mode.

The story in Black Ops is one of the game's strongest aspects, with a well-written and engaging plot that keeps players hooked from start to finish. The game's campaign mode takes players on a journey through various locations around the world, including Vietnam, Cuba, and Russia, as they try to uncover the truth behind a conspiracy involving mind control experiments and a Russian defector.

The story is told through a retrospective series of flashbacks, as Mason recounts his experiences to his interrogators. The game also features a number of memorable characters, including Mason's fellow operatives, Hudson and Weaver, as well as the enigmatic Russian defector, Reznov. This is also Reznov's second appearance in the Call of Duty franchise, as he was introduced as a side character in [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/10090/Call_of_Duty_World_at_War/?curator_clanid=42355870]Call of Duty: World at War[/url].

One of the standout positive aspects of Black Ops is its fast-paced and intense gameplay. The game's multiplayer mode is especially well-designed, with a variety of maps and game modes that keep players engaged and coming back for more. The inclusion of the ""Zombies"" mode is also a major positive, as it adds an extra layer of depth and replayability to the game.

Another positive aspect of Black Ops is its well-written and engaging story. The game's plot is both interesting and suspenseful, with a number of plot twists and turns that keep players on the edge of their seats. The game's memorable characters and well-crafted dialogue also help to bring the story to life and keep players invested in the game's world.

One of the main negative aspects of Black Ops is its reliance on quick-time events (QTEs) during the campaign mode. While these events can add a cinematic feel to the game, they can also feel repetitive and frustrating, especially if players fail to complete them on their first try.

Another negative aspect of the game is its somewhat dated graphics. While the game's visuals were impressive at the time of release, they can now feel a bit outdated compared to more recent first-person shooters. However, this is a minor complaint and doesn't detract from the overall enjoyment of the game.

Call of Duty Black Ops is - in conclusion - a well-designed and engaging first-person shooter that features fast-paced gameplay and a well-written story. The game's multiplayer mode and ""Zombies"" mode are both standout features, while its reliance on QTEs and somewhat dated graphics are minor drawbacks. Overall, Black Ops is a must-play for fans of the series.",1680634890,1680884965,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Having just finished Atomic Heart, which has some clear influence from the campaign of Black Ops 1 in some aspects, I knew it was the right time to return to this game. 

The gameplay is rather tight and famously one of Call of Duty's all time best campaigns, multiplayer experiences and... Nazi Zombies. 'Nuff said. This game is absolutely legendary and enjoyed by legends. 

While sometimes opinions on the plot can be decisive, this game came out and was incredibly daring with its narrative. Compared to Modern Warfare that played up very real and possible scenarios, Black Ops is technically a sequel to World at War, which was utterly faithful to the ferocity of the worst human conflict that was the Second World War. And the echoes of that game emerge not just in tribute missions or recurring characters, but also the soundtrack. Showing in clear emulation, that human conflict hardly changes. The flags, the borders, the ideologies alter - but human conflict is alive and well. 

World at War is objectively, the best WWII shooter ever made and Black Ops is one of the few games that takes the Cold War setting to its height. The soundtrack is dissonant in its modernity, but it is one of the best OSTs to ever grace the entire franchise. Which is a tall order. Personally, I believe it is on par with World at War's and is just slightly more iconic and brain-ingrained than the masterful MW2 soundtrack by H. Zimmer. But what made this soundtrack feel so alive, was that it wasn't the typical cinematic orchestra with basic guitar. It felt dramatic, but esoteric. The soundtrack, much like the game, was very inspired.

I remember this, back in the day, was the first time I truly peaked at Call of Duty multiplayer. In previous games, I often floated at a 0.97 k/d. For some reason, this game activated something in me that allowed for a steady 2.74 k/d which I maintained consistently and even peaked briefly, at a solid 3.20 at the height of my efforts, only to dwindle back to 2.74 when I decided I couldn't allow it to go any further. The 74u with the grip and ironsights completely melted opponents, especially if you actively aimed down sights while moving backward, which often threw off the aggressive players that aimed for smaller part of your rapidly shrinking hitbox as you faded back like a phantom with your finger on the trigger. Stunning times.

Arguably, if not for ALL of the Nazi Zombie content that composes Black Ops III, this was possibly the definitive and best Nazi Zombie experience possible for its time. 

The campaign is referenced by fans religiously. Even if the trope of the Fight Club-inspired 'companion was in your head the entire time' was rolling steadily (Manhunt 2 also did it around the same era, if I remember right), the way it was presented and done in complete cheese, but with a serious energy - really made this game beloved. Woods and Mason have resonated with players for years, their names, visages and words have survived the test of time. Whereas I honestly forgot how many Hudson missions there were in the campaign (hardly a bad thing), but this game also did something incredible with Reznov as an anti-hero.

World at War was so serious, bleak and heroic, yet tragic. But the journey of Reznov completely is the highlight of the series, nearly. Not just the twist, but Reznov's companionship with Mason throughout Vorkuta and the insane conclusion of the uprising was blissfully one of the most exciting arcs COD ever put out. While Modern Warfare had the protagonist's personal vendetta against Makarov as a beloved plot point, it honestly pales strongly in comparison to Reznov (and there for, Mason's) personal mission of revenge against Dragovich, Steiner and Kravchenko. Their names literally becoming a murderous mantra as famous as the game's ""WHAT DO THE NUMBERS MEAN, MASON"" - which further promotes just how long staying the fond nostalgia (and well deserved nostalgia at that) for this game there is. 

The story is ridiculous, but manages to have some restraint in appropriate places - only to completely let loose in others. I used to be bothered by the absurd sights of time inaccurate weapons, but this is hardly a historic setting as World at War was. Its a hypothetical, purely fictional and dramatic setting that builds on the real world Cold War. The game knew it wanted to truly bring war-tier conflict and gunfights to the fray. The history that composes this game, while mostly inaccurate, provides an incredible aesthetic, identity and energy to the missions, keeping everything unique, profound and powerfully engaging. 

When it comes to its reliance on reality, it gets everything wrong. When it comes to being enjoyable and shameless schlocky fun - this game hits every point perfectly for its time. This was exactly the game COD players needed too when it arrived, unrelenting fun without shame or guilt. And of course, there is an immediate post-WWII mission that is pure fan service to the fans of the World at War and its a great tribute to everything that made that game incredible while keeping it in line with the themes of the central plot. The fact they dared to do what they did to Reznov and Dimitri, once again, showed some serious balls and willingness to elevate the game to a path that would ensure its campaign would be long remembered.

Many people joked about ""no one plays the campaigns of these games"" and that is hardly true. However, there were many NPCs players and bad-kid randoms that mindlessly played MP or Zombies exclusively like goons. But COD stories at this time were beloved by those who played them and their short run times were actually to their benefit. A joyous memory is playing through Veteran on them all, going through that horrendous pain, just for the achievements, the clout and to complete the love for these games that many young players had.

The PC version also has some additional enemy models, additional soundtracks for levels and far less choking silence than the console version, much to the benefit of this version. Its a small plus on the PC version, but as a long time fan of this game, it was pleasant to see. 

And damn, when the chunky guitar strums hit in this soundtrack, you know some real shit is going to go down. That being said, the ""America fuck yeah"" ending is rather hilarious, especially with the final shot of everyone standing on combat patrol boats next to American ships, with helicopters and jets flying around with cool guitar music... only to confirm that Mason totally shot JFK - its interesting. This was also the first COD game to gain some more self awareness and make the player question the morality of Mason's missions, the intent of the both countries during the Cold War and also reference heinous things such as MKUltra. All of these themes and criticisms would be played up further in Call of Duty Black Ops Cold War - which to me, is the TRUE sequel to this game. 

Need I say more? This is Call of Duty Black Ops - the gem of the series when it was already shining at its brightest and yet, this game proved to be dark, gritty and melancholic in many scenes. It is a shame the next two BLOPS games desperately tried to keep that going, but fell into despair in more than just one way... Only for, once again, Cold War to truly make the sequel Black Ops' first campaign always deserved.

But that is a review for another day... 

For now, its time to find that Broadcast Station, Mason!

The game is set in the 1960s and features a campaign mode that follows the story of CIA operative Alex Mason as he tries to unravel a conspiracy involving mind control experiments and a numbers station. The campaign is full of twists and turns, and the story is engaging and well-written. The game also features a great soundtrack, with music from the time period that adds to the immersion.

The multiplayer mode in Black Ops is fantastic, with a wide variety of game modes and maps to choose from. The game features the signature Call of Duty fast-paced gameplay, and the new level progression system adds a new level of excitement to the multiplayer experience. The game also introduced 6 new maps for the popular Zombies mode, which has become a staple of the Call of Duty franchise. Unfortunately, only 'Kino der Toten' and 'FIVE' are available within the base game and the other 4 maps are locked behind (rather expensive) DLCs.

Overall, Black Ops is a fantastic game that offers a great campaign and an addictive multiplayer experience. The Cold War setting is unique and adds a new layer to the Call of Duty formula, making it a must-play for any fan of the series.",1679957146,1679957146,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I tried everything to buy his love including buying him a $10,000 gaming set up including the valve index. He still never wanted anything to do with me. I stress so often that I can not think most of the time, but this game was so relaxing, so much that i was able to relax and think about how to make my son love me, and realized that buying his love wont work. I took a baseball bat into his room and smashed his pc right while he was in the middle of a game of among us, luckily because he never stops talking about the computer, I knew exactly where to hit it. The bat slammed through the glass and crushed the ""graphics card"". The game vanished from the monitor. Then I grabbed the controller out of his hand and threw it at him, and yelled ""from now on you love yourself because I wont. You made me go broke and you scared away your mother with all the slurs you yell at your video games."" Later that night my son snuck into my bedroom and lit my bed sheets on fire. Luckily I was able to get out of bed before any fire reached me because I had been up watching my favorite fortnite streamer, Ninja, and I ran and grabbed the fire extinquisher and put out the fire. I then threw the fire extinquisher at my son and watched him cry. A 12 year old boy is far too old to be crying so I bought him a bib for his birthday the next week. Exactly 37 days, 4 hours, 12 minutes, and 43 seconds later, his mother walked through the door and threw a rock at me. She then picked the rock back up and began hitting me with it so I sprayed her with the can of whipped cream I was snacking on. She took my son and left but that was ok because as I said I didnt love him anymore. I stayed up until 4:29 in the morning watching my all time favorite show, Power Puff Girls that night. It was a rough night because my head really hurt. My ex wife was very loud. To this day I am living alone in crippiling debt, single, and 782.6 pounds. But every now and then I will play this game and it makes me feel better. Plus I have a major adiction to food hence my weight. Please excuse any spelling or grammar errors, my first language is actually the language of the minions, which has made it extremely hard to find a job because I randomly start spewing out gibberish, hence my debt.

For 2010, the game looks pretty good, especially the light and shadow effects, which blown me away. I liked the story and the characters in the campaign. It's not too long, but enjoyable for 5 - 7 hours, depending on the difficulty. Zombie mode is awesome. It's similar to World at War zombie mode, but some aspects are more polished in general. Soundtrack is a banger. It caught me off guard, because it's not usual COD soundtrack, but I really enjoyed it. 

It has some nice aspects, but there are other things which I have to address. One of them is the aiming: this issue is maybe not that annoying for others, but somehow I felt I have mouse accelaration throughout my gameplay, meanwhile I haven't, but the game always gave me this feeling, even if I changed the sensitivity. There are not many people who plays the multiplayer for this game, which is expected, but if you would find someone to play against, there is a high chance you find hackers and you can't do much with it, so this game mode is somewhat unplayable. There are small stutters in the game for whatever reason. In the campaign you can't still rely on your teammates and you always have to go forward and carry them to the finish line basically. There are scripted parts, where enemies coming infinetly and you have to reach a certain point on the level to stop that. For whatever reason, on certain levels some character model are completly dark, but this is a rare problem. And lastly, this is not the game's issue, but the Steam version of Black Ops was laggy for me, but thankfully it's fixable.

Basically if you get into the game's folder through Steam, find the config file in your players folder. Open this cfg file with Notepad++ or other text editor and search for 'configureghz' and 'sys_sysMB'. For configureghz change the value to your CPU's speed and at sys_sysMB change it to your amount of RAM. After this, save the file and you should be all right. If this doesn't help, change the affinity of the game in the task manager. With this combination, I was able to play Black Ops with just a few stuttering.

This is actually a pretty fun game, even though it has a short campaign, I can definitely recommend it to play though the campaign or if you wanna try the zombie mode alone or with others. 40€ is pretty strong for it, so try to get it for 15-20€ on sales.",1678059631,1678105279,True,16,0,0.663957655429840088,0,True,False,False

An incredible experience, possibly the best Call of Duty game ever made.

+ Good graphics
+ Excellent Sound effects and music (including full songs like Sympathy for the Devil by the Rolling Stones)
+ Good cutscenes
+ Amazing story
+ Enemy AI do attempt to roll, hide, change their position, etc (but stupidly charge at you sometimes)
+ You get to drive a motorbike, a boat, a helicopter, you get to swim and dive
+ Super fun cinematic explosions
+ Experience different time missions between 1945 to 1968
+ Experience different locations (Cuba, Vietnam, Russia, etc.)
+ Replayability value from playing the much harder 'hardened' and 'veteran' difficulty levels
+ Value for money: I bought it for $10 - the game is easily worth that

- Your teammates are kinda dumb, oftentimes blocking your way or, worse, throwing themselves at the path of your shooting (friendly fire is so common in this game)
- Some unrealistic moments when hordes of enemies are never ending. Then something in the story changes and they all magically disappear (Vietnam mission)
- AI enemies throw themselves forward to be easily picked off which is not realistic at all
- On the harder difficulty level 'hardened' - when you repeatedly die the game helps you sometimes by generating less enemies which I found to be annoying (I play the harder difficulty cause I want it to be harder, like duh!)",1677066132,1677066132,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

When it comes to the Call of Duty series, the first thing that most players think of is definitely Modern Warfare, which makes Black Ops the most underrated in the Call of Duty series in terms of plot. Unlike the grand scenes and grand plots of Modern Warfare, Black Ops was probably the first famous shooter game to dare to take the Cold War as its theme, and at the same time, the depth of its plot is extraordinary, creating an unparalleled sense of suspense and atmosphere that is no less than that of the Modern Warfare series.

The game's plot is actually quite remarkable, both in 2010 and compared to other Call of Duty predecessors, an unprecedented attempt that players who love the Call of Duty series but have never tried it before should not miss. In addition, the game's zombie mode is also both highly playable and interesting, and the multiplayer mode is also quite well designed.
 
However, in terms of graphics, Call of Duty: Black Ops is slightly inferior to the 2009 release of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, and there are often a variety of bugs that seriously ruins the game experience on the way to play. The game's obscure plot is a boon to players who like to dig deeper into the game's story development, but this different attempt with the previous Call of Duty series is often not in line with the taste of players seeking an easy and exciting game experience.

I believe that the vast majority of players have long tried Black Ops, more for nostalgia and come. If you are for the call of duty series of single-player campaigns and have not tried black ops, please remember to give it a try, black ops will not let you down. It is worth mentioning that even now, the multiplayer mode still has a certain number of players. Due to the presence of Call of Duty: World at War characters, it is recommended to play the game after completing the Call of Duty: World at War storyline.",1676698512,1676698533,True,123,6,0.885822772979736328,25,True,False,False

If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead, murdered by my brother-in-law Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, Hank came to me with a rather, shocking proposition. He asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using his connections in the drug world. Connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded, I... I always thought that Hank was a very moral man and I was... thrown, confused, but I was also particularly vulnerable at the time, something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me on a ride along, and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin so I agreed. Every day, I think back at that moment with regret. I quickly realized that I was in way over my head, and Hank had a partner, a man named Gustavo Fring, a businessman. Hank essentially sold me into servitude to this man, and when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn.
Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling out. From what I can gather, Hank was always pushing for a greater share of the business, to which Fring flatly refused to give him, and things escalated. Fring was able to arrange, uh I guess I guess you call it a ""hit"" on my brother-in-law, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured, and I wound up paying his medical bills which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge, working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring, and did so. In fact, the bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen in the ranks to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA, and about that time, to keep me in line, he took my children from me. For 3 months he kept them. My wife, who up until that point, had no idea of my criminal activities, was horrified to learn what I had done, why Hank had taken our children. We were scared. I was in Hell, I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, to end this nightmare, and in response, he gave me this. I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. I... All I could think to do was to make this video in hope that the world will finally see this man, for what he really is.",1676490876,1676490876,True,1,1,0.511494219303131104,0,True,False,False

My son got this game for Christmas from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you were supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he helped me. Loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.

Black Ops was the first CoD game I ever played, as a high school freshman back in 2012 whose only FPS experience was playing Medal of Honor: Airborne a year prior, and one I'll not soon forget. I was so engrossed in this game that I named my PS3 username after the game's protagonist, Alex Mason. Fun gunplay that never felt too fast or slow, an engaging and powerful story encompassing actual events from the Vietnam War and other operations that very well could have taken place in the 1960s, and memorable characters, the best of which were Mason and Frank Woods, whose comradeship held this game's campaign together all too well. Hudson, Bowman, and Weaver are all good, too...damn, Black Ops was just too good of a time. I'll miss the time spent going back through campaign missions to find fun exploits, the endless hours dedicated to playing Zombies, with its perfect variety of strategies and weapons, its steep learning curve, and its ever-lovable cast consisting of Tank Dempsey, Nikolai, Takeo, and Richtofen, with my friends and randoms online...

Reviewing this after finishing the campaign
I like the campaign, especially about mason
although i do admit the grenades in this game give me no time to get out of the way or throw it back
doesn't give me ONE SECOND!

and i don't know if its a skill issue but i probably have died in the black ops campaign more than when i played COD4:MW-MW3, i started the campaign in regular difficulty, but had to lower it to recruit after how much i keep on getting rekt, and even then, i still (sometimes) get rekt by the bots, so most probably, a skill issue

^
If your a good FPS player then skip that part of the review
Also by the time i writing this review, i haven't played zombies yet, gonna try that out

And multiplayer is great, there IS still hundreds of players playing, although i do get high ping but thats my fault as i am playing in south east asia, and im pretty sure activision doesn't have servers in china or specifically in the asia region.

overall, good game, just don't buy it with full price, overpriced as fuck, go get it on a sale like what i did.",1672992138,1672992138,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It starts with Mason's involvement in the Bay of Pigs Invasion, where, along with two men named Frank Woods and Joseph Bowman, as well as with the help of a local named Carlos, Mason's job was to assassinate then-Cuban dictator Fidel Castro. However, it went ends up going horribly wrong, with Mason being captured, and Castro handing him over to two Soviet military personnel named Nikita Dragovich and Lev Kravchenko, due to the Cuban-Soviet relations. Finding himself in the Vorkuta gulag, Mason finds himself working with a returning Viktor Reznov and various other prisoners to escape the prison, and eventually sets out to go about finding out what Dragovich and Kravchenko, and an ex-Nazi named Steiner, are planning, and stop them if he and his buddies can. However, as the plot unfurls, including detailing Mason's involvement in the Vietnam War, they find that not everything is as it seems...

This is a pretty good shooter! Graphically, it looks great. Guns are great to use, enemies are fun to fight, and there's less grenade spam than in WaW. The voice acting and the soundtrack is amazing like before. The plot is a genuinely intriguing conspiracy thrilling, gripping you at the edge of your seat, having you want to know what happens next, with a pretty good plot twist near the end of the game. And of course, there's the return of the infamous Zombies mode, with a pretty amusing map unlocked after you beat the Campaign.

[u][b]***WARNING! This is an old COD game. Activision has completely abandoned these older titles. This means the servers have been dead and have been repopulated with bots and custom matches. There are people who have encountered hackers in these games. If you want to keep your account safe, and avoid contact with these players, it is STRONGLY recommended you look at Plutonium, a fan made server browser that supports most of the old COD games.

You can’t earn multiplayer achievements playing on Plutonium, but even so, it’s the definitive way to play these games on PC.***[/b][/u]


[i]While it may be easy to write the [b]Call of Duty[/b] franchise off as a shameless cash grab, there are still those entries that make you think back on why this was a franchise you paid attention to at one point.

This is one of those games.

From the breakneck pacing, the awesome set-pieces and locales, the Fight Club inspired plot twist, the hilarious Zombies survival mode with JFK, the legendary multiplayer maps like Nuketown, and Gary Oldman just absolutely hamming it up as Reznov... it's one hell of a package. Even the main menu is more interactive than it lets on, allowing you to unstrap yourself from the interrogation chair and play fucking Zork from 1977. Back when [b]COD[/b] actually had some charm and creativity put in it.

The Campaign has you playing as Alex Mason, an American agent who is captured by Soviet scientists after botching the Bay of Pigs operation. What follows is a legendary Russian gulag uprising, to a flashback to WWII featuring characters from World at War, to a Vietnam boat mission featuring Sympathy for the Devil blasting in the background, to an all out assault on a James Bond villain secret base. It's one of the most insane yet intriguing plot lines for a shooter from its time. There's tons of twists and turns and it culminates in a bloody revenge story that is satisfying, yet leaves you with this uneasy sense of dread for what the next game will tackle. The Veteran difficulty is also the best tuned it probably has ever been in the series. It's not utterly infuriating like titles prior to this, but it still manages to challenge you at appropriate moments. If you're a one man army taking on a platoon of bad guys, you will die often without pushing up and flanking the enemy effectively. But whenever the game gives you a cool weapon such as a minigun, or a shotgun with flame rounds, the game seems to reduce enemy accuracy for those brief moments to allow you to enjoy the power fantasy. All in all, especially for a [b]COD[/b] game, it's a terrific single player campaign.

The Zombies mode returns from World at War, but with more legs to stand on (or less if you dismember them). There's multiple maps that offer different casts of characters to play as, with the mission 'Five' allowing you to play as freaking JFK, Castro, Nixon, and McNamara. The fact that Kennedy has a weapons cache in the Whitehouse like it's nothing is pure bliss. It makes for a fun and challenging co-op experience and gives the game some added replay value.

The staple multiplayer mode returns with some of the best map design in the series and a cool wager system in the form of points you can bet on in matches to finish unique challenges. Having a gambling system in this dopamine infested mode is a recipe for people losing their jobs and relationships at the time this game released and should be taken with extreme caution to those with addictive personalities.

That being said there are some issues. One, not necessarily the game's fault, but Activision just refuses to cut the retail price of their [b]Call of Duty[/b] games. This game is more than a decade old and is still asking you for 40 dollars USD, plus multiple map packs and Zombies expansions that are 15 dollars a pop. That is utter greed. Guess good ol' Bobby Kotick needs to buy a couple more yachts and believes that an old game with a dwindling multiplayer community should remain at an un-dropped price to achieve that. Another issue is the lack of some key PC features, such as being able to change the FOV without installing mods. Also, there's a weird tunnel section in one of the Vietnam levels where the enemies and allies have no textures and are total black voids. It was pretty frustrating getting through this small section on Veteran mode given that it's a dark cave, with dark lighting, and completely black enemies. Might have wanted to patch that at some point guys.

All in all, if you can catch it when it goes on sale for about 20 dollars, it's definitely worth the price. If you have never tried a [b]COD[/b] game before, this could be a great one to start with to see when the franchise was actually trying to do some cool stuff.[/i]",1670904587,1672192012,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.",1672120429,1672120429,True,3,1,0.519999980926513672,0,True,False,False

D*ck-tugging propaganda that has as much interactivity as a log flume at a Disney Park, the Black Ops series is frequently regarded in the Steam reviews as having the best story of the COD series. Which is kind of like saying that a square wheel is the most road-worthy of all the 4-sided wheels. Not a single event or character in this game stimulates an emotion by virtue of their in-game actions or dialogue - everything you are told to feel about anything you see or do comes directly from a synthesised impression you've received somewhere else in your life of the thing that this game is trying to depict. Treyarch have correctly identified that they don't need to think about their writing because their players aren't going to think about what they're seeing. They don't have to write motivated characters because they're all soldiers who do what they're told. They don't have to script interesting gameplay because your attention is divided perfectly between trying to discern snippets of contextual dialogue through the constant sound of explosions and shooting anything that moves because otherwise it's game over. 

You perform melee kills when you're told to. You can't open doors because someone else always does it for you. You don't have to have good reflexes or make plans when entering a room, because time slows down so you can pick off all 7 guards and admire the furnishings before they have a chance to touch their weapons. COD became a cultural touchstone in the same way methamphetamine did - by stimulating its audience beyond all reason.

This game is 12 years old, looks like sh*t, and has gameplay is so dated it's beyond parody. The multiplayer is functionally dead because the audience has half a dozen other identical and better-populated games to choose from, and by this point the MP was the only reason Activision was making these games anymore - so there's literally no reason to buy this  anymore. 

$54.95 AUD for a 12 year old game with zero redeeming value in the year 2022.

There's a reason you don't see ancient, outdated, barren games routinely priced like this anywhere else on Steam - it's because Activision thinks their audience are dumb enough to pay for it.

-The story (campaign) is excellent and has many memorable characters. The campaign has about 10 hours of gameplay on Regular difficulty, but I recommend playing on Veteran for a more challenging experience after your first playthrough; I got stuck on many parts of missions on Veteran and had to think about what to do to progress. 

-Zombies mode offers an intense wave-shooter experience, but I don't like horror. Some may find the voice acting funny.

-Multiplayer is where I have the most hours (~300). You can still find online games, especially with 3rd party clients like Plutonium. I haven't seen any cheaters online. Though I generally prefer to play against bots for a more casual experience.

-I highly recommend this game for anyone who wants a great FPS game with a great story (along with the sequel ""Black ops 2"" and the prequel ""World at War"")",1671737341,1671737341,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Granted, CoD: BO does have its share of issues that all military games share; namely invisible walls, linear ""on rail"" gameplay.

But I'd still remember the game as great narrative from the voice actors, engaging music and the guns feels good when you run around and shoot!

I'd just wish we'd had some more ""pilot / drive"" missions since I found them very short.

Now that BO2 just got out (at this time of writing), I'm very curious to see where the story will be heading since I did liked BO1 campaign.

The only COD that can compete with this one IMO is probably WaW or MW3, but they aren't that close.

There is a huge problem with this game however, and that is the public multiplayer. It's great that it is based on dedicated servers, but the problem is if you want to host a server in which you gain XP you have to spend like $14.99/month on a third-party hosting service. I would understand that if the game was still in its prime, but it isn't.

There is also a somewhat rare issue where all of your stats can be completely reset, which means you will need to start all the way back at level 1. There is no fix AFAIK, and it wouldn't be that bad if you had everything unlocked in private matches but that isn't the case.

also to be able to access alot of the multiplayer options you need to rank up to level 10, shit knows how to do that because theres no explanation. 

i also think zombies are broken because no matter how many players there are you cant beat round 5 on both the theatre and five map. 

in campaign the gameplay is super glitchy and lags all the time. Ive even mad me graphics to the lowest and still same result if not worse.

i Request an immediate refund for such a big disappointment. its really sad cause this game used to be the best back in the days and now like all the marvel movies it has failed the community 

Also i dont understand why a game this old has still a high price on it, like seriously its been 12 years since it came out",1670561056,1670561056,False,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

Campaign: The start of the black ops story line (kind of...) is a wonderfully done shoot em up campaign that ranks among the best in the franchise. With missions ranging from the final days of WWII to the bay of pigs, Vietnam, and more the story feels gripping and is littered with iconic characters. Not to mention an all time twist.

Zombies: Zombies started in cod WAW but they really came into their own in the original black ops. Coming with 2 base maps and a bonus side mode even with no dlc you're in for a fun experience. With all the dlc black ops 1 is the best zombies experience the franchise has ever had. Call of the Dead being a personal favorite and the standout map.

Multiplayer: Being more than a decade old the multiplayer player base is less than ideal. Fortunately, there is the combat training mode which allows you to progress through first prestige as you would in online. The bots aren't too smart, and the only modes are tdm and ffa but it is still fun enough to relive the old multiplayer if you don't want to venture into a active server.

The Price: Activision's business practices are frankly disgusting. The fact a game released in 2010 is STILL $40 is insane. I bought it 50% off and still feel... violated.",1670398088,1670398088,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Black Ops was a pretty fun change of pace for the CoD series and the shift in tone was well-executed. There's a lot of intrigue to be had surrounding Cold War/Kennedy era Americana, and this game really digs in. There's definitely a lot of cringey ""tough guy"" dialogue that feels like it was written by teenagers, but that's probably to be expected from most modern military shooters.

I'd say the game is worth picking up, though please don't pay the full $40, that's an absurd ask for a game this dated. Also bear in mind a hefty caveat with that recommendation - and I'm finding this to be true for most of the CoD games developed by Treyarch as opposed to Infinity Ward - the quality of gameplay is just, substantially lower than other titles in the series. Guns feel less satisfying, movement can be floaty and weird, a lot of character animations look bad, the whole game just feels strangely cheap. That said, it's definitely a classic, has a lot of memorable set pieces, and can still be enjoyed in 2022 if you don't look too closely.",1669144564,1669144564,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The screen transitions to showing Kennedy in black and white, sitting at a table with Fidel Castro.

John F. Kennedy: I said, 'are certain to miss the future'!

Fidel Castro: [laughs] Coño... I missed that.

Robert McNamara walks into the room towards Castro.

Robert McNamara: Prime Minister Castro, this missile crisis was the last straw. We almost blew ourselves up. Now we invited you here today...

John F. Kennedy: In good faith!

Robert McNamara: ... in good faith, to sort this thing out.

Robert walks back towards John F. Kennedy.

Fidel Castro: (pointing at Nixon) And why is he here? He lost!

Nixon is shown sitting left of them at the table, annoyed at Castro's remark.

John F. Kennedy: As I always say, forgive your enemies, but remember their names. Now gentlemen, as I like to think, in the long history of the world, that there are only a few generations...

Richard Nixon: (looking frantic and ducking) Sounds like someone breaking in...

John F. Kennedy: Just the storm, Dick. Sit down.

Zombies appear smashing a window on the other side of it, making noises and breaking through.

Richard Nixon: Oh my God!

Robert McNamara: It appears the Pentagon has been breached.

John F. Kennedy: Zombies. Gentlemen, at times like these our capacity to retaliate must be and has to be massive, to deter all forms of aggression.

Kennedy walks over to the wall behind him and hits a button, which makes the wall flip around to show an armory of weapons.

John F. Kennedy: Gentlemen, lock and load!

The screen turns black.

Fidel Castro: Viva la Revolution.

Screen then shows the four of them coming out of the armory. (Left to right) McNamara with a Stakeout with Grip, Kennedy with a China Lake, Castro with a Bowie Knife and a Python and Nixon with two HS-10s.

Robert McNamera: Any last words, Mr. President?

Richard Nixon: Yes Jack, any superlative words of inspiration for your humble troops?

Morbius is a fantasy-action film set in modern times, which is based off of Morbius, the Living Vampire, made by Roy Thomas and Gil Kane from the Marvel Comics. The film was directed by Daniel Espinosa and had Jared Leto as Dr. Michael Morbius. The film is about a successful doctor who has cured many diseases, except for the disease he and his friend Milo have. Fortunately, he has found a cure for the disease, with the drawback being that he turns into a vampire and needs to consume blood to survive. For Morbius, this is a problem since he doesn’t want people to get hurt, however Milo sees it differently, and takes the cure to become a vampire. Because of this, the two of the friends soon become enemies. The film was very beautiful and there was a lot of impressive cinematography. The voice acting by all of the actors was perfect. My favourite part of the movie was when Morbius said “It’s Morbin’ time”.

On my 16th Morbius viewing I saw a child (beta male) leave because they thought the movie was too scary. I had to interrupt my own Morbius experience to follow the child into the parking lot and beat the child and his mother almost to death. I am currently waiting to watch Morbius again, and hope that no morb-haters interrupt me this time.

During the German occupation, the sound of his violin filled the air with magnificent music - Korsakov, Stasov - many of the great nationalist composers. To my countrymen, it was a symbol of hope. To the Germans, it was a symbol of defiance. Even now, his music still haunts me. The Nazis slit his throat while he slept. Collaborating with any Nazi is a betrayal, a betrayal against all of Mother Russia. Dragovich and Kravchenko were not troubled by such matters. They looked only to advance towards their own interests and agendas...""
""The men and I had fought through the most bitter of winters on the Eastern Front - We were no strangers to the cold... Even now, the blood in my veins chills when I think back to the events of that day... Far, far from home...""
""As long as Mother Russia has enemies, I will answer her call...""
""When the German occupation began, he and his lap dog Kravchenko left my men and I hopelessly outnumbered... Promises of reinforcements were made. Made... But not kept. Dragovich and Kravchenko are oppurtunists... Manipulators... They are not to be trusted, Dimitri.""
""Dimitri Petrenko was one of the bravest men I had ever known. He fought by my side from the siege of Stalingrad to the fall of Berlin. The wounds he sustained ensuring our victory should have earned him a hero's welcome to Russia... But Stalin had little need for heroes.""
""We have found what we're looking for... Nova 6. The German weapon of mass destruction now belong to Mother Russia. Or so it seemed. Our victory was to be short lived. Dragovich wanted to see the effects of the poison first hand. It was also a opportunity to remove a thorn in his side. I had long known of their distrust. What kind of men they were. It was a betrayal I should have forseen.""
""Dimitri Petrenko was a hero... He deserved a hero's death. Instead of giving his life for the glory of the motherland, he died for nothing... like an animal. He should have died in Berlin...""
""As I watched my closest friend die, it became clear we were not the only one's seeking the German weapon. The Western allies circled like vultures... Of course, Dragovich, Kravchenko and Steiner scattered like rats - leaving me to contend with the British.""
""Mason listen to me. We are running of the time my friend...Can you trust your leaders to destroy it... or you think they will use it? The flag may be different but the methods are the same. They will use you, as they used me...You must decide... decide what do you think is worth fighting for... Dragovich... Kravchenko... Steiner... These...

When I revisited Black Ops, I found a multitude of immersion-breaking glitches, alongside with gameplay on auto pilot, unfair deaths and oversimplified AI; play the Campaign on Veteran and you'll see what I mean. Whilst MW2 has some of these issues to some degree, I didn't find them as immersion-breaking as BO1 and World at War. 

I love linear games when they're done right, but when they're being dominated by unskippable cutscenes, broken AI and pointlessly automated set pieces that the game tricks you into thinking you have control over, is where I start to have a few gripes over.

And of course, Zombies. Yes, probably the best version of zombies COD has to offer, back when they weren't watered down and over-saturated with pointless features. Still not as scary as their debut at World at War, but still very fun. The problem is, CoD zombies can be summed up as a very brief sandbox experience, that feels really empty and pointless when you've seen it all. So when you have unlocked every door, power up and get the weapons you want - that's it, you've basically finished this mode until you run out of auto revives and/or get trapped into a corner.

Que vaut cette version PC, bah mon avis à très peu changé, le jeu reste très moyen mais franchement il est à la limite d'être franchement pas foufou.
Laissez de côté la nostalgie de côté et notez le jeu objectivement, parce que y'a des choses que vous laissez passer alors que c'est clairement mauvais. Bref, je m'égare, passons au vif du sujet.

Je vais déjà commencer par les points positifs du jeu et puis ensuite j'enchaînerais bien évidemment sur les aspects négatifs du jeu.

Déjà en point positif, ça ne change absolument pas, c'est la Campagne donc le Solo. J'ai toujours adoré la Campagne de BO1, le côté Psychologique et le côté horreur tout de même de la Guerre (même si World at War lui sur le côté horreur et la violence de la Guerre est indétrônable), est vachement bon. Le personnage d'Alex Mason est franchement intéressant de même que ses coéquipiers notamment Frank Woods. Y'a énormément de missions cultes sur le jeu, la Mission en Arctique ou on incarne Reznov (il est de retour bien entendu) est toujours excellente, les Missions aux Viet Nâm et aux Laos sont incroyables, la Mission à Vorkouta est elle aussi sensationnelle...Bref, vous l'aurez compris, rien à dire vis à vis de la campagne, elle est toujours incroyable et fait partie selon moi des meilleures Campagne de la Série, les Renseignements aussi que vous pouvez ramasser sont intéressants également à faire car ceux-ci vous pourrez les lires au Menu Principal et cela vous apportera des informations intéressantes sur le Scénario et puis également évoquera énormément des faits réels sur ce qu'il s'est passé sur différents conflits durant La Guerre Froide (Viet Nâm, Laos...).

La Bande Son, donc l'ambiance globale du jeu, le bruits des armes, explosion etc et puis évidemment les Musiques, il me semble que c'est le même Compositeur que celui de World at War soit Sean Murray il me semble et rien à redire, les Musiques sont franchement excellentes (mention spéciale à une Mission en particulier qui reprends des Musiques de World at War).

Le gameplay en général est agréable, on connait, c'est classique et c'est du Call of Duty (à une exception près mais j'en reparlerais plus tard) moi qui adore le gameplay d'MW3 (car assez lent) et bien BO1 c'est exactement pareil, j'ai même l'impression que le gameplay de BO1 est plus rapide que celui d'MW3.

Le recul des armes, alors ça, c'est un très bon point, j'avoue avoir oublié que la majorité des armes ont un recul vachement important, surtout lorsque vous plombez avec, les armes de BO1 donc un jeu sortit en 2010 ont quand même plus d'impact que celles de Vanguard ou de Cold War qui eux sont sortis en 2020 et 2021, c'est ridicule. 
Les armes ont principalement un recul horizontal lorsque vous plombez avec les armes.


Je vais pouvoir vous parlez désormais des points négatifs du jeu.


Le Multijoueur est de base à mon sens très moyen (malgré effectivement de bons points comme les maps (sauf certaines franchement à chier comme: Cracked, Crisis, Array et Radiation), les Explosifs au moins ne sont pas efficaces si vous avez l'Atout Gilet Pare Balles (ce qui est excellent), le Multi est plutôt bien équilibré (sauf évidemment quelques armes broken (notamment la Commando et la Galil) mais sincèrement, le Multi est injouable en tout cas sur PC, on tombe que contre des Prestiges Max qui TryHard et qui jouent évidemment avec leurs Méta (sans parler des rats qui cheats avec leurs magnifiques Back-Track où tu peux rien faire en duel évidemment) et puis les Serveurs en général sont vraiment pas dingues du tout.
Les Streaks sont quand même broken et assez simple à avoir (BlackBird, Huey (Mitrailleur d'Hélico), Hind, Chiens, Hélico de Combat (vous pilotez un Hind et vous pouvez tirer avec vos Mitrailleuses Gatling et vos Roquettes).

Je suis désolé mais, le Zombies de BO1 est franchement pas terrible (je précise que j'adore le Zombies et que j'y joue depuis World at War et que j'ai fais les Secrets de toutes les maps de BO3 et celles de BO4 y compris aussi quelques unes de BO2 donc je suis légitime pour critiquer le Zombies), enlevez la Nostalgie de côté et soyez objectif, sans parler des maps qui sont moyennes voire dégeulasses (mention spéciale à Moon qui est UNE des pires maps de l'Histoire)
 J'ai évoqué le Gameplay en point positif ci dessus mais le Gameplay en Zombies n'est pas adapté je trouve, il est beaucoup trop lent pour un mode Zombies, sans parler du problème majeure qui fait que je ne comprends pas pourquoi le Zombies de BO1 est acclamé par les Hardcore Gamers, les Doubles Claques des Zombies sont tout bonnement insupportable, tu ne peux absolument rien faire, et ce dès la Manche 1. Sur World at War il y'avait le problème des Zombies ""qui t'aspiraient"" quand on leur mettait un coup de couteau, mais tu pouvais contrer ceci en reculant et en mettant un coup de couteau ce qui empêchait le coup de couteau Commando (ce qui provoquait le ""Zombies qui t'aspirais""), mais là sur BO1, de base tu as l'effet Commando lors de ton coup de Couteau donc tu ne peux pas mettre un coup de couteau en reculant, ce qui par conséquent empêche de contrer les Doubles Claques, et pardonnez moi mais ça nique complètement le Zombies de BO1 selon moi.
Pour ceux qui l'auraient pas compris, je reproche principalement au Zombies de BO1 de désavantager en permanence le joueur (ce qui est franchement à chier car le Zombies de BO1 est UN des plus difficiles de la Licence pas parce que tu dois le maîtriser, mais parce que le jeu te désavantage en permanence et avantage les Zombies ce qui est l'inverse de BO3 ou de BO4 par exemple qui eux justement te demandes de maîtriser la Map et les Mécaniques du jeu global)
  Sans parler aussi des armes de BO1 (tout comme celles de BO2) qui ne font aucun dégâts même quand tu les améliores, RPK Améliorée ou HK-21 Améliorée ne servent plus à rien à partir des Manches 16-17 donc les Zombies sont des Sacs à PV, y'a réellement que quelques armes ultra efficaces comme le Thundergun (donc Wonder Weapon), le Laser dans mes souvenirs est le dernier CoD ou il est efficace, la Commando ainsi que la Galil sont très efficace aussi.
C'est selon moi UN des pires Zombies de chez Treyarch (oublions Vanguard lui est à part, le Zombies de BO1 est cependant évidemment moins dégeulasse que celui de BO2, mais BO3 et BO4 sont les meilleurs et de très loin)

Dernier point négatif et c'est UN des plus importants, c'est l'optimisation, elle est franchement calamiteuse, déjà que le jeu même sur PC est moche (les effets et la DA passe bien), j'ai dû désactiver les Ombres et dégager l'Anti-Aliasing ainsi que l'Anticrénelage tellement je perdais d'FPS (même en bloquant mes FPS à 60 j'ai parfois des chutes d'FPS). 
Le jeu souffre de bug dans la Campagne Solo, dans 2 Missions vous aurez un QTE ou vous devrez appuyer sur une touche rapidement pour que le Script fonctionne, ouais, bah ça fonctionne pas, il faudra appuyer ""rapidement"" sur: Clique Gauche + Clique Droit + F (ou c'est E, je m'en souviens pas), remercions l'optimisation une fois de plus.

Pour conclure, je n'ai jamais compris l'admiration des joueurs vis à vis de Black Ops, enfin si, c'est la Nostalgie, mais le jeu est très loin d'être un chef d'oeuvre, je vais être cash, je lui mets un 11/20, c'est la Campagne qui sauve entièrement le jeu d'être mauvais, alors oui, ça risque de choquer les Hardcore Gamers qui manquent d'objectivité sur BO1 mais bon c'est pas grave. 
Le jeu vaut 40 € et 20 € en Promo (je l'ai acheté en Promo), bah franchement évitez le, je le déconseille fortement (en tout cas tant qu'il sera pas en dessous de 10€).

11/20.

First off it’s server based and the only “normal” game mode available is strictly nuketown TDM, the rest of the game modes are either modded, crouch only, hardcore with strict admins who can ban you for any reason and not to mention dead. No official matchmaking for zombies to meet new people so you have to play with people only on your friends list. If you want this game you might as well just buy it for ps3 or Xbox because it’s 1 cheaper (you can get black ops 1 and 2 for ps3 for like 10$), 2 has a bigger community and has more modes available (including search and destroy). 3 zombies has an official matchmaking so you don’t have to invite friends only.
But don’t get me wrong this is a fun game and worth getting if you have a console. Multiplayer is fun, zombies is fun and the campaign is fun I honestly can’t complain about the game itself.

I gotta say, I love strolling down memory lane, this game is my memory of how I started playing the COD franchise for the first time. I loved playing the Campaign, Multiplayer, and Zombie modes. All three were a dream come true when I finally played with others like me who kept continuing to play this game. The Campaign Story will always be great to me, the Multiplayer mode would always be one of the best modes added with the weapons that I loved using. And finally for the Zombie mode, one of my dearest and favorite COD Game Modes, I have to say that it always takes me back when I would play with others online and remember the challenges of how many rounds just one person or more people can do. if you are new to the COD Franchise, this would be the game to help new comers play as they will, I will always love this game and I will never let my memory of this game fade away anymore.",1662192592,1662192592,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Campaign Review [LIGHT SPOILERS BELOW]

Just played the campaign for the first time. Wow. What a movie. I've previously played CoD 2 and the Modern Warfare trilogy, and this was simply wow. It may not be as fair of a comparison since I've played the other games to death and this is new, but I think this might be the best movie campaign they've released thus far. CoD 4 had a great story, but it was still half-rooted in the military shooter niche of its predecessor (that Medal of Honor heritage), so it was lacking in unique set pieces (probably had a smaller budget too). MW2 had fantastic action movie moments and some of the best set pieces, but the writing connecting things was pretty weak, full of holes. MW3 was not that original; it had a satisfying conclusion but felt more like a ""best hits"" album of moments from the first two games.

Black Ops has the complete package: a brilliant plot featuring a mind-bending, chilling story, great direction, fantastic acting, a protagonist who finally speaks (that's a first for this series!), good soundtrack, and it's got great exotic locations. Most prominently featured is 'nam, which was one of the key draws of the game for me, and it definitely lives up to my expectations. Those moments are awesome, but there's plenty of variety in level design from Soviet bases in the freezing tundra to a prison riot escape in the desert.

I really like some of the new guns too like the explosive crossbow bolt which is pretty f***ing awesome, and some scenes felt inspired by Terminator 2 and Commando, which brought a huge grin to my face. In fact, that was a feeling I had a lot playing through this delight of a game/movie. What I love about this entry is that any trappings of the once purely military shooter game have been shed, and the creative team had the freedom to really just make whatever movie they wanted, and they did a wonderful job at that. They don't feel constrained to follow the typical, cliche Call of Duty script (although that's not to say moments don't exist that vaguely mirror their counterparts in the other CoD games).

The graphics are so gorgeously realistic too that never once did I feel I was playing a game trying to be a movie; I was just in the movie, as if I was in the theaters. When they played an FMV at the end, I could tell that was a real human woman, but otherwise it looked identical to the game's cutscenes. It's that good. There's impeccable attention to detail from the insects and rats crawling inside VC tunnels to the sound design intentionally muffling bullet fire when you're wearing a hazmat suit, mimicking what it would sound like in real life.

I can't ignore the lovely inclusion of a Rolling Stones song either, Sympathy for the Devil, though fear not, Fortunate Son still makes its obligatory appearance too.

All in all, an awesome campaign, arguably the best Call of Duty one so far, and one I thoroughly enjoyed.

My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.",1661342499,1661342499,True,7,1,0.385344743728637695,0,True,False,False

doing all cods on veteran in order. Honestly, this was a very poor experience on veteran. Many areas where you would be stuck on objects or where there was infinite spawning enemies again (which werent around for the past few games). Dont even get me started on the jeep turret section on the second last level. While the story is excellent and this game is worth it for custom lobbies and zombies, this shit on veteran was the worst experience yet. And no its not the hardest, i mean in terms of quality. You will die in sections with no real say or control as you can die before even going around a corner, i think its a physique issue tbh. At least the timed sections were pretty easy but this makes me worried to do BO2 since i had little fun here. Some areas felt like it had poor lighting as well, it was struggle to see some shots.

Tips:
- On the turret section on the second last level spam the grenade launcher function and pick a god.
- Some checkpoint areas wont hit until you die and re-do an area.
- Snipe with the helicopter.
- Run up and retreat to make allies advance, but dont TRUST BO1 allies to even clear sections right next to them
- Try to stay back and minimise enemies of infinite reinforcements before moving up and then retreating.
- Have a rocket launcher on backup when possible, one gun with a scope or decent aim is all you ever need
- Dont buy if not on sale

Thoughts:
- This re-run ruined how i viewed this game, nostalgia is crazy
- Still a really good story, not as good as MW1-2 but kid me did love it.
- Was so upset with the campaign i deleted before reliving zombies, gotta go back to do that.
- Resnov goated
- Woods goated, although he was less cool than i thought as a kid < Price
- Hudson always seemed like a loser and boring to me, and thats without his BO2 actions.
- Is weaver even in BO2? i forget. Bowman didnt get to see Mason insane, good on him.
- Ranked third in terms of easiest game, ranked last in terms of gameplay quality.

42700,119727433,76561197970659675,0,72,610,0,610,1659133070,"I am only reviewing the single player campaign. I am not reviewing any multiplayer component of the game which I played 12 years ago or whenever this game originally came out on XBOX 360. They were good then. I don't know what they're like now. So, if somehow you don't know about this game or want to know what multiplayer is like now, don't read this for that information.

I recently randomly decided to play this again. I never played this on PC, but I finished it when it came out originally (what, in 2010?) on XBOX 360.
I mainly just wanted wanted to write this because of two (maybe three) reasons. One I was playing the original Modern Warfare games before, all of which are middle of the road and not particularly great single player campaigns, but their fine first person shooters. Most people play them for multiplayer which is not something I am big on and I'm not interested in playing a dumb pretend military shooter where kids cuss at each other and talk about how realistic it is. It's not. It's Hollywood's version of war. It's pretty dramatic and unrealistic.
Anyway, the other reason is that all of the original Modern Warfare games have pretty middle of the road and simplistic stories with particularly competent shooting mechanics that they don't entirely let you use because most of those single player campaigns are mainly just shooting galleries with QTEs. They also, all three of them, crash my computer causing it to reboot at a certain point in the campaign. All three of those games still cause this. They're really poorly made games that made millions. It's quite shocking they're so popular since they're so badly programmed, but I have my own theories as to their popularity. That's a different discussion, though.
So, I remembered liking this one, but I was curious if it still holds up. Maybe it's not as good as I remembered. Maybe it has more QTEs and less game play then I recalled? I played all the original Modern Warfare games and it just made me question whether this one was actually as good as I remembered it being because those don't really let you play all that much.
Well, I can confirm this game still holds up very well. It's very cinematic, yes, but the missions you go on are well done and feel strategic in play. They don't just feel like shooting galleries, like other Modern Warfare games, and the story is probably too interesting for the game that's being made by a mega-corporation that only cares about profits that get funneled into Bobby Kotick's mouth. It's still a really fun story that makes sense for the era it's set in. This game will go down, at least for me, in a sadly growing list of phenomenally written story driven military game campaigns that no one will remember in 10-20 years.
The mechanics are good in all Modern Warfare games, but they are good in this as well. So, there's that.
I remember finding this game to be a really fun, exciting, story based experience when I originally played it so I am happy to find that that fact still remains and I would STILL highly recommend the single player campaign for this game. It is STILL the only modern warfare game I have played with a single player campaign that I think is any good and worth replaying.

That being said I do recommend waiting for a sale. Not because it wasn't worth full price originally even, but because the game has been out for over 10 years. They DO put their games on deep sale when there are steam sales so I do recommend waiting for one before you buy any Activision game. You could probably get this for 10$ maybe. I don't know exactly- I bought all the Modern Warfare games years ago now on a sale where they were all really cheap and I have been slowly playing the ones I have no interest in and also next I want to play the next Black Ops because I never played that.

So, anyway, this game is still great, and still looks great at 1080p, but it is old so just wait for a sale and buy it then. The single player game is still very good and worth playing.",1659134790,1659134790,True,1,0,0.512524068355560303,0,True,False,False

Chapter One: Campaign.
The black ops campaign is one of the best I've ever played talking story. Amazing writing, great characters, and you don't need to play the previous game to understand. (But I do recommend playing World at War because its also a great campaign)  For gameplay, its very fun but don't expect something revolutionary, It's fun but its not the greatest gameplay ever.

Chapter Two: Multiplayer
Plain and simple, its completely dead. Even if some people are still playing I don't recommend playing because of security risks. If you really wan't to play it there are community made server browsers to help with that. Other than that its good and fun but not really SUPER amazing.

Chapter Three: Zombies
Ok ok, before I get into this I will admit I have a huge bias because I LOVE Call of Duty: Zombies. But Black Ops Zombies is great, it's a lot of fun, more polished and less buggy than World at War. The maps include classics like Kino Der Toten, fend off the undead in an abandoned WW2 theatre turned Nazi facility and a great beginner map. Five, Play as Kennedy, Nixon, MacNamara, or Castro and kill hordes of zombies in the pentagon. (We are now getting into DLC maps so they aren't free) DLC: Escalation, Call of the Dead. Fight more hordes in Sibera as Micheal Rooker, Danny Trejo, Sarah Michelle Gellar or Robert Englund and fight an undead George Romero. (and he is like a boss zombie with LOTS of health so don't even try fighting him and don't damage him at all, trust me.) DLC: First strike, Ascension. Kill zombies in a russian cosmodrone overrun by the undead. TIP: at around round 9 or 10 monkeys will spawn and steal your perks, don't let them get the perk machines! DLC: Annihilation, Shangri-La. Place unknown, the undead have overrun this mythical city with origins unknown, try to survive as long as you can! TIP: when buying doors, certain areas might be booby trapped. Monkeys are also present on this map. DLC: Rezzurection, Moon. That's right, zombies on the moon. Find an old abandoned station on the moon, riddled with zombies. Find the power and survive for as long as you can. TIP: Certain portions of the map will be excavated at certain times after turning the power on. It won't remove it, it will just block your path. This DLC also comes with all of the previous zombies maps. Nacht Der Untoten: Survive in an WW2 bunker on an abandoned airfield. Verruckt: WW2 German insane asylum with sick experiments done in the facility. (Probably the scariest map in zombies) Shi-No-Numa: WW2 Japenese facility. Swampy outside, and random perk locations. Der Riese: The facility where it all began, first map to have an option to upgrade your guns for 5,000 points. Link the teleporters to the mainframe to unlock it.

Conclusion:
Campaign: 8/10, it's very much worth your time.
Multiplayer: 1/10, great multiplayer, but it’s mostly dead. There are modded server browsers which makes it playable, but do not play the steam version, if you do it’s a big security risk.
Zombies: 9/10. amazing zombies, not the best, not perfect, but its an amazing time. It's lots of fun with co-op but just as much in solo.",1658299244,1658354104,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

This campaign is... awful

The story makes 0 sense, it just throws you around all over the place facing a bunch of evil russians. The missions sometimes are so scripted it's like playing a rail shooter. It feels like playing one of those old arcade games, I just use a mouse and keyboard instead of a light gun. The game gives you basically unlimited ammo, just aim, hold down the left mouse button and never let go.

This game has no tactics whatsoever, just run around and shoot everything that moves. The enemies are absolutely brain dead and the difficulty only comes to the fact that the game showers you in enemies. Wave after wave.

There's a few scripted story elements I like, but these are very few. Reznovs ""flashback"" was very fun since it reminded me of CoD World at War which is a game I like. The prison scene in the beginning is also very good.

Then comes the Hong Kong mission which is the low point of the game, absolutely atrocious. Just shoot, shoot, shoot because? I have no friggin idea. The Vietnam stuff is also mind boggingly dumb and rips off both Apocalypse Now and Deer Hunter. Complete with Fortunate Son playing in the speakers in an almost ironic way. Because that makes it authentic right? I was bursting out laughing all the time.

The game has tons of weapons, of course to practice for the Multiplayer part, but come on... an AK47 with a flamethrower? ARE YOU HIGH?! It also seems that they add way too modern weapons sometimes for 1968 or whenever the hell this game is suppose to take place. Homing rocket launchers? I don't think so.

The big plot twist could be seen from a mile away, but it doesn't matter. What matters is the awful, horrendous story telling. It's like playing a game made by 10 different teams which were stitched together in an ugly tapestry from hell. Nothing feels cohesive and the characters are so enormously gung ho one dimensional bland. ""THE NUMBERS MASON!!!"" ugh...

Awful, awful, awful

I'm generally open minded about stories / plots etc.  but after revisiting this game,  I really just cannot get behind it and admittedly only finished it because of friends' nostalgia;  They constantly hyped up this game but I just don't see it.

I had this game at launch back in the day, but didn't remember much... now I realize why.   Overall just pretty bland, and it feels all over the place.   Obviously the plot follows a character trying to remember, which should be disorienting,  but it really don't work in gameplay..  not this execution anyway.   Looking at the game generally hurts my eyes,  tons of bright white lights which suck during night time play and cut scenes that will most definitely send you to the ER if you have the slightest epilepsy.    You can call me daft if you wish,  but the story is just tough to follow at times.

I didn't play the multiplayer, so I cannot comment on that.    Dead Ops Arcade is fun, and the Zork inclusion is a nice touch, but Zombies is pretty bland without emptying your wallet for DLC.   Like the game, the DLC rarely goes down in price on PC... too expensive now for old content.

Great game overall one of my favourite COD games. However. don't pay full price its a 12 year old game with a decent amount of bugs. The bugs can be avoided but are annoying. The zombies mode is fantastic but the prices for the DLC is outrageous. You will be playing the game solo as it is pretty dead. The campaign is unbelievable and IMO call of dutys best. The online multiplayer is dead. In conclusion, buy expecting to play solo. Still a fantastic game despite its age and lack of support.

This was my first call of duty. But probably my last.

Maybe i am biased based on my depression, experience, or favorite type of game, but i found this pretty boring.

I didnt even want to finish the game. I played the whole campaign on hard but yikes. The only challenge was figuring out what to do. I do not mean in a fun mystery game type of way, no as in the game is not thought through enough for it to be clear what the objective is.

Probably no one will even read my review, so ill just stop it here haha.",1656733042,1656733042,False,0,2,0.40625,2,True,False,False

I first fired up multiplayer though and came to the conclusion that there was only one full lobby with over 100 ping (server located in America, I'm from Europe). Also I wanted to play with ps4 controller, to make it feel a bit more like it used to on the ps3, but the controls just feel so different (even when you finally map them correctly). From there I accepted that multiplayer wouldnt be my cup of tea and so I moved on to zombies. When u fire up zombies, the controller stops working completely. I couldnt figure out how to fix it, so I can't split screen with my friends like back in the day. There was one online zombies game that I managed to join (I always felt like playing alone is less fun), but again it does not feel like it used to on the ps3. So my advice is: Only buy this in sale if you only want to play zombies or campaign (with a different feel to it than console). Do not expect a perfect online experience or the possibility to easily play local with friends (which is what I and many others were enjoying years ago). This game is dead, and imo is worth max 5eu for the zombies/campaign experience. Very sad to see this is what's left of one of my favorite games ever.",1656600373,1656600373,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

A couple of weird, if minor, borks though:

(1) In the 9th mission, ""Victor Charlie"", there's a whole segment that takes place in a dark tunnel. In this bit, all the NPCs are all in negative (as in, colour reversed, black to white and white to black). Weird.

(2) The game, the NPCs and objects in it, all seem ridiculously quick! At least on my system, which is only an i5-3570 with a GTX1060 6Gb gpu. I don't mind, but if I didn't already have an idea what was coming, having played the game before, I might find it really difficult. 

Also, there's a few amusing, minor artefacts here and there. At one point, during the mission 5 ""S.O.G"", I'm inside a building on the ground floor, and a Huey flew into the room, pushed me out of the way, then out again straight through a wall without damaging anything.

To me, it's as good as it gets. It was originally supposed to be in World at War but it was cut due to time constraints. Thankfully, Treyarch was able to finish it up, polish it up, and release it with Black Ops, cause it was good. Really good. So many iconic weapons. Layout was a perfect blend of simple and complex and the enemies were all unique and fun to fight.

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar

4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes.

When you purchase this game, there are three modes to play: campaign, multiplayer, and zombies. The campaign has a great story line set during the Cold War era when tensions between the Soviet Union and the United States were at an all-time high. This campaign is the predecessor to Call of Duty: Black Ops 2 sharing a similar story line. If you do finish the campaign and enjoy it, there is a probable chance you will try the successor game if you don't yet own it. Multiplayer still has an active player base but may vary depending on region and time zones. There are occasional cheaters on some servers, but they banned whenever an admin joins. Zombies is an enjoyable experience whether you have the D.L.C maps or not. You may have a difficult time finding other players to join your lobby, but it varies on your region and timing. Overall, the game still holds up more than a decade later as shown in the active player base. I would recommend to anyone considering the purchase of this game to wait until a sale period for the price to drop or the Black Ops bundle to decrease in price. The current price is a cash grab by Activision like they do to other nostalgic, popular games. To date, this is the best Call of Duty title and that is not an opinion, but a fact.",1653945835,1653945835,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

          To be honest, I find it rather difficult to + or - this game for it has major ups and downs. The Multiplayer appears sustained at the moment as there is a server browser. I found the Single Player campaign to be interesting. But Zombies, the selling point (to me) is undernourished as the player base even reaches flatline 0 at times, but with friends it has the ability to prove very fun. The game is obviously not worth its current price of $39.99 and should be a $19.99 as it is aged and slightly underoptimized. The DLC, I feel is overpriced as well ($14.99) but Treyarch will be Treyarch and Activision will be Activision, to my dissapointment.

EDIT: There is a server browser as previously stated, yes. However, the Multiplayer GAMEPLAY is significantly unoptimized. The slightest of detail costs 10 frames.",1425962205,1652781319,False,10,2,0.497470200061798096,1,True,False,False

Edit: 
How to set fov (Single Player Only)
1. Find file path to game through steam.
2. Open Players folder
3. Open config file using a text/code editor (notepad, notepad++, VS)
4. Add,  bind U ""cg_fov 90"" , inside the file, U can be replaced for another key.
5. Once in game (single player), press the bound key and your fov should change. 
6. Resetting the fov can be done by either restarting the game, or by creating an additional keybind within the config file that sets the fov to default. 

Edit:
Never played the WAW remastered zombie maps until now in 2022. 
I much prefer the feel of Black Ops 1 Der Reise compared to World At War.
I am strangely more accurate... I suspect I'm just more used to the feel of bo1/bo2.
Quick revive self revive works on solo mode in the WAW remastered maps. Nice!

Controller support was not included in the PC build of the game. A controller can be used, but without aim assist. This reason alone gives me the urge to play the game on a console for nostalgia reasons. However, I am so acclimated to the PC luxuries that I resist myself. High fps, low machine noise, ability to edit files, and multitask on other programs keeps me playing on PC.

Edit 2:
Use this video to install custom zombies maps :
 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hOLnKXYecE&ab_channel=DestinationGaming
I didn't like Kowloon, no immediate wall gun buys. I really like Battery, custom UI, new assets, wall gun buys close to beginning area.

Edit 2: 
For mutliplayer, there are no dedicated servers.
Matchmaking is done through public community servers. 
My rank was reset after grinding out to about level 20 on a handful of servers. 
I suspect this has to do with my game key and when I bought the game but I have no evidence to confirm this.
I have not figured out how to get maxrank/all unlocks as the most popular of those exploits was done through dedicated multiplayer servers and theater mode. 
The multiplayer is fun if you enjoy using the default classes or pick up other players that had not been reset guns.

T5M:
T5M as of the last time I played was inactive. 

I tried playing on my playstation 3, only found 1 game with high ping, couldn't stand the low textures and loud spinning fan of my console. 

Edit 3: 
Can't run game on mac OS, will not run 32 bit games

Edit 4: 
I got out my old xbox 360, purchased gold and signed into the multiplayer section of the game.
I only had 0d 2h 26m 14s combat record time played. Was max rank due to theater mode. I had only really played the game on ps3. Found some classes I made but they were pretty insignificant, nothing in my theater either. BO1 felt unfamiliar playing on xbox 360. I could not find a mutiplayer game on xbox live. 

Edit 5:
I finally got my old PSN account I used to play Black Ops 1 on back in my hands. When I logged in to BO1, I saw my profile for the first time in many years. I had done the theater mode process of getting max rank. 

Unfortunately because of that I do not know what my true level and true class unlocks were before. 
They are lost to time. 

My combat record remained untouched. With a astonishing 4d 16h 47s play time. 
There are 6 films in my theater mode, that I need to have recorded. Though I must purchase another device to bypass HDCP on the PS3 to do so.",1636865819,1650403147,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I am 48.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiralling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you.",1650043270,1650043270,True,1,1,0.47826087474822998,0,True,False,False

Just disappointed that I bought this with discount and finished it in 5.5 hours and it was 19.99 xD
So Its like 4 euros per 1 hour of fun. A bit too much for game made in 2010 to pay in 2022... But game didnt feel too aged while I did my playthrough.

----------------------------------------
The campaign on this game was very enjoyable. Took me about 30 or so hours to complete all attainable achievements for the campaign in this game. The story is really good in my opinion for a Call of Duty series game. ""The numbers, Mason. What do they mean?"" is from this title. Was also my first Call of Duty I bought way back on the PS3. I highly recommend this game for campaign. 

[Multiplayer]
----------------------------------------
Multiplayer I have not really got an opinion on. Servers are still around but I don't have enough playtime to really judge it. Though from the little I've played it's enjoyable still.

[Zombies] 
----------------------------------------
Zombies is pretty great on this game, though barebones in comparison to the newer titles. You get Kino der Toten and Five from the base game. Kino being the more casual map and Five being the more ""pro"" map. Want a casual game of Zombies? Hop on Kino. Want more of a challenge? Hop on Five. Watch out for the pentagon thief though!

If you take the time to actually look at some papers and even the weapons, you can actually see more detailed writing compared to the Console versions... and even more detail compared to PC CoD games made by Infinity Ward, yes really Black Ops 1 a game from 2010 has more detail than even later modern warfare games like MW2 and MW3. If there's one thing I can say it's that I out of all the CoD games on steam, avoid ones made by Infinity Ward because Treyarch compared to them actually tries with the PC version of their games. Unfortunately no new CoD game will ever come to Steam, you have to go through Activisions services like EA games for example, meaning only retro CoD games are on Steam which isn't really a bad thing because most would agree CoD stopped being original and genuinely good after Black Ops II (sometimes I say Ghosts because at least the enemies were more original there too).",1646703296,1646703296,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Really, really enjoyed this campaign; it was great seeing Reznov again and meeting the new characters, but BO2 was scattered and BO3 was... well, it was definately something.

Maybe the early 2010's novelty of these games wore off for me, or perhaps I just hold the Modern Warfare series on too high of a pedastool in my mind but I was just never able to get into this series as I did with the other games.

Would I say it's worth the price? No, wait for a sale. If you're a committed CoD enjoy like myself you won't regret the purchase, again this particular instance of Black Ops was incredibly enjoyable (and the music is awesome) but the series itself isn't one to swoon over and it lacks charm, personally.

Anyway, I've had this pent up inside of me for the longest of time and I've never seen anyone really agree with me, so why not give my 2 cents?

In fact, I am willing to bet my COD collection that you spend more time watching cinematics than you do actually playing. Even when you do get in the game, there are a lot of times you are just sitting and listening to your other team members telling a story. Some missions are very brief, and just when they start getting to be really fun to play, the mission is over, and you get to watch another scene. Other than those setbacks, the single player story is really good, but there needs to be a way to skip them as in other releases.

1.	Campaign
2.	Multiplayer
3.	Zombies
The Campaign mode offers a story driven experience wherein the player assumes control of a character and proceeds to complete in game objectives. In completing these objectives, the player obtains a greater understanding of the story which culminates in a grand finale. The story is engaging, it has character depth, the first-person play (FPS) is amazing, there is a diverse selection of weapons and there are several difficulty modes which encourages replay-ability. If you are hunting for achievements, then the campaign mode offers tons of it. Upon playing the campaign I would rate it 9/10. 

The Multiplayer mode allows the player to engage in a player vs player (PVP) mode. The players are divided into two teams and each team must work together to achieve an objective. The team that completes the first objective wins the game. As of 2022, the multiplayer support is no longer offered so it is not possible to enter competitive matches. I personally, do not enjoy PVP mode in gaming. As such for me this was not the selling point of the game. Given my personal lack of engagement and no online support I would rate this as 3/10. 

The zombies mode is a player vs environment (PVE) mode. The player spawns on a map and is given the objective of surviving hordes of zombies. The progression is marked with the number of rounds survived. Each time a set number of zombie hordes is killed the player progresses to the next round. The higher the rounds, the higher the player score and kills. The mode can be player solo or in co-op. I have thoroughly enjoyed playing zombies in black ops. For me, this is the best thing about this game. It is the reason I purchased it and should the main reason for anyone buying this game in 2022 and onwards. In solo I aim for “high round runs”. Currently, my objective is to reach round 50+ in all the zombie maps. I have accomplished round 56 in Kino and round 51 in ascension. 

The zombie mode offers a hidden storyline of sorts in form of an easter egg (EE). Once an EE is completed the player(s) are awarded with in game rewards such as longer death machine or all perks for an unlimited duration. I would recommend buying all the DLCs for black ops so that the zombie maps can be unlocked. Note that some EEs cannot be completed unless all DLCs are purchased. This is a major CON for this game, as each DLC costs an additional $15-20 (depending on the country and sale). I spent in total approximately, $75 CAD on this game. For a game which is over 10 years old the price is exorbitant. However, despite this I would highly recommend purchasing the game as it provides an unparalleled experience in zombies. My favourite zombies map is Moon. The EE is really engaging and fun. I have completed the moon EE twice in co-op and achieved all 8 perks! I plan to do the same again and aim for a round 50+ run. My rating for zombie mode is 10/10.

Overall, I would say that this game is overpriced. If you are looking to play campaign and multiplayer only then DO NOT buy this game. However, if you are really itching to play zombie mode either to experience something brand new or to re-experience it again, I would say that the price is totally worth it and to DEFINTELY BUY IT. Having said that, do wait for a sale that cuts the price of game in half and DLCs by reduction of 35%. If you do not plan on buying all the DLCs, then I suggest buying just the rezzurection DLC as it offers 5 zombie maps including moon.

TLDR; buy game and DLCs for zombies when on a sale but not for campaign or multiplayer.

The campaign -

 Its short - Kind of interesting - Game play feels very guided - Strangely COD 1 and 2 didn't feel guided as much - But of course they were - But this just seems confined some how and the shooting seemed weak.
I prefer COD 2 to this but this is OK - Enjoyable story - Nice to see how it develops.

I think Activision and Treyarch really outdid themselves with this game. I'll begin with the campaign. Black Ops is one of the most fun and interesting story's that I've ever played. It's a masterpiece. The game is an amazing blend of challenge and the shooting fun you get with the Call of Duty franchise. The story was phenomenal, the game play was great, the graphics are actually really good considering the time this game came out. I remember my first play through of this campaign. It was an absolute journey, and I'm so glad I was along for the ride. Now Zombies. This game started it all for me. This was my first zombies game, and this game is what took my breath away with zombies from the moment I first played zombies when I was 9. I can't put into words how amazing Zombies is as a mode, especially in this game. I think this game was the pinnacle of zombies as a mode, and I'm so, so very happy I was able to experience it. Unfortunately the Multiplayer had already died down by the time I was playing it so I don't have anything to say about it, but from the little I've played, I think it was my favorite multiplayer behind Cold War.",1642657869,1642657869,True,0,0,0,1,True,False,False

The story of Alex Mason and the people around him is told exactly as you expect - fast, adrenaline and a little confused. With the flood of information that a mysterious man behind the glass, spewing at the electric chair at the time, it is quite difficult to keep up. Conspiracies, wars, infiltrations, betrayals and unexpected meetings and farewells. This is the story of the Black Ops in a nutshell, and it must be acknowledged that there is a fairly decent B-shirt political thriller behind a certain confusion.

The interrogated Mason has to deal with memories of all the important events he has attended in the past, and the story will enrich several episodes with the other heroes of the story in the lead role. Thanks to this, the authors were not limited by time or place of narration, so in Black Ops you will see attractive places literally all over the world. Whether you find yourself in Vietnam, Laos, Russia or Cuba, you can always be sure of a spectacular spectacle. No chamber missions take place in the Black Ops, and despite a few calmer moments, a giant skirmish will always take place like a tsunami, which will not let you breathe. After all, every breath can be your last.

Multiplayer with huge options for setting up and improving your character and weapons is saved by the average single player Black Ops. It's definitely not a bad choice for online FPS fans, but it's far from perfect. [b] 50% [/b]",1641219003,1641219003,True,20,0,0.682709455490112305,1,True,False,False

Beyond that it still holds up as a fun game! I am going through Campaign mode again on regular difficulty and it is just as fun as it was years ago when I played it!

Now keep in mind this game is outdated and old. But that's what makes it timeless. If you're looking to snag this game, go for it. Zombies Mode still holds true better than any other black-ops zombie modes.
 I mean the whole bus idea in later games was fun and exciting, but... Kino Der Toten... that is some O.G. shiz right there. You can not recreate the vibe and feeling of it. So that alone is worth the game itself!

I am 41.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.
After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

I could care less about the game's multiplayer, and this review will only take Zombies and Campaign into account (I speedrun the two modes). The Zombies mode in this game is the strongest out of any CoD Zombies game, period. It has the perfect amount of challenge and difficult to master movement and gameplay mechanics. The campaign's story is probably one of the better known ones in the CoD franchise, but I would not buy it solely for that purpose considering that a casual playthrough will take 5 - 7 hours at most. I think if you like the traditional CoD zombies mode, you'll find great enjoyment sinking hours and hours into this game, mastering each of the maps and constantly improving your best rounds on them. The gunplay in this game still feels better than most modern CoDs with their weird recoil patterns and hard-to-see-through scopes. The lack of visual clutter combined with the minimalistic screen effects and UI is also refreshing to see every time I revisit this game. My only big issue is that Activision continues to list the game at a price tag of 40$ USD, which is totally unacceptable for a game that is more than 11 years old at the time that this review goes up.",1639267186,1639273246,True,54,3,0.818169295787811279,2,True,False,False

A Legendary CoD Campaign and the Start of the Legendary Zombies Storyline. A bit aged? Sure but the story itself still holds it's own, compared to what we get today at least. It doesn't stop, over the top, dramatic, epic characters, nonstop action, epic music. Zombies in the original Black Ops still has it's charm, the original characters, quotes and weapons/perks it all hits that button for me when it comes to Zombies mode, no heavy push to go for the Easter Eggs. Call of the Dead is still my favourite zombies map. 

I won't lie, playing through the story on Veteran kicked my ass sometimes, sometimes it just seemed extremely unfair but i still got through it.",1638965821,1638965821,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

It duplicates the noise and chaos of war very well.  The yelling and explosion sound effects actually get you a bit stressed as if you are in combat.  

A few funny moments and glitches:  

- it cracks me up how the guy with the CIA consistently tells everyone he's with the CIA.  That would never happen.  He would say, ""Department of Army"" or ""State Department.""  He would N E V E R name the company in the clear.  

- I had one glitch where one Russian soldier spawned and it gave an error that said ""blah blah blah has more than 120 bones"" No kidding.  Apparently the Russian NPC spawned with too many freakin' bones.  That's how detailed this game is.  

- another glitch was one where all the dead soldiers stood up and froze.  It was like a scene from a Twilight Zone episode. They were all bloody but all of them, and I mean ALL of them were just standing up where they had died, but with their eyes open. Creepy and funny at the same time (see screenshot).

Personally, the glitches are the fun part of any game to me.  They really crack me up.  I don't mind them at all unless it causes me to have to replay a level. 

The only components of the game I don't like are the long transition screens and long dialogue scenes.  I want to get right to the action and the lengthy scenes are just plain boring to me.  I know they wanted to make it like a movie that you are participating in, but I like to jump into the action.  There are some transition scenes you can skip by holding space and some you can skip with left click.  But the scene where Reznov tells a long story is boring once you've heard it the first time.  That's the only part of the game that is irritating to me.  I like to jump into action with maybe a little bit of briefing but not long, drawn out dissertations prior to the action.  That's just me.  

It's a fun game you can play over and over.  Well worth the price to me.  I'm sure they'd still make a massive profit if they sold it for a bit less, but you know how that works. 

One final thing: if you've had a stressful day at work and need to work out some anger on NPC AI bots, just play the S.O.G. mission during the siege of Khe Sang and man the machine gun for a while before you stop the siege :)",1637120832,1637746430,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False
