Report, don't buy. Loved the heck out of this game but I can't support this. Wouldn't advise to buy the new game either as this seems like a scam tactic to make you buy the other game. 

edit: Yes, it's fixed! Now I can go back to loving the game! Also, thanks for the answer.

What is so good about this game? I really love fixing stuff up around the house, but it's a lot of work and expensive to boot. Now I can simply click a button and do exactly the same thing without the hassle, mess or costs. 
If nothing else, it's perfect to check whether you would like something in real life. Or maybe you can try out something that you would normally not think of to try just in case it's horrible. 

After all these years I left a review, because I couldn't get into the game. It made me realize how much I miss it, even though I start it up occasionally, it's always great. So, now that it's been solved, why not change it to a big fat ""yes"".

Also, it can be terrifying once you notice it. Notice what, you ask? There's nobody in the streets! You only see people on your tablet.

pros:

1: some houses also have Easter eggs or are based on TV/Movie/Anime houses which is fun in its own way.

2: missions are also replayable allowing you to either do a better job once you get better equipment/skills or want to try something different while still getting paid!

3: lots of items, different color paints to choose from

4: you can turn day/night mod off

cons:

1: no multiplayer

2:  some cleaning requirements are bugged meaning you can't 100% jobs sometimes because you can't find that last 1% dirt or garbage

3: map sometimes glitches

Pros:
-so much fun doing all the jobs
-i love that CAT POSTERS!
-you can add your own photos to the house
-easy once you know what youre doing
-lots of decorating options

Cons:
-the Cockroaches are difficult to suck up. (also theyre so nasty and they make my skin crawl. just get in the vacuum sooner please.)
-some of the items dont go where i want them. the invisible barrier is a pain.
-i get stuck on random things sometimes
-that one spec of dirt you cant find? yea, its gonna haunt you.
-the spider webs dont show up map even if you have all the perks unlocked.
-lawn mowing isnt apartment of the base game and i hate looking at the grass all unruly. so i bought the DLC.

DLC Pets Pros:
-CATSSSSSS
-i love giving the cats pets all the time when i see them.
-theyre so cute even when theyre coughing hairballs on my rug.
-you can have as many pets as your computer can handle.
-you can get a pet hotel so you can have even more pets in a separate area. (the hotel is just another house btw)
-SNAKES! <3
-CAAAAAAAATS
-did i mention cats?
-Cats <3
-all the pet stuff is sooooo cute

DLC Pets Cons:
-the cats can get stuck under chairs and then get hungry and you dont notice till you see a yellow paw on your map and you start freaking out cuz ohno your baby is suffering what do i do?! so you delete the chair and manually pick up your cat to put her infront of the food only for her to run away and you chase her all over the house but no, Pancake doesnt wanna eat even though shes hungry. so you have to buy the chair back and hope she doesnt get stuck underneath the chair again. but oh look. she does.
-i demand more cat breeds. EX: MANX

DLC Gardener Pros:
-Pretty
-love cutting the grass
-pick them weeds! hell yea. pop pop pop!
-pretty flowers and stuff
-still love cutting the grass

DLC Gardener Cons:
-you cant put the plants closer together and it looks so grid like and i dont like how they look and i want them to be closer but they cant. :{
-i get stuck on plants more often then i care to admit
-theres some weeds stuck in some objects from basegame that i you cant just buy back? unless i havent found it yet.

I press the tab button to open the tablet, and it does not open, but does effectively freeze the game. I try to put the invisible tablet away, and now wasd doesn't work, nor does any other movement. Then when trying to reopen the invisible tablet, the game tells me I can't. I then have to force close the game because esc doesn't work after trying to use the invisible tablet.

house flipper is a simulation game developed by empyrean and published by frozen district & playway. it released in 2018 for pc & 2020 for ps4, xbox one, nintendo switch, & mobile devices. it's garnered significant attention for its unique premise and addictive/satisfying gameplay, while at the same time leaving players questioning its long-term playability. you step into the shoes of a one-person renovation crew, tasked with buying, renovating, and selling properties for profit. the game blends elements of strategy, creativity, and time management, offering players a truly immersive experience in the world of home renovation. 

at its core, house flipper offers a simple yet engaging gameplay loop: acquire properties, clean and renovate them, and then sell for profit. however, the depth of customization and attention to detail elevate this seemingly straightforward concept into a rich and rewarding experience. players start small, taking on humble jobs such as cleaning up abandoned properties, fixing broken appliances, and repainting walls. as they progress, they gain access to more advanced renovation tools and can tackle larger projects, including complete home makeovers.

the game's mechanics are intuitive and easy to grasp, even for players unfamiliar with the intricacies of home renovation. the user interface is clean and well-designed, with helpful tooltips and tutorials guiding players through each step of the process. from hammering nails to installing light fixtures, every action feels satisfying and impactful, thanks to the game's semi-realistic physics engine. one of the standout features of house flipper is its extensive array of renovation options. players can choose from a wide selection of furniture, appliances, and decorations to personalize each property according to their tastes. whether you prefer a minimalist aesthetic or a cozy, rustic vibe, the game offers enough variety to cater to every design sensibility. the ability to experiment with different layouts and color schemes adds an extra layer of depth to the gameplay, encouraging players to unleash their creativity and design skills.

there's a certain satisfaction in taking a gross & dirty room and making it look nice, and it's pretty cool that you can knock down (and rebuild) walls, but i just don't find the act of slowly painting and cleaning much fun, despite my playtime potentially suggesting otherwise.",1707356337,1707356337,True,9,0,0.611785352230072021,0,True,False,False

However...
You may have to spend hours tweaking with the settings to get the best consistent performance before starting to play the actual game (including setting up specific settings in your graphics card app to ensure the game will run as smoothly as possible), regardless of your setup. This is beause your hardware may be bottlenecking without those tweaks and so you will get low FPS when you feel you should be getting more.

Its fun the original game but gets boring after awhile. A lot of the dirt can be unseen or even harder to see on the map. Wish there was a sandbox option.

The graphics have this charming nostalgic vibe, kind of like revisiting your childhood game console. It's not exactly 4K, but hey, who needs hyper-realism when you can have a cozy, pixelated atmosphere?

Now, the gameplay is the virtual equivalent of a weekend home improvement project. It's got this comforting simplicity – you pick up your virtual tools and start transforming spaces. No pressure, just a laid-back experience. Whether you're fixing leaky faucets or giving a room a fresh coat of paint, it's oddly therapeutic.

Customization is where you get to sprinkle a bit of your personality into the virtual world. Sure, the furniture options may not rival a high-end design catalog, but there's a certain charm in creating spaces with the limited choices. It's like having a conversation with your virtual home, and it says, ""Let's keep it simple and cozy.""

The clients are a quirky bunch – they're not just homeowners; they're like your virtual companions on this renovation journey. Their feedback is, well, let's say ""constructive,"" and it adds a touch of humanity to the process. You're not just fixing walls; you're making someone's virtual dream home.

The soundtrack is a gentle background melody – it's not trying to steal the show, just providing a soothing ambiance. It complements the overall experience, making you feel like you're in your own little creative bubble.

In a world of glitches, House Flipper has its share of quirks, but it's nothing major. It's like hanging out with a friend who occasionally forgets where they put their keys – a minor inconvenience that doesn't overshadow the fun.

So, to sum it up, House Flipper is like a cozy sweater for your gaming soul. It might not be the flashiest game on the block, but it offers a laid-back and heartwarming experience. It's not about the destination; it's about enjoying the journey of turning virtual chaos into a comforting digital haven.

It's definitely not perfect, but it's a solid game and if you're into things like Powerwasher simulator or just simulator/design/cleaning games in general, you'll probably enjoy this one. Though, after playing it for a while it can start to feel like there's a lack of stuff. Especially in terms of furniture designs and decorations. For those who are solely interested in cleaning and redecorating houses according to the job posting on your laptop, you might not even notice this. I have yet to buy or play the second game so I'm not sure if it has more content, but I hope it does. 
Anyways, I still recommend this game. The sequel is out now so you may want to buy that and not be dumb like me tho.",1706042450,1706042450,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The GOOD 
- pretty good user interface, especially once everything is upgraded.  (Tip from someone who took a while to notice it, you don't aim your tool at the item, you aim the microscopic white dot that blends in with light backgrounds)
- nice mix of jobs at the start, so you can earn money for the house purchases.
-Large catalogue of items, colors, furniture etc. and a search bar if you can't remember where you saw it, so long as you remember what it's called (no trash cans, just bins)
-Once every property has been sold once you can buy them again, in the original condition.
-variety of properties, from hut to castle
-I got the garden DLC and it was worth it,
- very active and helpful player community, usually pretty easy to find an answer or at least find someone to confirm ""its not just you"".
The BAD
- you can't do anything with the yard except weed whack unless you shell out for the garden DLC.  Not even mow the hideously overgrown yards at every property.
- the color palette is very inconsistent between sample, can, and wall.  Some supposedly light colors are almost neon.  The light you put in can change it entirely so I would say put in the light and turn them on before painting.
- It seems like 75% of the kitchen accessories and rugs are Christmas themed.  They are all at the top so you have to scroll through them every damn time.  The smaller rugs that would fit in a bathroom are just solid colored, textureless squares for the most part, look horribly out of place, and appear to have been thrown in as an afterthought.  
- Size descriptions are next to useless on decorations.  Some small pictures are mural sized, and other ""large""
paintings are pretty little.  Be prepared to spend a lot of time trying to remember which sizes you need.
- drape type curtains are a pain in the ass.  Put them up before furnishing or they won't go up.  
- I wish there was more consistency with the patterns, I mean dozens of bed options but only one will have a certain bedding color/print.  And good luck remembering which of the curtain options actually has a match for the bedspread.  Pretty slapdash.
- The BUYERS all need to get hit by virtual trucks.  There are supposedly things you do to attract certain buyers but they don't seem to matter much.  No matter what you do, a house that is basically a giant pink sauna with two bathtubs, a giant bedroom, a huge closet, and no kitchen will still be ""won"" by the family who wants a kitchen and multiple bedrooms.  It's insanely frustrating.  And some of what they say they want are the same things they whine about.  This aspect of the game was very poorly designed.
- I find that the shopping is a bit tough because the contrast is so off that some stuff is literally invisible.  it's just so ridiculously white and I haven't found a way to fix it.  Every other thing on my computer is fine so it's not my settings.
- There is no eyedropper tool, so if you need to match something in the house it is a tedious project of going through each tile/panel in turn, and sometimes it turns out there is no match.  
- Some things have dozens of options and others have none.  Not sure why.
-Only way to get any cash from yards is to enter contests, which can have pretty tight requirements that the the fun out of making it your way if you want max return. (Eg the American garden seems to need one of each conifer, many of which look alike, so it becomes a tedious chore rather than a fun activity

The UGLY (As in blatantly lazy coding that has not been addressed despite many comments in the discussions)
- there are lovely  kitchen sets with lovely sinks.  Some of them the game does not recognize as sinks and thus will not call a room a kitchen.  So you have to either sell the set at a loss, or add another stupid sink.  There are a lot of newer items that do not register as what they are, meaning your beautiful bedroom might end up not being a bedroom.
- Some really basic stuff, like the lawnmower, requires a DLC purchases.
- Lately I've noticed you can't put things on the original window sills, though I could before.  You must sell the window, and then re-buy and install the window, even if it's the exact same window.  Only then can your plants sit in the sun on the window sill.  This is infuriating to me.  And I imagine the plants aren't thrilled either.
- The two young families try to buy EVERYTHING!  I mean, there is six of you.  Why the H are you still trying to buy the three room house I'm doing up for the misanthropic plant lady?  They really need to have a bit more separation between the buyers' needs.

Anyway, that's my take, most of it was easy to work around once I was aware it was an issue so hopefully this helps a bit.  Overall, a good game with lots to do.",1699228718,1705697909,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This is, without a doubt, my favorite game on Steam. This is the game I go to when I have no mental energy to play a new game, or when I can’t work out what I’m meant to do next in the game I’m playing. This is my default game.

The story is fairly nonexistent, we have no backstory as a character other than we are a “do it all” handyperson. We repair, clean, demolish, build, paint, furnish, you name it we do it. We do odd jobs for people who email us, and as we earn money we can eventually buy houses and flip them for profit. It’s extremely enjoyable, as long as you enjoy that kind of repetitive gameplay that only differs in the details.

You also have the Steam Workshop, where you can download custom furniture made by other players, and that is what separates the game from any other simulation game for me. Being able to not only build and customize your own house, but do so with custom furniture as well, it brings it to a level only Sims has ever reached for me, but this is purely the construction part of Sims and that’s all I’ve ever wanted in life.

That said, you really do need the DLC packs to enjoy the game to the fullest, as a lot of the best tools and abilities are only available in specific DLC packs. For example, the ability to fully construct your own home from scratch is only available in Farm DLC, you cannot do that in the base game or any of the previous DLCs. 

I would recommend, if you’re interested, put the game on your wishlist and wait for a sale as you can often get the entire bundle for 20-40% off if you wait. That said, if you have the funds please do buy it at full price and support the developers, the game really is worth it.",1704229912,1704229912,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

As someone who is very confused by the Sims 4 building mechanics but loves to be able to customize and build my own things this is a great choice! I just had to get the DLC's (especially the pets, I love them all) they are a great addition to the game, I love that they are technically a different game mode and unlock some nice items you can use in your own office or when selling a house. 

I also enjoy the fact that even in the base game (or DLC's) you still get some creative freedom when making over someones place, two or three choices for paint or tiles, or even just being able to choose what color scheme the furniture or items will have. Making the layout of rooms is probably one of the best and worst part of the game, its kinda like playing tetris, but I love it non-the less 

Cons? Only thing I'd have to mention is the lag, as I use my old beat up laptop to play games and this one happens to be a little hard on the old thing. Another thing I'd have to mention is installing things in game, mainly things such as a washer or windows, as the washer tends to clip you camera into the wall behind it leaving it in a weird angle as well, which makes it hard to pull parts in the directions they need to go. As for windows installation, when a house requires a window in a certain room I sometimes run into trouble with the checklist accepting it as a task being completed. I had to replace a window maybe 6 times in one home to get it to be fully recognized as a finished task.

Other than that, would definitely recommend for anyone into the chill and relaxing side of gaming.",1704173714,1704173714,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Despite some technical glitches and repetitions, House Flipper is an addictive game and an ideal choice for those looking to explore the world of virtual property development.",1704152364,1704152364,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

House Flipper is a simulation game that lets you buy, renovate, and sell houses in various ways. I have been playing it for many years (and have 99 hours into this game at the time of writing this review) and I love the creative freedom and variety it offers. The game has different modes, such as missions, where you complete tasks for clients, and sandbox, where you can design your own dream house. The game also has several DLCs, such as Farm and Pets, that add new features and content. I enjoy both of these DLCs very much, as they enhance the game play and the immersion.

The game is not only fun, but also relaxing and satisfying. Its a great game to pick up after a hard day at work and unleash your creativity. There is something therapeutic about cleaning, painting, and decorating houses, and seeing the results of your hard work. The game also has a realistic and detailed graphics engine, which makes the houses and the environments look amazing. The game is constantly updated with new content and improvements, which keeps me interested and excited. I am eagerly look forward to playing House Flipper 2, which promises to be even better than the first one.

House Flipper is one of my favourite simulation games of all time, and I highly recommend it to anyone who likes home design and management. It is a game that combines challenge, fun, and beauty in a wonderful way.",1703982729,1703982729,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

First off, the graphics are surprisingly crisp and clean. I didn't expect such attention to detail in a game where you're essentially cleaning up other people's messes, but it makes the whole experience way more immersive. It's weirdly satisfying to scrub away virtual grime and see a space transform right before your eyes.

The range of tasks you can do is mind-blowing. I started off just fixing leaky faucets and painting walls, but before I knew it, I was knocking down walls and redesigning entire rooms. The freedom to unleash your inner interior designer is so addictive – it's like The Sims on steroids.

And let's talk about the before-and-after moments. Seriously, if you're into that instant gratification of seeing a space go from disaster to dream home, this game delivers. Every completed project feels like a personal triumph, and I can't get enough of it.

The market aspect is a cool twist too. It adds a strategic layer to the game, making you think about what upgrades will give you the best return on investment. It's like Monopoly, but with power tools.

I've sunk way more hours into House Flipper than I care to admit, but honestly, it's time well spent. Whether you're into home improvement or just need a break from reality, this game is an absolute blast. Highly recommend giving it a shot!

Because when I first played it, the free update/farm DLC (I can't remember which one gives you it because I bought the farm DLC) wasn't out yet. That meant that you couldn't build houses, you could only renovate houses that we already built. But now. you can build from scratch. I highly recommend (even if the building wasn't in it) to buy the Farm DLC. It adds the interesting feature of being able to own farm animals and planting crops. That is extremely fun. Like I said, repeating myself now, I highly recommend that you buy the Farm DLC with House Flipper. The other fun thing with the Farm DLC is that you can milk the cows, milk the goats, collect eggs from the chickens, ride horses, and more interactions with animals like that. It's amazing! But, back to the base game itself, overall, it is a good game. Out of ten (without the Farm DLC), I'd rate it 8/10. With the Farm DLC, probably 10/10. You can't go wrong with buying House Flipper.
But there are some bad things in it. Here are some of them listed

1. You have to buy another DLC to make the game interesting
2. A bit pricey.
3. It does have the occasional bug, but nothing serious.
4. Without the extra DLC, (at least I find) the game is a bit boring. It gets repetitive. 

Other than that though, this game is perfect! A must buy, at very least. There seems to be something for everyone in it, a pet DLC for animal lovers, a Farm DLC to spicen the game up, a Garden DLC for people who love planting gardens, and more! If you love tidying houses, this is the game for you. 

HOW THE GAME WORKS

Basically, you'll get emails asking you to do jobs at houses. You can go to the house and do a bit of cleaning up. Usually, it will be things like broken wine glasses on the ground, water spillages everywhere, walls that need cleaning, and once everything to do with tidying up is done, you will most likely have to do something like put down some sofas, build some walls in the inside of the house to change the room layout, break down some walls, put up some pictures, put down a wardrobe, bed, and chest of drawers down in the bedroom e.t.c. Occasionally, you find cockroaches and have to hoover them up. This can be changed to small pieces of glass in settings though, and you get a warning in the first house with cockroaches in it. You also have to do some fixing work, for instance a plug socket might not be working quite right, and then you would fix it up. You do things like this in the house until it is completely done. Then you get your pay and you go home. After you have done this for quite a while (going to houses and doing work e.t.c.), you will have enough money to buy a house. When you have done this, you can have a look around, and renovate it with no restrictions. That is quite fun. But then you have the auction. That is even more fun. I'm not entirely sure, but I think that you can do other jobs whilst the people bid. But, if you are at the house, you will see the top bidders at the left side of your screen. One of them might say something like, ""There's not enough bookshelves for all my books."" and then you might place a couple bookshelves down and the person might place a higher bid. Once you have got a certain amount of point things for selling houses and that kind of thing, you can negotiate the price with people, for instance, if they had voted 3900 you could say 4000 and they might accept or refuse. You aren't guaranteed to have it accepted. Anyway, that's the most of the game. If you are reading this sentence, I congratulate you as this has turned into a long review.

I boot up the laptop, I do a mission, I get paid.
I make enough money to buy a house and I start cleaning it up, improving it and refurnishing it to re-sell it for a profit.
And that's about it.

What about having a realtor visit your house, and visibly point out the issues that could be changed.
What about being able to hire contractors to do the tiresome work instead of doing it all by yourself.
What about leveling up your skills to the point of not having to put every fu***** panel up manually, but just do it instantly for an entire wall if you wanted to.

The game really feels like a 'babies first video-game'.

Maybe it appeals to the fantasy of owning property and modifying it however you want (which, even if it isn't, seems out of reach to many, including me). I've lost hours to cleaning, repairing, furnishing, and finally selling homes. It's a bit weird sometimes (yeah, I'll just sweep this couch clean of this suspicious stain real quick), but I can't complain about it *too* much. That said, there is some stuff I CAN complain about:

* Unhelpful or Vague Directions
    Most of this has been fixed with regular updates, which is great. However, when a new mechanic is introduced, it can be very difficult to figure out exactly what to do. I struggled for quite a while the first time repairing outlets was introduced, for instance. These mechanics are explained beyond a red marker on your minimap. A bit more tutorial - even just a pop-up message - when a new mechanic is introduced could go a long way.

* Alignment issues
    I have yet to get a dang door to line up just how I want, and that's with a good chunk of practice. It feels neigh impossible to achieve the same placement as the defaults, especially with the outer doors. This can make some homes feel not quite right.
    In addition, arranging furniture (in particular, the little decor objects like books and vases) can be an absolute mess to get where you want them. It's not as bad as, say, Skyrim, but it's still annoying.

* The Auction System
    Just a minor nitpick here. When you go to sell a house, it has to be sold to the highest bidder in an auction. I would really like to see a way to accept a lower bid. This might be a way to help add variety by intentionally renovating a house to the known preferences of a certain bidder.

* No outdoor actions
    Apart from cleaning and changing the siding of a home, no actions are allowed outside. It would be nice to be able to do some landscaping, add outdoor lighting, maybe a welcome mat, some furniture, and perhaps even change the porches/decks. In at least one home, I got rid of some damaged fencing along a porch and couldn't replace it. That was very frustrating.
    ** UPDATE**: The ""Garden Flipper"" DLC has been released, but that contains ALL outdoor functions. I don't mind adding a lot of functionality in paid content, but adding some basic stuff for free wouldn't go amiss.

* Lack of some choice
    There's a single shower for purchase and installation (despite several non-playable options), no color choice for some other parts (like electrical outlets and light switches), and an inability to color parts of some cabinets. This can limit the feel of more open rooms, like combination kitchen/dining/living rooms (UPDATE: A lot of this has been updated, with new options for outlets, baths/showers, etc. Even options to move plumbing, external doors, and windows - a very welcome addition!). Speaking of which...

* Room definition
    If I make a HUGE connected kitchen and living room, even with the nicest kitchen possible, the game acts the same as if I threw down a hotplate on a desk. It would be nice to get a little more sophisticated detection so buyers of the homes don't get so annoyed.

* Color previews - or lack thereof
    There are no paint color previews, and the wall color is ALWAYS darker than the color displayed in the store or in the can. Without a way to know what a color really looks like, this can lead to a lot of somewhat costly experimentation, or just a lot of bland painting.
    The same issue exists to a lesser extent with wall tiles. It can be hard to judge how a tile will look until it's already up, and tiling isn't the fastest or most fun minigame.

* Day/night cycle performance issues
    While the inclusion of the cycle is nice, nighttime brings a HUGE performance hit to my PC. I admit I'm rather graphically bound, but it's big enough I wanted to mention it. This cycle can be turned off (and honestly, I suggest you do - it's hard to judge paint color at night), however.

* Misc
    I have had color disappear from curtains in houses, leading to sadness.
    Cockroaches regenerate while exterminating - this can be really frustrating.
    Imperfect English translation (some awkward phrasing)
    Can't paint ceilings


So after that list, you may be wondering why I still recommend House Flipper. Simply put, if it's not on the list of complaints, that means it works really well. As noted above, I've seriously sunk hours at a time playing this game. It's far from perfect, but it's really enjoyable - and regular updates keep adding functionality, bug fixes, and quality-of-life improvements. Even for full price, this is worth it. If you like work simulators or want something a little more involved (but admittedly more restrictive) than The Sims, grab House Flipper.",1531176146,1703016139,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

There's something extraordinary in how the simple processes involved in this game--cleaning, picking up trash, demolishing, etc--can help me not only wind down after a busy day, but also get me in the kind of ""zen"" focus zone that is conducive to helping me sleep quite well. 

And then there's the part of the game that sparks creativity and joy. I've long thought I would be a good house flipper, if only there wasn't so much physical labor involved. I also have long believed I'd be a good interior designer, because I have watched a lot of shows of that nature, so. Clearly I would be good at it. In all seriousness, though, the process of designing stuff in this game is not only creative, but adds to to the calming nature I mentioned before. Making sure everything is placed ""just so,"" that colors match, that things are aligned and that spaces feel good...all of it leads to a general sense of well-being I just don't get from many other games. 

In summary, this is a good game.",1702921187,1702921187,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The awkward menu you use for searching for objects to buy for decorating and furnishing - there's no 'Did you mean this...' or anything. You either have to search for the exact name of the item or search through a whole page of things for one specific item. Very tedious and time consuming.  

For example, you can't simply type in 'shelf' or 'tv unit' or something like that (I can't remember exactly what I typed in) but nothing shows up - but there are actually shelves and tv units or cabinets or whatever. They just don't show up by searching using those words. 

The whole game pretty much relies on this menu for buying/decorating and it just sucks - it's not at all precise and just a pain in the ass. You also can't click back or open different tabs. I had to keep typing in the same query every time. It more than doubles the amount of time you're spending on browsing and selecting stuff from the catalogue.

I mean really it's just shit... Sims does it better. 

There's also the fact that almost every house you go to is identical and you can't even cut the grass without paying for an over priced DLC. In fact, most of the good stuff is locked behind DLC - including the really basic stuff that you would do anyway to make the house more presentable both inside and out (e.g. cutting the fucking grass). 

I think it's also a tad bit too basic overall... It's mostly just dealing with the shit menus and playing clicking simulator. Want to paint a wall? Buy paint, click paint, click wall, rinse and repeat. Pretty much everything is just click, click, clickity click. A bit mind numbing. The whole gameplay loop is! I like simulators but this isn't really proper. There's no thought required at all like with e.g. Bus Simulator/Farming Simulator or even Bakery Simulator or Thief Simulator! I suppose you can get creative but for what? I spent hours on a house and my reward was next to nothing. 

I know it's always more tempting to take the easy road and play something that doesn't require any thought whatsoever and you can just sit there drooling and wasting the day away instead of playing something with substance but this ain't it bro... And you don't want to support devs that charge you over £10 to cut the fucking grass! 

I got this game for like £1-£3 with two DLC too and that's about the right price for this I think. But from me it's a big fat NOPE. Also, the community is weird. Now don't get me wrong... I think this game could be worth it for people with autism maybe or OCD no cap but for the rest of you again: nope.

I can think of a few different things that would make the game a proper simulator and make it feel more alive like having the clients actually exist (actual NPCs) that perhaps come to view the property or being able to rent the property, collect rent, evict bad tenants and clean up afterwards for the next tenant or having to visit properties to make repairs. Also not having to appease a handful of cliches and instead allow you free reign to build, design and decorate the house as you see fit and sell it for a more realistic price or even less realistic if it means the game will actually respect your time (the time you've invested into the project - just add a few thousand £ on top) and so much more.

The fact that you can do it in a game without having to put in the actual hours of work makes it seem like there is no way this could not be fun.

However in practice the experience gets very dull in a couple hours of gameplay. Mostly due to the fact that all these properties have the exact same type of trash to clean, the tasks feel monotonous. If houses were crafted with more unique dirt elements rather than copy pasted elements I could see this being so much more fulfilling.

I wish I could really see the personality of the people that lived in the house. Have unique types of trash, maybe make it so you come across a dead body or old love letters, have some story building outside of just the emails.

As it is currently you will have seen everything there is to see in 2-3 hours of gameplay. Base game also lacks different furbishing options.

Graphic:
Having a rather ill suited devices for gaming, my device has no trouble running this game at a surprisingly stable 60fps. The visuals are very well done in this game, objects and shades are well detailed and realistic.

Gameplay:
You play as a guy/gal who renovates houses for a living. To get paid, you accept jobs from your laptops, and perform various tasks of clean/pick up trash/repaint the wall/installing hardwares/placing down furnitures/destroying and rebuilding walls at your client's instructions to complete the job. While the jobs require you to follow certain instructions on how a house is renovated, you can also purchase a houses to renovated it at your own will, which you will then either turn it into your own office or initiate an auction to sell it to interested buyers, who each have their own preferences on the style/layout of the house. While the DLC are expensive by themselves, I don't find the base game lacking in contents and it has no trouble keeping me interested.

Bugs:
I have yet encounter any bugs in the base game myself, but many seem to find themselves troubled by bugs with the DLC add-ons, so I would say watch out for that. 

Conclusion:
This game offer ample amount of furnitures, wall paints and so on to let players build their dream houses themselves. While I don't believe you can build a house from ground up, the game does give you many style of houses to choose from. I think this is a great game for those who enjoys building and decorating a house.",1702523581,1702523581,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Can spend hours playing without noticing 

earn cash quite easily 

no in game purchases excluding DLCs which i would say they are worth it i got mine for £7-£8[$8-$9] - full price mite be a bit much but you would get over spending it.

Plenty of items to decorate with, not just one form of things in different colours 

can add walls to outer house and levels  make a simple house twice as big and have upto 3 levels/floors 
Look goods not 100% realistic but good enough

Cons -

Missions are a bit of a repeat of each other Minus the special/bomb shelter missions - Not really a bad thing as there are really only there to get you used to the games control

Light from ceiling lamps tent to bleed through the walls so if you have two rooms next to each other light from the lamp in room 1 will bleed through to room 2
 
Overall - Good game would defo buy again would suggest getting it on a deal £15 is not to bad but deals are always better lol DLCs are great gives a lot extra to the game still needs more patches, addons adjustments i have played 41 hours so far and im still going id say its a bit of a time out game when you are tired of multiplayer games, it starts off with missions for families houses to decorate they give you a task like decorate this room this with this colour bla bla bla to build up your in game cash good way to learn the game, gets a bit annoying when you are putting effort into making it look nice then the couple requests something ugly or huge,  after you have done enough missions and saved up a bit of cash you can buy the same houses you do missions on and do it up your own way and then sell it for more cash aka Flip it you can put up wall to separate rooms knock down wall to combine rooms  ect",1595780765,1702408468,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

House Flipper is a game that focuses on reorganising houses from top to bottom. The game may seem ordinary at first, but once you get into it, it makes you feel like a home decoration guru. 🧹

[b]🎨 Graphics and Sounds:[/b]
The graphics and sound of the game are very satisfying. The detail of every corner of the house gives a real sense of satisfaction during the editing phase. 🖼️

[b]🕹️ Gameplay and Entertainment:[/b]
The game is generally fun and addictive. However, sometimes the missions can be a bit repetitive, a change would have been inevitable. 🎮

[b]📜 Story and Depth:[/b]
In terms of story, the game lacks the depth to keep you engrossed. There could have been a more in-depth scenario and character development, which would have made the game more attractive. 📚

[b]🌟 Game Pros[/b]
🏠 Freedom: The freedom to organise houses according to my own taste is fascinating.
🧐 Details: The details in every corner of the house make the game realistic.
[b]👎 Cons of the game[/b]
🔄 Repetitive tasks: Repetitive tasks can be boring from time to time.
📖 A Deeper Story: A more in-depth story would have increased the game's appeal.

The item system is... well it's wack. Particularly the interaction of the buyers and the items. I get that is hard to make a system that objectively values a subjective thing like house design.

But for example: I was trying to build a house for a guy who wanted a really rich looking hallway and office, and the bare minimum everywhere else. I could not get that office to be considered an office, I tried everything, looking up internet guides and it just kept being a home library. And every time you do auction, you're taking this big monetary risk on this weirdly regimental system where a beautiful office you made doesn't count as an office and he's like BUT I WANTED AN OFFICE. Like is it that hard to make a room qualify as two different types of rooms at once, as long as it has all the qualifying features? And why do those qualifying features need to be so INCREDIBLY SPECIFIC. It's just lazy game design.

Also the availability of items and materials is so sorely lacking, like The Sims is way more complete and it's not even really a game specifically about building houses. And The Sims sucks, lets be frank.

Less annoying but still things to consider for the developers: the progression does not feel satisfying at all- you should slowly build from crappy materials to better and better materials, and eventually be able to finally build a beautiful state of the art home (not after only like 15 hours of play, like I could). The materials are all incredibly similarly priced, and it should be more like real life, where there's dirt cheap materials and then there's wildly impractical materials that look fantastic on the exponentially high end. And there are too many houses that are carbon copies of each other, but you knew that and were just lazy.

The demo scenes for the DLCs were not even remotely appealing. The HGTV one didn't seem to have any new content at all.

Things I liked: the buyable houses were really dirty and disgusting in the best way, and cleaning, junking, plastering, painting, and demolition all felt fantastic, you really nailed that part.",1701294377,1701294377,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

With a unique premise and a mix of simulation and renovation gameplay, House Flipper offers an enjoyable and satisfying experience for those who have a knack for home improvement.

The heart of House Flipper lies in its addictive renovation mechanics. The game allows players to tackle a variety of tasks, from cleaning up debris and repainting walls to installing new fixtures and rearranging furniture. The sense of progression is tangible as each house transforms from a neglected space into a stylish, personalized haven. The wide range of available tools and decorations provides ample creative freedom, allowing players to experiment with different styles and designs.

Graphics may not be cutting-edge, but House Flipper's visuals are clean and functional. The before-and-after transformations showcase the impact of the player's efforts effectively. The attention to detail in the objects and the overall design of the houses adds a layer of realism to the experience.

The game's economic system, where players buy, renovate, and sell properties for profit, adds a strategic element. Balancing the budget, choosing the right upgrades, and keeping an eye on market trends contribute to the simulation aspect of House Flipper, making it more than just a simple home improvement sandbox.

House Flipper's intuitive controls and straightforward gameplay mechanics make it accessible for players of all skill levels. The tutorial does an excellent job of guiding newcomers through the basics, allowing them to grasp the renovation process quickly. However, the simplicity of the game may lead to a lack of challenge for those seeking a more complex simulation experience.

While House Flipper excels in providing a satisfying renovation experience, the absence of a robust storyline or long-term goals may leave some players craving more depth. The repetitive nature of the gameplay loop, where each house follows a similar renovation pattern, could potentially lead to monotony over extended play sessions.

In conclusion, House Flipper is a fun and engaging simulation game that successfully taps into the joy of turning neglected spaces into dream homes. Its accessible mechanics, creative freedom, and the satisfaction of tangible progress make it a compelling choice for fans of home renovation and simulation games. While it may lack some of the depth found in more complex simulations, House Flipper's charm lies in its simplicity and the sheer pleasure of transforming virtual fixer-uppers into digital showcases of personal style and creativity.",1701238861,1701238861,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The only negative things I can say about it is that I wish the devs would update previous DLCs with features in new DLCs.  For example, in older houses you can't change or sell the stairs.

I sold my soul to this game. Every time I've had a bad day at work, I launched Flippy and painted walls for hours. Wish my life was as tidy and organised as my houses in this game.

But let's take it a bit more seriously:

♥ PROS ♥
- Lots of free content, regular free updates featuring new houses and furnishing.
- DLCs priced relatively low, worth all the content you're getting.
- Adding or removing walls feature, so you can design your house to your heart's content. There will be some limitation where you can't add on more floors for example.
- Fantastic relationship with the Devs who always listen to their community and work on constant improvements on the game releasing regular patches and offering more fresh updates.

☻CONS☻
- Long loading screens.
- The game doesn't feel well optimised. Laptop users may experience loud noise when playing thee game/it may overheat as well. Desktop users shouldn't have this problem.",1700999570,1700999570,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

You're a one-person renovation crew, starting off with performing simple cleaning jobs for clients to earn cash for their first home purchase. The jobs themselves serve as a lengthy tutorial as you start to acquire new gear (such as plastering wood wall tiles or demolishing and rebuilding walls), and the sense of general progression by acquiring perks (such as faster mounting when it comes to radiators and appliances, or using less paint when painting walls) the more you use each tool. You've got a bit more freedom when it comes to demolishing walls and rebuilding them, but you won't be impressing anyone from HGTV anytime soon.

Gameplay-wise it's boring, but a good type of boring. The mechanics themselves aren't interesting, nor is the actual story of the game--or lack thereof. The game itself gives you the ability to perform a number of remodeling actions, but the mechanics are stupidly simple. Cleaning boils down to clicking boxes and holding down the mouse button to wave your broom or mop around and watching a stain magically disappear. Painting is virtually the same, holding down the mouse button and slowly watching the paint appear on the walls one wall at a time.

After you've saved enough money from the odd jobs, you're able to buy your own home to renovate yourself. Once you've cleaned it and repaired the broken appliances (if applicable), you're able to decorate it with a variety of furnishings, décor, wallpaper, paint, carpets, and tiles. There are options for essentially every living space; kitchen, bathroom, bedroom... and strangely enough, a sauna. Once you've renovated and refurnished the house, you can put the house back on the market and sell it to a list of preset “buyers.” Each buyer has certain needs in mind (some want large bedrooms, no walls, little clutter...you get the idea!) and the game runs an auction, where the highest bidder wins. Then you use your profits to buy another house. Rinse and Repeat.

I wouldn't buy this game full-price simply because its necessary to buy the DLCs also, but at a discount, it becomes a MUST BUY. I only have the HGTV and Luxury DLCs currently, but I will likely buy the rest when on sale. They add so much to the game, and the items are worth the relief of being able to find an item that works/looks how you want it to. As House Flipper 2 comes out, I will be buying it on release. Truly, it is a great, relaxing, and fun game with creative DLCs that contribute to a well-crafted experience.

Base Game Highlights: 

Very beautiful and interesting houses (Samarta Myers lol)
Fun design possibilities
Lovely paintings/decorations
Large game
Interesting buyers
Can change staircases
Beautiful paints, interesting patterns, diverse furniture
Relaxing; mindless cleaning fun
Easy to lose time in
Many room types

Note: The HGTV DLC and the Luxury DLC are almost a REQUIREMENT and add quite a bit to the game. While the Pet, Garden, and Farm DLCs do as well, no doubt, the HGTV and Luxury DLCs add some amazing options both house and item-wise. 

Nitpicks:

Limited color options for many items.
Limited/different pattern options.
Can't expand houses.
Building rooms to fit certain furniture can be difficult, sometimes doesn't fit by like 5 cm. A bathroom I designed ended up with some spaces in between cabinets.
Doors are exclusively wooden in base game/HGTV/luxury.
Cannot put things in drawers but can in cabinets.
Small dressers/things cannot fit under beds that sit higher and should fit underneath.
Sizing is inconsistent. This is especially true in pictures; small is not small, large is not large, small is too large, large is too small, large is too large.
Buyers can be confusing to work with; some will not outbid others even when the house is perfectly to their liking.
Putting items in bookcases is unnecessarily difficult. Ladders are hard to stand on and place items on one.
Window curtains can't go through objects, some aren't short enough, some aren't wide enough, and the color/pattern options are limited in base game/HGTV/luxury.

Like I said, it is a game worth getting and enjoying, despite the nitpicks I've put in. They really are nitpicks, only mildly annoying. On the whole, I find the game relaxing and fun, so I can't stress it enough that it's worth being bought and played, even with HF2 coming out shortly.

=============

Update several hundred hours later!

With the release of the Farm DLC, we got SO MUCH new content it's insane. First, we got new animal types in addition to the Pets DLC animals. I love my little chickens so much! The ability to build entirely new buildings makes going back to older lots worth it because you can slap up a whole new house on the First Office lot, for example. 

There are a ton of jobs available with all the DLCs included, so I always have something to do. Plus the free content updates to the base game are very welcome and much appreciated. They actually did add a ton of new carpets with new textures, so that prayer was answered.

Overall, this game is solid as it could be, and I'm psyched for House Flipper 2 to come out!

If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead– murdered by my brother-in-law, Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now, and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, he asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded. I... I always thought Hank was a very moral man, and I was particularly vulnerable at the time – something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me in on a ride-along and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin, so I agreed. Hank had a partner, a businessman named Gustavo Fring. Hank sold me into servitude to this man. And when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn. Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling-out. Things escalated. Fring was able to arrange – uh, I guess... I guess you call it a ""hit"" – on Hank, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured. And I wound up paying his medical bills, which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge. Working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring. The bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA. To keep me in line, he took my children. For three months, he kept them. My wife had no idea of my criminal activities, and was horrified to learn what I had done. I was in hell. I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, and in response, he gave me this.

outside of buying and flipping houses you have a variety of odd jobs to level up to get skill points to use to use to help make things easier of yourself when working and build up your funds to start flipping. The odd jobs can be fun to do but can also help you learn what you can do with with rooms to help you with furnishing houses you buy to flip.

* Update after pet dlc: Still loving it and many, many more hours poured into this game!

Do yourself a favour and check out the workshop for this game too. Lots of items and great content. And do not limit yourself to houses, try out cafe's, restaurants and retail. The templates for the most part do cater to houses/apartments but with the workshop you can think outside the box. ✨

My favorite DLCs are the Luxury and Pets. I love taking a job and being told exactly what to do with minimal choices based on the customer's taste.
It'd be nice if you could sell the ""houses"" as things other than residences; it feels weird to sell a business to a family wanting a house.

It does have a few issues, mostly with pets; When you disable pet needs, you have to re-enable it to stop them coming with you on jobs. When you tell them not to follow you, they STILL follow you and get in the way. You can tell them to move, but it's frustrating either way. I normally just tell them to follow me to another area I've finished with and tell them to stay. Their AI needs some work, but at least they're cute... And hypoallergenic (LOL).

This game isn't just about flipping houses; it's about unlocking your inner interior designer and turning dreams into reality, both in the digital and physical realms.

The beauty of House Flipper lies in its simplicity yet incredible attention to detail. From the moment you step into your first property, you're armed with tools and a blank canvas, ready to transform the space into something spectacular. The freedom the game offers in choosing colors, furniture, decorations, and layout is not just liberating—it's inspiring.

But here's where House Flipper transcends the screen: its real-life application. The skills and design ideas you develop while playing this game are directly transferable to your own living space. I found myself applying the concepts I learned—like efficient room layouts, color combinations, and creative use of space—to redesign my own room.

The game's ability to spark creativity and provide a risk-free environment for experimentation is truly invaluable. It encourages you to think outside the box, try new styles, and visualize how different elements can come together to create a harmonious living space.

Personally, I found that after playing House Flipper, I became more confident in making design choices for my own room. I experimented with different furniture arrangements, tried out color palettes I wouldn't have considered before, and paid more attention to the finer details that can make a room feel truly special.

Moreover, the satisfaction of seeing your virtual designs come to life in the game is akin to the joy of witnessing your real-life room transformation. It's a testament to the game's ability to inspire and empower players to explore their creativity and design potential.

In summary, House Flipper isn't just a game; it's a catalyst for unlocking your inner designer and applying newfound skills to your own living space. Its immersive gameplay, attention to detail, and ability to nurture creativity make it a valuable tool for anyone looking to explore interior design or simply wanting to breathe new life into their surroundings.",1700154523,1700154523,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Move over, Chip Gaines; there's a new sheriff in town, and his name is... well, it's me, after playing this game.

From the moment I stepped into my first virtual dump, armed with a paint roller and a questionable taste in wallpaper, I knew I was in for a wild ride. Forget about real-life sweat and tears – in House Flipper, my tears were purely from laughter as I tried to paint a straight line for the umpteenth time.

The best part? I can do all the heavy lifting without actually breaking a sweat. I can demolish walls, tear down cabinets, and shatter windows with the precision of a sledgehammer-wielding ninja, all from the comfort of my ergonomic gaming chair. Who needs a gym when you can have biceps of steel from virtual demolition?

And don't even get me started on the real estate market in the game. Move over, HGTV; House Flipper is where the true drama unfolds. I've had potential buyers walk in, take one look at my neon-green bathroom tiles, and promptly leave with a disgusted emoji. It's like the game has a built-in virtual mic drop for every questionable design decision.

But fear not, fellow virtual renovators, for the joy of ""undo"" is always at your fingertips. Accidentally painted the entire living room neon pink? No problem! Just hit Ctrl+Z and watch your mistakes disappear faster than my hopes of ever becoming a professional interior decorator.

In conclusion, House Flipper is the game I never knew I needed – a virtual playground where I can unleash my inner Bob the Builder and create architectural masterpieces that may or may not be considered crimes against good taste. Five stars for the laughs, the tears (mostly of joy), and the satisfaction of turning pixelated dumps into virtual mansions.

It fills really great to clean them up, put new furniture in and selling them. There's even a before/after picture whenever you sell a house, just to show you how much the place changed.
Or yknow, you can play it like a complete psycho, sell everything including door and windows and you can still make a profit.",1699906577,1699906577,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

They also have no way to roll back updates so monst people just cannot play currently.

UPDATED:
I shall keep my review negative since the game keeps resetting my cloud saves to a blank game and it asks me if I want to use local or cloud every time I boot then game.
This has made me unable to play at my partners house unless I backup manually and take the save with me.
No your updates did not fix my problem with objects. 3 weeks after posing this I sold my rats and that was what fixed it.(after getting a tip from someone else in the community)
The update broke the game for many and we fixed it ourselves before getting any guide on how to fix it from you.

I love this game and I respect all the work you do for it. But it is extreamly buggy and refuses to cooperate with its players.

It's incredibly satisfying to start with a run-down, dilapidated house and turn it into a stunning masterpiece. The variety of tasks you can tackle, from cleaning up trash and fixing broken appliances to painting walls and choosing the right furniture, keeps the gameplay fresh and engaging.

The graphics are surprisingly detailed for a game of this nature. You can really appreciate the before-and-after transformations as you watch your properties go from shabby to chic. It's like a virtual HGTV show, and it's oddly therapeutic.

The game's progression system keeps you motivated as you earn money from your flips and unlock new tools and skills to enhance your abilities. There's a sense of accomplishment when you complete a project and see those virtual dollars roll in.

While House Flipper offers a lot of fun, it's not without its minor quirks.

I've done actual yard work, home building, restoration work, additions, remodeling, and house flipping at different times in my life, and wanted to know if a game about it could be fun.

Over 300 hours in now on one of my most played games on Steam, and yes...it's fun.  Just forgot to leave a review.

It takes out the most annoying parts of the business, and just allows you to enjoy the success.  There's no smell or body aches or unpaid invoices or trouble making ends meet.  But there is the fun of completing tasks and creativity and a zen like activity.

If you like dreaming up your own house, or just laying out some ideas, or sometimes playing around with thoughts like ""what kind of apocalypse bunker / futuristic studio / ideal beach home / whatever"" place you'd like to imagine...this has a lot of capabilities to let you explore that, especially with all the dlcs and user created content.

The UI is painful. I got to building walls, trying to snap them into place and it's so clunky. 
Installing appliances is literally just screwing things into place, slowly. Painting is pointing your cursor at a wall and it's painted with an up and down motion.
With the tools you just make the same general back and forth motion with your hand (hurhur) and then it's done. There's not even a satisfying rustle of paper when you clean up trash. The sound effects are repetitive. 
I thought destruction would be fun but no, just as awful. The pieces kind of stick together and you have to select a specific chunk to target it, resulting in a lot of waving the pointer around to get it to trigger.
This game would benefit from a 3rd person, overhead view, similar to the Sims or other house builder games. Instead it's in first person POV and so frustrating.

Additionally, the game's regular updates and downloadable content (DLC) provide even more ways to expand your renovation empire, ensuring that you won't run out of things to do.

Multiplayer:

There are few problems I ran into right away. Taking off the wall plug in face plate it has black screws super hard to see, I wasn't even sure if it was working the first time so I had to back out and then go back in. The highlight around items are white, also very difficult to see in some areas. It should be maybe a different color just so you can see it a bit better. 

Also I have 1080 graphics card and 16 gigs of ram so I shouldn't be experiencing so much lag (frame rate)  in this game. I can run many games at max. But this one really lags it especially lags when you get to the student house. To a point of almost just crawling.

There's literally no time limit and no limit in here, maybe except the bugs. You can design and decorate different houses and spaces into something you like, which is very satisfying. Before I know it, many hours have passed. 
But this game isn't without bugs and some of the bugs are really annoying, e.g. Shuana with the big bedroom thing, sometimes buyers not recognizing spaces even if the houses have it because you stand at a wrong room, etc. The inability to do anything to sockets at the inner side of exterior walls is also driving me crazy. 
Another annoying thing is the lack of rulers and grids, so it is super hard to make sure you put all the lights, deco, and furniture symmetrically. 
Another reviewer mentioned about shady business thing. I agree with them. The base game itself is not cheap at full price, but many of others good stuff are locked behind DLCs (like the ability to tidy up the plot and mow grass) and if you buy everything at full price, your wallet gonna kaput.

What I like: 

1> Freedom to modify a house to a degree. 

2> The Cyberpunk style lofts are fun and I enjoy them more then most of the houses 

3> I like the overall creativeness of the game.

What I dislike: 

1> Disappearing furniture as soon as you leave the room. It just kills the game. 

2> Game glitches a lot, can't finish the game. The castle crashes my game. 

3> The lights mechanic is bad. Lights turn off when you go into the next room. For the lofts this is broken. 

4> Random holes in the homes makes me fall into the stage. This happens with particular furniture and corners.


Conclusion:

This game has great potential but the developers is planning on a release of house flipper 2. They don't really care for the bugs in house flipper one. I doubt we will see any improvements on game performance but I will not be buying the second one as the first one was never really fixed to begin with. 

The add on content just breaks the game more.",1693145374,1698751592,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

since the game isn't to straining on your computer and is available for mac.os(and does not require wifi) to be played you can do so pretty much any where. House flipper also has dlc's that greatly improves customisability but are absolutely not required for a good time.
The one thing i have a problem with is the lack of a make your own feature, for example a picture frame where you can put photographs you've taken in the game.

The details of objects, interiors, and structures are surprisingly realistic. The design of environments and objects is diverse, ensuring a wide range of customization options. However, in some cases, the repetitiveness of objects can lead to a sense of déjà vu.

Gameplay (4/5): The core mechanics of House Flipper focus on renovating houses, from clearing debris and dirt to choosing furniture and materials. The gaming experience is engaging and satisfying, especially for those who enjoy the creative aspect of interior design. However, some missions can become repetitive, lacking true variety in the challenges presented.

Realism and Detail (4.5/5): One of the most captivating aspects of House Flipper is its realistic approach to renovation. From repairs to decorations, every action requires attention to detail. The variety of tools and materials available adds a level of complexity that appeals to enthusiasts of realistic simulations.

Progression and Challenges (3.5/5): House Flipper's progression is based on an experience system that allows players to unlock new tools and missions as they advance. However, the lack of more complex challenges might lead to a loss of interest in the long run. The addition of more intricate objectives could provide greater motivation for continued engagement.

Social Interaction (3/5): While there are elements of social interaction, such as customer requests and house reviews, a multiplayer component is lacking, which could have further enhanced the social aspect of the game. The ability to collaborate with other players in renovating a house could have added an intriguing teamwork element.

Sound and Music (4/5): Sound effects, such as the noise of tools and the surrounding environment, are well-executed and contribute to player immersion. The soundtrack is pleasant, although at times it might become monotonous. A greater variety of music could have enriched the gaming experience.",1698002175,1698002175,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The first comes from when you first start the game and everything is great. I am doing missions, flipping cheap smaller houses, unlocking upgrades, and just having a good time; the ""Calm Before The Storm."" But then you finish the missions, 100% them perhaps, and you start switching to just flipping houses in your own style and selling them do the buyers; which is where said calm ends, and the storm begins. Because as soon as I am left to my own devices, the game play begins to really suck. I have all these options, all these homes, furniture I have never seen, and ideas I never thought about before. But I simply feel no drive to do it. As compared to the first stage where I played 15 to 20 hours over three days, playing every night for as long as my brain could handle; in the second stage I cant even bring myself to play for longer then half an hour without forcing myself to engage in bore that is continuing to do the same things over and over again without reason. Perhaps if the buyers of my homes had significantly different concept of what they want in mind from each other, then perhaps I would feel challenged to engage in different design ideas or harder to construct concepts, things that could challenge my skills and understanding. But no, every buyer is 100% happy with the same colours, same brands of furniture, and a added sauna to really boost the property value. As it is House Flipper is an okay game, I can flip houses. But the game play only lasts for as long as the story missions do before becoming dull, with nothing be done to make me truly feel like I am ""House Flipper"" beyond the title. Truly a perfect representation of a streamer game, play for a bit, then never play again.

I must say however, that I am extremely saddened by the state of this game, I wish it was more, I wish they truly expanded on the buyers. Because flipping houses is a fun concept, and the game does allow for quite a high degree of freedom, just fails in its delivery of that freedom to the player.",1697963734,1697963734,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Pros:  - Relaxing game
          - Satisfaction of turning a messy house into something good 

Issues: - Not enough content with the base game, would be much better if DLCs were free
          - Highly repetitive gameplay, did about everything in 12 hours
          - Cannot build outside or add/remove/modify exterior walls, limits a lot of possibilities
          - When flipping a house there is no reward for painting and making it look good, you can literally buy a house, clean it and sell it for 10-15k $ profit (removes the satisfaction and point of the game)

The game graphic is quite mediocre with bare bone mechanic. Lack a lot of stuff that could be added like the ability take a shower after each jobs so your home can actually feel like home. Or pay for food, eat and clean the dishes with soap and runnin water.
The animation when you dispose stuff is nice and smooth, but the animation for using tool is as mediocre as the graphic.
 Doesn't know why it get so much praise when the game play is bare bone basic and plain.
Also get some bug when some times I can do thing as the same time, other I can't. Also when I do thing earlier than expected, the camera zoom in way too much, obscure the view which I can't see thing to do. It would be best if they let the player has free camera around the installation area, then the player can choose what to do next on their own without the camera annoying zoom in and out.

I got all the achievements and thought the game was a very neat concept. Though I wish I was able to do more in the way of customization.

Fast forward to 2023 around the time when the Farm DLC releases. I realize that a lot of content, jobs, and properties were added. Some of those properties being very massive, allowing for me later to build an entire office for my “business”, a large house, and an entire garden/chicken coop area.

Anyway when I returned I was delighted to see that they added the ability to customize the pre-existing stairs in properties. But the biggest one of them all was the ability to remove the exterior doors and windows and replace them and place them wherever you’d like.

Then the Farm DLC came out and added the ability to build additional houses on a lot, which made me ecstatic. Although you can’t do much in the way with the preexisting houses on an occupied lot. You can't add floors or change it per say, but you can add additions onto it though. But they added empty plots to truly unleash this game's potential.

Overall this game is relaxing, and has plenty of content, the base game alone has a fair amount, and you can add loads more via buying the DLCc which are worth it as they drastically expand on the game’s systems.

But if you’re not content with what the game has to offer in terms of furniture and what not, the game has the steam workshop which has loads of useful tools and really nice looking furniture.

As I just “finished” or “100%” the game as of writing, I highly recommend this game to everyone who may be interested. Here's to hoping House Flipper 2 turns out to be a successful successor.

Review:

House Flipper, developed by Empyrean and published by PlayWay S.A., is a refreshing and addictive take on the simulation genre. As the ultimate one-person renovation crew, this game hands you the keys to rundown properties, challenges you to transform them into luxurious spaces, and, in the process, turns your interior design fantasies into reality. With its satisfying gameplay loop, creative freedom, and attention to detail, House Flipper is an absolute delight for aspiring decorators and virtual renovators.

At the heart of House Flipper lies the joy of transformation. Starting with derelict houses, garages, and other properties, the game tasks you with cleaning, repairing, and redecorating to boost their value. The sense of satisfaction that comes from turning a grime-covered, dilapidated room into a stylish living space is immensely rewarding. The game's intuitive controls and user-friendly interface ensure that even newcomers to simulation games can dive in and start flipping houses with ease.

One of the game's standout features is the extensive variety of tasks and customization options available. From painting walls and laying flooring to installing appliances and arranging furniture, every aspect of the renovation process is at your fingertips. The extensive catalog of furniture and decor items offers endless possibilities, allowing you to create spaces that range from cozy rustic cottages to sleek modern apartments. The freedom to experiment with different styles and designs ensures that each renovation project is a unique and personal endeavor.

The game's career mode provides structure and guidance while allowing for creative expression. Completing renovation jobs for virtual clients not only earns you in-game currency but also unlocks new tools, skills, and customization options. The progression system ensures a sense of accomplishment as you gradually expand your renovation empire and tackle increasingly complex projects.

House Flipper excels in attention to detail. Every object, from tiny decorations to large appliances, is meticulously rendered, and the game's graphics capture the essence of different architectural styles. The environments are vibrant and immersive, with realistic lighting and textures that add depth to your creations. The sound design complements the visuals, with satisfying audio cues accompanying every action, from hammering nails to vacuuming carpets.

Moreover, the game benefits from its modding community. Players can access a wealth of user-created content, including new furniture items, house models, and additional renovation tools. This active modding scene extends the game's longevity and ensures that there's always something fresh to discover and incorporate into your projects.

In summary, House Flipper is a delightful blend of creativity, relaxation, and entrepreneurship. Its addictive gameplay, coupled with the freedom to design and renovate to your heart's content, offers a satisfying and immersive experience. Whether you're an interior design enthusiast, a simulation game lover, or simply someone who enjoys the art of transformation, House Flipper welcomes you into a world where dilapidation meets dream homes, making it an enjoyable and engaging simulation title.

After having put several hours into House Flipper and owning every DLC...

House Flipper is for sure my all time favourite renovating simulation game. You can do so much in this game, it's actually insane and it never get's boring . You start out with a terrible house, you have a laptop where you can do jobs from random NPC's through emails wanting you to do things for them. TIP: Do every job till you receive no more emails then move on to the bigger jobs 'map of jobs', then spend your earned money on whatever you have your eyes on. You have total freedom in House Flipper, the design is at your finger tips, you can do anything you like. Just be aware, there are haunted houses, so it's not entirely a realistic renovating game, it's more of a thriller in some houses that feels like someone is watching you all the time, hehehehehe...okay...let's be honest here...I am very jumpy in real life, I get scared very easily so anything will give me a fright.

I recommend buying all the DLC's first before trying out the game, it's worth the full House Flipper experience, trust me, if you love renovating, you'll love this game then. You can even put the bits and pieces together such as air conditioners etc. You can mow the lawn, have a pool, have pets, etc. Great game, see if you enjoy it.

Oh, and House Flipper 2 releases on the 15th of December 2023. :-)

5/5

It's like a dream come true for all you DIY enthusiasts out there, and let me tell you, it's a rollercoaster ride through the world of virtual home improvement.

Now, imagine this: you're tearing down walls, installing appliances like a pro, and painting walls with the finesse of an artist. All of this, and not a single stain on your pants! I mean, who needs a contractor's license or those pesky city permits when you've got House Flipper?

But here's the kicker - you'll get so engrossed in this game that you'll start questioning your life choices. Why are you fixing virtual toilet pipes when there's a real-life leaking disaster waiting for your attention? Priorities, my friend, priorities!

Now, let's talk about those glitches. Yes, there are a few hiccups in the game that can sometimes block your path to virtual renovation stardom. But who cares when you're watching your dream house on your PC screen shining like a beacon of perfection? Meanwhile, your real house might just crumble to the ground, but hey, at least you're a virtual home improvement guru!

In the end, House Flipper is a fun and addictive game that lets you live out your wildest DIY fantasies. Just remember, when you're knee-deep in virtual house paint and tile, don't forget about that leaking toilet in the real world. Your pants may stay clean, but your real-life house might not be as forgiving!",1697183030,1697183030,True,2,1,0.533757209777832031,0,True,False,False

Cons: Way too expensive. Also super shady business practice. You buy the base game and your only getting like 20% of a game. The rest is hidden behind a bunch of dlc paywalls. 

I bought the base game when it was on sale for 90% off. At the time of this posting that sale has almost another week before it expires. Worth buying at that price. Do not buy at full price. Do not support the shady business practices of selling an incomplete game that would require buying a bunch of overpriced dlc to get the full game.

After 5 years, they're abandoning this game for ""House Flipper 2"", They're also abandoning it without fixing any of the bugs, and most likely won't patch anything when House Flipper 2 releases.

I'm guessing they're abandoning this game due to the recent issues with Unity, but that's not an excuse when I'm still encountering bugs just in the base game, and according to others, the Farm DLC has been broken/full of bugs since its release in April.

I'm still hoping they'll continue to work on this game (even if it's just a few patches), but until I know for sure, my review will stay negative.

Come on designers, get real already. Considering the genre of the game, a simple way to line up furniture, fixtures and surfaces should have been a priority.

However, the gameplay can sometimes become repetitive and even tedious, especially during the initial stages of a project when you're tasked with cleaning, scrubbing, and painting every nook and cranny of a house. While realism is a strong point, it can also feel like a grind. The game's mechanics could benefit from a bit more streamlining to maintain the relaxing atmosphere while reducing monotony.

Where ""House Flipper"" truly shines is through its DLCs. The Luxury DLC and Pets DLC add fresh and enjoyable elements to the game. The Luxury DLC lets you work on high-end properties with extravagant designs, adding a touch of elegance to your flipping endeavours. The Pets DLC, on the other hand, introduces adorable animals into the game, bringing more life and warmth to the homes you work on. These DLCs provide a breath of fresh air and enhance the overall experience significantly.

n conclusion, ""House Flipper"" is a relaxing and immersive game that offers a unique experience in the world of home renovation.

Looking forward to the House flipper 2.

I can't believe it's been 5 years since i've reviewed this game. This game has come such a long way in 5 years. I've spent hours and hours, doing the missions, cleaning and redecorating housings and most recently doing farm stuff and building houses. The detail were allowed to go into building, painting, decorating, windows, doors etc etc is incredible. This is one of my favorite games of all time, probably top 3. I'll pop in the game every once in a while and there's always new stuff and over the last month, i've gotten absolutely hooked again. Also after rereading my original review, the Devs implemented everything i wanted plus tons more. Once again, thanks Devs!


I love this game.  I used to spend hours playing The Sims just decorating the house, well this is 100x better. I love every aspect of it. The painting, assembling appliances, furnishing and even the sweeping and cleaning up trash. I've beat the ""missions"" part of it and i've still been playing this game for hours. There's just so much to do. I make bizzare houses, super expensive houses, houses i would like to live in, and right now i turning a house into a maze using the large blocks. (Would love an option to auto keep buying the same item.) (There may be one but i haven't found it.) I'm looking forward to new houses, missions, maybe even a plot of land so i can build a house from scratch. There's really so much potential with this game.

This game is perfect in between time wasters. Building houses and designing them is a truly cathartic experience.

 I've played this game on steam for nearly 500 hours at the time of writing this, and at least another few hundred hours on the switch. I've also played it with no DLC's and with all of them available and recommend it either way (though the extra content truly expands the game and makes it so much more enjoyable). You can design the same home in so many different ways and I think I fell in love with the game so much because of the creativity as well as how relaxing it is to play. 

I was a little nervous transitioning to playing on my Macbook considering I had previously fried my old one by playing sims 4 on it, however it's done surprisingly well with some adjustments to the settings here and there. Other than random small tweaks, there's not a single complaint I have about it! With recent patches, all of the DLC's work fine together, granted some do lag a little more than others, and being able to add custom content from the workshop has been exceptionally enjoyable. 

I can't recommend this game enough to others. I've been able to create spaces I'm proud of and consider myself apart of the community by participating in online groups.

 If you enjoyed ACNH's Happy Home Academy DLC(and just decorating Animal Crossing houses in general), you will LOVE this. I loved getting to unleash my inner interior designer demon. 

 I can imagine the fixing and cleaning aspect of the game would be similar to powerwash simulator. It was definitely a ""turn your brain off"" type activity for me, and I loved every second of it. 

 The game could use more content, though. I hear it's a bit empty without the DLCs(especially farm and pets dlc) and I definitely agree. I guess that's what DLCs are for, but I'm not cashing out 16,500 won for every dang DLC. Guess I'll have to wait for a sale.

The HGTV DLC is worth it from the start, mostly for the before and after shots of your homes when you sell them or finish the job. I am very excited for the sequel to come! This game appeases the tidier in you, the creative, the constructive, and the imaginative.

Update: As you can see I put in quite a bit more time from the first time I reviewed this game. It is crazy how much has been added with the pets DLC and farm DLC. They have done such a good job with this game when it comes to simulators. It would be cool if there was a little more focus (just a little) on the business side of being a home flipper. It would be nice to have need for money a bit more, because really just playing the game you get money and it just sits there mostly. I am not sure how this will be done, however I think it could add more to the immersion. 

P.S. I played the demo for the next one and I hope they still add more to this one, because I was not impressed. It added a lot more tediousness with cleanup and reminds me of the not very good simulators on steam, where it is too much and nit picky rather than how clean and smooth this game is.",1679954974,1695503204,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

If you're like me and spend hours decorating your house and choosing your outfits in games like the Sims or Animal Crossing, then House Flipper is perfect for you.  I generally gravitate toward ""cozy,"" laid-back games that allow me to progress and explore at my own pace, and this is definitely one of them.

House Flipper offers dozens of quests that feature many aspects of home renovation, such as decorating, budgeting, and demolition, and the game does a great job of guiding new players as you unlock more building modes.  The more quests you complete, the more skill points you acquire, which makes flipping your houses much easier.

In addition to completing quests, you can also buy homes to renovate on your own.  You can keep any house that you buy for yourself, or you can sell it to a buyer - if the house meets their specifications, you'll get a large profit for your hard work!  Most buyer preferences are broad and allow for a lot of artistic freedom, giving you the opportunity to customize your homes exactly the way you want.

One of the best aspects of the game is the relaxed pace.  There are no time restrictions or penalties, so whether you feel like completing quests or flipping houses to sell, you'll never feel like you're missing out on anything.  You can take your time decorating and renovating to your heart's content and earn money at your own pace.

As much as I enjoy House Flipper, I do wish there were more quests available.  After binge-playing the game for a few weeks, I finished every quest and even flew through the HGTV DLC.  Additionally, I would've liked it if lawn mowing and gardening were available features on the base game instead of being a separate DLC.  That said, I think the game is wonderful overall and most definitely deserves a spot in your ""cozy game"" rotation.",1695271585,1695271585,True,50,2,0.815783917903900146,0,True,False,False

It is now 2023 and I own everything there is to House Flipper, I own it on console and my switch. When HF first launched a few years back I won't lie, there was a lot missing. There was a lot I had put that I wished there was in the game. 2023 has come and now we can have a farm and animals. I am anxiously waiting HF2 because I am so addicted to this game. About a year ago, if that, there was issues with the cloud saves and I ended up losing my game, had finished it completely, but I have had to start halfway over with it and honestly, I ain't even mad about it. This is truly one of my all time favorite games to just sit for hours and renovate houses. I have built my childhood home, dream homes, and everything in between. 10 out of 10 would HIGHLY recommend this game! 



Original (40.3 hours at time of this review): I've been playing this game for a bit and watching it on YT when it was in beta by some of my favorite youtubers. There are a few things I wish was available for in game (like, landscaping, more furniture, being able to move walls by expansion or demo and bringing them in more) but they keep adding updates to make the game better. I did have an issue where my saved game was erased and had to start over but this is one game I don't mind that happening to in a way because I like being able to do different stuff. I do hope there is an update to have more than one saved game at a time, however. But overall, love this game!",1533245950,1695251991,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I will however still be playing this version as I really do love it as is. Personally i got the game on sale, with every DLC for the same price as the game normally costs alone, and am obviously biased in the sense that i basically got most of the game for free. But even with that in mind, I'd still recommend the game to anyone interested in house design, architecture, interior design, pets (pets dlc), farming (farm dlc), garden-scaping (garden dlc), wannabe millionaires (luxury dlc), and of course those who wish they could host their own renovation tv-show (hgtv dlc), and of course those who just enjoy fucking up the lives of the people around them by completely trashing the houses you work on, and selling the dumbest looking houses you can come up with.

However, it became clear that beauty doesn't matter in this game, not because it's subjective, but because the characters don't take it into account. This made House Flipper feel like a boring job of just moving furniture and cleaning, without any depth or meaning.

Selling Houses:
When it's time to sell a house, the process is disappointingly simplistic. The house goes up for auction, and if it meets a character's predetermined criteria, they place the highest bid and acquire the property. This predictability removes any sense of challenge or excitement from the selling aspect of the game.

Lack of Lasting Impact:
One of the most disheartening aspects of House Flipper is the lack of lasting impact. Even if you put in considerable effort to create a masterpiece worthy of an architectural magazine, there is no trace of it after the sale. The game only provides a sales history with photos of the house in its initial condition. It would greatly enhance the experience if players had the ability to customize the listing photos, similar to a real estate listing.

Overall Disappointment:
Regrettably, my experience with House Flipper left much to be desired. The game lacks depth and fails to provide a sense of accomplishment or fulfillment. It falls short in several areas, making it difficult for me to consider it a complete and satisfying game. Moreover, considering its shortcomings, the price of the game feels unjustified.

Overall, my experience with House Flipper was disappointing. It lacks depth and a sense of accomplishment, falling short in several areas. Considering its flaws, I can't recommend it as a worthwhile purchase.",1687067018,1694870757,False,6,0,0.535301685333251953,0,True,False,False

what I don`t like:
- when I renovate a home and I sell it, on the tablet in the sold tab it won`t show the house after renovating it. it is still dirty as you bought it in the pictures. if you really wish to remember what you have done, take pictures.
- a few bugs... sometimes assembling can put you in a weird frame and you won`t be able to complete it.
- the way the game changes a room status from office to home library etc. it`s annoying, and it won`t make it what you want ( for example, I place office furniture and it won`t become an office )

When you're stressed or on edge, House Flipper is a soothing escape. It might get a tad repetitive, but then again, so does life sometimes. While the game doesn't last forever – once you've accomplished everything, it's essentially game over – it's a delightful way to pass the time.

I'd recommend picking it up, but only when it's on sale to avoid splurging too much.

First of all i recommend getting it on sale it's not worth £20. Secondly, this game can get very very boring within the first 10 hours. You practically unlock every tool and almost  get everything fully upgraded and gets boring painting walls and decorating huge houses like the Family home or the Castle. They seem like late game houses but the truth is you can get everything unlocked and beat the game if you play for a straight 2 days. It just doesn't seem worth the price and gets quite boring. It doesn't have much variety and you sell to the same people with the same preferences. You can't even get a refund after 2 hours because of their refund policy. Save your money for House Flipper 2 I'm hoping it's better and maybe implements Ai to make whoever you sell the house random or maybe make different randomised houses. Many other people have the same complaint where the game gets to bland and boring so don't think I'm the only who mad about this.

Not everything is interactive.  It's frustrating.  Sometimes you can open cabinets, sometimes you cannot.  
You cannot place things into drawers, why?  
Sinks do not work.  
You don't need to hook up ovens, stoves or sinks in the kitchens.  
Walking through grass sounds like walking on plastic.  Doors opening uses the AOL 'online' notification sound.  
Not all TVs work
Computers do not work (I'm talking about turning on, showing a desktop, not actually functioning as a real computer)

Again, I am a simulation freak so I will up-vote this as obviously it is very fun.  But I wanted to say my own issues with the game, that I do not think would ever really be addressed as they are almost like asking to make Sims a first person game.  Which is my actual fantasy.  But I think it s stupid to actually expect those types of things so yes, it is very fun and is very involved and the DLCs are extremely neat.  

Active, helpful community & devs
Good graphics
Good controls
Fun game-play

The game is worth it and the dlc's are fun, however as much as I love this simulator game I HATE the bugs that you can potentially encounter, for example when you want to paint walls but you can't do it because it won't let you. Same issue with the hammer when you want to destroy a wall or use the mop when you need to clean the floor. People said to switch between equipment but it works 1 out of 3  times. It's frustrating. 
Over time I played around 100 hours so imagine having to exit the game and come back everytime. I hope the same issue won't be in House flipper 2. Ok now that I have complained I can speak about the best parts xD, the range of things you have to do in house flipper is insane, you just don't see the time going.  My first house took me over 2h xD it's super fun and you can destroy/decorate/fix as much as you want because even after completing the main game  you can still buy houses and continue endlessly. It will take you around 100 hours to get 100% if you are after the achievements, probably less if you rush but I took my time.

Pros: Was able to get about 7 hours of enjoyment out of it, so the  1 hr = $1 rule. applies. It does have a zen ""ah, I'm cleaning up messy houses"" element for a brief while.

Cons: Gets redundant pretty quickly. Some bugs exist--like the inability to paint over or wash off the graffiti on or even replace the ""Walter White"" garage door. Buying stuff could be far better categorized, and saving searches improved. It's really hard to find just ""white"" paint by merely searching or scrolling through the paints.  Very annoying. Also, why is it that a room doesn't count as a bedroom when you flip it unless you buy a bed to put in it? Who buys a house that already has beds and furniture??? You get the idea pretty quickly that stuff like garish colors on walls and ridiculously transparent doors for rooms don't seem to matter to potential buyers. 

Essentially, it could have been thought through with much more accuracy and depth.

Basically you build skills by doing a bunch of jobs for clients and then use the money you make to purchase a house and then flip it for a profit.  The various potential buyers all have different needs, so the key to making the most profit is to cater to the top bidder.  That's the game in a nutshell.  

The REAL game, however, is spending hours and hours playing around with the design tools to make the perfect house.  The PC version is especially good because you can upload any photo you want to make it a painting.  A lot of people have found creative ways to use this feature such as making photos look like windows outside or covering up entire walls with them.  There are many, many possibilities for design in this game.   

While this game is great, I do have a few complaints.  Placement can be finicky at times.  For example, doors have to be placed correctly the first time because you can't move them.  Also, the tile/panel spreading tool tends to stretch out beyond the boundaries of the room so it can sometimes mess up the walls of an adjacent room.  Lastly, the garbage you have to pick up can sometimes spawn in an area outside the map which can make it difficult to locate for 100% completion, though during my latest playthrough I didn't have this problem so they may have fixed this.  

Anyway, I highly recommend this game if you're into design and want something relaxing to play.  The job and business components are more of an afterthought because of how easy they are but I still had fun with them.

Literally the pinnacle of human technology. Every mechanic flows together in a harmony which is matched nowhere and never will be. Your beliefs do not matter, you could be an Atheist, Buddhist or Jew, every single human being will find more enlightenment in House Flipper than in any of your holy scrolls. This is truly the best thing that humanity (and i would go as far as to say the entire universe) has been given to.

If you want something smaller and faster, you do jobs.  All the DLCs also have very different vibes, each with unique tools and tasks, which can make the game feel fresh even after hours and hours of play.

A bit buggy at times and missing a few quality-of-life features, but ultimately very charming.  Absolutely would recommend not just the game but all of the DLCs, and the recent addition of the DLC demo is a great way to explore whether you want just the base game or the whole package.  Steam workshop custom items also boost the already-high replay value.

Wasn't originally planning on getting the sequel, as I almost never buy Steam games until they're on sale, but my love for this game has me genuinely considering buying the sequel on release.

- without any of the DLC, the inbox messages run out quickly. I actually enjoy doing them, and to have them run out so fast feels a little empty.
- Also, without the lawn care DLC being in the base game, my homes always feel unfinished, and I just can't rationalize paying $15 to get a lawnmower.

Rating: ★★★★☆ (4/5)

House Flipper takes the satisfying concept of turning dilapidated spaces into stunning abodes and transforms it into an addictive virtual experience. As a fan of both simulation and renovation games, I was excited to dive into this unique title that combines creativity, design, and business strategy.

The core gameplay of House Flipper revolves around purchasing neglected properties, cleaning, renovating, decorating, and ultimately selling them for a profit. The game offers a wide range of options for each step of the process, from tearing down walls to selecting paint colors and furnishings. This flexibility encourages players to unleash their inner interior designer and experiment with various styles, layouts, and combinations.

Visually, House Flipper is surprisingly detailed. The transformation of rundown rooms into stylish living spaces is incredibly satisfying to witness. The variety of furniture, decorations, and equipment available allows for a high degree of customization, ensuring that each project feels unique. While the graphics may not be on par with some AAA titles, they do their job well and provide a clear representation of the changes you're making.

One of the standout features of House Flipper is its sense of progression. As you complete more projects and accumulate wealth, you can invest in skills and tools that enhance your abilities. This progression system adds a layer of depth to the game and keeps you motivated to take on bigger challenges.

However, House Flipper isn't without its minor flaws. Some of the controls and mechanics can be a bit clunky, especially when placing objects or fine-tuning details. Additionally, while the game's core loop is engaging, it can become slightly repetitive after numerous flips. More varied objectives or additional gameplay elements could help alleviate this repetition.

The game also lacks a true sense of story or personal connection with the properties you're flipping. Adding more narrative elements, such as dealing with unique sellers, exploring the histories of the houses, or having ongoing interactions with clients, could enhance the overall immersion.

Despite these shortcomings, House Flipper is undeniably addictive. The feeling of accomplishment that comes from transforming a rundown wreck into a stylish haven is truly satisfying. It's a game that offers a creative outlet while appealing to the inner entrepreneur in all of us.

In conclusion, House Flipper is a must-play for fans of simulation, design, and renovation games. It successfully captures the thrill of turning neglected spaces into something beautiful and profitable. While it may not be flawless, its unique premise, customization options, and sense of progression make it a worthy addition to any gamer's library. Whether you're a budding designer or a business-savvy player, House Flipper offers a satisfying and enjoyable experience that will keep you flipping properties for hours on end.",1692991835,1692991835,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Initially when they're installed, they'll work fine, but if I leave to another house, I come back and find I literally can't get through these gates anymore. I've just stopped playing all together, because I was really looking for to the livestock part of the farm DLC, and it's just been a disappointment. I jump on every few weeks to see if it's been fixed, but haven't fully played since the farm DLC release, and probably won't be until that bug is finally gone.

If that isn't something that would bother you, I'd actually still recommend the game, especially with some of the new features, such as extra stair options and the ability of making a balcony. There's such a huge range of items and customisation available, and the pets DLC is actually pretty awesome.

Update: 25.08.2023 - I no longer recommend this game. With the recent update, I loaded up the game to see if the fence gate issue might have been fixed. Not only is that bug still  not fixed, but my save data is a mess. I've lost so much progress and time consuming creative designs, that it's just not worth investing any time in this game any more. This isn't the first time I've lost save data, it's not even the second or third time. I've had enough of being let down by the folks behind this game.

This isn't a bad game by any means but there is one particularly annoying aspect to it. Most of the time when you try to place something in an area where you have to place it the game will say ""there isn't room"" when clearly there is. This happens a lot. It's not game breaking just maddeningly annoying and has caused me to quit the game out of sheer frustration on many occasions because you can't finish what you are doing. You are trying to finish a job and the game just will not let you - as an example you will be given a section where you have to lay turf but when you try to lay it you are told there isn't room even though there clearly is. Another point I can't understand is why you have to stop laying turf when you come to a plant or a tree but when mowing the lawn you can go right through such obstacles. These might seem like minor gripes but when it keeps on happening it gets frustrating. That aside the game is good and can be fun if they'd only be a bit more flexible with their boundaries to prevent the problems I have mentioned (to be honest it seems to mainly occur on the garden flipper jobs). All in all you can get a lot of hours of fun from this game just watch out for the ""there isn't room"" annoyance.
Something else that has really irked me is that they have released a new farm dlc but have changed the minimum specs for running it. The game runs on 8 GB RAM but they've upped the minimum specs to 12 GB RAM for the dlc so as I only have 8 GB RAM I can't play this dlc - still the reviews for this dlc are ""mixed"" so I'm probably not missing anything.",1653690886,1692904906,False,1,0,0,0,True,True,False

A lot of times where I wanted to interact with something I had just built, the option to do so just simply isn't there. You can build all the TVs, couches, sinks, and showers you want and it may look pretty, but at the end of the day they're just props and that's what bugs me. When you think you can interact with something, you can't and it gets demotivating. ""Why build this shower?"" ""Why build a TV?"" if they're all props. And a couple mechanics just don't make sense. I'll start with the office which is just one big prop (take a shot everytime I say prop). You can have the entire thing be empty with just a computer and there's nothing stopping you from doing so. You can complete the entire game just ignoring your home base and focusing on flipping homes which at that point, what is the point? The sleep mechanic is, and I cannot stress this enough, actually useless. Hey devs, wanna know an idea that I thought of in less than 5 seconds? Make your character fatigued if you ignore sleep for long enough and as result you work slower. I know, crazy. I understand how criticizing a game without an offered solution is pointless so I'll try to offer some of my suggestions. As I said, let us interact with the world more. If I build a couch, I wanna be able to sit on it. If I build a gaming pc, why can't I play a flappy bird mini game? I know there's cars but I haven't got to them just yet but if I had to guess, they're un-customizable just using context clues. And I haven't even gotten to the flipping part yet in this review. In short, it's just repetitive after a while and it really didn't feel intuitive.  Some mechanics are horribly unbalanced. Some jobs will have you pick up ungodly amounts of trash which is just straight up not fun. Simple as. It got so bad to the point where I had to use an auto-clicker. Anything that needs to be refilled in your hands, god help me, is just atrocious. Wallpaper is by far the biggest offender. I had to have broken my wrist with the amount of times I had to look back at the floor to left click and get a new batch of wallpaper and there's no small batch, medium batch, and large batch like there is paint. So, you go to buy more, right..? WRONG. The devs had to fuck up that mechanic too. If you are holding literally anything inside your hands, you can't buy more of something. You have to put it down then you can buy something from the shop. If both your hands are occupied, you can't even open the menu that brings you to the shop. For what it's worth, I did have fun playing this game and if you like to build your own spaces, get it but if you want anything beyond mindless left clicking and a list of tasks, look somewhere else please. Side rant: I really hope HF2 has a story but if it doesn't, it is what it is. A good example would be teardown. Horrible game but you start from the bottom and you complete more and more daunting tasks as you make a name for yourself. This game does have progression but it's in the background. So you don't really know that you're making a name for yourself, the game kind of just throws tougher jobs at you without any real reason behind it.",1692901506,1692901506,False,1,1,0.468811988830566406,0,True,False,False

""House Flipper"" offers a unique and addictive gameplay experience that lets you step into the shoes of a renovator and designer extraordinaire. Developed by Empyrean and published by PlayWay, this simulation game lets you transform dilapidated properties into stunning homes, channeling your creativity and strategic thinking.

Gameplay:
The heart of ""House Flipper"" lies in its engaging gameplay mechanics. You're tasked with purchasing rundown properties, cleaning them up, renovating, decorating, and finally selling them for a profit. Each property presents different challenges and possibilities, requiring you to manage resources wisely, prioritize tasks, and cater to the specific needs of potential buyers.

Renovation and Design:
The game offers a surprisingly extensive range of tools and items for your renovations, from painting walls and laying tiles to installing furniture and fixtures. The customization options are impressive, allowing you to experiment with various design styles and create spaces that reflect your personal taste.

Progression:
As you successfully renovate and sell properties, you'll earn money and experience points. Experience unlocks new tools, skills, and options, giving you a sense of growth and achievement as you progress through the game. This feeling of advancement adds a layer of satisfaction to the gameplay.

Realism and Immersion:
""House Flipper"" excels in its attention to detail. From the way you meticulously clean stains and dirt to the accurate portrayal of construction and interior design tasks, the game captures the essence of the real-world renovation process. This realism contributes to a satisfying sense of accomplishment when you witness the transformation of a once-neglected property.

Challenges:
While the gameplay loop is addictive, some players might find it repetitive over extended periods. The process of cleaning, renovating, and decorating can become somewhat formulaic, especially as you encounter similar tasks in different properties.

Graphics and Performance:
The graphics are serviceable but not groundbreaking. The game's visual style is simple and functional, focusing more on the details of the properties themselves rather than eye-catching aesthetics. Performance can vary, especially when dealing with larger properties and complex designs.

Community and Updates:
The game has a dedicated community that shares their creative designs and tips. The developers have continued to support the game with updates, adding new properties, tools, and features to keep the experience fresh and engaging.

Conclusion:
""House Flipper"" offers an enjoyable and immersive experience for those who have a penchant for design and renovation. Its unique gameplay loop, along with a satisfying sense of progression, makes it an ideal choice for players who enjoy simulation and strategy games. While the potential for repetitiveness exists, the game's attention to detail, customization options, and ongoing support from the developers make it a worthwhile investment for those looking to unleash their inner designer and house flipper.",1692670998,1692670998,True,27,1,0.733963906764984131,0,True,False,False

I highly recommend you this game if you are a fan of the Flip of Flop or Property Brothers TV Shows.
This game allows you to unleash your creativity and relax without any worries.
Even without buying the dlcs you have a good variety of furnishings to best furnish your home.

The only thing that didn't convince me is the approval rating of the various buyers; it's pretty clear that each customer is triggered by one or two specific elements in a completely illogical way. 
For example, once you understand that a specific buyer is a flower lover, all you have to do is fill the house to be sold with flowers. Even if the house hasn't been cleaned and the toilet is missing, you can rest assured that this buyer will make false papers to get it.

In any case, I'm glad they decided to make a sequel, which I hope is even more beautiful and entertaining than this one.

I rate it 8/10.

The storyline falls a little bit short because all you are supposed to do is renew and sell, so, if you love just building / architecture / decoration and get somewhat attached to your builds, youll avoid selling at all costs, and there is only so much to do if you keep pilling houses.

Perhaps if you could rent your houses, open restaurants, hotels, and make money out of it, the gameplay would be much more ambitious and immersive.

From the moment I started playing, I was drawn in by the game's immersive mechanics and attention to detail.

The ability to transform rundown properties into stunning, personalized living spaces is nothing short of addictive. Each task, whether it's cleaning up debris, painting walls, or arranging furniture, feels remarkably fulfilling, allowing you to witness tangible progress in real time. The game's realistic simulation of renovation work is not only educational but also strangely therapeutic, offering a sense of accomplishment that few other games can match.

One of the standout features of House Flipper is its vast array of customization options. From choosing paint colors to picking out the perfect kitchen cabinets, the level of control you have over the design process is truly impressive. The satisfaction of seeing your vision come to life as you turn a dilapidated dwelling into a stunning masterpiece is immensely gratifying.

Furthermore, the game's attention to realism extends beyond just the physical renovations. The financial aspects of property investment, such as buying and selling houses strategically, adds a layer of depth that keeps you engaged and constantly striving to improve your skills. The sense of progression and growth as you amass wealth and reputation is incredibly rewarding.

House Flipper's charming graphics and user-friendly interface enhance the overall experience, making it accessible to players of all ages and skill levels. The frequent updates and additional content introduced by the developers demonstrate their commitment to keeping the game fresh and exciting.

In conclusion, House Flipper is a delightful blend of creativity, strategy, and relaxation. Its addictive game-play, coupled with the joy of turning neglected spaces into dream homes, makes it an absolute must-play for anyone seeking a positive and immersive gaming experience. Whether you're a seasoned gamer or just looking to unwind after a long day, House Flipper offers endless hours of enjoyment and a unique sense of accomplishment.",1691988490,1691988490,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I started with just the base game with luxury added. before 2 weeks went by I heard about the garden dlc and pet . had to have them. I wake up wanting to play it immediately. I have had so much fun with this game. I tried a few demo's of other kinds like this and they were terrible and their dlc's were rid high. this one is just right and checks all the boxes. so very happy with it.,1691777222,1691777222,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

My biggest issue is that my save file has disappeared multiple times, it's connected to steam cloud, I have never had issues with save files vanishing. I've followed multiple guides trying to get it back and managed to restore things, but it reset all my skills and it wasn't worth it to me at that point to start over yet again.  That being said, I have many friends that haven't had this issue, so I still recommend the game, just a word of caution when it automatically saves that it might not actually be.

The devs are very active in discussions, and do what they can to fix bugs quickly. The DLC's are all great, and I love doing the jobs. And while some people may dislike the new farm DLC, (I mean, come on. Why would I get a horse when I have a lawn mower? It's probably faster anyway, and I can take it everywhere!) it's totally worth it because of the house extensions and the grappling hook. Seriously, walking isn't cool anymore because of it.

[b]Graphics:[/b] Graphics do not have to be top-notch for a game to be enjoyable, and in this game such is the case. The graphics of this game are designed as such that the lower-end computers can handle the game, and though I have not yet tried it on my low-end laptop, I imagine that it will handle just fine. The only thing you need to worry about on lower-end computers is the load time, which might be significantly longer.

[b]Content - Decorating:[/b] This game has jobs you can complete for in-game currency and houses you can purchase with in-game currency to shape and decorate almost any way you want. You will need to complete a job to unlock the house for purchase, however, so do be aware of that. One of the major downsides to this content, however, is that you must acquire the Game Over achievement in order to purchase a house more than once. Additionally, if you have installed DLC before completing this achievement, you must also complete all DLC houses to get the achievement....which can get very painful if you have all of the DLC. The second downside to content is that almost all furniture in the game is ""modernized."" You may have to go searching through the Steam Workshop for things you want and hope there is something there...or design it yourself if you have the ability and talent to do so.

[b]Content - Build Your Own:[/b] If you want to build a house from scratch, or add onto existing houses, you must obtain the Farm DLC. There is no other way to get it done. The other downside? You are restricted to only three floors, cannot add basements at this time, and houses that already have roofs on them cannot have new floors added atop of them. The upside? The Farm DLC provides three empty plots of land on which to build massive houses and finally includes some not-as-modernized, farm-style furniture. Woohoo!

[b]Content - Pets:[/b] Yes, that is right. Pets are available in this game through the Pets DLC and through Farm DLC. You do have to purchase the DLC to get them, but the pets from Pets DLC will help you on your job sites.

[b]Content - Fishing:[/b] This is not a fishing game. This is a house flipping game. Fishing has nothing to do with house flipping. Why do you care about fishing in a house flipping game? Shoo! You are looking at the wrong game!

[b]Content: Buyers:[/b] The Buyers Problem is why one point is knocked off of the score. So, what is The Buyers Problem? Well, to put it simply, there are way too few buyers for houses. The AI is designed in this game so that buyers lean toward specific things in houses...which is great until you end up with the same two buyers at the top for just about every house even when you are sometimes placing into it things that should have more appeal to different buyers. The AI on this is still a bit wonky. The good news is that once you unlock the Game Over achievement, you need not worry so much about buyers any more. Design and plan to your hearts' content!

[b]Content- Profiles:[/b] This is one of the really neat features about this game. You can create multiple profiles on your account. Each profile is like a completely separate game, allowing each profile to complete all of the offered jobs and design the houses in the way that the user wishes. So, if you share an account with a sister, for example, each of you can have your own profile and do your own thing with a single account.

[b]Content - DLC:[/b] There are several DLCs available for this game, even including a Luxury one and an HGTV one, that add new items, jobs, and houses to the market for you to decorate. The downside is that these DLCs are not available for all platforms. If you play via Steam you are in luck, though! All DLC is available.",1691681171,1691681430,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

some bugs ive encountered being:
pets getting stuck / unable to interact
objects not placing properly / turning invisible / having collision while holding, then money being removed from the budget anyway
same as last bug but every object in my office [including pet waste], i have to move my office to another building to edit the one im using. it's negligible but annoying! the first office / building worked fine.
when the object has collision when holding, it can push you outside walls or even the map. this is negated by teleporting you back to spawn, but still annoying

otherwise, ive had a wonderful time with this game and am very excited for house flipper 2! <3",1691635348,1691635348,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

I boot this game up, put on a podcast or some music, and just go to town on a house. Reminds me of playing Viscera Cleanup Detail, or Hardspace Ship Breaker. Just a relaxing game where you can (nearly) be as creative as you want. I picked this game up because it seemed like such a strange concept, and I have grown to really like playing it here and there when ever I need to relax.

The only problems I have with the game are as follows: While you can build walls and knock them down, you can only do this to the walls already inside the house. You cannot construct additions to the building, or remove areas. It is a very small playground sometimes, unfortunately.

Why are you furnishing homes? This doesn't make any sense. When you sell a home, you don't include sofas and TVs and even cars. On top of that, the search mechanic for these items is not great. Many items aren't called what you would expect. Having tabs filled with items for different classifications of rooms (kitchen items, dinning room items, bathroom items, etc.) would be fantastic. Sadly, you have to sort through a lot of crap.

Why are there so few buyers? Why do I keep selling houses to these same people to live in? It is really quite strange. Having a setting where you can set expectations to random; and thus have to fulfill new and interesting conditions each time (can you possibly make this tiny house have what this person is looking for??) would keep it fresh and interesting.

A big problem I have with the game is the DLC. I have no problem with a game selling expansions after they have made a solid base game, it makes good business sense (note, I say a solid base game, which not all game developers do, sadly). The problem I have with it is that each DLC pack sells for almost as much as the base game itself. This feels extremely overpriced for what you actually get out of it, and just feels really greedy like they are trying to milk what they have as much as they can.

Because of this, as much as I have really enjoyed playing the game, I would only recommend it while it is on sale, the DLC especially.",1691544685,1691544685,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I got House Flipper (just the core game) when it was on sale, so it cost me almost nothing. I think they did this to try to get new players to buy their DLC. The problem is that all of the DLC is way more expensive. The one DLC-locked item that seems ridiculous not to have in the core game is a lawnmower. You get a [spoiler]flamethrower, but that's expensive to refuel and takes maybe 3 to 7 refills to clear overgrown grass from a property.[/spoiler] So you flip houses without really being able to mow down overgrown grass. Seems gimped.

Speaking of gimped, the LONG list of things you can't do or have no control over in House Flipper:
[list]
[*]Can't get all of the Steam Achievements unlocked unless you buy all of the DLC. W˥̄F? How evil can you get?
[*]Can't paint ceilings. And painting walls around windows takes more paint then painting other walls of the same size. Awkward.
[*]Can't paint walls different colors/textures horizontally (but there are a few textures to buy that do this)
[*]Can't destroy/move exterior walls. Which means you can't make your own property designs.
[*]Can't add/remove levels of a house.
[*]Can't relocate the main and rear entrances. On that note, can't add additional entrances.
[*]Can't sell to anyone except the same 10 pre-defined parties, i.e.: nothing random, same buyers who want the same things.
[*]Negotiation is stuck with the option ""you ask for X money and seller either refuses or accepts"", so you can't haggle at all. And the success of your negotiations seems to be completely random. $60k asks can fly while $2k asks might get denied.
[*]Can't make much money unless you not only flip houses but also become an interior decorator to appease buyers. Why does every single buyer prefer a pre-furnished house? That's not how house flipping works, lol. You can stage, but almost no one buys houses based on how many decorations are included with the house... except all of the House Flipper game's buyers apparently.
[*]So many bugs and awkward UI issues that you end up having to waste money in-game to get around those things. Examples: placed a shower in an orientation the devs didn't expect? Have to cancel your assembly, sell it, and buy another in their preferred orientation since you're stuck unable to click on anything during the assembly. Or perhaps you're trying to sell a hundred cups and dishes littered across a kitchen cabinet, and just miss one by a pixel and accidentally sell the entire kitchen cabinet? What you earned from selling it won't cover what you have to pay to put it back. Oops. Or selling junk on a window sill, but accidentally sell the window itself? Then you have to buy a new window, break out the wall again, etc. Geees. Users should be able to set a sell amount to trigger a warning yes/no dialog on the sell gun on the fly. That would be a good use of the mouse wheel to select between preset limits or to turn off the warning.
[*]It won't matter if you've spent time selecting the right, tasteful and/or elegant colors for walls, furniture, etc., because buyers don't care. You could throw down a hot pink sofa on top of a green carpet, in front of striped purple walls, and buyers will still pay the same price. Long story short: your style or palette decisions make no difference.
[*]Walls do not block line of sight, meaning you can clean the inside of the house from the outside and vice versa.
[*]Changing the assembly difficulty does nothing, as assembly steps still the same for many (most) items.
[*]Assembly of one shower might be super quick, while another is exponentially more tedious. Why? Makes no sense at all. Same with so many other items. One sink is a few clicks, and another is a tedious click-fest. There's no rhyme or reason to the assembly. I'm not even going to mention how out of touch with reality any of the assembly is since this is a game.
[*]Once you've mastered all of the skills, there's really no reason to keep using them. You can just clean up and flip a house with just your cleaning skill and make money and get the sell X number of houses achievement.
[*]Achievements are not localized, meaning to unlock anything with a monetary value in the achievement is set to Euro. So you're forced to change your money type to Euro if you want to track that.
[*]No grid or any assistance to help you line up placement of items. Good luck adding a dozen overhead ceiling lights and getting them lined-up to look perfect.
[/list]

I got all of the achievements in the core game except for the 'sell 50 houses'. I was about 30-some houses (easy to get), but I stopped when I realized all of the DLC is tied to the Steam Achievements, so you can never get 100% unless you buy their DLC. No thanks, time to uninstall and then remove it from my library permanently. But hey, at least for the super cheap price I paid for it, I did get some fun out of it for 70-some hours in decorating houses more than flipping them. But the mechanics of assembly, repairs, painting, and tiling become tedious over time. And then eventually you get tired of the limited furniture/decoration supplied.

My advice for those looking at this title for the first time many years after release: if you get it on sale and enjoy decorating and laying out houses, have some fun it, but don't bother with any of the DLC. Because by the time you get around to playing the DLC you're already tired of the game.",1691438614,1691439022,False,5,0,0.596273303031921387,0,True,False,False

You buy houses cheap, fixing them up, then sell them to buyers. You are also offered jobs cleaning up, fixing, and renovating houses. This is a great way to not only make some money early in the game, but they also unlock additional features in the game. 

The buyers give you feedback (very poorly formulated and inaccurate feedback, often the same thing in both the negative and positive categories) to guide you regarding how you can increase the property value by tailoring things to their individual needs. Sadly, these include being told that a family needs 3 kids rooms, not just 2, then that there aren't kids' rooms. You can get rid of the kitchen, and the game still has feedback from a buyer that he doesn't need the kitchen. What kitchen?? In one house, a kitchen didn't even exist, ever! You add a bedroom, but there's still no bedroom. You have a ton of chifferrobes, dressers, etc, but a buyer will complain that there is no place to put his clothes. You can add a ton of storage to a house, yet every single room gives you the fresh feedback that there isn't room to store stuff, you add things, then OH! There's storage space. Next room, same thing all over again. When you delete the TV from the bedroom, the buyer will thank you and say now he can sleep in peace, but still have feedback complaining that there is a TV in the bedroom. 

The garden add-on: The text says that winning a garden contest you get a percent of the sales price. Instead of adding that to the sales price, it magically appears in your balance. There are several aspects that weren't thought through. The garden concepts are, let us say, interesting. Apparently the ""typical"" American garden has pine trees, a pool, and a grill. You need to have the internet description open for the gardens to get a decent amount of points on these.

The English is absolutely wretched in some cases and okay in others. A snow globe is labelled as a snowball, for example. The answer from the dev team is that you should work for free giving them your expertise. In my case, I use my 8 years of university training to get paid to clean-up people's English, translate between German and English, and write technical documentation, so why would I donate my time and expertise to a game that I paid money to play?

The dev team's concepts of what America and Americans are like is extremely odd. I say this as a military brat, who lived all over the US as a child (20 schools). The game seems to have been developed by Scandinavians, which would be great, if they hadn't chosen to set it in the USA. You'll find their requirements for rooms to qualify as a certain room type to be extremely frustrating. The forums are full of complaints regarding this topic.

The game would be fun and fulfilling, if you weren't struggling with so many bugs, trying to figure out what is meant with the language in so many places, and it didn't lag so hard.

I read many negative reviews lately because of all the bugs Farm DLC has - or is supposed to have. So I was very hesitant at first to buy the DLC. 
I dared to try anyways and after three or fours hours I can tell you that I have encountered, if any, only minor bugs. Sometimes the game seems to lag in reaction, for example I went outside, but my tool wheel was still showing the inside tools, so I had to go back in and out again to make the game realize where I am. That happened exactly ONCE. There are other such little things occasionally, but other than that, everything works fine. 
I've done a couple of jobs, I've worked on some of my own projects, and encountered no mayor problems. 
The game runs smoothly and I also have no issues with performance, even though I don't have a high-end gaming PC. 
It seems to me though that for some reason there are people who have a lot of issues whereas others don't have any. So if you were able to play the game without (bigger) problems, I'm confident Farm DLC will not break anything for you. 
That being said, the DLC brings many nice new things and tools. I actually like the grabbling hook (or what it's called), but I'd still love to be able to chance existing houses (not sure if this is supposed to work? But I couldn't change anything, or at least I haven't found out yet how). I have not yet tried the whole ""your own farm"" thing, but I will next time I play. 

(original review below)

If you have ever played the Sims and thought, why do I have to play with the avatar, just let me continue building houses (mansions... castles...), this game is totally for you.

Only this is much more realistic because you are IN the house and if this were in VR, you'd probably at some point wonder, why the hell did I give up my office job?! Unless, of course, your dream job always was to be a handiman or the like.

Yes, this gets repetitive after a while, but before it does, it gets addictive, so while you notice that the houses you can buy to renovate are the same ones you did before in your email jobs, it's still loads of fun to just, well, create. Create your dream house, get wild with the interior, put things where and how you usually never would (or your better half wouldn't let you...), try out colors and color combinations...

And whatever you do - have FUN. Because with this one, you definitely can.

It's relaxing, you can stop at any time, or you can spend hours upon hours with it. Gameplay and controls are simple after you've gotten the hang of it, graphics are great and realistic, and birds will sing for you... Well sometimes I turn the ambient volume down, I admit it, these critters are loud.

Only the buyers can be a bit annoying at times, because they comment on things that don't happen, or make no sense, because they complain about dirt while you are just in the progress of cleaning... but you learn to ignore them, do your thing, and sell just another house (must be the 20th...30th...50th or so) to the Donald Trump lookalike (seriously, he does).

Tl;dr - if you enjoy building and creating, just get it. You won't regret it.",1609691072,1690807334,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

However since downloading all the DLC I have had several glitches. I cannot touch anything in my office otherwise I can no longer play or do anything, without having to restart the game. I really love this game but would love to see some updates improving glitches in the game. I really want to play but it makes it hard when I cant do anything in my office without glitches. As well Ive had where I've placed objects in other houses and they dont appear but the money disappears. Hoping for some improvements.

To say I love this game is an understatement. Even before Farm Flipper came out I was already using all kinds of community creations to make extensions.

The basic premise is that you make old/bad houses better and on face value that sounds boring but in this game it really isn't, there are multiple houses you can buy, renovate, sell etc and with all the items, paint, layout plans you can really make your self become a true house flipper.
At some times the game may feel a bit repetitive on some of the more bigger maps and it does take some time whilst working on the house flipping aspect of the game, especially if you're trying to get all the achievements it may be difficult to be able to get all of them because everyone has different things that they like and dislike.

Overall House Flipper is a fun game that makes what many see as a tedious task into a fun game where you can build the house of your dreams or a poorly built shack and that's what I think makes this game really shine out.

If you’re a Sims gamer who spends most of their time building/renovating houses, this game is for YOU.

What I like:
- The creative freedom when renovating and selling properties.
- All the choices in furniture, paint, wall/floor panels/tiles - there’s a lot to choose from (even with just the base game!)
- The game mechanics are easy to get used to.
- I like the email messages that clients send you. Their stories add a personal touch.

Updates I hope to see eventually (especially for the second game coming out!):
- I wish the loading screens that pop up when you enter properties were updated to show the progress you made so far. It’s kind of annoying looking at a picture of what a property used to look like - with torn up furniture, dirt on the walls, and trash everywhere. I want to be reminded of all the hard work I’ve put in when continuing a project!
- I wish the before & after photos feature was included in the base game. You need the HGTV DLC to have this. :( There’s also not enough before & after pictures that get taken, in my opinion. I’ve ended up just snapping some screenshots of my own.

Overall, this is a solid cozy and relaxing game to play while listening to some music, a podcast, or audiobook. Super intrigued to see what the second game will be like! But for now, I’m happy to play this one for hoursss.",1690241520,1690241571,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I love all of the new DLC that has been added since I made my original review!  Lots of beautiful houses, colors, and decor to play around with, and I'm glad they made it where you can change stairs, at least in the newer homes.  

The Pet DLC is cute, although for a while there the pets would get stuck on floors, unable to go up and down the stairs before they added their ability to ""teleport"" up and down.  Cats weren't able to use the wall cat furniture for a while, but now they can.  The pets do still get stuck in places every now and then, which spams the ""pet can't reach location"" error, but it seems to happen less than before.

The only complaint that I have now is that the game is MASSIVE, which causes a lot of lag, freezing, and crashes.  Fully installed and actively played, this game takes up more space than my MMORPGS and lengthy open world RP games, and because of this I only install it when I'm actively playing it.  It's weird that the space used goes down when I uninstall and reinstall the game, even though nothing inside the game has changed.  I'm not sure if it's holding onto every single auto-save the game performs, but that's the only thing I can think of.

I have the upcoming House Flipper 2 game on my wish list, and hope that it comes with improvements on compression to take up less space and have less lag and crashes.

I still recommend this game, I only suggest that players maybe not hold onto as many houses as I do, since I've noticed the lag is a bit less when I have less ""owned"" houses.  I love to flip back and forth between houses and try different things with each, so I always have a few of my favorite houses/floor plans to do so.

__________________________________________________________________________

I love this game.  It's relaxing to take a house that is in rough shape, clean it up, repair it, and make it look amazing, inside and out.  The garden package is great too as you can really spruce the place up and give it great appeal to buyers, or keep it for yourself.  ;)

However, there's a few complaints that I have.  First, there are some walls that you just can't tear down, no matter how much you'd like to, and it's not limited to the exterior walls, which would be nice to build onto a house.  Second, you cannot change the appearance of the stairs in any house, and the wood does not match floor options that you have.  This is made even uglier if the stairs have a runner carpet as those are always dated looking and clash with most all of the options you have, especially if you prefer a modern look.  And third, some houses have cars in their garages, but not all of them.  And while you can move these cars around or sell them, you can't buy a car to replace it or to put in any of the other garages of houses without cars.  I know that's just a minor annoyance and doesn't really affect the house restoration, but it's just something that would be nice to have!  Honestly it wouldn't bother me if there had been no houses with cars, but when they dangle that out there and don't offer it as an option for other homes, or alternative vehicles to park in all these empty garages, it makes me sad.  :'(",1631815730,1690206222,True,19,0,0.731367528438568115,0,True,False,False

Basically the shadows in this game go all sorta wonky when you tear down a wall and rebuild the rooms. Light seem to pass through walls and floors and throws all sorta weird immersion breaking shadows. Only way past it is to turn them completely off which makes the game just look meh. 

And also some houses seem like they weren't even designed with remodeling of rooms in mind. The big wintery house.. the metal beams it has cannot be removed. And if you remove a wall attached to them their graphics just break. It's like it wasn't intended.

House Diversity: 8/10
Decoration Options: 9/10
User Interface: 8/10
Bug-free: 9/10
Graphics & Sound Design: 10/10
Controls: 9/10

HOUSE DIVERSITY. Mostly, there are quite a few options. For the base game, though, some of the quests can be really repetitive (I think I got the same house for Christmas at least 3 times). At that point it's just work, not fun. But I enjoyed the others, especially ones from the Luxury and HGTV DLCs. Those were a lot of fun and had many more options for house type, location, work orders, etc.

DECORATION OPTIONS. For the most part, there is a wide range of things to choose from, especially if you get the DLCs (I got Luxury, Cyberpunk, HGTV, and Apocalypse). However, some items I just didn't quite jive with, and I couldn't find options for what I wanted in a certain house (i.e., not enough tall openable window options, and can't modify/build roofs). This could be a feature I hope they add in the future or to its sequel. Overall, though, I made some spaces I really enjoyed and felt at home in.

USER INTERFACE. Easy to use and looks pretty good, though I'd add better functionality to the shop so you could exit/go back more smoothly between pages. It's also really hard to tell what items look like in the store, and you can't always preview them properly. The paint is the worst - I had to buy all the shades of a color just to figure out what was already painted in a house (I never found the right shade).

BUGS. Overall, smooth game. There were a few issues I ran into, but none were game breaking that I recall. In any case, it wasn't significant enough for me to remember!

GRAPHICS & SOUND DESIGN. Though it's an older game, it looks and sounds good. It's satisfying to look at the furniture and textures, especially the modern styles. The music is nice to listen to and not as repetitive as some games, though eventually I did turn it off. The cleaning and painting sounds are really satisfying, too - it's almost ASMR for people who love tidying.

CONTROLS. Pretty intuitive and smooth. I like that you can improve your skills and therefore paint/build/modify multiple wall pieces at a time. One thing I disliked at times was that placement was a little off - some things would be just barely off-centered (I'd pull my hair out), or I couldn't get things to line up, or items just wouldn't fit in a room. Their sizing needs to be adjusted a bit better to fit things in the rooms.",1689974580,1689974624,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

I'm so glad that I did!  I've enjoyed a few other simulator games, but none like this - I'm addicted!  Want a rose garden?  Plant one!  Want an amazing yard?  Landscape to your wee heart's content!  Don't like the interior layout?  Change it up!  I love having a plethora of options and variations on the old standards.  
I've always had a design/decorating bug, and now I get to feed that need, as often as I like.  I also have a new  (and so far very effective!) OCD tamer.  I find myself eager to see new listings, and I get impatient between houses, because there's always something else that comes to mind for the next project.  I haven't had such a level of excitement and eagerness to carry on, in a very long time, and I greatly enjoy feeling that way about a game, again.

First, you renovate a house to make it look awesome to your tastes, and you barely make any money. Then you figure out what the buyers are into, and you figure out how to game the system to maximize your profits. You no longer feel like you're renovating houses, but this is what flipping houses is IRL too, right? A nice unintentional commentary on ruining historical homes from the 20's through 40's to sell to the tasteless with inheritance housing funds. Once you've sold all the houses and have more money than you'd ever need, you can re-buy the houses and make them suited to your own personal tastes again.

People online seem to love the Pets and the Farms/Garden DLCs. I skipped those and went for the HGTV one and Luxury (because I really wanted to do the Yacht). They were worth it. I don't know who those HGTV weirdos are but the houses are neat that they've added, I like that we get some older colonial-style architecture. I don't like pets or gardening so I'm gonna keep skipping those.

The architecture in this game feels very restrictive. My dream would be to renovate (in-game, not IRL) Craftsman homes from the 20s, the Sears homes from the 30s, and the wartime 40's duplexes you find in major US cities that existed before, well, California. No shotgun shacks either, which feels wasted. I also love the 60's and 70's style one-story bungalows that are noticeably absent from this game as well. The colonial homes from the HGTV expansion are nice but I feel like we're missing a huge slice of Americana with this. The homes in the base game feel very samey to me.

I also come back to missing walls, sections of paint, etc. The most recent and most annoying one put my shower, toilet, washer, and sink into the same corner of the bathroom all on top of each other. The only thing I could do was sell them all and start over. The living room is missing walls and several squares of paint all over the ceiling. I'll need to not only spend money for more walls, but buy a whole new can of paint to fill the spaces. Needless to say I'm gonna have to give the game a break because I'm pretty pissed. This happens frequently, but this time I was very meticulous about the work I did to this particular house, so it actually hurts to have to redo it.",1689134386,1689134386,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I found the beginning to be very boring but after getting through all the ""busywork"" jobs and now buying and flipping actual houses, the game feels much more involved and creative. I usually spend about an hour per house. There's also some really fun houses referencing other games and pop culture to explore. As a side tip for those achievement hunting, make sure to change your in-game currency to Euro if you're from the US, as the achievements track in Euros and not dollars- I negotiated a sale for over $50k per the achievement, but it didn't trigger because the exchange rate is different.

Ingredients
120g butter, softened
75g light brown sugar
75g golden caster sugar
1 medium egg
1 tsp vanilla extract
180g plain flour
½ tsp bicarbonate of soda
150g dark chocolate, cut into chunks

Method
STEP 1
Heat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4 and line two baking sheets with parchment. Cream the butter and sugars together until very light and fluffy, then beat in the egg and vanilla. Once combined, stir in the flour, bicarb, chocolate and ¼ tsp salt.

STEP 2
Scoop 10 large tbsps of the mixture onto the trays, leaving enough space between each to allow for spreading. Bake for 10-12 mins or until firm at the edges but still soft in the middle – they will harden a little as they cool. Leave to cool on the tray for a few mins before eating warm, or transfer to a wire rack to cool completely. Will keep for three days in an airtight container.

-Decent value, many hours of gameplay and replayability.
-A wonderful way to find a creative outlet or just relax.
-A large and varied workshop with new designs/furniture/decorations to download.
-Devs that are active and involved. We get constant updates, new content, improvements, competitions and player input.
-Great DLCs.
-Unique gameplay.
-Plenty of different properties to flip.

CONS

-UI can be a bit funky at times, but they've been slowly improving it.
-You can't build your own house from scratch. You can add or break interior walls, however the outside walls cannot be moved, only decorated.
-You can't visit previous houses you've flipped unless you don't sell, but you can replay old jobs.
-It's highly recommended you play with the DLCs, as the quality of decorations and furniture is significantly higher.
-If you want to run the game to look pretty, your pc is gonna get HOT.
-The buyer needs are a bit strange to design for at times, but personally I just ignore this feature and design what I want.",1661223627,1689116501,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

this is a little gem to enjoy and relax while still doing something good.
You can be creative, clean, destroy, buy houses for your own or to gain money and there is a lot of cute events bond to happen (if you buy DLC´s).

But listen guy´s! There is soon House Flipper 2 to come out!!!
It will be better in Quality and there will be more realistic way´s of cleaning, easier way of changing color´s more stuff to pick and place etc. And a Sandmode to build a house from the very beginning.

So choose wisely if you wanna play a game with some not perfect gaming abilitie´s or a game where you can place everything everywhere etc?

I could not wait, I tryed very long to wait and after I read the next is coming out with better placing ability´s I wanted to wait. even more.. but as you can see I could not endure it anymore.

After 31 hours of playing I am happy, this is a game I play when I just don´t know what else to play.
You have many color´s to pick from you can put lots of things on the table of your customer and realize that his home is way more beautiful than your own and that you totally forgot to keep in mind how much you gain for this job and what you invested in his house.^^

Of course you beginn in a ""little house"" that doesn´t look like much it´s still charming^^
You get to know the mechanic stepp by stepp and with dlc´s a bit hard to make decesion where do I go first.

My advice:
1. Go in the Settings and change the way of how you clean the window (yes you start as a cleaner).
Add it to your mouse speed.
2. Change the automatic save to ""30 Min"" to avoid little bugs or the feeling that your game may crush.
But remember to always go over Exit Game and say ""Yes save and close down"".
3. There is a variety to pick ""hands"" from.
Very funny when its hallooween or christmas just take your time and look around.
4. If you can´t handle the look of Cockroaches you can change their appearance to glas.
5. The Dev´s still support their game with new DLC´s and items!
(In the workshop you will find tons of things too, the maker did a quite good job! Cheer to community^^)
6. Press F on the keyboeard to activate your flash! (The game told me too but only after I had the third night job done^^)
7. The DEV still support this game with DLC´s some extra for Event´s like Christmas etc.

There is so much I could tell you but than we would never be able to stopp talking^^
Look at some screenshots or youtube video and wait till an event comes so it´s cheaper if you end up buying it like me, wink.

Thanks for the Dev´s whisper I found this new game ""Honeycomp"" and added it to my poor wishlist.

IThx for this game and wish all who will buy or already have lots of gaming fun.

Greetings a big fan

The paintbrush was so hard to control, it felt like I was trying to draw with a wet noodle. The paint ran out so fast, I had to keep buying more cans.

The controls are easy to learn.  The jobs in game serve as a tutorials to show what you can do with your tools, as well as helping you to earn money to buy houses and maybe giving you a few ideas.  There are all kinds of settings, including being able to change certain disgusting insects into pieces of glass, as well as a heads-up that this setting is available shortly before you have to deal with said problem for the first time.

There are times where it may feel a bit monotonous-- clean another window, scrub more dirt off the floor.  I actually enjoy putting on some music or a podcast to listen to while I play, to make things go quicker, especially for the more fiddly jobs.

I'll discuss the overall game and the DLC's and the recent issues. 

[b] Initial Impression and Gameplay [/b]

When I first purchased House Flipper, I was immediately captivated by its fun and rewarding gameplay mechanics.  The satisfaction of transforming run-down properties into beautiful homes kept me hooked for hours on end.  With four successful playthroughs under my belt, I can confidently say that the game offers a substantial amount of content to keep players engaged. 

[b] The Garden DLC [/b]

The Garden DLC stand out as a valuable addition to the game, providing an array of enjoyable outdoor tasks, such as mowing lawns, planting flowers, and designing picturesque landscapes.  The added jobs and customisation options offer a fresh perspective on home renovation, enhancing the overall gameplay experience.  If you enjoy beautiful outdoor spaces, the Garden DLC is a worthwhile investment. 

[b] The HGTV DLC [/b]

While the HGTV DLC introduced exciting new jobs and choices, it fell slightly short of expectations.  The houses and choices available lacked the visual appear and variety anticipated.  Nevertheless, the DLC still provided some enjoyable moments, even if it didn't quite live up to its potential.  If you're a dedicated fan of House Flipper, it may be worth exploring the HGTV DLC for it's unique tasks and challenges. 

[b] Luxury DLC [/b]

The Luxury DLC fell somewhat short in delivering the expected level of opulence.  While the new features were enjoyable, the lack of extensive furniture, flooring, and wall options restricted the true luxurious experience.  Despite this, the DLC did offer amazing houses that are worth flipping. 

[b] Pets DLC [/b]

This is my favourite DLC, it delivered its promise of adorable animals and well-designed houses.  The addition of pets adds an extra layer of charm and emotional connection to the game. It is definitely one of the DLC's worth investing in for a heartwarming and delightful experience. 

[b] Technical Issues and Concerns [/b]

While House Flipper initially provided a smooth and enjoyable gameplay experience, the addition of the workshop feature has introduced some maintenance issues.  Even with a limited number of workshop items, the game suffers from extended loading times, severe lag, and occasional crashes.  Deleting workshop items seemed to alleviate these problems, but it's disheartening to see the game's performance decline over time.  Moreover, recent reports of crashes, lags, and unaddressed issues in the Farm DLC indicate a concerning trend, leaving players to question the developer's commitment to resolving these technical issues,  as I do personally believe they are focusing on House Flipper 2 they are attempting to put out by next year.  

[b] Conclusion [/b]

House Flipper offers an engaging and satisfying renovation experience, with DLCs like the Garden and Pets providing substantial value and enjoyable content.  However, the game's overall experience has been marred by recent technical issues and lack of prompt resolutions.  It is disheartening to witness the game's decline as the developer shifts focus to House Flipper 2.  Hopefully, the developers will address these concerns and ensure that House Flipper maintains its status as an exceptional home renovation simulator.

+Beautiful graphics
+Playable on low-end PCs
+High replayability
+Average game time of each job
+Easy to learn
+Great DLCs 

-Worth the price if it's on sale
-Minor bugs

If you don't have a low-end PC, I would recommend waiting for House Flipper 2 to come out and buy that instead.

This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join.

Lots of jobs to do, and you can always re-do them later, if you want. I've never gotten to the point where I'd have sold all of the houses once (they have kept adding houses, making it more and more time-consuming), but one day I will manage it.

Low key as much as i like this game for what it is. If you don't get the DLC Just don't get the game. It's basically unplayable without the DLC.
Oh you wanna mow the grass outside of your house or maybe plant some stuff to make it look nicer outside
Garden DLC
Oh you wanna design a pet room or a barn because you love animals irl and want that for your in-game house
Pet and farm DLC
Oh you completed literally every mission in the game and now want more cool unique stuff that you can design around that isn't a moon base or the 2 free DLC stuff
Luxury DLC
This game for me has the Sims model of game purchasing. If you aren't gonna get the DLC just don't get the game. Most of the fun of flipping houses comes from the DLC content and honestly that doesn't really affect my review.
I played 16 hours of the game (almost straight with a 2 hour nap between 8 hour sessions) without the DLC. I just picked it up after I looked it up and realized I couldn't cut my grass without the DLC. The last 3 hours (posted at 18.9 hours btw) have opened my eyes to the fact that just like the sims everything is cut off by expensive DLC. It isn't awful though the base game without the DLC's is fun for probably 20-30 hours but if you wanna get indepth into the gameplay loop and really experience it you really do need that stuff. The DLC's do add missions that are fun as hell ngl but alot of the stuff just feels like it should be in base game (IE; Grappling hook, scaffolding, lawnmower). But besides those flaws the game is fun for what it is, build dream houses for yourself and your friends and flip them to make a profit or just keep them to take cool screenshots of. Its 3d sims without the character creator. Honestly I love it but you might not because of the price tag so just beware.",1688126646,1688126646,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

If you do find that enjoyable though this game is for you. Especially if you get all of the expansion packs, though I would recommend waiting until they go on sale as I find that they're a little over priced normally for what they are and what they bring to the main game. Where the main gameplay loop is fairly solid in its completed state there are several jobs in the dlc where things can get a little wonky. 

The pets in the pet dlc sometimes get stuck in the ground, and become uninterruptible unless you send them to the hotel and retrieve them. Something similar happens with the farm animals in the Farm DLC but they get outside of the fence boundary and can sometimes walk through solid objects. 

I found the Farm and Pets dlc's a little strange to add into this particular game. The pets are very cute and are enjoyable in small doses, but I don't find that they add anything to my gameplay. The Farm DLC is even stranger asking you to run a farm, grow crops and raise animals, a far departure from renovating houses.

Pros.

Easy on the eye graphics.
Simplistic game design.
Sound design is peaceful.
Very mellow and chilled game to play.
Very relaxed atmosphere and mindless chilling.

Cons,

The fact that when you buy this game you are getting 1/4 of the content.
3/4 of the content is locked behind PAID DLC.
You can produce a lovely house, all be it with limited options, but lovely, but if you want to do the garden, even mow the lawn, yup, gotta pay for the DLC.
That's right kids, you have to pay, to mow grass in an already pricey game.
The content in the base game is repetitive as are the options for decoration.
DLC content is shown when renovating as a sly way to get you to buy.


Look, this game is great don't get me wrong.

But the fact that it has about as much content as a glorified demo is just hard to look past.

Since when did indie developers who clearly have a great deal of talent start to play the games of AAA publishers?

I shouldn't have to pay upwards of £30 to enjoy a game which already cost me £15.

I really wish I could give this a recommendation but with how this game works and how limited it in actuality is, is quite the downer. It's okay - but that's about it.

[b]Pros:[/b]
+ You get to furnish homes
+ Items can be rotated in almost any way you want
+ Quite a bit of items
+ Ability points that make it possible to work faster and more efficiently

[b]Cons:[/b]
- gets repetitive very easily
- assembling of items is just click & hold (actual active participation like mini-games would make it more fun maybe, or even needing to rotate your mouse or something - just SOMETHING)
- Window cleaning is very wonky (why can't we just clean them with the damn mop)
- no freedom in customer jobs (I wanna make houses prettier, not uglier - thank you)
- a lot of the patterns are outright hideous (my condolences)
- shop categories are weirdly scattered
- paint colors are missing from their respective categories, but can be found from the overall paint category
- colors wrongly titled (pink being purple, green being yellow etc.)
- main dude walks over anything and everything, getting stuck between a lamp and a coffee table
- items don't move along the furniture they're on top of, they just fall down and you gotta rearrange them again

The devs were also nice enough to include different versions of the launcher to attempt to make sure more people can play / enjoy the game. Mind you, this is also in addition to the in-game graphics / display settings. Not a lot of companies do that.

Starting off, on the first levels I said that this game is one of the most relaxing games, also bought some DLC after finished the main game. But god, this game shouldn't left early, this game should be in some alpha or smth. Besides the poor optimization this game has(because fuck it, I can play it on 50 fps on 2070), these are some of the worst mood-killers of this game:
- crashes, it crashes a lot
- when exploring the map, sometimes it gets stuck and won't move
- when placing items from inspirations, they disappear, sometimes they are marked even as placed
- placing doors doesn't really register them inside the room
- placing tiles, sometimes it will place them on the other room, ruining its painting
- after placing an item from inspiration, the recommendation circle still remains and the item appears like it wasn't placed at all(yeah, I really wanted to do 100% on all jobs, but couldn't because of this bug)
- when gardening and digging, you always have to press E to dig for EACH plant, it means that when you have 20 plants in a row, you cannot shovel them all, you always have to press E before each plant, WITH THE SHOVEL IN THE HAND LOL, at least hide it
- and much more little things which personally, it annoyed me and made me write this review.

NOTE: It's not always happening, but it's starting to get really frustrating because I want to play this game to relax, not to annoy me. And most of the bugs appeared after the installation of the DLCs, they should firstly fix the bugs, THEN RELEASE another DLC. Also saw in some reviews that the dev team consists in 10 persons, but that doesn't matter, you assume this, you keep the game in alpha until it's good enough.

Putting these bugs aside, things that mattered the most to me were:
- great graphics(especially the lighting, it looks stunning)
- a very large variety of items and colors
- love the way you can customize your own home/garden
- something which other games do not have, that's why I kept playing in the first place

Overall, the game should've stayed in early(don't even know if it even was) and warning its users that sometimes, the game doesn't really work like a game. I hope that House Flipper 2 will be better, because without those little bugs, the game would be perfect.

EDIT  1: After writing this review, I jumped into the game, guess what, it got stuck when loading a mission LOL.

EDIT 2: Ah it seems that I cannot play that mission anymore, it just keeps getting stuck in loading screen when resuming a mission from Luxury pack. Also saw on internet that I wasn't the only one. Great.",1687631696,1687636334,False,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

i have an interface suggestion, which is that i wish the eyeview camera was a wider angle one. especially when working with large objetcs (ie. pool), the camera angle is smaller than the object itself so i don't know where i'm going or where to decently place the object. (in the garden dlc, there are green-glowing specified slots in which you have to place certain objects. i have had to sell the pool i had just installed because it falls out of the area, which is because i can't see where i'm walking to begin with)
i understand that maybe the camera is at such an angle to represent the human eye as realistically as possible, but realistically speaking it doesn't take me three digs and a click to install a pool. so maybe sometimes it's helpful to stretch the concept 'realistic'.
given all of this, the game is one of my all time favorites. never change!!!! (except the camera thing)

I was running it on high settings, which given my hardware (5700X processor and AMD 6600 GPU) I thought would be acceptable. Game frequently tanked in framerate when opening various UI elements, which is really weird because I would think those might be the least demanding elements, but that's one aspect I didn't like. The gameplay felt too slow. Picking up items takes too long for me to find any joy in rearranging and organising stuff, cleaning feels fine but painting feels even slower. 

Those sections where you install and repair stuff like radiators or electrical sockets, most of them I can skip by holding the mouse button down. I thought there'd be puzzle elements when I first saw these where I'd have to memorise how these are put together, but no, I just hold a mouse button - very non-engaging. Personally, I'd either have them be fully interactable or have an option to skip this altogether. Perhaps the option to have them complete themselves by just holding down a button is more accessible to those with motor disabilities, but it takes tooooo loooong for me, personally.

Maybe behind all of this there is truly an immersive game, maybe the other reviews are truly genuine about that.

There's a lot of initial renovations and jobs for you to do to get a good hang of the game. I feel like there's plenty of variety in the problems and what people are looking for also. Of course, there's nothing super crazy and out there with just the base game, but I've had a lot of fun. I didn't encounter many bugs, just one obvious one. If the house had a bathroom with fixtures already there (shower, sink, toilet) it would all teleport outside of the house. You would need to go in and manually sell those original ones and replace them, but it wasn't a big deal to me, just annoying when I liked the set up of the original room and suddenly it's gone.

Adding things from the workshop has also elevated this game to a huge degree.

1. House dirty
2. *mop noises*
3. House clean
OR THAT’S WHAT THE GAME WANTS YOU TO THINK
It’s a slippery slope from “I want to remove that can from this kitchen floor” to “Damn this room could really use some teal heron wallpaper matched with sea breeze paint and a cool oak dresser”
This game made me buy an expansion pack that allows me to mow lawns. I own a virtual lawnmower. My own mother came and asked me for something and I said “hold up let me just mow this lawn” and she looked at me like I was out of my mind. I am out of my mind. I could be playing house flipper right now.
But if you think this is just a relaxing renovation game then think again, for you are rewarded if you sell to every possible buyer and Giorgio wants two baths and no kitchen so I made a house with two baths and no kitchen and THE LOVELY ELDERLY COUPLE STILL BOUGHT IT. I made a nice house for the young couple with the baby and it was bought by Dolan Trund. Yes. Dolan Trund. I also essentially sold a sex dungeon to a man called Jimmy Traitor who whenever I place a child’s object in any house I am building tells me “Those aren’t my kind of toys”. 
I’m forever struggling to understand why the one potted cactus makes the house instantly more appealling to the “I like creative disaster” woman and why everybody is so horny about bookshelves, why the room that has been a living room for the past half an hour is suddenly classed as a kitchen oh god Giorgio’s pissed at me again.
Lovely and relaxing and calming I may say, but then again they give you a hammer and there are walls, you can take out *whatever you like on them*. You can knock all of the walls down, you can sell the doors, you can sell the WINDOWS, you can make the worst house in the history of houses ever created and the AIs will still buy it for a profit.
I built a house and filled it with baths. Just baths. Only baths. It was chaotic. It was brilliant. Jimmy Traitor bought it? What does he want with all these baths? Is 2 the limit for Giorgio?
Let’s not even speak about the gardening DLC in which you are graded on coverage and variety of plants which increases the house sales price yes I’d like to mention the £200,000 profit I made on a property because I *ran around their lawn randomly placing daffodils for an hour* Oh and forget the confusing logic behind the animal crossing shovel, the house flipper shovel has SEEN THINGS. 
But seriously, I love this game so much, it has so many different things going for it and you can be as chill or as serious as you want to be. I am freed from the shackles of powerwashing and fully invested in real estate. As somebody who currently can’t do too much because of illness this game… I mowed the lawn mum.
If you need a new game to play and are looking for something different, a little slower maybe, I would recommend this game. FYI it is a bit pants without the DLC but still very playable and enjoyable.

I'm even considering cleaning the windows, which has over 8 years of oil built up from vaping. (strange that the walls don't get that, still beats smoking)

and maybe... JUST maybe... I'll finally get the 10 years of spiderwebs clung to the ceiling, layered so thick, that it's as if a single web spans the entire house.

I have already purchased two corresponding doors within the designated area, but they have not been counted.This request cannot be completed.

(The bug has not been fixed yet)


※Task - 'PITCH PERFECT APARTMENT'.

To this point I've played 333 hours on this game, spent over 30 hours on a farmhouse over the last few days, so I feel I can be more helpful now. 

I think this is probably my favourite game, especially with the creations of Workshop Items (thank you, House Flippers!)
With the addition of the DLCs there is so much that a player can get lost in, whether its doing jobs for others or renovating your own houses (most of my game play has been spent remodelling and selling houses, with very little focus on the jobs, meaning i've still got hours of game content to get to.)

I really want to give the creators a huge nod, they've created a great game, they have a sense of humour with it, they're very attentive to their player base, they're open to feedback and will develop ideas based upon said feedback, whilst communicating about updates. Great!

The DLCs definitely make the game better and add a lot more content, they're on sale so often it's worth purchasing them when you're able to. I'd recommend Farm and Garden Flipper for sure, since the garden is a different design vibe and it's fun. 

The Architect tool is a welcome addition, renovating buildings like Burnt House is a lot more enjoyable because it's not so restrictive thanks to the extra rooms and floors players can add, I was finally able to build an appropriate home for the family of 6! 
Architect also deserves points for ease of use (I should mention I use an xbox controller with my laptop whilst playing this game) and it feels like any other straightforward interface because it could have been awful.

Overall. this is an in-depth, well thought out game, particularly if you're someone that thinks having a To Do List is fun haha! The limits to creativity is down to the player's imagination, the game facilitates numerous ways to approach a renovation creatively, so the length of time spent on a house is up the the individual. 

 This is the nudge for those undecided if they want this game....*booming voice* yes you do, it is worth it and it is a lot of fun and you won't regret it. Do it. Do. It. 

Last fan boy comment - I bloomin' LOVED the Silent Hill house and the Breaking Bad house!! I'm sure there are more references sprinkled throughout the game but the I have so much respect to the developers for that, I was super excited to recreate that home.

Cons / Feedback
I think the roof tool needs some work, it would be better if we could play around with different shapes, or at least paint the underside of the roof so that the overhang isn't bright white. I suspect that's in the pipeline though, knowing how intuitive these developers are.

On the store page - it would be handy to have the 'Last purchased' and 'Recently viewed' fixed to the appropriate store page for items. For example, if I use the Renovation Shop, I would only like to see 'Last purchased' and 'Recently viewed' items from the Renovation category, not mixed amongst sofas and light switches. Vice versa for items purchased in the Interior Design tab. 

I would like to see more variations of curtain styles, whilst the ones in the game are beautiful, they're pretty much the same  styles with a tiny difference. Plus, the Workshop curtains tend to bug when placed in game and can't be opened or closed.  I'd also like to place curtains on any wall, not specifically above a window of corresponding size, this will allow curtains to be used as archways instead of the traditional wooden ones.

The Before/ After pics!! Probably my most disliked element of this game. I wish we were able to set up angle points or frames for the B/A pics because if you forget to take a pic on the in-game tablet, you might as well say goodbye to any decent portfolio shots. 
For example, you gut out and renovate a grubby little house into a masterpiece of a home by adding walls, changing the layout etc, the After shot will be a close up of a wall you installed. Or certain rooms won't be pictured at all and it's so disappointing after spending hours creating a home you're proud of only for the B/A to completely mess up the grand reveal. If you want to go back and look at your portfolio? It's the same terrible in-game pics that you're left with, so I hope you have a good memory.

Lighting - I wish we had more lighting options. Sometimes the design is what you want but the lampshade makes the light come out in jagged lines or boxes, they emit next to no light or they're brighter than the Sun. I wish we could toggle through 'dim/ med/ bright' options because we're also quite limited with choices, given that workshop lights can't currently function in game. 

The Buyers - The buyers are a great guide to have, encouraging players to build family homes to survival bunkers, however, they're annoying. 
They can simultaneously love and hate something about the house... how? and how do i fix it? No clues given. 
It's the same handful of people buying houses, too, the elderly couple own most of the real estate in my game, so it becomes tedious, alternatively, you're spending time creating homes that you don't really like in order to persuade a new buyer purchase one. 
Presumably, if we build it exclusively the way we want, disregarding the demands of the buyers, then the negative points from the buyers will reduce the final offer price? I'd rather a selection of 20 buyers, in which they have more simplistic preferences that are easier to discern. 

The Garden Contest - I wish I was able to submit a nice garden I've made without assigning it to one of the specified categories. Sometimes I'm really proud of the gardens I make but they don't quite fit into any of the categories. so I may only get 25% increase, even though it's a really well made garden. Maybe a more generalised category or additional specific categories so we can spread our wings a little further. 

Either way, the overall pace, style and creativity make this game one of my favourites. Whilst it's got a couple of 'could be better's to it, the list is very small. The positives of this game far outweigh the negatives and I intend on frittering away even more hours of my life on House Flipper 2 when it's released.

I find that it's becoming more and more frustrating with each update I download. The furniture in any given room with ghost out (like it does when placing floor tiles) colors don't match on countertops even though the same color options were chosen.  Sometimes when i set a lamp on the floor to move a table or shelf, the lamp disappears when i try to pick it back up which results in me having to purchase it again. The prices are generally cheap on those things, so it's no big loss, but it is annoying. My biggest thing though is that despite being from HGTV, there are barely any measurements or thought put into how something fits into a space. The sims build mode does better at that... and that's truely saying something since a lot of us know the monstrosity that is the sim4 build mode. If you like designing, i would recommend given some bug fixes.
EDIT to add: Why am a I constantly having to update this thing for DLC I don't have? I haven't played in a while but I keep all my games up to date.

I have about 230+ hours (as of writing this review) and I still have a ton of more houses I can flip (I haven't even flipped all of them yet!). I love the customization of this game. Don't like cockroaches? No problem! You can switch it to broken glass. Don't want manly hands? No problem! You can change your hands to zombie hands, robot hands, farmer hands, etc! Don't want to crap your pants while designing a ""haunted"" Halloween house? No problem! The game gives you the option to turn off spooky effects, which is really nice! Also, this game has really cool ""Easter-egg"" houses from pop-culture TV shows/movies, interesting job stories, and fun mystery/crime styled houses you can clean and flip. 

I currently own all the DLCs and I have to say, if you were going to just buy 1, I would 100% buy the Gardening DLC. This allows you to cut the grass, cut down trees, plant flowers, trees and various bushes outside, put furniture outside, and etc. The ""flip"" feels more complete when the house is fully done (both outside and inside). Also, if your outdoor area fits one of the ""Outdoor themes"" for the gardening contest, it can substantially increase the value of the house, which means more money to design the homes of your dreams! (There are tips online on how you can score great on these contests). If you were going to buy a second DLC, I would recommend the Farming DLC. Even though there are still some bugs since it's new, this allows you to build extensions to a select number of homes, build homes from scratch, and you can unlock tools that will decrease time consuming tasks/ make your life easier, such as the grappling hook, chainsaw, paint gun (for outdoor painting) and etc.

However, the more DLCs you buy, the more cool houses and jobs you can flip and fix up, which is super nice. The Luxury DLC, Pet DLC and Farming DLC have jobs that have an associated story with voice acting, which is cool! The HGTV DLC has  jobs where you are presented with various choices to either save money, or spend a little more to fix up something in particular during the flip. I have played all the jobs in all the DLCs, and they have kept me busy for hours, especially the huge houses. However, I recommend waiting to get the DLCs on sale if you can (That's what I did).

If I had to say something negative about this game, it would be about the amount of buyers available. The way you make the most money is fitting the needs of a particular buyer. For example, some buyers will only want one bedroom, one bathroom, an office, etc. While other buyers will want specific types of rooms (There's guides on Wiki and online for assistance), multiple bedrooms, multiple bathrooms, etc. At first, it's fun trying to get all the achievements and getting all the buyers to buy at least one of the houses you have designed. But after selling a few houses to the same buyers over and over again, it can get repetitive. I hope they will either add more buyers in the future, or add this in the sequel to this game (House Flipper 2). 

Also, something I wish I knew before playing is the Workshop tab. Once you buy and install the game, you can unlock hundreds of amazing community designed furniture, accessories, decorations etc. It's a game changer... and I wish I knew about it in the start! Make sure you check it out, and grab some awesome designs! 

If you like renovating, cleaning, designing and having fun.. you will love this game. But be warned...you will be hooked!",1685761203,1685761203,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Now that EA has ducked up Origin and I can't get Sim 4's building mode, this is my only way to get an anonymous building fix (and honestly Sims does a better job and it's only half the game).

Quiet simply, this game is exorbitantly overpriced.  But wait, you say - it's only $15, you say. Yeah, well - this game is downright unplayable without almost ALL of the pricey DLC so appearances are definitely deceiving on this one. 

I will say the game isn't bad - it's a lot of fun if you like building sims - but the price tag makes it decidedly NOT worth it. Game and controls are SUPER buggy and all the DLC are expensive add-on that should have been in the base game. Don't want the garden to look like shit? Money please. Want to build add-ons to the property? Money please. Want to change roof color or paint the outside of the house? Money please. I mean it's ridiculous. There are some nice extra furniture and features with the DLC, sure - but they're buggy, don't always stack well with the base game and it is really just such a bitter pill at $15 for each subpar DLC on top of the game. If you want a fleshed out game and try to get all useful functions when it's not on sale, that's about 60+ bucks just from DLC shit. 

Are some games work the heavy price tag? Sure. Is this game one of them? Duck no. 

If you can get this during the summer sale or something at an EXTREME discount (no more than $20 with DLC) then yeah, probably worth it. Current price tag? Definitely not. At the end of the day, I like this game and the hefty price tag was worth it to me (look at my play hours) but I need a certain amount of mindless visual stimming and this is it for me. 

For what it is, few players are going to find worth in the game at this price - especially when you could go get Tears of the Kingdom or some other open world beauty for a little bit LESS money.",1685654805,1685654805,False,3,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

Some parts are more fun then others (for example, I love painting the walls and decorating the house). I do have a few suggestions however. 
1: Ability to make renovations to the houses (ie. add rooms on, create a basement, create a garage, add other entrances, add a bunker)
2: More items to the buying menu (there is already A LOT of different items to chose from, but after 7 or 8 houses, you start to lack variety) New furniture, some vehicles, more electronic choices, more little nick-nack decorations, etc.
3: The ability to mix paint colours would be pretty cool.
4: (Corresponds with suggestion 1) Ability to connect basement to a bunker would definitely be a feature I would use frequently.

Maybe also have an option to select certain furnishings, ones that you choose often, the ability to favorite so that they come to the top of the search when you open that folder.

although I do think that there should be some stuff added to the dlcs and the base game.

There's no bugs in the base game but I think there should be a couple more beds or bedroom items specifically for younger kids because I think the game lacks good looking beds for kids and younger kids like babies. 

I think the game would greatly benefit from maybe a dlc that added more houses but they're related more to kids whether the parents are expecting or welcoming their kids home from college, this dlc can help to introduce new things like putting together cribs and other various pieces of furniture, this dlc can also help introduce things like new toys and other items!

DLC reviews - 
pets - 
I started out with the pets dlc and I think it's a great one to start with, however there are definitely some things that need to be added. 
There's a good amount of dog breeds but there should definitely be more, I think there should be more breeds such as pitbulls, bulldogs, boxers, etc

I've seen many good cat breeds, but they should add more breeds like exotics, bobtails and calicos!!

the rodents and fish are good enough but I'm personally not happy with the reptiles or birds, I think the game would definitely benefit from having different kinds of reptiles such as beardies, ball pythons, geckos, etc. The parrots are a huge disappointment because there should be different breeds such as budgies, lovebirds, macaws, etc

overall I do like this dlc but they should also add different bird cages, reptile tanks, and different fish tanks as well as a few new pet items like toys and beds.

Garden dlc - 
I love this dlc! it's so fun, but it needs a few things added to it!

I think there should be a few new plants, whether they're indoor or outdoor plants. I also believe that there should be new outdoor plants such as shaped bushes or flowers. All of the outdoor items are good, I like the fact that you have to assemble almost all of the items. 

I also think that they should add a jobs map like with the other dlcs just so we can get to know some new characters. If that's not possible though it would b nice to see some new jobs!

HGTV dlc - 
I'm absolutely in LOVE with this dlc, the best feature of this dlc is when you're doing some of the jobs the owners will change what they want done with the house. At first it was stressful but then I started to like it because I think it makes the game more realistic. 

Overall the only thing I have to say about this dlc is i wish it had more jobs!! or even another jobs map for it!!

luxury dlc - 
i also LOVE this dlc, the best feature of this dlc is refurbishing the furniture! it's so fun! I wish there were more refurbishing opportunities though!

overall this one is awesome too, I just wish there were more houses or properties, but mainly houses!!

Farm dlc - 
with the farm dlc being so new, I don't expect it to be perfect but there should definitely be some things added, mainly with the animals! The house building feature is awesome! the house decor is great too! 

The problem with the animals is VARIETY!!!

I love the different horses but I think the game would greatly benefit from different breeds that are clearly different from each other. 

The chickens are so cute but I think they're bland!! the dlc would greatly benefit from different breeds such as silkies, plymouth rocks, etc

The pigs and the cows look great but I don't think there should be different breeds but there should definitely be different colorations and there should be bulls, male pigs, and calves should be available to buy as well!!

The sheep, goats, and alpacas are super cute, but there should be males, babies for sale, and different colors!! there should be llamas too but they should be paired in with the alpacas too

I think the dlc would greatly benefit from more animal items being added like things for the goats to climb on, horse toys or items, and other various animal enrichment items!!

overall I love this game and I think it's very fun especially if some of the fan suggestions are added and I would definitely recommend it to everyone, especially some of my favorite DLCS!!!",1658260730,1685118976,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

While the game offers an enjoyable experience and can be a great way to pass the time, it is true that the gameplay can become repetitive if players consistently engage in the same activities at every house. Here's an explanation of why House Flipper can be a fun game but may feel repetitive after a while:

Initial Enjoyment: When players first start playing House Flipper, there is a sense of excitement and satisfaction in transforming rundown properties into beautiful homes. The game offers a wide range of tasks, such as cleaning, painting, and furnishing, which can be engaging and rewarding initially.

Variety of Houses: House Flipper features a variety of houses with different sizes, layouts, and conditions. This diversity allows players to experience various renovation challenges and creative opportunities. Initially, exploring and discovering new houses can keep the gameplay fresh and interesting.

Repetition of Tasks: As players progress and complete more houses, they may find themselves performing similar tasks repeatedly. This repetition can lead to a sense of monotony and make the gameplay feel less exciting and engaging over time. When players find themselves doing the same activities at every house, the game can lose some of its initial appeal.

Limited Depth and Variety: While House Flipper offers a range of activities and customization options, some players may feel that the game lacks depth and variety in the long run. The core gameplay loop of cleaning, renovating, and selling houses can become predictable, especially for those seeking more complex challenges or greater depth in the simulation aspect.

To mitigate the feeling of repetition, House Flipper provides periodic updates and DLCs, introducing new houses, items, and features to expand the gameplay experience. Additionally, players can experiment with different renovation styles, explore creative designs, and set personal goals to keep the experience fresh and engaging.

In conclusion, House Flipper is a fun game that can be enjoyed as a means to pass the time and indulge in virtual home renovation. However, it is not uncommon for players to find the gameplay repetitive after a while, particularly if they continue to engage in the same tasks at every house. Despite this, periodic updates and personal creativity can help mitigate the feeling of repetition and keep the game enjoyable for those who appreciate the simulation and creative aspects of home renovation.",1684554500,1684554500,True,66,6,0.8185843825340271,3,True,False,False

Had to install mods there in order to clean up ALL the trash and get buildings that actually look like they're not made of rotting timbers, and the physics were always janky anyway on the non-flat ground. None of that is a problem here! Interface is intuitive, and I'm enjoying leveling up my skills to do things better as I go.

Also, I live in California, and the two hours I've spent in this game's tutorial so far is the most I've seen radiators in my entire life. Are they really this common in other parts of the country? Places that actually build houses out of bricks, I guess. Luckily, the buyers don't seem to actually care whether there are radiators or not, so I just sell them when flipping a house and stop thinking about it.

I wish the game made it easier to find furniture and other things I'm looking for in the shop. Let me mark favorite items, or hide things I never want to use ever. Give items tags so I know what the buyers consider ""modern"" vs ""old fashioned"" and let me search and filter for those!

I also wish there was some better help for aligning objects with walls or other objects. It's especially frustrating when I'm trying to do something like making sure the dining table is centered under the ceiling lamp -- I can't see the lamp when I'm moving the table, and vice versa. A way to lock on to a measurement in order to align the edges as is standard in actual design software would go a long way. And why is it so hard to line furniture up with walls? I shouldn't even be able to preview an item passing through a wall. I know the game can do it because some of the new expansion items do this well! Just make it apply to all of the base game items too!

And I'm still not sure what exactly I'm accomplishing when installing a washer. (No dryers!) I unscrew a back panel so I can unscrew some larger screws that were already fully accessible, and then I screw the back panel back on??",1676654510,1684439090,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

In this game, you play the role of a home renovation expert, taking on different houses and restoring them to their former glory.

One of the things I appreciate about House Flipper is the attention to detail in the design and renovation process. You have access to a wide range of tools and equipment, allowing you to fix everything from leaky pipes to broken walls. The game even offers a decorating mode, where you can choose from various furniture and decor options to make the house your own.

Another great feature of House Flipper is the freedom it gives players to customize their gameplay experience. You can choose which houses to renovate, which upgrades to prioritize, and how much time to spend on each project. This allows you to tailor the game to your preferences and create a unique experience every time you play.

The graphics in House Flipper are also impressive, with detailed textures and realistic lighting effects that make the houses feel like real homes. The game's sound design is also well-done, with realistic sound effects that add to the overall immersion.

But what sets House Flipper apart from other games is the sense of satisfaction that comes with restoring a house to its former glory. Seeing the transformation from a run-down, neglected home to a beautifully renovated masterpiece is incredibly rewarding.

In conclusion, House Flipper is an excellent game that offers a fun and unique experience. Its attention to detail, freedom of customization, and sense of satisfaction make it a game worth trying for anyone who enjoys simulation and renovation games. If you are looking for a break from traditional video games and want to unleash your inner home renovation expert, House Flipper is the perfect game for you.",1555157842,1684246495,True,157,7,0.921370565891265869,0,True,False,False

 but after that I was bored to know that since I don't have any DLCs I was pretty much done, then I atleast wanted to do 100% of achievements, the problem is that to do most achievements you need the DLCs

Also something about the devs. The last DLC (Farm) was very bugged at release, lots of problems, but devs reacted beautifully IMO, they openly apologized and released a lot of fixes very quickly, and are still doing do, while communicating with the playerbase.

You see, the game allows you to buy back and decorate houses as much as you want. There's just one condition; you have to have completed ALL missions and flipped ALL houses. .

Obviously, this is much easier to do if you only have the base game, where you only have to worry about 30 or so houses (and their associated missions). This becomes a LOT harder if you try to do this with all DLC (including the free DLC) on your account.] The DLC adds around 47-50 ADDITIONAL houses to flip (and associated missions), so that's more than double your workload to get through just to get the ability to buy back houses. 

I'm close to 100 hours and I STILL haven't finished through the DLC in order to unlock buy back. I really miss some of the houses I already sold, but there's nothing I can do to see them again until I finish my task of completing all the DLCs.
I decided I was going to hold off on the farm dlc until I finished with what I got, so I can unlock buyback before adding all those additional missions and houses.   That ended up working in my favor, I think, because it seems that the farm dlc has got it's fair share of problems there.   

So this is just a head's up; don't be like me. Only work on the base game first and ignore all the DLCs until you finished it. The ability to buy back houses whenever you want is not one to be taken lightly, and will help you immensely. Especially if love the design aspect of it, and want to design the same houses again and again. 

And I think, in general, it's a good idea anyways to just buy the base game first. That way, if it turns out you don't like it (but somehow made it past Steam's refund timeline), you haven't lost as much. Remember, you can always go back and buy the bundle for the discounted price even if you own some of the items.

P.S. Also, if you like making stripes or patterns with different paints, DO NOT get the ""paint two walls at once"" line of perks.  It's incredibly annoying when you want to make alternating stripes of paint. I wish they made it work like building walls (and laying tiles), where you simple use the scroll wheel to control whether you make one wall or two (or more).  And the unfortunate part is, you cannot disable perks once you've gotten them.",1679763194,1683323778,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It has so many problems.  The major ones being that you earn a grass-cutter which is like someone asking you to clean your whole house with a toothbrush.  The gardens are huge, great you say until after spending hours mowing the lawn, you exit the game only to find that the grass has grown back.  This defeats the whole object of this game which is to design a really nice garden which you cannot do with a continuously unmowed and unweeded garden.

I had to sell the house that I spent 22 hrs working on for a loss because there was no point in trying to continue.

My office furniture was replaced with different colours.

I then get the update only to find that all the maxed out gardening perks I had earned, were gone.  I have quite a few of the gardening achievements unlocked, but all the perks are gone.

A million pounds was taken from my account.   I could go on.

Someone knew that this game was not ready which is why it was offered at a discounted price. I would rather have paid a little more for a decent game.  Empyrean should be ashamed.

I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS GAME AS IT IS NOT READY  in fact I have posted that I would like a refund and that I would like to make a complaint.

UPDATE: It's been a while since I first reviewed Garden Flipper. At the time I asked for, and got a refund. I waited over a year until the majority of bugs were fixed, and then re-purchased it.

I am happy to say that I can now give a more positive review of this DLC.
The tools that you use to garden with, the trimmer and the mower have drastically improved in performance. It is now quick and easy to mow your garden, which stays mowed.
There's a good selection of flowers, plants, outdoor furniture and structures.
Creating decent gardens is one of my favourite parts of House Flipper, and I thoroughly enjoy taking part in the garden competitions, of which I might add,  I make a lot of money as you can boost your profits up to 50% of your house property if you gain enough points.

So, yes I do recommend Garden Flipper, because when this game works, it is brilliant and gives me hours of enjoyment.

However, I do recommend to anyone buying any DLC to make a separate back-up of the game. { I keep mine on a usb}. I've had to re-start from scratch at least 3 times now, because I've lost all progress. So, just bear this in mind.

HOWEVER, there are real difficulties with some things now. Building a greenhouse properly is very difficult as you have no way of planning out what size of panels you need beforehand. The only thing you can do is play with it and rebuild and rebuild until you get it. Also some of the farm jobs are quite tricky if you don't put a piece exactly where it's supposed to be then you don't get paid for it. I wish the developers would make it clearer where things need to go exactly. As well, I have been frustrated with this aspect for years. In real life, if someone asks you to redecorate their place they tell you exactly where they want things placed. As it is you can just pile on the items in the center of the room and still get paid for it. That doesn't make sense. 

It's still a very fun game though if you can get past some of the frustrations.",1634744010,1682605129,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

You can use this game not only for good time-spending but with newly added mechanics you can now build the house of your dream or become an interior designer of your own house or flat to realize it in real life afterward! And the key thing - you are able to interact with all the switches, furniture, gadgets, etc. you are placing to see how it gonna work and look in real life!

You can now recreate houses from other games, like CJ`s house from GTA San Andreas, Michael or Franklin`s house from GTA V, or any other games! No limits to your fantasies! 
I have never gotten bored in this game, especially after adding pets that you can interact with and have a companion with you there in the quests) 

It is still exciting to pass all the quests a few times, to achieve more interesting and each time different results with new mechanics, skills, and experiences you gained during the gameplay.  I'm using the game both for relaxation and inspiration! This is my top 10 for life and top 1 for this year!

Special thanks to the developers for the qualitative Ukrainian language! It is an extremely nice feeling to play my favorite game in my native language! Also, when my mom borrows my PC when she comes to visit me, she can play this game and have fun without knowing English, which is convenient and pleasant! 

Thanks again! Big fan! Waiting for new DLCs and the House Flipper 2 (wishlisted).

I like how they give updates on what they plan for the game.  If you enjoy relaxing and fixing up houses this is a really good game for that.

I think adding a multiplayer in this game or the second one more fun as you and you friend could design the house together as it would make things a lot more quicker to finish. Though yes I would spend the time to do it alone but having a friend could keep more company and make me stay in the game longer as it can get boring over long period of time. Though overall I like how they keep adding new furniture or little subtle updates to the game to make it better. I know they have a lot on their plate as well as house flipper 2 to be worried about but I hope this game gets the attention it needs because it was apart of my childhood dream to own this game.,1682113451,1682113451,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False
