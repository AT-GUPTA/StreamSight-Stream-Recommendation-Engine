This is one of the few games where I will willingly choose to play Medic because they're actually fun, instead of being a lame defenseless support-only role. The game is pretty mobile with players constantly longjumping/walljumping, and the time-to-kill is in just the right spot where it's high enough to allow people to fight and duel each other, while also being low enough that a single player can go in and kill a bunch of people to make an impact on things.

Also despite being a f2p game that's been abandoned by the devs, there's pretty much no cheaters playing (unlike Team Fortress 2).

Development halted heading into 2019, and now rounding out the year, the official dedicated servers have been shut down. Community-rented servers continue to run, but for all intents and purposes, Dirty Bomb is going onto life support.

I'd been following the game since nearly the beginning - BRINK is one of my fav games of all time, so of course I was excited to see what Splash Damage was moving onto next. Following updates on Dirty Bomb rabidly, I originally jumped in towards the end of the Nexon client closed beta, before following the migration to Steam at the start of 2015 to participate in stress tests and see the closed beta out. It was an exciting time!

I probably shouldn't have burnt myself out on the game in such an early, barebones state. Having stepped away for a majority of the last 3 or so years I missed a LOT of good times. They made plenty of positive changes, and some that weren't so much. For everything that improved in the game, it looked like something else took a step back - or at least kept stagnating. It never quite got to be the best it could be.

The gameplay was top-class, and all things considered, pretty balanced. There was a LOT of variety and depth, more than you'd get in most shooters, so it was never going to be perfect. But they did a pretty good job of making mercs, weapons, loadouts and maps feel fair (well, for the most part... there were definitely ups & downs).

The combat style was frantic; with higher movement speed, weapon accuracy and time-to-kills generally leading to intense dances of death between players. And the visual style & atmosphere of the game - as is typical of Splash Damage's original output - was second to none. Nobody else gives grim, gritty violence so much colour, charm and pizzazz.

There's a couple areas I feel the game slipped. It perhaps all comes down to updates being  half-baked and spread thin. There was barely any maps, especially towards the beginning of the game, so it became incredibly repetitive. As they eventually added new ones they were messier, lacking in character, and felt less meticulously designed than the original set - there's a reason nobody picks them in map votes.

And the progression of the game (while mostly cosmetic, and only marginally gameplay-affecting) was most heavily tied to random drops or saving up currency, which was incredibly slow and unsatisfying. That was my experience as a paying player, and it was much worse for those going the F2P route. The events they ran a few times a year were the tiresomely grindy, sometimes confusing, and typically disappointing apex of this all.

But the positives definitely outweighed the negatives. While the maps may have gotten repetitive or felt lackluster, and neither the progression or events were totally engaging, the solid core gameplay and the variety & character of the mercs carried the game. A sort of weird love-child of CS:GO and Overwatch - it was definitely unique. I had a great time, and will miss it... you really don't know what you've got til it's gone.

There's never been anything else quite like Dirty Bomb. And there probably never will be.

I've seen this coming, but I didn't want to. Sadly the devs announced that the game will have no more updates.

But this review is about the game and the players. What killed this wounderful game was the bad  match making system that caused, not just new players but average players, to be stomped over and over and worst the so called ""shuffle"" vote option didn't do anything. 
And being honest, it's fault of the devs and us, the players.

I've tried to return to this game so many times, but the same thing (bad MMS) annoyed me and stoped me from playing. The more experienced players didn't care about teaching new players or sharing their tips on how to play the game. Instead most of them cared only about having ""fun"", wich meant stomping new players, and also genereting a toxic atmosphere.

If you stomped new or less skilled players I want to thank you for killing this game. But as mean as it sounds it's true, or at least a part of it, because devs had the other part of the responsability of fixing and improving the things that players pointed out to be wrong, but no. 

Hope this is not the end of the game, and the devs should reconsider the situation of the game. But the only way to do it is showing that there more people out there that want to play, wich will improve the player base and therefore reducing the stomping and increasing the fun.

I hope the best for this game and its devs, I just wish more people knew about it so it could get the support it deserves.

The game is fun, but there are just some dated design decisions that keep it lagging behind most other shooters. Everything beyond this point is my opinion, but I'll try to stay objective. Also, I'm a bit rusty so excuse any mistakes I make.

Pros:
-Each role feels distinct and offer different playstyles.
-Different weapons within categories often feel different and are sidegrades.
-Possible to unlock every loadout and merc just by playing.
-Every charcter feels fast, and every weapon feels viable in the right hands.
-Objective based modes make use of most every role.
-Quick play and Stopwatch (Swapping Sides) and competitve play are free to engage with out of the gate.

Neutral:
-High Time To Kill
-Diverse cast of mercs.
-Variety in loadouts it there should you engage with that.
-Graphics are a bit dated by this point.

Cons:
-Loadout Card system is limiting, and weird. Why can't we assemble our own loadouts?
-Forced camos based on card rarity is just tacked on for seemingly no reason.
-All loadout cards beyond Silver (Some cards don't come in Bronze anymore) are basically Gucci, or Supreme level luxuries for when you need to burn fragments.
-Servers can be full one minute, then gone the next. Small-ish community.
-Difficult to play with friends.

Despite all of this, I can't give this game more than a 7.5 out of 10. Seven just feels a tad too low, and and eight feels too high. The game is enjoyable, but it isn't perfect. Personally I think it feels a little too rigid in the way you can only choose three mercs with you per game. Then on top of that, attempting to use the loadout you may want may cost you a lot of ingame currency, then if you don't enjoy that loadout as much as you thought you would feels like a waste. I think this game just has too many things to pay for with ingame currency, but that may be a good thing for some people. Grinding is fulfilling for some people and may feel like a waste of time for others.

Bottom Line: Game isn't perfect, 7.5 out of 10. Spending ingame currency doesn't always feel like a good transacation took place, and sometimes you can be grouped up with a team unable to handle your opponents due to the rigid loadout, and three merc slots per game.",1535599595,1535599595,True,32,1,0.630683720111846924,0,True,False,False

I'm going to give a quick review about the game and my impressions so far.  I heard a little about it about a year ago and found it on steam when the beta was first released.  I bought it today and have played a fair amount.  My impression is this:
It has glorious game mechanics.  They are well polished and hit home with what they aimed for making with this game, and the developers did a good job to try and balance the game with the systems set in place.  That being said the game is not without it's problems.  The game feels incomplete, but I cannot hold this against the game or the devs because this is a beta.  It has a few bugs (There is when that when you try to change the FOV with V-Sync on, it will keep an overlay of the previous screen while you play).  Also, although this may be intentional, there isn't much upgrading or customization, or motivation to keep playing after you have a good merc.  This can be fixed with some minor things, and I'm sure the Devs are already thinking about ways to expand. So here's the watered down version:

+Great Game Mechanics
+Well Polished Art Style
+Original Concept With Bits and Pieces of Other Games Mixed In
+Good Shop and Merc System (Like CS:GO Case opening)
+Well Thought Out Weapons (None feel like weak pea shooters)
+Fast Paced Competetive Gameplay
+Great Objectives
+Extremely Fun

-Game Optimization
-Feels Incomplete (Needs more content, such as customizeable weapons with some roulette system, or like TF2 hats)
-Bugs exist, but not prominently
-A few weapons need extra balancing

Overall, the game is on the right track, and could turn out to be a wonderfully fun experience.  I can't hold any negatives against the game because it is in beta, but it does have it's issues.  

Good Start. 7.8/10

EDIT:
I have played significantly more of this game in the past few weeks.  My opinion has not changed much , although I do have more to add.  The game is extremely fun, but also extremely competitive.  It has a nature about it that subconsciously funnels your mind from casual to getting really into the game play.  The mechanics, which I have stated previously, are absolutely glorious, and they are working hard to release new updates with more content for us to play.  It is still on the right track, a lot of the bugs have been dealt with, along with many of the balancing issues.  One thing I will say is that every time new content is added, there will be unbalance in one way or another.  This would seem like a problem, but it really isn't, and this is why: They are prepared to turn right around and give us a patch if something is not balanced.  In other words, the fix comes quick, with no hitches.

The progress is coming along quite well, and the community, although hostile sometimes, is growing as well.

8.2/10.  Definitely worth trying.

EDIT: August 28th, 2018.

With the release of 1.0 I can't help but be dissapointed. The game plataued in late 2015, and it never recovered. New life was breathed about six months ago, but it decayed fast. It seems as if the devs have given up, and decided to release in 1.0, and move on. I can't fault them for that, the game has been in development for far too long- but it is dissapointing. That being said, it is still a good game, and I wish they cared about it more.

This game has incredible potential but people taking decisions are so bad, I even wonder if they play the games they create.. they probably don't.... it's not possible they play them and make them so bad on purpose... that would be crazy...

I have played a lot of FPS games and I can say this is one of the best ones I have played! It's in beta still but its concept is fantastic and you are never sat there without a gunfight for too long after you spawn. I think one of the best things this game does is combat, there's a lot of it and it is quite fair for everyone, every class does have their own perk and I think it's pretty balanced between them all in this game.

There is a selection of characters to choose from however you only start with 3 free ones until you play a few matches and are able to purchase another one, be careful though this is just a boost of credits so you can get your first character. Believe me, it is not easy to get money in this game.

You can buy crates with the money you earn to get better character cards, which is nice as you do have a chance to get something nice, although I haven't got anything good so far.

Each character has its own set of guns that can be changed with a different card for the character. When you get a better card for your character, the character gets better abilities, like 12% less damage taken from explosives.

You can get crates from drops and open them. When you get your character from the case you can recycle them and get scrap or something which you can put towards getting a better card for the character you like using. When you try to get that better card it's like opening a case except you can only get that rarity and that character in it, but you can get cards that have different abilities and guns. If you prefer a gun on that character you have to use kits that cost money to make sure you get that specific gun in the case. You can't use the money to make sure you get the exact abilities you want. I have done this before and got a gun I didn't like so I stuck with the worse card just for the weapon.

There are quite a bit of maps that don't get boring after playing them over and over for a while.

There are a couple different game modes that are like other games, there is Stopwatch, where you have to do the objective faster than the other team to win, Objective, where there is one team trying to deliver the vehicle and supplies and what not while the other team tries to stop them, Execution, where there are two teams, one team has to defuse the bomb and the other has to plant the bomb, this game mode is out of 12 rounds. There is also a competitive mode where you have to do the objective. You have to be level 7 to be able to play competitive mode. There is a server browser so you can join a specific server.

The levels are pretty straightforward, you just do what you are supposed to do and you get XP at the end of the game. Getting to level 6 is quite easy except it takes forever to get to level 7.

In conclusion, I LUV THIS GAME, The maps are awesome and not boring, it takes forever to get to level seven, there are like 5 different game modes and this is like the best FPS game I have ever played!

The fundamental reason I'm going to uninstall is that the initial and early characters didn't feel too gimmicky, and they tended to work together. Since that time, they've become more and more ridiculous. Constantly putting in characters that don't really mesh together isn't helping the team aspect of the game. When you can help your team while still shooting the enemy and not need to make a decision about which to do, you have a problem. Throwing health packs, ammo, and needing to be on top of people to revive them encourages smart team play. ""Don't run into the open, we can't pick you up"" Sparks the medic comes out, and more fools over-extend because you can revive them now at a distance, instead of them being dead and gibbed, and they can be picked up. Not being revived is the game punishing bad play by those who over-extend. Javelin dispenses ammo even in fire-fights, so who needs to manage and plan for their ammo? Getting into long fire-fights back in 2015 used to require someone to be very good at managing ammo and position. You had to bring a support character, but that person needed excellent positioning to be able to toss that pack and hit a teammate who needs it without giving it to the enemy, and then quickly be back in the fight. The same is true of the medics. Running a combo of medic/ammo giver required great support. Automatically dispensing ammo in a circle around you doesn't force you to think about how to help your team, and you can help without actively helping. You can both help you team with a power, and shoot an enemy. This isn't encouraging teammates to help each other, it just encourages them to bunch up. Further, key abilities can be done by everyone, like repairing, planting explosives, and reviving. This dilutes the need to take certain classes at all.

Further, rarely has a new character been balanced on release, which means in the the intervening time between release and patch you face a lot of people playing a broken character. In-fact, new characters were never allowed straight into ranked. They would hold them back because they knew they weren't balanced. They eventually gets nerfed, frequently too far, and the cycle repeats. This is irritating, but I also know that characters aren't balanced until you really get a lot of people playing them. I don't know why they feel so far off each time, but I suspect it is because of the aforementioned decision to keep pushing out characters that have odd abilities that need to be special to justify making a new merc. Balancing among more and more abilities also takes more and more effort - effort that could be spent making the one thing that doesn't get enough attention - maps.

Maps. You need more maps. You always need more maps. More maps means more unique strategies, it means you can play a lot of matches without repeating maps (back when there were only 6 maps, I took lots of several week or several month breaks because I didn't want to play the same maps over and over). Each map should highlight a few abilities. You can get the objective done without them and successfully defend without them, but on some maps, some characters should shine without being overpowered. Each map should be able to take advantage of each merc's abilities. I know this is a tall order, but you want to be great, right? The more abilities you have, the more trouble you have where you get into a map and think, ""I brought a terrible merc for this map."" That should not happen, ever. Rhino is a good example. There are some maps where I will never take him, he's far too slow, and he needs to be on top of people to do damage. There are too many maps where he cannot do much, and very few maps where he can truly shine. Similarly, taking Skyhammer or Arty in Underground, is a waste of time (Skyhammer's marker does act like a grenade, but it isn't a great one). Stoker, on the other hand, dominates in Undergound because his ability is always useful. There is no need for that enormous discrepancy between characters. This removes flexibility to form and break defenses. 

While this is definitely a personal preference, the worst part about this game is being one-shot. I don't know why people think this is fun in an arcade-style shooter. In ARMA, SWAT, Rainbow 6, being one-shot killed is fine and I like those games, but not in a game like this. It wasn't fun 20 years ago with the rocket launchers in Quake and Unreal, it still isn't now. The wide-spread availabilty and ease-of-use of one-shot weapons in this game is killing my enjoyment (and I realize that this is a very personal complaint, hence the reason I listed it last). The fact that most people cannot use one-shot weapons well in a fast-moving arcade-style shooter doesn't make them balanced. In any game, when you balance to the average, you neglect that part of the population who will take the time needed to perfect the one-shot (or power, skill, etc.) who will still continue to dominate with over-powered weapons/abiliites, etc. This is where the accurate arcade-style shooting and movement work against you - perfecting that one-shot is 100% doable. I've met and seen plenty of people who have perfected it. For awhile, I could do it pretty well, but it felt really cheap and dirty, so I stopped. Once you master the one-shot kill, it's a joke for those who don't. Removing scope sway on snipers - terrible move, the sway at least made the one-shot kills reasonably rare but threatening. The reviver railgun of doom - terrible move. I still stuck around, despite really not liking these changes. The additional of Javelin was another change that I didn't like. What purpose does she serve? There are characters who can break-up camps, if they're not doing the job, adjust them! Instead, you put in the one-shot rocket of doom, something I was really proud of you for not putting in the game from day one. An arcade style game balanced without a rocket launcher. Ponder that. We had that.

Coming back after a long break, I wanted to see how the game progressed. I see the new characters introduced, and one of them is Hunter - he has a crossbow that can one-shot people. After playing a few games against people with Hunter, I can see once again that the higher-skilled players are STILL taking the high-damage sniper rifles, and Hunter. I used to accept being one-shot as part of the game, but I just don't want to deal with it anymore. If I want to be killed in one shot while moving around a corner, I'll play the SWAT and Rainbow 6 games - realistic shooters. Not in arcade shooters. I want teamwork, but that can't be had, because not enough abilities force you to support or rely your team. I used to think that the self-healing that all mercs have was fine, but as time went on, I found myself drawn to characters that had ""tough"" perk because I didn't need a medic. Ammo is easy to come by, generally, and rarely do you need to go far out of the way to get it, so who needs those pesky teammates? Going to get ammo shouldn't be easy, a team game should prefer you to get it from teammates, and hence punish you by having inconvenient ammo supply locations.

In case you are wondering, I don't play Overwatch. I saw enough in the videos to know that it wasn't what I was looking for. And now, very sadly, I must conclude that Dirty Bomb joins it.

Dirty Bomb is a hero shooter in a similar style as Overwatch (though, I want to mention here it was released before OW).
And until the last update - the one titled ""Melee Mayhem"" - I probably would have recommended it. 
I probably still would if not for the addition of what they call rads - their new, shiny cash currency.
Up to this point every ""real cash"" purchase in DB was shown directly in real money. Changing this to a premium currency like rads is a psychological trick with a number of effects which usually boost sales by manipulating customers:
- Making it impossible to ""just buy exactly that"" and instead force you pay money ""to pay money"" - so that you don't just manage to exactly spend all your rads, making you feel like you ""rather purchase another pack so those don't go to waste"" - ofc they gave away some free rads out of the gate. ""First one is free"", you know.
- Disconnecting the purchase (and the endorphine rush connected with it) with the feeling of having spend money - you ""just"" spend rads, no real money
- Making it harder to keep track of how much money you exactly spent

Also - and they added this quite a while ago, but without the addition of rads it just wasn't ""bad enough"" to bother - they added cosmetic lootboxes in addition to their already lootbox based equipment sets, As real cash only - or rather ""rads only"" purchases.

While recent balance decisions from the developers were at times questionable and [i]definitely[/i] not playtested, I did not bother too much with those and usually would not have bothered writing a review about this, but the drug dealer-level business decisions they did is a complete different beast and for me a reason for me to drop this game all-together.",1524267061,1524267115,False,7,0,0.565972030162811279,2,True,False,False

I seem to be doing this once a year because i continually play this stupid game because my friend seems to love it lol. Right now as it stands i went ahead and changed it to recommended because I feel like there is a lot of good in the game despite the bad. Its still filled to the brim with hackers but on the occasion you can get matches without them its a lot of fun.

 I dont even mind getting my but kicked but you just know if a guy is getting 144 kills in one match that somethings wrong there. Its still same old song and dance though, hey that guys hacking - NO hes not hes just that good... Shyeah right lol. Yep everybodys a comp player and nobody cheats ever. I dont understand why its so hard for an anti cheat company to do their jobs. It seems to me like all yould have to do is search daily for the newest hacks. Get a copy and then reverse engineer the thing. I mean if thats not what theyre doing what are they paying them for? I think whenever somebody cheats they should advertise it on the forums and in a feed in the game and embarrass them or something.  The game itself is fun and has a lot of different mercs and playstyles you can use to get the objectives done. So what works in the game works well. But the company doesnt seem to release new maps at any kind of reasonable rate and they are constantly changing things and adding new mercs when they havent even balanced and fixed whats there. Like now theres a bug with the EV where if youre near it you warp all over the place. Its been there a long time they even mention it in one of their videos they know about it but will not be fixing it anytime soon because theyre working on other stuff. It just seems like they dont have a clear idea of what theyre doing to me and are just caretakers. I get the feeling the original team is no longer there and these guys are just doing patch jobs basically. What it feels like anyway.  Games free to play. i mean check it out for yourself and see if you like it. Nothing really to lose. But i do think the devs need to step up their game a little bit. Especially on the anti hacking side.

They also need to readd the servers for lower level players to learn the game at their own pace instead of getting thrown into a high level match where half the time people vote to kick them and im sure that makes them not feel welcome and want to play.Which in turn is killing the newer player influx. Lot of good but a lot of bad in this game. It could be fixed but the devs seem to be overwhelmed or clueless one not sure which.

Review Update 1: I can no longer in good conscience recommend this game.So i am changing my recommendation to NOT RECOMMENDED until they make some changes. Everyday for the past three months ive ran into hackers. The anti cheat in the game just cant seem to keep up or the devs just dont seem to care. As you can see ive put enough hours into this game to know what im talking about and it really makes me sad that its gotten this way. I just played with somebody who was level 6 a few minutes ago and he got about 78 kills, never missed a shot, was getting headshots while people were jumping off buildings, running through stokers fire. It was pretty bad. And if you say anything about it on the forums people act like youre crazy and dismiss it. Right after that map i went to a different server and ran into a guy named EV exploiter who was lvl 133..... 

All i can say is enjoy your hackfest, ill be moving onto battleborn and overwatch. Hopefully they can do a better job dealing with the cheaters. 

BELOW IS MY ORIGINAL REVIEW OF THE GAME ITSELF. I still enjoy the game and love it to death but just dont find it fun playing with cheaters every single match. 


Really fun shooter from the guys who made Enemy Territory Quakewars. A game i played for over four years. Its kind of like a mix of team fortress and quakewars in that you have non standard objectives for your team to achieve like planting bombs, repairing things etc. Theres medics, snipers, heavy gunners, engineers. Theres more than one merc that fits each class type too so its very likely youll find one you enjoy. The game play is very fast paced and nothing like Cod so if you come in with that mindset of thats the kind of game this is, you probably wont do well or enjoy it very much. The most fun with the game i have is when the team is working together to achieve objectives in the game. Its a very teamwork objective oriented game. So if youre bored of your current shooter and looking for something new give Dirty Bomb a try. 

If you have friends invite them too, its a lot more fun with friends. Best advice i can give for playing this game too is dont worry so much about your KD just support your team and that comes with it :) GLHF and hope to see you in game.",1433123118,1515157697,True,0,0,0,6,True,False,False

Two years later from the below review and the game is still great.  Devs listen to the comunity.  Updates with new mercs are frequent.  Patches are frequent.  Balance is constantly being worked on.


Fun objective based FPS.  I would reccomend to give this game a try, it's fun to play, fast action FPS. 

Pros:

-Fast, fun gameplay.
-NOT pay to win.  You can unlock new mercs faster with cash but can buy them with in game money too.
-All items unlocked are yours forever, no stupid items that expire after a week.
-Objective based, play the objectives or get left in the dust! K/D means jack squat.
-Fast paced action always keeps you thinking.
-Many unique mercs to choose from, bring 3 into each battle and swap any time you die.
-Devs listen to the players.
-Stable - I don't know if I have ever had this crash and I've played it on 2 desktops and 1 laptop.
-Weekly free rotation of mercs so you always have new ones to try out.

Cons:

(Still in Beta so a lot of this is being worked on.)

Matchmaking - sometimes end up with all high lvls on one team raping a bunch of noobs. (greatly improved since I first wrote this review!)

Hacking - I don't see a lot of it, but it is there - a new anti-cheat system is being tested to address this soon! (Have not seen any since I returned to the game)

Some balance issues still, but it's beta so lots of time to work it out. (Better and getting better all the time)

No general chat other than in missions.  Friend system only through Steam.  I was trying to explain something to someone and the match ended and we were punted before we could finish.  I didn't get his name so I couldn't help him.

Overall a solid beta game, no pay to win, active devs, good player base.  Well worth the download to give it a go.  New features being added regularly.  Updates all the time.

Dirty Bomb is class based and require teamwork and good team synergi to be successful. It also requires a fair amount of skill, so if you're new to FPS games, the learning curve can be a bit steep. It has more in common with arena shooters than OW or Paladins.

At start you get two powerful characters (mercs) for free. One medic (Aura) and one fire support (Skyhammer). In addition there are three mercs which are free to use in the weekly rotation. So without unlocking ANYTHING you have access to five mercs. One of the free rotation mercs are always an engineer, as they are important to do the objectives.

Prices for unlocking mercs vary from 30.000 to 50.000 in game currency. You can earn ~50.000 in about a week, if you do the missions and you help the team do the objective(s). I recommend playing as Aura to begin with as she generates XP quite fast. Revive your fallen teammates and put down the heal station in a good spot. Move it as the team progresses through the map.

The loadout cards give certain augmentations and weapons for the mercs, but you can use the default loadout and be successful, no problem. Also equipment cases which contains a random loadout drop fairly often. While the chance of getting a lower tier loadout like Led or Iron has the highest chance, they are also useful. A bronze loadout gives you all three augmentations for that laodout and anything above Bronze is just cosmetics/skins. You can craft a random Bronze loadout for the merc of your choice with 1500 credits and 165 fragments. You can also buy ANY Bronce loadout you want from the store with 17.000 Credits.

Yes you need to play a little bit to get the resources to unlock mercs and loadouts. And yes the RNG can be frustrating at times. However, the game is very generous in giving Credits and cases. Paying for something in Dirty Bomb does NOT give you any advantage over other players. You can unlock anything with in-game Credits, (and a bit of luck). Sure it can save you some time grinding if you pay real money to unlock a merc, but that's it.

Cons:

[*]Matchmaking isn't great, around 60% of games end in a stomp.
[*]The crafting system that replaced tradeups is awful and unrewarding, pretty much limits crafting to silver cards.
[*]Newer merc changes feel very lazily designed and out of place (phantom's emp feels clunky and not enjoyable to use, thunder shouldn't blind AND immobilize players, makes him a less effective fragger while also making him horribly unenjoyable to play against.)
[*]Community consists of vastly untalented players, with a few veterans that show up to crush them.

this is an update to the current game state... since i last played i can say that now not only can i play flawlessly but this is actually a fun game ... no worries on disconnections it just has a learning curve.. i feel as if the developers do look at the comments and fix the issues that are mostly complained about but i will say this im not to sure if the game has pay 2 win aspects but really in this case you can earn a lot of the characters they offer

Then one of the devs came along and actually responded to my review, saying that all my criticisms would be seriously looked at and fixed, over a length of time, should they prove to be valid.

It is a long time since then and after that long hiatus I came back to playing this game. To my pleasant surprise, my problems with this game were mostly fixed.

Mostly.

So, without further adue, this is my review. (That rhymed...)

The big thing that originally attracted me to the game was the game's overall aesthetic and character design. To this day it continues to be one of my absolute favorite thing about this game. It's not as cartoony as Overwatch (to which I hate the character designs) and most certainly not as cartoony as TF2, but it's not the realistic look being pushed out by the CoD and Battlefield titles. It's somewhere in between those, finding a good balance of realism and cartoony. The character designs themselves share in this philosophy as well, as does the combat.

Combat is interesting, to say the least. Twitch shooting as a home here, but so does some extent of intelligence despite the arcadey-ness of the shooting. You can aim down your sights, spray from the hip, or knife/bat/sword people in the face or extremities to your heart's content. Meanwhile each character has special gadgets and skills that help in their team utility, to which the vast majority of the characters actually have some utility. This is where it starts, however, to really distinguish itself from titles like Overwatch: If you can shoot and kill with one character, you can do it with them all. Whereas in titles like Overwatch your weapon(s) can be so vastly different between characters, as is your utility, that you generally find yourself at odds with certain characters who you simply cannot function as, in Dirty Bomb so long as you can shoot ANY weapon on ANY character you can generally shoot and kill with ALL characters. From there the utility abilities aren't instrusive as they are in Overwatch, actually forcing me to draw a *small* comparison to titles like Rainbow Six Siege. 

In fact, yeah: This game is a middle ground between Overwatch and Rainbow Six Siege.

Levels and objectives are generally well constructed. The levels aren't ridiculously long, though long enough to make dying a serious hinderence for your overall team efforts. The objectives tend to change as the mission progresses, making the lone mission objectives in titles like Overwatch not an issue. Sorry Blizzard, I don't want to defend a damned hover-car with a mechanical boxing glove the whole damned match. As a result, knowing the levels of DirtyBomb is fairly important as each part of the level is specifically designed with the current objective in mind. This really causes the player to have to give decent (and often *enough* a proper strategic) consideration towards the surrounding level and how to exploit it (and how the enemy can exploit it) towards completing your objective.

LOADOUT CARDS! This was once one of my gripes, but since has been removed. So, there are loadout cards you use to equip your character(s). You win them through missions, fun-bucks, and at *seemingly* random. You can also buy them for real money. Where this no longer present a P2W issue is that the Bronze cards, cards that you can acquire RIDICULOUSLY easily, have all the best loadouts. From there on, from Silver to Platinum, it's all just aesthetic. Having a Platinum card to show off that you have one is more just icing on the cake if the card actually has a loadout you like. There are such things as high ranked cards that have garbage loadouts you don't want, in which case just find a lower ranked card that you DO like; You're not getting hindered by it regardless. This strikes me as one of the best damned things a game of this sort has ever done and really can ONLY be outdone, really, by full character customization. Since that won't happen, this is just fine and works to the game's strengths by giving more reasons to keep playing.

I... don't have anything too negative to say about this game. Sometimes it feels like a team is just wiping my team all over the map, but generally that's from skill and nothing else. Other times I've wiped the enemy team hard and wondered if I just somehow unlocked some inner badass, but again it's just skill. This goes also towards skill as a team, by the way. Having a good team can really help you out, having a well balanced team can make all the difference.

I should back up a moment, though, as I can think of a FEW problems. Some characters have more utility than others, like how the British pyro can set down an ammo-station while others just drop ammo packs that get consumed. Obviously having the British pyro presents a SERIOUS boon to his team, meaning he's NEVER a bad pick. Same goes for Aura, an American woman who can set down an AoE heal station as well as do her normal medic stuff. These two tend to be almost required to get anything done, especially on the defending teams. I understand that's a hard one to balance, and Splash Damage has done their best to do so, but the very nature of their special gadgets simply make them far too invaluable and thus a bit OP team-build-wise. I know their weapons aren't the greatest but, well, they're not underpowered weapons neither. So, again, I suppose that's one of my few issues but overall I can see how to counter them and how they've already been balanced. (Even if it doesn't always feel like it)

If you're not sure about this game, check it out on YouTube or talk to your friends who play it. I love this game and recommend it to anyone who wants to see what the bastard child of Overwatch and Rainbow Six Siege looks and plays like. That said, the bastard might never take the throne from those two games (Game of Thrones reference!) but it'll definitely be king of the F2P shooters.",1433086173,1497924061,True,0,0,0,1,True,False,False

TL,DR: game is fast, free, fun and a grind fest. give it a shot.

the goods
- the core gameplay is great, it's fast paced and a mixture of parcour movement like brink and different roles that remind of return to castle wolfenstein much. playing with a good team is a lot of fun, especially when the round was tough to win. the three existing game modes are good considering the game is not finished, same for the maps.

the mostly bads
- a claim i made was ""spending real money gives you an ingame advantage"". i still stand by that, however it's not as significant as i thought it did, when i made that statement. by spending money you can unlock mercs you like much earlier than grinding the necessary credits for it. that's the only thing it would be justified to spend money on the game imho. (the other things you can buy are chests with terrible drop chances, as stated in the comment below, and some other things like crafting packs, but crafting loadout cards yourself isn't THAT credit intensive to justify buying those packs imo.) experience - the little i have, ~27 hrs - says, loadout cards are not nearly as important as teamplay, map knowledge, aim and some other non buyable stuff. so a skilled team can take on any buncha rich doofus gang, so there's that, chalk up one. and as stated below, you can pick up some decent loadout cards while playing without spending any money.
- had the chance to try out every merc over the weekend and have some beef with some of them. some mercs don't make much sense, e.g. the guy that can throw a grenade every 20 secs. throwing a grenade shouldn't be something only 1 merc can do if you ask me. a big guy with a huge gun, probably compensating idk, the sniper and the ""i haz a gr3nAde""-guy could be put together in 1 class as in return to castle wolfenstein. same as for some other mercs, e.g. arty and skyhammer. they don't need to be split up in 4 resp. 2 different mercs. but that's probably just me being old, farty n reminiscent.
- game is still not finished, meaning there are a few bugs killing the fun. for example not being able to fire or use any of your abilitys, quite unhandy in the middle of a firefight. another bug that's espacially aggravating won't let you deliver the objective though standing right before it or won't let you defuse a bomb with no enemys left to worry about.

if i forgot something, comment, hate, like, share, subscribe, whatever you do these days.",1487898927,1488236769,True,0,0,0.496562957763671875,2,True,False,False

What else? Oh, matchmaking is completely fucked. You have a whole bunch of high level players with tons of loadout cards (another thing you have to pay for, I might add) versus level 1 players who literally just started the game yesterday. You have an option to vote scramble, but the vote almost never go through, because players think that wanting a balanced match is ""whining"".

Which brings me to my next gripe: the DB community. Anyone here who says the Dirty Bomb community is great is either lying through their teeth or hasn't quite seen the depths of hell I have in just the few short hours I played this wretch of a game. This has got to be one of the most toxic, unfunny communities I've seen, and I've seen the CSGO and MOBA communities. Hell, even the CoD community is more friendly than this. Telling someone to just ""git gud"" is not conducive to me wanting to play more. In fact, it just pisses me off and make me want to leave.

Now they are a dozen or characters or so that have diffrent ablities and loadouts...

Ablities of characters, varied to where you have to keep on your toes on who your fighting, one of my favourites is phoenix an offensive medic who can revive himself! If your fighting him and you forget that ablitiy...well you might be up for a bad day

Now there are loadout cards, which can affect your ablities(for example, faster cooldown times, more potent) and the look of your character, despite how desirable platinum cards are, it appears you will be just fine with bronze cards as all the possible enchanments and load outs are there(relative to that character...you won't find a medic with a RPG, as of the last time I played it anyhow). Bronze cards, you will need to do some matches to lvl up, get some crummy lead cards from cases(or buy cases with in game money) breakdown, reforge hope you get the load out card you want...

Of course there is a real life money solution to get Coblot ones super quick, but this is by no means a paywall...you could grind longer for those...and I mean ALOT longer...BUT remember, the only diffrence for cards higher then bronze is THE LOOKS! 

The game is fast paced shooter, which forces you to really think about your approach and character uses, the format typically goes one side wants to do something(blowing up a building, steal drugs, pick your posion) and the other to stop them...

You will need multiple characters, as sometimes...you know...there is a tank...and an airstrike would be helpful, or a golden eye weapon...OPS! I dropped a minigun right.....here...where all my enemies might ""accidentally"" walk into....how tragic

only three can be used per match, so you need to pay attension to maps if you want the best possible match up! Is there lots of close quarters fighting? Shotguns are a go! Snipers...sorry too slow...

The box is telling the truth on this one...use skill...shoot accurately, have the drop on them...use choke points, have an iron will to push on, and victory may be yours

although I have noticed loads of people painfully yelling/typing..but hey, thats with plenty of games...just wish there was a mute button so I dont have to hear so and so complaining about ""noobs"" post game...

Now I dont know the characters as in depth as I would like too, but I have had fun with this game even if some peolpe just need to relax and enjoy rather then raging...which trust me will happen ALOT...though I DO wonder if there is something in the matchmaking, some feel balanced with teamwork...others...did I walk into a salughter house in a all-you-can-kill-me buffet? or other times I feel that I AM GOD! right in the middle is hard to find, probably hard to program...but if it at all possible could we get more balanced teams more consisitantly? I see there are some attempts at it, hopefully that will get better in time...cause everytime I feel like the next rambo...someone there is having a bad time...


So quick sum up, awesome characters in an FPS shooter with some matchmaking bugs we pray get better...a loadout system which can be used without real money(though good luck getting exactly what you want), a game that cares about the objective and the team more so then kill streaks...just needs ways to enforce those better

Pros: All mercs have character, lots of it. Each one is unique in its own way. Abilities are also cool, they manage to be fun and innovative even tho developers play it safe and don't take to much risk with any of abilities standing out too much or being overpowered. 

Cons: COMMUNITY! The thing is that is very very difficult to get into matches where both teams are balanced and there is teamwork, the game does nothing to encourage it. The game does very little to teach newcomers and does nothing to reward going trough tutorials (of which there is only one!). Teams in matches are very often highly unbalanced, everybody wants to be on the winning team. The game does nothing to balance out those teams (like, dunno, offer some bonus XP to player from a winning team to come to the losing team). Furthermore, seeing hackers is not a rare event. In last two or three days I saw a couple of them (managed to report one). Funny how the teams with hackers never kick them out, even tho almost all of us report them and point it out in the chat. 

The crafting system is broken! After crafting bronze card for one of my mercs, for two days and on multiple attempts I was getting the same loadout card every time! What were the chances? Even before that, I noticed that getting doubles is really frequent occurrence.

Now, highly subjective point, but it needs to be said. I don't recall that I ever ever played map (in any game) worse than the Terminal! It has a confusing layout, there are some parts of the map that literally look the same and overall is just map that puts new players at huge disadvantage as it is quite difficult to get it right. It is my impression that maps could use some markings or indications that could make them easier to get around for the newcomers. 

All in all, it seems to me that this game is way too much focused on grabbing new players instead of keeping the existing playerbase and satisfying those that play it even for just a couple of hours. I think this is a decent game (with a lot of potential) that is really difficult to enjoy.",1487781216,1487781216,False,28,3,0.525623083114624023,6,True,False,False

I've found every weapon satisfying. Unlocking new mercs takes time. Lots of time.

I would give this game a recommendation, but I put 31 hours into it before getting banned mid-match with only a vague error message informing me my account was suspended. Yet after contacing support, I was met with more vagueness and they only informed me that they detected I was using third party software while playing Dirty Bomb. 

*I HAVE NOT NOR WILL I EVER DOWNLOAD THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE TO GAIN AN UNFAIR ADVANTAGE AGAINST OTHER PLAYERS OR OTHER WISE CHEAT*

As expected, I couldn't get any answers as to what software could have caused the ban, or even a list of banned software of any kind. I was told I'd need to create a new Steam account to play the game (YEAH RIGHT.) I'm never playing this game again, even if I was unbanned. It's a shame, I was considering buying in game items too. So here I am, a legitimate player and potential customer being treated like a cheater while actual cheaters run rampent in the game with aimbots and wallhacks. Appearently, Nexon, the parent company that owns this game has a nororiously bad customer support department, so good luck with any appeals. They won't review my case or communicate at all.

Dirty Bomb has enjoyable gunfights, smooth controls and weapon handling, Game design is fresh and modern, while still having a very oldschool vibe to it. This makes it a blast to play, as well as extremely familiair to anyone who's had at least a bit of experience with multiplayer FPS games. Really, this familiarity is well accredited, as the devs were the ones that made Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory, Doom 3's multiplayer (ID outsourced the multiplayer component to Splash Damage) and the lesser succesful Brink and Quake Wars. Needless to say, these were games i really enjoyed and specifically carry fond memories of with Enemy Territory when i was a prepubescent kiddo. As such, when they announced Dirty Bomb i was excited as hell.

It's been well over a year now and i've got plenty of time spent. (as i said, some of the gametime wasn't recorded)I think it's safe to say that Dirty Bomb is, if you ignore some of the flaws, the best FPS in the last few years. And yes, it ranks well and high above games such as Overwatch in that case. That said, that is my opinion. I'm a core gamer, i've grown up with games such as Quake, Medal of Honor, Enemy Territory, Unreal Tournament '99 and oldschool Call of Duty. (CoD, rest in peace, old friend. Whatever you've become is but a shadow of what you were) Dirty Bomb shakes up the modern FPS genre and returns it back to its roots. It still carries some more 'modern' elements, but much of it is classic, heavily skill-based duelist acrobatic gunfighting. And i, for one, love it. 

Usually speaking, F2P games have a catch somewhere. Many F2P shooters have strong, or slightly more hidden pay-to-win aspects, ridiculous grinding or worse. There are always a number of exceptions to the rule, and DB ranks as the latter. There's a grind, sure, i won't deny that, but i've never felt 'robbed' of my time spent. It's some serious, good old fashioned fun - as it's meant to be. And Dirty Bomb exceeds well in that.

Technically the game's not the sharpest of the bunch and some of the animations seem sluggish, but it runs very, very well. If you've got an old potato lying about, chances are Dirty Bomb can  be run on it. Equally so, i've yet to see a single bug or crash. (there were a bunch in the early beta, but that was to be expected, these have been fixed) The netcode is excellent as well. With so many games running awful netcode, or even downright ruin the experience (R6:Siege, for one), you'll never feel the game treated you unfairly.

There's a lot of praise here, absolutely, but Dirty Bomb does have it's cons. Skill-cards used to be on a fully random basis, but can now be bought with ingame money or real money. This used to be a serious con but that has been resolved. Farming in-game money however is only worth it when completing missions or your first-win-of-the-day bonus. Any other sort of grinding is so tediously slow, it feels like you're trying to save up money for a fancy car by begging for pennies on the street. You might as well not bother at all. Characters (mercenaries) in the game are also very, very expensive, as well as when spending real money on it. (i don't mind chipping in a bit, but, really, €10 per champ is pricey)

Secondly, while the devs do try to communicate with its fanbase a bunch, there's a lack of content. There are 6 maps, and 2 small maps for the arena game-mode (with often recycled props from the regular maps). Splash Damage has, over the time it's been released, only released one map. While i have to say the maps are top-notch, it does get a bit bland. Development is slow, at snail's pace. While it's better than nothing, i'd like to see some more development. 

Finally, there's barely a sense of balance in player skill. I've had more than a few times that the teams were ridiculously skewed to one or the other, which is frustrating to say the least. The game does try to balance it a bit in the pre-match lobby and people joining ingame, but it doesn't really seem to work well. Also, i've had a few times that a team's player count would be imbalanced as well. Sometimes you just jump in a match and you feel like you're in the 1939 blitzkrieg in Poland. You don't stand a chance. (equally so, i've had matches where we rolled over the enemy with little opposition) This is partially to blame on the game, but also on the playerbase. Dirty Bomb has a hardcore, dedicated fanbase, but few newcomers, making it hard to balance it out all right.

While the game is fantastic if it works out alright, sometimes it just doesn't. 

Regardless, don't let that hold you back. Dirty Bomb is well, well worth your time and effort. The price of admission? Absolutely zero. But if Dirty Bomb were a full priced AAA game, i'd have spent full price.

This game simply isn't the best I've played for a F2P game.

Pros:
- Game is fast-paced
- Game is optimized

Cons:
- Weapons aren't logical at all (4-5 shots to kill with a Deagle, 6+ to kill with a M4, etc)
- Sensitivity options aren't fitting
- Poor map randomization (no randomized map selections pre-game)
- Poor character balance (proxy getting 2 mines instantly, as well as other explosives)
- Hit detection is rubbish (tested with 40-60ms)
- It takes 3-5 bullets to finish someone off whereas 1 melee hit finishes them instantly (not logical at all)
- Poor gun balance (such as recoil, damage, rate of fire etc)
- Very limited amount of objectives
- Getting credits/coins takes way too long to get them
- No customizable loadouts
- Some characters move so fast to the point where you don't even know where they ran to

Proxy isn't fun, her mines are a cheap kill and thats fine but why give her two mines that recharge instantly. The fact that she always has a mine available means that she can place her mine anywhere without a care. Proxy should be nerfed in such a way where she only gets one mine but the mine deals heavy damage over a larger area. This nerf alows for more skillful placement of mines. Currently the meta involves mine spam making it nearly impossible to have fun as a light armored character.

Call Of Duty : marry me, and you get alot of money then before.

Team Fortress 2 : okay then.

Nine months later, they have a baby. They call it, Dirty Bomb. But DB have a little weird mentality, Don't go solo or you'll fucked. And DB didn't want to follow his father's steps, he just make a case instead of his father's supply drops. DB loved his mother so much, and he created a crafting system, but don't wanna follow his mother cosmetic systems. But DB love his father too, he just don't want to be as greedy as his father so he copied his father aim down sights setting. Unfortunately, DB followed his father's steps that shotgun is too OP. In high school, DB saw two guys that exactly looks like him, but more like his mother side, it was Overwatch and Paladins! DB hate  Overwatch because he is the most intelligent in the class, while Paladin always copied Overwatch's style. but DB has his own ways, and I love his ways.

-Poor matchmaking (Then again, which game got it right lol)
-Very few and badly designed maps. Some maps blatantly favor attackers, while others favor defenders.
-Hard to attack with short round times, bad spawn points (dude gets spawned right behind the c4 I planted when I spawn in another universe, how am I supposed to defend that?) and ridiculous payload repair mechanic (Defenders can destroy the payload lol, so you have to repair it before moving it again, which also takes forever).

Pros:
- Not P2W
- Neat things like trick jumps and animation cancelling 

Cons:
- Updated loadout system <-- Lotta the vets can say this shit is retarded
- Where the new maps and mercs at
- Laggy ass motherfuckers
- Optimization on balance
- Map balance


Although alot of people say it's P2W, it's not. Revolved around headshots, if you die, don't rage and deem it as P2W. You're just bad xd. Suggest you lowering your sens to anything below ten as it helps with your aiming alot. Also, knowledge comes with time played. Many of the vets understand little things that you don't, and can use that against you. Honestly, it's better to feel a crushing defeat so that you understand you aren't good and can learn from that. The trick jumps are dank as hell. You are able to suprise the fuck out of people. The animation is pretty cool too. For example, you can cancel the reload animation by switching to your melee then back to your main gun. This also works with jumping. Say someone is chasing you. You can long jump off of walls while reloading, so by the time you land, you can turn around and kill the guy. Also this trick works with abilites, like Fragger's nades. 

You don't really feel the joy from crafting a loadout anymore. :/. Able to craft a loadout whenever you want is what sucks. WIth the previous system, you could hope for a better loadout as you tradeup, AND still use your current one. With this one, it's go big or go home, and usually it's the latter. No new maps or mercs speaks it for itself. Maybe Turtle went into hiding in Dockyard, then Kira's orbital strike wiped both of them off London? I mean, Turtle is IN the trailer FFS. Please make a ping of or region limiter. Gokus everywhere. Some of them teleport behind me, lmfao. Balance has improved quite a bit from the last patch. You don't see stacked teams anymore, unless they are doing it purposely. Oh yeah, and stacking team on purpose should be a big no-no. Maybe make it so that high-level's can't stack, like an inability to switch unless one team is getting hammered? Nobody uses quick join, fix that part. Also, we don't even know how balance works. Is it based on accuracy with your use of guns? Splash Damage never tells us. Stuff with map balance issues is pretty common. For example, if your entire defending team dies on the last objective, it's nearly impossible to recapture it. Fragger nades, Kira lasers, Arty strikes... you get the idea. This also happens alot in Trainyard. There is almost nothing you can do.

Here's the top 3 pros versus the top 3 cons, I'll go into depth afterwards for those interested.

[h1]Pros:[/h1]
[list]
[*] Scoring system
[*] Combat
[*] Community
[/list]

[h1]Cons:[/h1]
[list]
[*] Unoptimized
[*] Free to play
[*] Community
[/list]

[i]~Delving into the pro list...[/i]

[h1]Scoring system[/h1]
   The scoring system in the game rewards you for the correct playstyle and allows for any class to be anywhere on the score boards. Using your abilities, killing, healing, defending, sticking with your teammates, working towards/completing the objective, etc.

[h1]Combat[/h1]
   The combat is fast-paced and action-packed. Fairly standard FPS mechanics with the addition of the quick movement. Wall jumping and long jumping are simple but add a lot of depth to the maps (mastering them offers better combat positions, quicker routes to the objective, ways to get behind cover with minimal exposure, etc.). Sniping is actually difficult due to the movement speed. Melee is actually useful. Firing at the hip has a purpose.

[h1]Community[/h1]
   Overall the community is pretty friendly. There are plenty of advice and guides from the players to help you improve your game. You can find nice little chit chat here 'n' there. Despite there being many people who play the game, there are still familiar faces as quite a few players are regulars.

[i]~Getting into the cons...[/i]

[h1]Unoptimized[/h1]
   Let's all be honest... this game is intensive and requires a beefy computer to run it. It doesn't help that this game isn't known for it's optimization. The dev's have been working at improving it but as of yet they still have work to do.

[h1]Free to play[/h1]
   Anyone who can run the game can play it... while this increases the community size it makes it easier for [i]everyone[/i] to join, from hackers to [i]that guy[/i] that nobody enjoys playing with. Hacking is a very uncommon sight fortunately so it's not that big of a problem. Worst comes to worst we can all vote kick, right? People won't abuse it or anything... clutch or kick cyka blyat. Wait... no... this isn't CS:GO, nevermind.

[h1]Community[/h1]
   I shouldn't have to go into this one too much as I already covered it... yeah it's mostly good, but there's plenty of bad to be found here too.

Some good and bad things-
1. The game is one of the fast paced games, everything happens in seconds. Jumping, Running, Rushing
2. Good balance of individual characters (Mercs), though Every one of them has different approach but they are well balanced when compared to each other with their own abilities.
3. Maps are now more interesting after last big update.
4. Big problem are servers, there are limited servers and they get overloaded most of the time resulting in bad latency. Hope they fix it soon in near future.
5. The team shuffling system is kind of unbalanced. Sometimes nothing happens and same team comes even after shuffle vote.
6. Special Loadout Cards are harder to get atleast for new players, but there are some packs or stuff that you can buy if you want.
7. The game is still in Beta, no idea when they gonna release stable version. Or they might continue fixing the bugs for whole 21st century.

Considering all this, the game is free & it's one of the good fps that you can enjoy without spending a buck.",1485315119,1485315119,True,5,0,0.533739566802978516,0,True,False,False

Pros
- NOT PTW.
- Balanced combat. No one person is better then another, it's all on your playstyle and how you use them.
- Loadouts. Or more accurately, loadout cards. Every one can be earned though random drops (much like a cs:go case) but requires nothing special to unlock it.
- Face paced combat reminiscent of Brink (To me at least) with parkour like movement when it comes to jumping.
- Classes or characters with each to their own special abilities and weapons. All of which can be earned and used though the weekly hero preview
- Little to no hackers
- Cannot stress enough that everything that makes up gameplay advantages CAN be earned.

Cons
- A little wonky to queue with friends for public matches.
- Unfortunately not always the best servers. High ping in some or just bad netcode, either one.
- A bit of a grind to unlock heroes. Not impossible but still a fair amount of time.
- Limited maps, still in ""beta"" even though it's been out for quite some time. I'd love to see more map selection.
- Not overly small playerbase but not exactly large. In lower level lobbies you can find the uncommon empty lobby or near empty.

Personally I find if this game did add more content like maps or whatnot this game would of the best FTP shooters out there without a doubt.

Overall I would strongly recommend this game to anyone who likes fast paced and class based combat.",1485238766,1485238895,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

+Decent Balance (All Mercs Seem to counter one another)

+Loadout Cards/Skeenz
-Long Credit Grind for characters and Cards
-Some Bugs and Glitches here and there but nothing too major like body flopping after being downed (Still a ""Beta Build"")
-Haven't found an option to remove the faint ""Beta Build"" in the bottom center of the HUD
-Events

There has definitely been updates and support from the devs (such as the performance and map enhancements) however I personally feel the game has become stale. But, I have faith in the developers and know that content is coming and I can't wait to see what this game has on final release. 

The gunplay is fantastic, and as a hardcore FPS player, it's some of the best I've experienced in years. The movement is fast and fluid and feels great; it's a nice mid-way point between classic FPS and arena shooters. The game has a very complex level of tactical and teamwork requirements to be competitive. Additionally, this game allows the better players to shine, there isn't much balancing of ability in Dirty Bomb, it gives players the platform and let's your skills do the talking.

For a free game it's a must try, no question. Especially if your a fan of FPS. There are zero P2W elements in this game, do not believe otherwise! The game has it's issues for sure, the biggest one, for me personally, is very very unbalanced teams on occasion that really kills the fun.

Unfortunately after months of no real content, unfixed bugs, blatant balance issues [Phantom update], horrible F2P system and performance problems I had to drop it. And so did many other people, the numbers on SteamDB speak for themselves.

This is Brink all over again, in that Splash Damage released a game and never properly finished it. 

Don't get fooled by ""Open Beta"", its been in open beta for over a year now which is a complete fucking joke and a dirty marketing technique.

tl;dr
- lack of content updates [ all the current Mercs in the game were already available in the Alpha, they are just being re-released]
- questionable design decisions [Execution mode which nobody asked for, all people wanted were more Stopwatch maps]
- badly optimized with performence issues on mid-range PCs
- bugs unfixed for months
- terrible F2P system with RNG crafting

Stupidly long loading times for how cheap the graphics are, even on low settings - worse, even, than previously.  Add to that the sluggish movement, toxic players in the games, and the apparent ability to buy upgrade card packs (surely buying upgrades isn't P2W here though), I see no gamesmanship other than on the part of the developer.
[/update]




------------------

I am trying VERY hard to like this (BETA) game but currently the gameplay just feels frenetic (and not in a good way).  All the players do is either snipe from as far away as possible, or bounce around the maps like ADHD children, resuting in a chatic brawl more akin to an FPS spin on SmashBros than an arena style shooter. 

Getting 1-shot killed just out of spawn is all too frequent (ludicrously so). Game 'balance' is laughable - machine guns do little to no damage at point blank, and the ADHD kids can skip right past you and slit your throat with a knife without slowing down - assuming you can get out of your spawn.

The 'Cases' concept is old, and a traditional P2W feel to it.  Getting and opening cases is an onerous ordeal to say the least.  You couldn't just buy and open 10 cases (i.e. buy 10 cards), you instead must buy 1 card at a time.  If you don't open the pack when you buy it, it takes 4 clicks/screens to get through each card - so, you buy 10 cards, you can get 40 mouse clicks. A small thing to be sure, but that kind of thing gets real old, real fast.  I get 35,000 credits or whatever - enough for 35 cases (cards)...  35cards x 4clicks / card = 140 clicks.  That seriously needs to be optimized.

As for the cards themselves, maybe I'm missing something but they really are not intuitive and seem pretty useless so far.  Almost all cards have been 'Lead', and maybe an 'Iron?' and a 'Copper'.  I bet if I blew enough real cash in the store I'd find something useful.

One last thought, as far as skill-based games go, this isn't one.  This is an FPS scratch-off game at best, where the only winner is can be the publisher.

[Edit] Tried again to love this game and couldn't manage it.  Unbalanced in crazy ways. Try to cap the objective?

Make sure everything is at room temperature.
Combine sugar, cheese, flour and vanilla in a big bowl and mix on medium speed till well combined. Don't forget to scrape the bowl as you're doing this.
Mix in the sour cream till its incorporated well. Then, add the eggs one by one, mixing well after each addition.
Pour the batter into the springform and let it bake for 1 hour and 10 minutes After the baking time, turn off the oven and leave the door ajar. Let the cake cool in there for about 1 1/2 hours.

[h1] Pros [/h1]
[*] A shooter that relies heavily on skill, since you don't die in one shot on this (unless your head is taken off by a sniper) so you'll have to land a good number of shots to kill someone.
[*] A plethora of characters, each with their own gimmick, stats and personality.
[*] Active community...small enough that you will see a handful of players again and again.
[*] For the most part, characters are fairly balanced...any powerful ability is paired with a long recharge time and vice versa.
[*] Pay to be lazy model means you don't ever need to spend money on this game unless you want something now and don't have the in-game funds.

[h1] Cons [/h1]
[*] While skill based, it will become obvious that some characters are heavily reliant on their powers to get kills (looking at you Pheonix and Red-eye)
[*] There is not 100% freedom to choose who you want to play...i've almost been kicked at the start of a game on numerous occasions because I decided I wanted to play as a sniper for a change.
[*] Fairly toxic community, 80% of dialogue with other players will be ""gg"", the other 20% are either people taunting you/accusing you of hacking.
[*] Balancing issues; about 2/5 games will be a landslide win/lose, either because there are more players on one team than the other (i'm talking about 7 vs 3, not just 6 vs 7) or because it stacked all the higher levelled, more skilled players against the people that have just started.
[*] Unless you play this game religiously, have fun grinding the money required to unlock every character (as of writing i've played roughly 60 hours, in that time i've unlocked 3 people). This statement is true for other players too, so be ready to get a landslide of the same 3 characters on yours and the opponents team...fighting 5 red-eyes was probably the most infuriating game of my time playing.

Finally, here are personal gripes...they may or may not impact your gameplay, but these things bug the hell out of me:
[*] Anyone who plays Pheonix or Phantom thinking they can actually support their team.
[*] Anyone who taps the defib button so you're revived to the brink of death when they could've just held the button down a second longer.
[*] Fletchers...that is all
[*] Escorting the EV while against a Kira
[*] Getting killed by a land mine that someone else triggered.
[*] Starting a game with a fairly balanced team, then suddenly a level 97 joins (60 hours, i'm still level 10)
[*] Anyone who says gg, especially when its at the end of the first of what could potentially be 11 short rounds.
[*] That one player who doesn't realise what sprinting, jumping, or aiming is...and may be a bot in hindsight.
[*] Immediately dying after spawning to a skyhammers airstrike you couldn't have possibly predicted.

It's by the same developer as the very well regarded Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory, and takes the form of a team-based rolling-objective high-speed high-accuracy shooter. I like to think of it as TF2 meets Quake3 in London with wall-jumping...

Much has been made - and misunderstood - about how the game monetises itself (it's F2P afterall). I'm happy to say the game allows you to compete on a level playing field with people investing money - there's [b]certainly[/b] no [i]special ammo[/i] or [i]pay-only weapons[/i] or things like that.

If you do intend to pay for most of your progress with in-game-earned Credits try to maximise the Missions you are set - they can be worth significant amounts to you.

I’m a fan of their art and general style too – it’s British without being hackneyed or irritating, and there are some lovely touches of quintessentially dry humour. What’s more the character design is great. There are both male and female characters but none pander to the dull, well-trodden path of buxom ladies and rippling torso’d men. The design feels more cohesive, solid and more [i]believeable[/i] as a result. I find it great.

I'm not going to say the game is perfect - I'm sure the developers would be the first to agree - but they are very open with their work and stream 4 times a week across 2 twitch channels. They take questions and answer them in a manner that's honestly refreshing compared to many other devs.

If I had to criticize - I’d say the real-money cost of many of the items seems too high. Especially the Mercs (characters / hereos / etc.) - this honestly pushes me towards the F2P route to unlock them.

Summing up :: This is my go-to game at the moment and I'm having a lot of fun. If you like a fast FPS experience I can [b]certainly recommend[/b] you give it a try.

Yes, there's execution but honestly that is the least popular mode in the game and I don't think that requires years of work.

We don't have all the mercs out yet (basically for cash grabbing reasons) and the mercs that do come out are buggy or poorly thought out. Sparks revivr bugged out on revives, rendered team mates invisible upon revive and still does too much damage to the EV/destructable side objectives. Phantom now on paper is just ridiculous, don't rly think he is too OP for 5v5 as he doesn't offer much in terms of gaining ground and securing objectives, in pubs however he is annoying as fuck. The concept of a cloak acting as a shield is completely counter-intuitive, if you get spotted and are getting shot at the cloak is no longer serving a purpose, they know you're there. Instead of being punished for your lack of stealth you are rewarded with 75 free health.

Why don't we have demos yet? Why don't we have our own private servers yet? Why doesn't ranked work yet? (ranked frequently puts you in a mis-matched lobby e.g. 4v6.) Why are merc re-releases taking so long? and when they are released they aren't in a very good state whatsoever.
Other than giving us blue reskins with cobalt tier loadout cards I'm not sure what is even happening at the SD offices each day.

==== Previous review ====

Think Counter-Strike (gun play) meets Team Fortress 2 (objectives) meets Call of Duty (fast pace)... on steroids.  A variety of weapons, great gun play mechanics and smooth movement meets team objectives/goals.  The unique aspects of the game involve timed spawn queues and the ability to revive dead teammates (with a medic) -- these elements alone play a big part in a team's strategy to push forward or defend.  

But it's not a game for everyone.  It's hard!  This game requires both good hand-eye coordination and brains.  Many will struggle with the frenetic fast pace.  Others won't be able to comprehend the concept of teamwork that's needed. And most will be overwhelemed with both the map and situational awareness required that is essential to the constantly changing tactics and decision-making needed to win games.  

Are you good enough?  I would debate that 8/10 people are not.  ;)  :)

Update: June 13, 2015 - So many people are complaining that the game is too hard to grind out credits to get new mercs, or that the game is ""pay to win"".  That is simply incorrect.  This indicates coddled children who want everything to be spoon-fed to them -- they simply lack work ethic and grit and would much rather be given all the mercs for free, or worse, want the game to auto-aim for them.  I have friends who are too cheap to buy new mercs and they still wreck shop with the default mercs.  So again, read the above review, and ask yourself, ""Are you good enough?""  80% of you won't be.

Yes there are cheaters here but it's no difference than in any other FPS out there.  I keep reading of this people claiming that they go in servers after servers and there is always a hacker in it.  This is just BS.  I get accused daily just because I can get 50 kills and only 5-10 deaths in a match with my sniper.  FYI --> That doesn't make me a cheater; it makes me better than you.  Let’s also talk about all does that claim this is a P2W game.   Don’t believe this CR@P, after bronze all you get are skins.  That means bronze is equal to silver, gold, Cobalt, Obsidian and the Alienware cards.   I only have about 1-2 hours to play this game daily and I get 2-4k easily.  Its 50k per Merc or 10$.  That means that if you for play 15 days (2 hours a day) you can get a Merc easily.

Classes people have problems with: 

Nader:  I can understand the hate for this class.  If you are in a close already you are as good as dead if this class sees you.  

Vassili/sniper:  Come on!  Why would you run in a straight line in a wide open area?  You deserve to get shot!
Redeye/sniper:  if you see smoke just wait until it goes away before you step out.  If you do than you deserve to get shot.

Broken Classes:
Phantom/The useless Ninja!:  This class was nerfed to extinction.  When it came out it was a really fun class and many complained it was OP so the devs nerfed it by making it practically useless.  His Katana now has the reach of a pocketknife so you have to basically kiss the other player to kill him.

I give this game a 8/10.  It needs more maps and has some glitches but it is an OPEN BETA!

Dirty Bomb is a Free-To-Play team-based First-Person Shooter created by Splash Damage, the same developers behind BRINK. Dirty Bomb does not offer a storyline between two main factions, rather a random set of mercs picked out by an algorithm in the game to work together and complete the objective. To really find the story behind the game, you will have to look through the lore between each of the characters to know their personality & background.

[h1]Graphics & Aesthetics[/h1]
Dirty Bomb is created through the Unreal Engine, and has a large number of graphical options to suit your needs. It supports up to 1920 x 1080 px resolutions, Fullscreen, Borderless Fullscreen, and Windowed, with advanced options such as Anti-Aliasing, Ambient Occlusion, and a number of different options with respect to textures and shadows. The game overall does require you to have some top-notch computer parts to play, but if you tweak with the configurations, you can definitely bring it down to 2007-era computers. 

Aesthetics-wise, the game looks very cartoonish, but definitely fits right in with the theme. The background isn't exactly beautiful in the least, but at the very least the objects that will come flying into your face are crisp and clear, which is likely the only real necessary thing to know. If there's one thing to recognize though, it's that even though maps need to look bleak and devastated, at least you can still detect the differences in what something is than let it mix with everything else. 

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
Ready to ride on the FREE-TO-PLAY RUSSIAN ROULETTE? I certainly am. Since this is a Free-To-Play, there will still be a lot of players that just want to play Team Death Match and get the highest kills. For some characters, this is the only way they can really play this character, and I understand that. 

THIS GAME WILLS PLAYERS INTO PLAYING THE OBJECTIVE, and if you're not ready to go 100% in it, then it can get really frustrating for the team playing with you. At least, that's how I felt after being with players that didn't know how to use their character abilities and wanted to shoot the enemy team with their shoddy pistols.

""GET THE BLOODY OBJECTIVE!"" is probably the only thing you'll hear after a long gaming session. This was something I remember experiencing when I was playing BRINK, and hearing it ""hear"" really annoys the ears out of me. To describe the animosity of it, consider Titanfall's ""Be Advised"" issue. It's a pet peeve, but if the writers could word it ever so slightly differently, it would make a world's difference for me.

[i]""fuck man, it's just a game"". [/i] I don't know about you, but me talking about the brevity of not being super immersed into something again is rare in a review. Just to keep this between you and me, I'm sure a lot of people like to win, and this is the one time where I'll say that THIS GAME GETS PEOPLE SO HYPED IT'S LIKE CSGO CASUAL/COMP AGAIN. It doesn't matter if you're in a casual match or in a casual team, these people will fight you even if it's as meaningless as reading this review. 


[h1]Business Model[/h1]
This game acts like CSGO, yet behaves like Metro Conflict. In Metro Conflict, you can purchase different characters permanently for an unfair price, but the weapons you get are pretty much stuck with you for that character. It acts like CSGO in that the way you receive different weapons or playstyles are based on a card. YOUR PLAYSTYLE IS DEPENDENT ON A CARD, WHICH IS AS RNG AS THE CSGO CRATES.

Does that mean the game is Pay-To-Win in a micro level? Not necessarily. You can still purchase a specific loadout card you want from a character so that you can play optimally. At a more macro level, there's a number of different characters with different loadouts making the balance really difficult to see through. This is also added to the benefactor that player skill is adjusted for it, but all in all, IT'S REALLY DIFFICULT TO SAY WHETHER IT'S PAY-TO-WIN WHEN THERE'S SO MANY FACTORS GOING INTO THE MATCH.

Still though, I wouldn't deny that I didn't think that this game feels Pay To Win in the least. There's always that one player with a Cobalt Loadout Card that, you know.. maybe it's because of the card that his perks are objectively better on that character resulting in a better ability to play. At the very least, it's on the back of my mind, but it doesn't poison my judgement when I later finish his/her life with my trusty melee item.

[h1]OVERALL[/h1]
This game is a double-edged sword for me. I love it in that I get to play with people that really like playing a certain objective and not be fuccbois over just wanting to play Team Deathmatch, but in the other edge, I end up being that very same fuccboi after losing a match, thinking, maybe that Obsidian Loadout dude had the upper hand because he was in beta.

This game is a strangely good kind of pain, but to those that just want to get a quick killstreak, this is not one of those games. Do not try this game just to spite me if you are, because this game takes the living hell and puts it inside you.

Alternatively if you don't like those games, this one is better anyways! The game is fast paced to keep you constantly excited, and every game focuses on working with your team to complete the objectives. Every map is brilliantly made and allows players to use what they know to really change the tide of the battle. Sticking with your squad is important in this game, so its great to play it with friends, and even if you're not the community is amazing and I've walked away enjoying every single match.

Flaws of the game? A few characters seem a little overpowered but once you try it out, you'll realize that people are just good with that merc. Each character is uniquely made and there is a perfect setup for anyone. Lag has never seemed to be an issue and the mechanics of the game are simple and easy to learn. This game doesn't have a large learning curve, its straight to the point and there are no dirty tactics that will make you hate the enemy.

If your not convinced by my review, just try the game out. It's free! Also, unlike counterstrike, crates you receive to unlock are immediatley able to be opened and you can buy more with your in game currency. Characters are also purchasable with in game money, but if you hate to wait then you can always buy the characters with real money. Either way, its great and the game is constantly getting updates to keep you involved and bringing you back to see what's new.

What does this game do well? I wouldn't be writing a review if I wasn't going to tell you, Dirty Bomb excells at creating a first person shooter gaming environment that not only rewards skilled veterans of the genre, but also allows casual gamers the chance to enjoy it in all of it's explosive and action-packed nature. 

So often do we see games that label themselves free-to-play, but are secretly pay-to-enjoy. Dirty Bomb breaks this cycle and does it with a clever system of credits and ""loadout-cards"". Without spending a cent, one can easily find themselves creating their own niche and developing a playing strategy that allows them to play their own way. Earning the upgrades and classes you want are as simple as playing the game and investing your time (only a few hours or less). 

A lot of the reviews on steam will tell you the game is flawed because there have been issues with server security and hacking. They'll tell you the game isn't worth playing. This is highly innacurate. Personally, I have not experienced this, nor has it made my playing of the game any less enjoyable. 

When I was younger I used to play TF2, Counter Strike and though I'm embarassed to admit, Call of Duty. Since those days though, I had struggled to find a first person shooter that could hold my attention quite as much. Dirty Bomb changed this. Now I could continue on, at length, about why I enjoy this game so much, but honestly that wouldn't help you would it? If you've been gaming for quite a bit of time like myself, or maybe you've recently started, I'm sure you still know 'THE' feeling. You know what I'm talking about and it's hard to find the words that describe it, that feeling of instant satifaction the moment the game loads up, the feeling of overwhelming joy when you finish a game in the top ranking, when you finally achieve that goal you've been working towards. That's what this game has given me, a chance to feel again those moments of satisfaction that I felt when I was younger.

Gameplay: Fast. Arcade-y. Pretty much like Brink if it was polished up. I honestly found it to be really fun. I loved the semi-parkour system. It wasn't exactly Brink style parkour. But it's still somewhat present. Especially with movement. However. That isn't to say that some of the gameplay isn't balanced. There are certainly alot of balancing issues at the moment. 7/10

Graphics: ...Pretty meh. If I may say. Not really an art style present. Bland colors. Some shoddy textures here and there. 
But they aren't terrible. 5/10 

Animation quality: Fantastic. I could watch some of the animations for days on end. Especially some of the pistols. The reload animations are really smooth. Yet they don't distract you from the gameplay either. (Apart from me.) Some of the melee animations could do with a rework though. They're kinda dodgy in some cases. 8/10

Economy (In game credits, micro transactions etc.): This is what really let's the game down. However if you're expecting a rant about the cases. I don't actually mind them. You get them for free. So they aren't exactly forcing you to buy them. Which is pretty nice. In fact. It's about the cost for the characters. I'm sorry. But £7.00 for one single character. Who almost reuses the exact same abilities and weapons. Is pathetic. I wouldn't mind it as much if they lowered the in game cost to at least half of the required amount. (25K) But 50K for a character which is such a boring grind since you earn really low amounts of credits in game, is an incredible scam. Yeah. Sure there's a free rotation. But It's still complete scamming bullshit.

Matchmaking is rife with hackers, 'balance' issues are a constant, and the number of maps available for play is abysmally low. Votekick function is ""implemented"", but it doesn't work when used. 

Nexon is following the tried and true ""F2P"" style of releasing new content in the form of mercenaries, enticing people to blow hard earned credits, or in some cases cash on new mercs that completely shift the balance of fights. Roughly a week or so after all of these purchases have been made and people have had their fun, these same mercs get crippling 'rebalances' or are just marginalized into being reskins of existing mercs.

Credit gain is glacially slow because it is based on the time a match takes, not performance in the match. If two players are in a 30 minute ranked game together and one earns 15,000xp and the other earns 500xp out of objectives, support, and combat totalled up.

By playing the game u will collect many , many cards for free that u dont want to directly use , u can use these cards to craft a random card for your favorite merc.

cards come with rarities. so there are lead , iron , bronze , silver , gold and cobalt loadout cards. lead cards have only one augment ( passive ability for your merc) while iron has 2 augments and from bronze and above all cards have 3 augments. From bronze rarity and up all cards are equally strong with the difference of aesthetics , so a golden loadout merc looks better that a bronze merc etc.

gameplay wise the game is fast and fun to play , with very well made shooting mechanics and cartoony gfx which are really well made!!!

If you were to personally ask me what P2W is, I'd say, ""Games with weapons or unlockables (Generally ones that give you an advantage or are just overpowered) not obtainable through playing the game for free, instead using real world money to unlock it.""

TL;DR: Everything above Bronze in loadouts is cosmetic. Characters rotate to play for free every week.

How this game works is entirely different, you get loadout cards, now while you might think, ""Oh, well that must mean that everything Silver and Gold is better than things that are Bronze."" This is not correct, every card above Bronze simply works as a form of cosmetic.
On the other hand you have people that would say, ""Getting a Bronze card would mean you have way too many advantages over players that don't."" This is also not true, as the bronze cards simply give you perks on the side that give you small boosts, no gun damage, health (Except for one perk that gives you up to 30 health for dying multiple times) or other character attributes altered with cards.

Now with these loadout cards, you also get different weapons. These weapons on the loadout cards will change how you play your character. By default you have good loadouts, you can destroy anybody with the basic loadouts so long as you can aim, your guns make you, not your perks. You can get a different gun for every rarity of loadout, even the worst rarities come with guns that can change how you play by alot, but for the most part all the guns are reletively balanced.

Next comes the whole RNG thing that people get very angry at because they can't find good things in cases. 1000 ingame credits = 1 case, this case grants you 1 random loadout card in the game, with the higher tier rarities being lower chances of obtaining, but still possible. if you really want to go all out, you can spend 5 dollars in real world money for some random cases that are primarily used for the higher chance at getting Gold and Cobalt loadouts, but still guarenteed a Silver loadout.

The crafting system is next and it's pretty simple, put in cards you don't like of the same rarity and get the next loadout rarity up, you also select any of the characters that you want a loadout specifically for. Essentially trade up contracts in CS:GO. Pretty easy to understand, gives you another chance at randomizing and it's a way of letting you get loadouts that are Silver and higher without the RNG chance, however the weapons and perks are randomized each time. 
With that being said, if you find that you can't be bothered to open up cases for 1000 ingame credits, you can simply save up enough to just buy a bronze loadout that you like.

Next comes characters. Here's where people have whined most about the game. ""6-10 Dollars for a single character in this game? What a ripoff!"" And here's where I come in and say ""You don't need to spend money, blah blah blah, you can play the game normally and get every character you just need to save up a bit.""
On top of this, there is a free character rotation every week. Just like in League of Legends, every week three characters become unlocked for the week's duration as playable characters, afterwards you need to purchase them to keep them permanently.

To end this I'm simply going to put it. The game is fun, not Pay 2 Win, and it's starting to take up time I would spend playing Tf2.",1435329282,1435676109,True,741,51,0.835471570491790771,16,True,False,False

Yes, you have to grind for multiple hours/nights to earn yourself 50.000k ingame credit (price of new merc), but it is very very do-able. And otherwise is 9,99 euro for 1 merc. If you do your missions everyday, you'l get there faster than you think. offcourse there are also bundles and starter packs. But i see it this way : in a few months there will be no more mercs to be released, by that time there have been multiple double xp weekends and other boosts to help you gain enough credits for your favourite merc!

 Movement is fast and responsive, headshots important, weapons accurate, teamplay required and objective oriented. The level design isn't flawless but the current few maps are all solid. I can't recall the last time I played a shooter in which I liked all of the maps. 

The buisness model isn't 'optimal', but for free to play game it's certainly acceptable. A free pool of rotating starter mercs with any loadout card that requires any real amount of grinding being a cosmetic change only from the fairly easy to obtain bronze cards. 

If you're a very casual player, expect to struggle. This game has very few democratizing elements to bridge skillgaps.

-PROS-
-Good Hit Registry (Been a long time since I have been able to say that!) 
-SERVER BROWSER! (This alone is worth a thumb in my opinion) 
-ADS And Hip fire are just as useful in their own situations. 
-ACTION PACKED
-Comedic

-CONS-
-Hackers. (As with any game, they exist, and in Dirty Bomb, there is no lack of them. At least 1 seen for every 20 min of game play) 
-The Grind is real.. Unless you make $20/hour and don't have a family that consumes your funds. 
-No hardcore mode. (I've played Low health/Hardcore modes in pretty much every FPS that has it, I don't feel like it should take any more then 3-5 well placed shots to kill someone, So I'm pretty biased to the fact that even if you land a perfect head shot on someone standing still(unless your a sniper) , it will need to be accompanied by at least one other body shot to put someone down. 

-MIXED concerns- 
I Don't agree that this game is P2W per say, but I do believe that the more money you spend, the better your chances of ruining everyone else's lives. The grind in the game is stupid ridiculous, albeit less monotonous since the latest patch that reduced mission timers. The latest Merc’s for example Rhino and Kira, one has a freaking AOE laser that can be controlled for like 10 seconds and it one shots everything and everyone within what feels like an entire spawn area. Rhino, has a Minigun, that has little to no spread, and absolutely no cooldown if bursted. Compared to everyone else who has at least 5-10 second cooldowns even after you pick-up what you placed down (Proxy and her mines for example, that take 3 seconds to arm after being placed, and only take half health when someone stands directly on them, if she picks it back up she still has to wait a CD before she can place it down again.) he just fires his SPECIAL like it's no problem. Bitch at me if you must but that shit is broken. Anyway, back to the point, If you don’t have the funds to spare, you better use common sense to join a low ping server, hope to hell that no stupid 500+ ping foreigner joins, and aim for the head as much as possible. 

Besides the unbalanced mercs, the amount of money that you can spend for a slight advantage, and the shitty hackers. It’s actually one of the best Free to Play games, I’ve ever installed. If you have $20 to drop, I suggest at least doing that for the merc pack and bonus coins, you will need them.

Its a great game, Not P2W, the mechanics are ... well Old school, More quake wars than ET:RTCW thats all good.

Game modes can be long winded for some that can steer you away from putting long sesions in.

The key problem though... Its a F2P game and thats good for the playerbase, As of current though me and many others will not continue to play for the time being as theres no customisation, sure theres various things that make your character slightly different, but theres no purchaseable asthetics that can just make you look better.

With practically no visual customisation at this point, the game gets stale, and its not just a case of looking better than someone else, its to support the future of the game too, because some of us like grinding to get all the characters with in game cash, and in this game that will take quite a while.

Brink managed customisation, So why cant this? theres a lot of options this game can take with customisation, not just stickers and reskins of characters, cant be that boring.

I should have articulated myself better. Sorry. My nostalgic trip was to highlight all the interesting and creative things I could do in ET. When I compare that to Dirty Bomb I'm just not finding the same scope of gameplay. Obviously Dirty Bomb is a different game but   I find it lacks depth and could be so much more. Splash Damage just makes these types of games so the comparison is always going to be made in my eyes.


I'm a huge ET fan. It's the one game I look back the most fondly. As another review said this is what BRINK should have been and I totally agree. However it just doesn't quite capture the magic of ET. Perhaps I'm wearing rose coloured glasses... But it's the yard stick I measure ALL Splash Damage games with.

I only played Covert Op (enemy in disguise) back in the day and I miss the little things I could do as that class. This is why the magic is missing for ME -> I can't be as creative as I used to be.

- Capture the forward spawn at just the right time
- Deny the enemy information by blowing up the command post at strategic times
- Secondary means of completing the objective - Fuel Dump ;)
- Satchel charge on a group of gunners
- Run through the spawn to get to the objective in an unexpected manner
- Open the back door and sneak key team members in (multiple vectors to complete a mission)
- Fireteam chat (only communicate to key team memebers)
- Spotting hidden mines
- Mind games with the enemy, constantly blowing up the command post and hiding, blocking the doorway when rushing to defuse, pretend to defend an objective for a long period of time
- Hiding in the bushes, spotting mines waiting to pounce
- Smoke grenades (so useful)

This and so much more I could do that I felt made a huge impact on the course of a round. Brutally hard to pull off but so satisfying. It appealed to my lone wolf introverted nature.

In saying that... I'm going to stick with this game, hoping the new mercs bring something new to the table. Red eye and that invisible one look promising. 

Currently the game is fast and fun. Some rounds your team are a bunch of muppets and other times they're God's gift to gaming. Mostly it's a fairly balanced game of tug-o-war. But as it stands there are just too many variations of the same merc. Give me tools to be creative.

Still recommend.

Second is a shotgun lady with a first aid station deployable, and can revive, boom, there are many many different character types after that
PROS 
- Jump, shoot, make with the hurt to enemies with enough variety in the characters to keep interest
- Free mercs are fantastic, merc rotation is also unbiased. Even if you don't spend any money, two of the best support characters are yours
- Unless your team is entirely snipers, even the most off the wall combination of mercs can give a fair fight
CONS
-Stupidly expensive to unlock mercs, 50 times the price of just unlocking a loadout crate, 10$ USD a piece, kinda a.. woah, sort of thing
- Loadout cards, a balancing factor, essentially limit what weapons you bring as a specific merc to random chance. Interesting, but irritating

Dirty Bomb has Payload, Capture the flag (1 side), and repearing objectives, and depending on the map you can either have to repair, then paylord the EV and finally deliver an objective.
So there's a good mix in maps with objective types.

Sadly, this also means your favorite class, or Merc, might be useless on that map, like Arty in Underground, due to the map having no sky, so you can't call down a bombardment of the area.

Now, it has that TF2 kind of vibe, but there's no med packs lying around, but there's ammo crates stationed in corners.
And medics are very valuable!

There are some balance quirks that needs tuning, but so far it's a very enjoyable experience.

Pros:
- Great speed during game play
- Guns feel good
- Map layouts are nice
- The LoL way of purchasing stuff in game is cool
- The mercs are interesting
- Playing with a group of friends is amazing

Cons:
- Mercs abilities can be OP when they are stacked on a team and some cant be countered
- Loadouts are locked into specific weapon combinations and cant be altered
- Teamwork is essential and joining a PUG feels more like a chore than being fun
- KDR still seems to matter more to most people over objectives
- Support mercs need an end game reflection on the score board (revives, defends, repairs)

Beta is beta though so if they fix a few balance issues, reward support a bit more, dont turn this into P2W, and really push people to play objectives over a TDM style game play then this game will shine.

I came into this game with high expectations since I have played many many games on the unreal engine so far that and after 12hrs and 5 competitive matches my final word is it's an awesome game for a closed beta. Using the Unreal Engine of course also means it is an easier transition for many players who have played F2P Unreal Engine games such as AVA and SF2 by simply moving over setting the same FOV and sensitivity and you are set to learn the core mechanics of the game. The game takes away the whole weapon shop system for card loadouts and balancing between the characters exceeds expectations for a game that is in a closed beta. The game allows you to set 3 different characters into a loadout when u play allowing you to switch freely between the classes while you are waiting to respawn. Teamwork and communication is a integral part of the game while placing less emphasis on individual skill. In game voice comms  is similar to CSGO and there is no stuttering from players with high ping. A competitive matchmaking is available and it follows a similar queue method as CSGO with several different servers to choose from. The game has taken away the OHKO sniper rifles and shifted them into a OnehitHeadshot model which battlefield fans would be all to familiar with while the COD fans might take a huge issue with. The pace of the game is extremely fast due to the heightened movement speed and it doesn't take too long to move from spawn into action. The FOV slider is of course a welcomed addition since most unreal engine shooters lock FOV at 85-90fov. 

However it is important to note that there is no uniformed aiming so sniping could potentially be an issue. Also class abilities are on an extremely short cooldown for a 8v8 game where Artys and Frags can dish out the explosive hate one after another in an almost never ending chain of death ball explosions. Outside of peak hours it is almost impossible to find a competitive game which could possibly fix itself once another few rounds of beta keys are given out. The learning curve of the game is sharper than most free to play shooters and learning the core mechanics of the game such as the different play styles of the characters and juggling key abilities with longer cool downs. You also spawn with quite a small portion of ammo and ammo is scarce if your teammates does not care about teamplay and only supplies himself with ammo. Despite all the issues that I have raised the game it is important to note that the game is in closed beta and holds great promise for the future.",1433017616,1433017616,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Something just did not feel quite right about the gun mechanics and the flow of the game and I just did not enjoy it, however a few months had passed and I decided to take this game back up again.

Much to my surprise Dirty Bomb has come along way and it feels amazing to play, it's a fun fast paced team-objective focused game which is something that players who like the competitive side of fps have been lacking for a while. The game works by first selecting three ""Mercenaries"" which are essentially different classes whom have different 'abilities' such as medics whom can revive and play a more support role or ammo givers who can play offensively but fragging also plays an important role and you have a few mercenaries available to you who do that alone. There may be TOO much reward at the moment for just fragging which is a slight concern given the objective-based nature but it balances out fairly well and players who focus on objectives should score highly still.

Overall this game has awoken a love for the fast paced side of fps that I haven't had in a while with well balanced maps, intuitive map layout with a seemingly easy skillcap at first for new comers but you soon realize the skill ceiling for outplay potential in this game gets pretty huge, specifically with the wall hopping mechanic of the game.

in all honesty the only reason i tried this game out was because i was offered a key to play this game, originally i saw videos of it and it looked great and with this key invite from alienware arena i could have finally had the chance to play it. and boy was it a good choice. there's a lot of team based action going on in this game, a lot of content updates, and most of all it isn't pay to win at all.

the game's shop where you actually spend your money is mostly just for show for your characters, such as guns and perks that stands you apart from the rest. and even if you choose to not give a single penny to Splash Damage you could still earn all the characters, all the loadouts and all the fun for free. they don't force you to buy anything. and over time as you level up you can earn loadout cases which is basically the game's way of giving you a card which changes your characters guns and perks. without the cards you're stuck on the basic version of your class so there really isn't any force on the players to buy something.

what i can say negative about this game is that there's just too much grinding for currency to buy anything. you earn a measly about 200 credits a match and just for one character it could range about 30-50k and that's just nonstop playing, the game offers you dailies to complete that give you more than usual credit but it's still a long way to go to achieve the person you wanna buy. sometimes the guns you're using just doesn't feel like you're a total badass, it could be more in your face with the sound, because everyone's guns just sound too low to feel menacing. other times you're in a position where you could really be an essential team player if you were sniping or an engineer but you can't because all 3 of your loadout classes are entirely different classes and because of this you're stuck relying on what you have rather than what your team can do and most of the time your team might just be using a class just to get kills instead of actually defending or attacking the objective. so maybe they could force players with a better tutorial or maybe an extra loadout.

so tl;dr would i recommend this game? yeah i would, it's really fun and you get a good time out of this compared to other triple A titles. i can't compare this to brink at all because out of both of them one was a disaster and this game is not. this game honestly reminds me more of tf2 without the hats.",1432809272,1432809272,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

--GOOD--
+Fast paced FPS gameplay that favors hip fire.
+Class based system lets every Mercenary useful in their own way (you need one of each to succeed).
+Team/squad based gameplay is a priority which means it does help complete objectives.
+Variety of Mercs to fit different playstyles (fast paced run & gun, Slow and methodical, Support).
+ Interesting character design and environment (cartoony yet semi-realistic).
+Interesting maps and objectives that change the course of gameplay.
+TEAMWORK is stressed and strategy matters which is fun.
+No weapon repair cost/rentals (good when compared to other Free to play FPS)
+You can be good at this game and have good equips without spending real money.

--BAD--
- Some Mercenaries are not balanced, (Nader's SMG is really overpowered vs Skyhammer's Assault rifle does no damage).

- Certain maps have objectives that can be abused to generate easy wins.
-Merc balance with respect to weaponry and damage.
-(for some people, it can be fustrating to keep looking for loadout cards to get good equips).
- In game money reward is on the low side (IF YOU DO NOT COMPLETE OBJECTIVES).

Dirty Bomb is an objective-orientated competitive online shooter. Each match you pick three potential classes (mercenaries) you can freely swap between upon death. Class balance is asymmetrical. Each class has a role (Soldier, Support, Medic or Engineer), abilities to suit that role and a weapon set/movement model compliments combat at a certain range. Movement is quick like an arena shooter, with an Unreal Tournament style wall jump and Half Life style long jump helping you get around the maps. There is an aim down sights feature, however, due to the speed of movement and the accuracy of hip firing, aiming down sights is more niche than in other FPS games.

Competitive play is 5 v 5. Casual play is 6 v 6 to 8 v 8.

[b]Pros[/b]

The skill ceiling in the game is very high and there's a lot of depth to mechanics. Many new FPS games shy away from features like sophisticated movement and health systems that made games like Quake so rich. Dirty Bomb is not one of these games.

Although strafing and crouching the standard evasion model, great players can also use long jumps and wall jumps to further increase evasion in the right situation. Perhaps even the odd standard jump in some niche circumstances. The maps are specifically built with jumps in mind and there are various spots that will provide you with good flanks or an advantage, with the right trick jump. The movement model has depth but it's also not obnoxiously powerful such as in games like Quake, people that haven't quite mastered it definitely stand a reasonable chance against people that have.

Health does regenerate slowly over time, however, if you don't have access to a medic, the down-time is somewhat punishing if your health bar is significantly depleted. Additionally, you spawn with only a few magazines of ammunition, meaning you will also need access to a Support character or the slower supplying and uncommon ammunition box, to regularly stock your pool. 

The level design is good in the context of competitive play. It's not too open and not too “chokey”. There's usually 2 - 3 potential lanes you can take to push. The inclusion of optional but useful sub-objectives has also further enhanced the design by spreading combat out and giving people more targets to focus on.

Most of the small arms are solidly designed and satisfying to use. The bullets go where you shoot them! Most of the time, it's the better player that will win an engagement.

Balance may not be perfect but the game is very playable, as pretty much any class, in a non-competitive setting. 

[b]Cons[/b]

Casual play feels like a non-consideration. The maps are really too “chokey” and defender-orientated for public matches. Slowly regenerating health and low ammunition pools leave you gimped without a reliable medic and support on your team. It's hard for a single player to carry a bad team, however several competent players can make a huge difference, meaning you often get very imbalanced one sided public matches. Furthermore, several classes have abilities that are very frustrating to play against in the larger scale public matches (I'm looking at you “spammy” grenade launcher). I personally think this is a big thing because it means Splash Damage are overly limiting their target demographic - Dirty Bomb likely will not be able to sustain itself on “hardcore” competitive players alone.

Balance isn't quite there yet and some of the classes are straying in to hard counter territory levels of power. The soldier classes specifically feel like they're excessively superior to the others at killing. There are certain mechanics like high velocity cook-able one hit kill grenades and 1.5s immortality upon revive that obviously need to go.

In addition to the class balance problems, there seem to be some netcode issues occasionally, perhaps linked to lack of inertia on certain fast moving classes. Certain people forgo good aim and decide to spaz out strafing and/or jumping instead and/or crouching. Unfortunely, sometimes this nets these people the win because directional changes become game breakingly fast. Obviously this negatively impacts the competitiveness of the game quite a bit. 

Although it's obviously early days yet, the game seems to really lack long term re-playability. You've probably seen all the game has to offer and reached close to maximum progression in a couple of hundreds hours of play, at best. Ranked queues are long and there is only the odd small scale tourne on weekends. There's little in the way of a competitive scene yet and a game like this sorely needs one. Early days though, this could easily change in time.

The business is currently okay, however, this might change. Progression is mildly P2W in the short term, however, viable competitive loadouts are quickly attainable, and at the end of the day, the progression cap isn't set that high. If you did want to spend money to reduce your grind everything would only cost ~£30, at the time of writing. This price will definately go up every time a new class is released though. (Bare in mind you don't necessarily need everything though and can also mix/match paying and buying content for in-game currency.)

Other minor cons: The UI is laggy. The vote interface isn't very obvious and intuitive. Pub stomping premades allowing on casual servers. The odd hacker and no clear way to report them. 

[b]Conclusion[/b]

If you like fast paced competitive shooters this game is worth a try. It has its flaws and it's definitely no CS, UT or Quake, however, it's something new that's relatively rich.

-This game is really intense. You have the possibility to jump on walls and win firefights like that or get faster to the objective.

-There are no Pay2Win mechanics in the game what is actually good for an Free2Play game. Dont play a F2P if its Pay2Win ist not good for you.

-There are alot of classes now and there even come much more, but they are not always very good made like aura. She is extrem fats and has low hp thats ok BUT her healing station is just too op at the moment. To get the health 24/7 when you are stading in it is too op and the only way to win against someone in there is to give im headshots only.

-Another bad thing is that you have a fixed loadout. Much very much people hate this. I have now a silver proxy (could make gold but i save the others) and she has this 1 ability I honestly dont need. To throw back grenades. First the grenade of fragger is an instant explosion and second i never meet one of them ingame. So the possibility to destroy single Loadouts and swap Weapons/Perks would be an awesome addition to the game (I dont want a golden proxy with a shitty shotgun).

-Well also one bad thing is that there is only one Gamemode at the Moment (stopwatch is Objective 2x), but you can excuse that its an closed beta now.

-(this one is not very serious) WHY I AM DESTROYING THINGS IN A TOWN WHERE NOONE LIVES ANYMORE. AND WHY THE DEFENDERS CARE. ITS AN GHOSTTOWN

Also if there are some negative things its still much better than most of the games wich are out now (whole CoD, and everything after halo3) so i would defenitly recommend to get this game on steam or try to get it with an beta key.

We are still in a suburb of London, trying to find out what hit us. Enemy forces have forced us back to the soulless town, whilst we had the initial order to progress forward. All seems wrecked, but I'm not willing to let 'em conquer any further. Their days will end today. They will end now at our defense. We are strong, we WILL keep stand and will protect our wealth. Remember: We are here to get some s##tload of money. And now go and defend it!

Teams on public seem to be unbalanced, so we didn't even know what hit us even if three of us were on duty together. Matchmaking in the wild seems to be the biggest issue so far, life itself is wonderful.

Rushing with Proxy can give you a kick or break your neck, whilst Bushwrecker is his own man crew. Fragger will always seem to win with his grens, but it is more complicated than you think it is. Vassili takes it up from far away, but he's getting cloned all too fast. Sawbonez is ready to battle it in with his devib, while Aura remains calm defending her healing station. So many of us died here - yet there seems to be an endless wave rushing the enemy.

After all, you just have too keep an eye on the uhb-jek-tiv, and don't be a d##k. That's all what's needed. But don't forget about these - you don't need K/D ratio, you should not camp if not ordered so by mission control - after all, it's the team that wins, and not you. You simply shall not do it the same way you did before - else we will loose everything. Understood, soldier?

And now get your f###ing a## to the objectiv and bring it to the EV!

this game has the potential to reach esports top10.

pros/cons:

+it has all important gamestyle related features like fov/bob/sens/accel/smooth/hitmarks etc. included.
+unreal engine, u can adjust your config as you like (doom1 graphics with high res models for example)
+competetive game modes_ stopwatch (main mode) lets you play one match mirrored, every team plays each side.
+high skill cap even it appears easy to learn at first. you really need to learn the game mechanics and merc/class synergy to be succesfull, AND you need to be a weasel, does´nt matter which class you´re playin. be fast, agile and brained as fuck to be succesfull. 
EVEN the games focus is at teamplay, one good player can be a gamechanger.

-when your playin alone you´re fucked bu that ok_ teamup!

This game has to be one of the best fast-paced First Person Shooters I have ever played.

Since the re-launch I have played this game non-stop, yes it has been that addictive.

A lot of people writing reviews will ignore the fact that the game is in closed beta and yes there will be quite a few bugs, but after seeing past the bugs which will evidently be fixed in the near future, this game runs like a charm (minus optimizations). I have a vision of this game ending up like a MOBA, with the ability to eliminate mercs for an avantage over your opponent in future competitive play.

For now this game is largely based on casual gameplay, an easy way to pass the time and spend countless hours playing public games against like minded people.

An improvement could be to incorporate the competitive side a lot sooner than was originally planned, people are waiting and you don't want them to get bored, right? :)

This game is good for a free to play game but I'm having remorse over purchasing the 15 pound BETA-BUY in.

It's a good F2P game like I mentioned, but the card system is luck based; It's not grind to win cause you get on average 1000 coins per win but this is the massively BS part where people will argue.

SMGs are just as accurate as Snipers and CQC consists of who can jump first and spin around the fastest, there's been countless times where I've come up behind someone for them to turn around instantly and kill me in half the clip.

Simple yet fun movement system, noobs can do just fine but there are a ton of wall jumps to discover. 
Classes and loadouts abundant, there is something for everyone. (Some mercs still being worked on, but once out of beta there will be more choice)
You MUST work as a team, not like a cod where you just shoot stuff and win.
You can get really good at this game, the skill ceiling is pretty high
When you get into a good pub, it can be really fun
It does seem like the dev's are putting work into this game
Good forum/competitve community, seems like a small town. Almost (almost) everyone is friendly and everybody pretty much everybody knows your name

Cons
Loudout system frusterating, don't always get the guns you want
Pubs often get ""stacked"", or really one sided and its no fun to play. Hard to find a good pub
Balance and meta is a little crappy, although should work itself out soon so no reason not to play
Currency is hard to come by, although they made it easier to get recently
Maps seem a little stale at times because some objectives are awkward to get to (chaple 3rd stage as an example, obj is right next to enemy spawn)

I'm going to recommend this game just because I find it fun, I don't think everyone will though. If your ok with giving up a few quality of life ajustments compaired to other, more finished games, then it shouldn't be to much of a problem. If you can't stand being in a lot of pub stomps sometimes, or the balance frusterates you, then this probably isn't the game for you. I think that once the community gets larger and the game progresses this game will be a lot more fun for new and old players, so I'm putting my faith in the dev's to make this game fun for everyone, and I think that it might well happen. If it doesn't, then no big deal. Overwatch seems cool too :D

I would only recommend this game to someone who is a fan of the CoD style run and gun gamestyle, where no thought is needed and the only thing that counts are lightning reflexes. If that flicks your switch go for it. But if you prefer a little thought to your shooter experience then walk on and look elsewhere because it just isn't here.

Oh, I almost forgot. Regarding its free to play experience. Yes, it will be free to play at release and after closed beta has ended. But take a look at the DLC already available.

I played it almost exactly a year ago (when it had 3 or 4 times the number of Mercs) and I recently got back in to it. As far as shooters go, it's pretty much spot on. It's fast, accurate and maintains a level of uniqueness to it.  I'll condense this review in to a pros and cons list:

Pros:
The Dev's roadmap looks excellent and they seem to be sticking to it.
Ranked games with publicly visible tiers (like CS).
Interesting objectives.
Fast.
Accurate and smooth.
Interesting loadout/rewards system.

Cons:
Few Mercs out at the moment (will be resolved over time).
Few maps/modes (will be resolved this month - April 15).
Server browser is clunky and buggy.
Can't quick queue with friends, only ranked.
Devs seem a little on the slow side. In a year I can't see (other than balance) what they've done.
No one playing ranked in EU means queues are well over 20 minutes.

The final con is my biggest grievance. More people need to be on the game and level 7 to queue for ranked and things will improve drastically. I would definitely recommend this game but I'd urge the publishers to get a move on with content, mercs and advertising.

it also talks abount team work well... no one revives you people charge out and get killed (the tutoral tells youn not to do this) but whey realy want one frag and shout at you for not reviving when the at the other end of the map, and they dont spawn you in groupes that well this does not help the ""stick togeather"" aspect

Positives:
+ game runs smooth, no framedrops noticed yet
+ art design and character design is great
+ very nice sound set
+ clear level design, options to flank opponents given
+ class based gameplay
+ objectives make for diverting rounds
+ gunplay feels solid
+ movement feels fluid and not clunky
+ walljumps open up new paths

Negatives:
- menu design is cluttered and confusing
- graphical settings need more in-depth options
- movement options are unintuitive (toggled sprint and crouch)*
- quickmatch function is not working properly
- lack of progression
- no character customisation
- ludicrous shop prices (in-game currency)
- loadouts completely based on RNG
- inability to change loadouts in-game
- no freedom of gun choice
- overlapping classes
- unspectacular class skills, lack of innovation
- partly annoying synchronisation
- questionable balance

*Your character will always sprint/crouch when you use the toggled option until you press the button again, my gripe here is that e.g. usually one stops sprinting when released 'W'.

This game relies way too hefty on RNG. The card loadout system feels contra-productive. Your whole experience will have its roots on RNG, it's up to you how you feel about that. I fore one, think it is misplaced in a fps game.
There is a complete lack of customisation, you can't change your characters loadout unless you have another card for him, which you will only receive via crates you get by leveling up your account or purchasing them in the store.
It should be noted that those are completely RNG based as well, meaning you can't choose for which character you want a crate.
The merc prices are just ridiculous, it goes up to 50.000 credits for a merc to unlock.
To put this in perspective, a crate costs 1000, you will receive around 100 per match. Meaning if you want to unlock e.g. Fragger, you have to save 50.000 credits and you will have to play the whole time with the exact same loadout with the few characters you got.
The grind in this game is unreal, furthermore it is not rewarding nor is there any 'wow' factor, since higher cards only offer more passive skills for your character which in case of a fps game, they are rather marginal and not noteworthy.

At it's current state I don't see how this game could possibly spark my interest to the point where this could become an evening game for me. There is no progression, no customisation, un-innovative classes and skills.

I mean if you like the feel of it the rest of the game is fine (mercs, shop, unlocks,etc) its setup to be a good F2P game its just the core game it's self is bad :/

even if had a closed beta access without buying the starter kit i bought it, because imo it's worth supporting the game+ its development aswell as the company behind the game.

in its current state i can just recommend the game to all who enjoy fast paced combat with basically no bugs and a fair free2play model.

Game is actually fun to play. The claims about balance issues is there because people haven't put the time in to understand the system on which the loadout cards are done. Right now, credits are easily obtained through normal gameplay. You can gain about 12k from a victory, while getting 7k for a loss, and that's a full game where you joined in from the start. With your credits you can purchase Loadout cases for 1k each, which comes with a loadout card. You then use these cards to upgrade to the next tier. So 3 iron cards, equals to one bronze card. Then 4 bronze cards to one silver, then 4 silver to one gold. Essentially, per win, you can obtain a single bronze card. Put the math in and in about 3-4 hours you can have a gold card.

Balance issues aren't really a decent claim from users. Due to this being a ""class"" based combat system, each one excells at it's own. Frag, the assault class, destroys anything at long range except for a sniper. Aura, the healer, is great for a fast paced close quarters engagement. She boasts both shotgun and SMG loadouts. Proxy is the shotgunner, and fast paced runner, she's a CQB ONLY! class... Balance has no issue at all, once you know the strengths and weakness' of each class. It's like TF2 people... Each class per situation. There is no balance issues in that regards.

The game is indeed in closed beta, so performance is an issue. I say that as recording/streaming gameplay seems to be problematic as the game doesn't agree with on-the-fly x264 encoding. I was attempting to stream and my CPU was taking a dick. I can, however, stream everything else 720p without a problem or a single FPS spike.

Give the game a shot. I reckon you'll like it. It's certainly a different take on F2P shooters.

Also, uhb-jek-tive gameplay is the best way to obtain exp and maximum credits intake, before you say anything.

Having said that this game isn't perfect. It is undoubtably loaded with flaws but the game is still in BETA so take it for what you will. All in all this game probably has more CONS than PROS for me yet I'd still recommend it to people since it is so fun.

PROS:
+ Fun fast paced objective Game Play
+ Well thought out level designs and interesting objectives
+ ""F2P""

CONS: 
+ P2W - The model they are choosing to launch this 'f2p' FPS game is clearly a P2W model. 
+ Game is very unbalanced and hard to obtain perks or classes to unlock without paying money (see P2W CON)
+ Game doesn't feel complete yet (again it's still in beta so I'll let this one slide)

SUGGESTION: At certain levels give a better chance to get rarer cards (ie. 3%) idk something, because its random chance so all those cards you save up (3 per teir and theres like 3 or 4 teirs) you could end up with a crappy card and to add insult to injury it costs everytime you convert lower teir to higher teir.

Start: 
-Download/started game with no issues, however the base Lobby menu is as laggy as can be (@~250fps even) 
-Game is advertised as F2P, however, sign of an obvious RNG Loot Crate tell me 
1)You'll farm forever for one meh, and rarely good loadout 
2)Throw all your money at Nexon (like any of their other games) 
 
Classes: 
Funny British elements 
Varied, Every class an obvious role, however, some roles overlap 
 
 
Modes: 
-Basically play 1 round of Attack/Defend or Play 2 Rounds switching between A/D (Casual) 
-Scared to touch competitive mode as rumors of random teams completely ruin the competitive part 
-Everything is camp able and very easy to have long/one sided games from how long it takes to do objectives 
 
 
Gameplay: 
-Typical FPS with some light Brink elements (small wall jumping) 
-Hip Firing, encourages spray and pray (which some people like, I don't) 
-Balance is horrid, can't tell what weapons are even good/bad due to slight server lag making everything seem like its 2-3 shotting 
-Medics can resurrect someone to half HP with one button push, whats the point of charging (seriously, why) 
-Spamable Air Strikes near objective locations 
 
Rewards: 
-Decent coin gain 
-EXP fairly decent 
-Rewarded chucks of gold at certain levels 
-Not really anything else (closed beta review) 
 
Overall/TL;DR: 
+ Decent Graphics 
+ British 
+ Slight New take on FPS (where brink failed to say the least) 
+/- Lots of Bugs for other people (obviously Beta, but uses third party anti cheat rather than valve for instance) 
+/- EXP and Gold gain aren't too terrible 
- Balance is nonexistent, feel free to just rofl with a smg while a shotgun takes 5seconds to kill you upclose or just let medics instant resurrect 
- Unneeded Lag in Lobby Menus, game runs smooth but not lobby, makes no sense 
- Hip Firing without aim penalties just makes everyone run and gun, preference to some people, mostly to none 
- Nexon has a bad reputation for pay2win, lets see if the game stays f2p for long 
- Loadout Cards make you play with what the server gives you, not what you want 
 
This game will probably get overshadowed by other Modern FPS shooters such as Overwatch, as it doesn't have much more to offer than you can Hip Fire without worry which is why I can only stand 3 hours of it

So far it's been quite good for a beta and I've dropped almost 40 hours into it over two different weekends when the beta was live.

1.  A game where aim matters and shooting for heads is required to excel 
2.  A game built with mouse/keyboard in mind and doesn't have a ""press this button to do a cool animation""
3.  A game where movement is just as important as aim.  You can jump off walls to reach new areas.  Yup, it's awesome
4.  Class based team combat with ""Mercs"" to unlock LoL-style
5.  Multiple objectives per map to complete on offense before you then switch to defense and hold those objectives
6.  5v5 ranked system at launch

You will hate this game if you:
1.  Enjoy proning.  Seriously, F every single one of you guys
2.  Enjoy unloading a magazine in 1.5 seconds and hitting a guy in the nuts with 3 of those sprayed bullets across the map with your SMG for the kill
3.  Enjoy only shooting people and dislike objectives beyond shooting people
4.  Do not like jumping in videogames
5.  Hate skillful movement beyond ""running lanes"".  If you want to only press forward to move then this is not the game for you

Surprisingly fun! I have never been a huge fan of shooters like CS:GO, but this game is really unique and makes the experience better imho.

One of the main differences is you get characters, When you play games you earn coins based on level badges you get (such as double kill etc) and wins. These coins go towards unlocking new characters. We have been introduced to a handful in beta (Ranging from assaults who can call in air strikes, give team mates ammo when they run out.) medics who heal and have instant revives, snipers, or drop some bad ass proximity mines and blow your enemies to pieces.) 

The objectives and maps seem so much fresher and entertaining then similar games. The cyber punkesque graphics and feel to the ""Post Apocalyptic"" world is also really fun.

The similarity to CS GO also comes in crates, but from what i've seen now.. they're not p2w crates. You can randomly get dropped crates in games you play, and they gave us a starting of 100 keys to open. I don't know if this will change on release, but I love it in it's current build.. In these crates are card loadouts for the different characters. They include different guns and knives and perk abilities. These are sorted by rarity the same way a cs go weapon would be found in crates.

If they give us the chance to customize character outfits, oh god, this would be a masterpiece. Really excited for the next stress test and to see some new characters and game modes!

I've heard numerous peoples compare the game to Brink. Never played it. And others compare it to TF2. The only loose resemblence is there's two teams playing against one another, attacking and defending various objectives, unique classes, and simplified loadouts.... That could be any multiplayer game.

 OKAY.

  I'm going to outline a few things i like:

-Appropriately Sized Maps
-Small Teams
-Multiple Classes
-Objective Oriented Gameplay
-Fast Paced
-High Skill Ceiling

The one thing I don't care for is the matchmaking feature.  Understanding thats what the playtest was for this past weekend, It always connected me to an empty server. Yet, viewing the server list there were multiple games being played where player-slots were availible.
 I can't wait to see how the final polished product will turn out. So far, it's rubbed me with a fresh new feel to FPS gaming.

It combined the speed and movement of Quake and the hitscan and aiming mechanics of Counter-Strike into a objective-based game.  The focus on team-oriented objectives created a very popular fps game that sadly had a community die off and move on.

Splash Damage attempted to revive the series with with Enemy Territory: Quake Wars, but was largely unsucessful.

Welcome to Dirty Bomb, the newest reincarnation of the gameplay.  It feels and plays like the first legitemate sucessor to Enemy Territory.  With similar team-based classes, and a much more noob-friendly interface than ET could ever muster, this game could possibly be the first game that is a legitemate competitor to CSGO in terms of competitive FPS games... as long as Nexon doesn't FUCK everything up and make the game p2w.

The shooting mechanics combine that of quake and counter-strike.  Players are tanky and can take 2 or 3 headshots to kill.  However, similar to CS, aiming for the head is highly rewarding as most guns will kill in 8 to 10 shots (generally it takes a little less than 2 seconds to kill a player with body shots).  Additionally, you're highly accurate while moving, which makes strafe shooting a viable and effective strategy.

Don't let the cartoonish atmosphere fool you, however.  Despite its simplistic nature, there is a lot of depth to the game in taking fights, healing with medics, and even intentionally suiciding to respawn with full ammo or to defend an objective.

If you like playing competitive FPS games, give this one a fair shot.  The gameplay is quite unforgiving for new players, but highly rewarding if you stick with it.",1424580892,1424652025,True,124,13,0.792703330516815186,7,True,False,False

You are more likely to win if you are denfending in the match. The game is not a rush and shoot people type of game, but this doesn't mean that there is no action. You will be getting into a lot of gun fights, but you won't be able to always get the kills. It take a few rounds to get someone down and a few more to kill them, so basically a clip per 2 kill if you miss a decent amount. The game it self is hard to master and get good, but it's easy to jump in and not get lost. You just need some time to get the hang of the support perks like the airstrike (Not op like it sounds) and health packs. The good thing is that when you are down you can ask a teammate to help you up and you'll get up or get a medic to shock you and you'll get up faster with more health.

It looked amazing, and felt amazing to me as well. Despite some of it's flaws, I loved the game. Now Dirty Bomb, it simply polishes and brings out the best in what Brink should have been and also what the developers are more than capable of doing. 

PROS: 

- Graphics are amazing for it being a free to play, which will be a huge hit in the free to play gaming community, considering there's not many free to play first person shooters who achieve this. 

- Playing Style: Now, I'm not the best player in Dirty Bomb. But it feels smooth and really easy to control. You'll have to fix the mouse sensitivity, however that shouldn't be an issue - fixing it, I mean.

- Customization/Game Modes/Progression: These days most free to play games have these basic game modes in which are common and overused in my opinion. DirtyBomb has an objective for almost everything just so you can support your teammates in some fashion or another. Not very many free to play games have that. Customization, this game is said to implement it. I've not seen it yet, however if it's anything like Brink, which obviously it's at least simalar in some fashion, then it's more than safe to assume customization play a huge part. Progression in Dirty Bomb is amazing. When you level up, you'll be given crates, keys and cards. They'll play a huge part in the game as well. I won't explain that part because they can explain it to you better in their videos. 

CONS:

- Published by Nexon

- Makes people worry whether it'll be pay to win or not

- Since it's published by Nexon, this may also have an issue with hacking considering Nexon is known for Combat at Arms. Which wasn't a bad game, just the people who ruined it were bad individuals. 

- Also, maybe it's just me. However in game, certain maps. I've been running into bushes as if they're solid objects. I believe that's a bug that needs to be addressed!

Would I recommend this game?

Hell yeah! Despite who it's published by, I believe the game deserves you to at least try it and then judge it based on that. Not who published it. Because they didn't make the game, SplashDamage did. Might I add, they did a wonderful job in my opinion as well! Continue the hard work, SplashDamage! I'll continue playing as well.
