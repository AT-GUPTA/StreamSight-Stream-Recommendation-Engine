I love action. I like my games with a lot of blowing sh*t up and killing dudes. My favorite genres are first-person-shooters (because there's a lot of killing dudes), stealth games (because there is a lot of killing dudes sneakily and silently) and realtime-strategy games (because you build huge bases and armies to blow sh*t up and kill dudes). If there was one genre that I thought I couldn't like even if my life depended on it, it was the economic city-building simulation genre, the genre that is well known for one particular franchise: ANNO. I was unable to comprehend how buildung houses and streets for dozens of hours without any real purpose could be remotely fun. Until I tried it myself.

When I started with Anno 1602 a couple of years ago, the first few hours where rough, because it is indeed somewhat tricky to see through all the rather complex building- and economic mechanics (especially in Anno 1503, which does things wildly different than all other classic Anno games in that regard). But once I got the hang of it, it turned out to be addictive. Since then I sunk literally hundreds of hours into Anno 1602, Anno 1503, Anno 1701 and lately Anno 1404.

Anno 1404's core gameplay isn't different from the preceeding Anno games at all: You just build the necessary infrastructure, carefully balance out your taxes, ressources and production of goods, establish political and trading relationships with other players and very rarely carry out land- or sea battles, all with the sole purpose of developing a handful of small huts, farms and pigsties into a sprawling glorious metropolis. What's so particularly good about Anno 1404 is how polished and well-developed everything is. Even though the older Anno games are perfectly playable and great fun still today (yes, even Anno 1602), Anno 1404 is the one that comes very close to being just perfect. Everything is significantly more beginner-friendly, from the controls and functions all down to the combat system (which they never got right in the previous games even though it is clearly not the focus in Anno).  
Of all the Anno games I've played so far, this is the one that is the most comfortable to play and therefore especially recommendable for Anno beginners who want to get into the series. On top, just like the previous Anno games before it, Anno 1404 has a well-designed and entertaining singleplayer campaign that acts as a sort of 20 hours long tutorial and prepares you for the more challenging scenarios or the endless game, where you can just build your city as big as the map allows it, with no specific goals.  

Anno in general lets you play it like you want to. If you are looking for a slightly more stressful and challenging experience, there are the scenarios and the three different difficulty settings of the campaign. Or you can just lay back in the endless game and build your city completely at your own pace, without any pressure or aggressive competitors, but with basically limitless ressources. It's a near perfect and very rewarding game to just completely loose yourself in for a few hours. I could play the game for a thousand years more and still wouldn't find a single tiny thing here to complain about. 

No matter which Anno game you play first, everyone of them will seem overly complex and simply overwhelming and very hard to get into at the start and Anno 1404 is no exception, but once everything clicks and you finally understand how easy in principle it all is, Anno will literally glue you to your screen. Even if you are more like me (blow sh*t up, kill dudes), I highly recommend trying any of the Anno games (at least from the ones I've played so far). Chances are you'll be surprised how addicting, fun, relaxing, rewarding and well-made a game with barely any sh*t to blow up and dudes to kill can be.

It's not entirely my fault as there is no way for new players to know that, most of the DLC's I've played simply add a new option to the main menu or some extra scenarios/maps so I assumed this would be the case here.

So, if you fall into this trap and can't figure out how to go back to the original game (because you clicked the ""Always open History Edition"" box then go into >Properties>Launch Options and you can un-check that option.

I bought Anno 1404 - History Edition but it didn't come with campaign or any tutorial. Couldn't figure out how to play the base game (the one with the campaign / tutorial). So for the people facing the same issue:

1. Go to your Steam Library and right click Anno 1404 - History Edition
2. Go to Properties - DLC
3. Uncheck the Anno 1404 - History Edition Uplay Activation Box

I was hesitant to purchase it, because of the Ubi Connect issues.
I am already on the Ubi platform (AC Valhalla), thus aside from the annoyance of it's existence it's not a huge issue for me.

I had no issues installing & binding the game to my Ubisoft account (I logged in & updated my Ubi client before installation).
The game booted fine on my Win 11 AMD + 3070ti. It even seems to allow for multiplayer invites being sent through steam chat, as it showed my steam friends not my ubi friends.

Let's start with the bad: it needs Ubisoft connect to play for some reason, and that totally stinks, I didn't have any problem with it but many have, and it's a pain to create new accounts, have new passwords and launchers after buying it from Steam, just a big thumbs down.

The good: I have about 100 hours on the original and I loved it so much I got the HE to play on high resolution display with Win10, and I'm now approaching 120 hours on this version too. 
I always have a blast playing it, it's complex, balanced, very well thought out, beautiful world characterization and it's the kind of game which is easy to understand but hard to master. 
Beside the campaign there is an endless mode in which you just do your own thing for as long or as little as you like, tons of settings before beginning the game, tons of random generated maps, AI, no AI, disasters, missions, objectives, monuments to your heart's desire.

This game is a perfect example of a good game ruined by having to play through ubisoft. You will see most negative reviews talk about crash at start up or ubisoft issues. If you don't have those issues and like strategy, rts, city builder, and management games this like the other four games in the series thoroughly enjoyable. I have all 4 Anno games and I think this one is my favorite despite being the oldest, and with that having issues of its own.

Go through the population tiers and fullfill their needs step by step, ever expanding and growing further with more complicated needs. It's very satisfying, but build with efficiency in mind for your industry.

I even searched why the hell they would require the players to create an account and require log-in to play the game, and the answer, albeit not from the developer itself, was something like ""because online profile is required to allow multiplayer games."" The developer did not explicitly acknowledge this comment, but it did not refute the claim either.

As far as I know this game is not primarily marketed as a multiplayer game, so I see no reason why an online profile is mandatory where multiplayer is just an option to the game. Besides, there are a lot of games with multiplayer component that allow single-player mode without requiring the players to create an account with the developer. So in my view this requirement is utterly unnecessary inconvenience to the players.

Can't understand why they are selling the game on Steam with this policy in the first place.

Gameplay is exciting, challenging, and you can set your games up according to your wish, alllowing you to play the way you want. For example you can choose if you want other AI players, and what diffculty they should be, as well as choose your own goals (like building monuments, defeating enemies).
The only issue i can think of is land combat, which is quite slow and IMO boring, but that's only a minor part of the game, which can be almost entirely ignored, with the correct settings at game start.

The campaign is decent too, serving as a long tutorial, and giving some background on most of the characters you meet, but you don't have to play it.

I wish they had Steam workshop though. But that's alright! Steam version is much much better than the GOG version. 

This is the best! When I played this game there was mostly socializing than competing. We helped each other meet the goals. You don't have to have multiplayer or ai player you can do things like Perform quests or the two ultimate quests for the emperor and the Sultan.

The only other ANNO game that's any good as this is 1701 AD. followed by 1602. and 2101? 1503 and the other one in space is lousy.

What I love about this game is how random it is and the ability to form dynamic campaigns and quests. Its never the same no matter who you play against and the characters you meet in the game are awesome.

Uses Ubisoft loader that delays the start with useless downloads for ads.
Is impossible to play single player as the AI is hopeless and makes it impossible to progress by not buying anything you produce and refusing to allow you to build the items it wants until you supply those items. Catch22

Main gameplay consists of building, expanding and maintaining supply chains under time pressure. The game throws you curve balls while you are busy with existing growth challenges.

Main issues come down to missing information (again... like in all of these games)
 - What size and how many fields does a building need? (Counteracted by full refund when destructing buildings -only on easy- BUT time is your most valuable resource!)
 - How much wood does a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck would chuck wood? (even tutorial tip mentions some buildings requiring multiple sources, but... how many and which? You have to try it out)
 - How many and where are XXX production buildings on the island/whole map? (all buildings look alike after a while)
 - killing AI is like playing whack-a-mole as they generate resources out of thin air. When conquering their resource depots they will just build another one just outside your armies range. Only way to force them out of an island is to maintain area presence where the AI can not build.

A lot of these challenges could be better if the game had better logistics simulation. In the grand year of 1400 island wide quantum teleportation storage has been invented and all resources within an island exist in ALL of the storages at the same time and can not be destroyed unless the last building holding them is erased... Road connection is required in some cases, but for citizens it matters not how long said road connection is (there just needs to be a path). Thus building most efficiently includes having a storage depot in the middle and huddle all production buildings as close as possible to it (only logistics simulation is from storage to pick up resources from the production sites and back in a cart).

I miss connection between population and production... manpower wise. As it stands, population exists only to consume resources and generate gold. They do not participate in work in any way. Production is always fully employed...

The game is good. You will be working while playing. As the game mainly comes down to microfest I am not convinced this is an interesting multiplayer game for me.",1631728912,1631776610,True,28,3,0.764192640781402588,1,True,False,False

The economics are elaborate.  The music is beautiful.  The graphics are good without being beyond the abilities of a mid-range video card several years old.  

Cons: What you get here from Steam is ""Anno 1404 Venice"", which is enhanced from the original but with the original tutorial campaign suppressed.  You can get access to it only by starting the game up in a special way.  Be prepared for  a LOT of micro-management, especially the need to start and stop farms and factories when an island's storage is empty or full.  It's a pity that the designers provided no way to automate this adjustment.  I recently received an ""achievement"" for having halted my production units five hundred times in a single game!  Trade routes are a crucial part of tying your economy together but are not sophisticated enough.  (I'm told that this shortcoming was rectified somewhat in Anno 1800).  All in all, optimal play requires slowing the game down to the slowest possible speed, which in my experience cannot be done with the '-' key that is supposed to control it.  Instead you must press F11 and click on the left arrow on the bar at the bottom of the screen.  With this done, the game is much less nerve-wracking, but a conscientious play-through of any scenario will require many hours.
