By 2H/3H you would've already seen everything.

The game does feel a bit aimless in the beginning, with little to no explanations of things like Taxes, Employees.

Also, With 11 of the 21 screenshots being VERY different to the actual game (In terms of Map Design, and especially Quaility) i recommend watching a Video/Stream of the game before buying, And as im about to point out, the Trailers are misleading too, so just ignore them.

Id also like to point out, in the Gameplay Trailer:
you can see footage of one of the Players cars being stolen, this is not a feature in the game, Cops aren't in the game either.
Buying the shop at the beginning is not something in the game.
Buying cars from the Junkyard is not in the game.

Features:
Buying and Selling cars (Auction, And just cars in a Lot or Neighborhood, You can also take photos of the Cars, but the Camera is fairly Janky, and hard to use)
Basic car tuning (NOS, Turbo, Wheels)
Pretty basic Drifting (1 Special map) and Drag Races (1 VS and 2 Solo maps)
Light Office and House Customization (Office Presets would be a lot nicer due to how time consuming it is)
2 Bar Mini-Games
And of course, a (Seemingly) Paid 'DLC'

Collision:
NPC Humans don't have collision in a Car, NPC Cars don't have collision while on foot, Nearly all environmental Objects besides Walls don't have Collision, and if they do, they're heavily over-sized.

Cars:
Some of the Cheapest cars in the game can outrun some of the most Expensive Cars in the game, Most cars have the Same Sounds as well.

Update Overview:
So far, no major updates have added on to the base Game (i.e. Buying and selling cars)
Everything has either been Drag Races, or drifting tracks, which isn't the reason i, or many others bought the game. But who'd expect a game about buying and selling cars to get updates to add onto buying and selling cars, right?
I mean, Employees were added awhile ago, but all they can do is wash cars and pick up trash, both things that can take the player seconds to do.
And you can only get 1 employee, not that they're useful anyway.
as of 2/26/24, they say they're adding 'tuning', But if it doesn't majorly increase the Value, Why spend the time 'tuning'?

If the Devs aren't going to expand on the Base Game, and only add Filler, then i feel the game shouldn't be marketed as a Salesman Game, because it's really not.
The drifting and racing sections feel more detailed than the base game, even though the Drifting and Racing stuff is more than likely just pre-paid assets.


The game is also Free on Mobile, i'd recommend just getting it there. Exact same features and content. You could even use Dolphin Emulator on PC to play it.

For whats in the game currently, it's just not worth the price, Maybe $5 or $6? but definitely not $18
i'd highly recommend Car Mechanic Simulator 2021 instead, It's at a Similar price, with much more, Higher quality content.

Overall:
It's devs like this that make indie games look bad, And what you see me calling out in the review above, People have been calling out since the game came out, So i highly doubt anything will change.

Also, considering how 90% of the nearly 12K reviews are positive all time, and 538 recent reviews are 88% positive, i HIGHLY expect that the majority of the reviews are fake. Or the devs giving players the game in exchange for a positive review.

If the devs improve the game, maybe i'll come back. Just save your money.",1708730748,1709001975,False,2,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,True

Positives:
- Engine noise is incredible (would like different engine sounds though)
- Negotiating of prices
- Gambling
- Different cars and options
- Fun factor and grindy

Negatives:
- There are a lot of bugs that actually make the game funny so not really a negative


Wants:
- Increase the max limit in blackjack. 20k is not enough when I am a millionaire
- Bigger map, with more towns and more places to buy cars
- More cars and custom modifications
- Drift tracks
- Career progression

Highly recommend getting this game and supporting the devs.

One of the highlights of Car For Sale Simulator 2023 is its engaging premise. The game puts players in the driver's seat of managing a car dealership, from purchasing inventory to negotiating deals with customers. The realistic portrayal of the business aspects adds depth and immersion, making each decision feel impactful.

However, as promising as the game is, there's a noticeable need for more content. While the core gameplay loop is enjoyable, it can feel repetitive after extended play sessions. Adding more variety in terms of car models, dealership customization options, and additional business challenges would greatly enhance the overall experience.

Furthermore, Car For Sale Simulator 2023 is still plagued by some bugs and technical issues. From occasional crashes to minor glitches during gameplay, these issues can disrupt the immersion and hinder the overall enjoyment. It's worth noting, though, that the game is still in early access, and it's reasonable to expect these issues to be addressed in future updates.

In conclusion, Car For Sale Simulator 2023 shows promise as a unique and engaging simulation game. While it currently lacks some depth and polish, its foundation is strong enough to build upon. With continued development and attention to player feedback, there's hope that the developers will iron out the bugs and introduce more content to elevate the game to its full potential.",1708424438,1708424438,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

**ORIGINAL REVIEW** I wouldn't buy this game just yet but I'm not going to sh*t on it and not recommend. 

I strongly believe this game at some point can be good, it's just not anywhere near yet. I've wanted a game like this for years and there is nothing on the market with the elements that I want. This game has these elements however every element in the game is very, very simple. I'd of happily not refunded and kept this game for future releases if I'd of paid £6 but the current £15 price tag is way too high for this game. It kinda feels and looks like a mobile game at the moment.

I will be buying this game again in the future if the dev keeps on updating and fixing like they've promised.

Quite simply, almost but no cigar and too expensive for what it currently is.

Hope you update the game dev's as you do have something here if you polish and finish it up.",1687512718,1707395204,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

The problem here is that there is not much ""in-between"". You will have fun playing this game, don't get me wrong. But it will get dull real soon. There need to serious Gameloop-upgrades, like:

[h3]Car buying:[/h3] 15/25 Points
• Car age should make a significant impact on price
• Car mileage should push the price significant
• Inspecting cheap cars will diminish all gains 
• Scrap the “original color vs now” option. Doesn’t matter not even in real life. Just add a % of rust or patch-up %.
• Core mechanics (haggle, inspect) shouldn’t be hidden behind levels
[h3]Car fixing:[/h3] 5/25 Points
Nothing you’ll do except repairing will up the sell price.
Hefty sums for installing special equipment, but it doesn’t up the price significantly.
• Adding gear should sell the car faster or give more money
• Paintjobs should give more money
• Add car wraps that can be removed for less money and price paints for a lot more
• Tune cars for different target audiences: Tuning for younger people and racers, Luxury fittings for business, safety-/family kits for male/female sub-urbaners.
[h3]Car selling:[/h3] 10/25 Points
• Let the different types of people not all speak the same way. Old womans that go “Woah dude, nice ride. What’s final price” etc. is just so OFF
• Establish a possible multiple-answer-system where your answers push or lower the price with a patience meter. This could make haggling enjoyable. 
• Getting scammed by sellers left and right. I’M A CAR SELLER! Let me scam people, too!! Ffs
[h3]Racing[/h3] 2/25 Points
I – personally – couldn’t care less about the racing. There are a mega-shitton of racing games out there and this is [b]not[/b] one of them. Not with the flimsy tuning, upgrading, tweaking mechanics and car variants this game possesses. 
It’s a nice side-activity, but please concentrate on the core-mechanics OR make a race-game where you buy cars to race them and concentrate on that instead, both just doesn’t work.

[h2]Score[/h2]
32/100 

Needs more time in the oven and a clear focus.

I've already had 2 auctions where I've lost more than 400,000$ because after the auction, the cars don't spawn in and basically, you get scammed! It's honestly so annoying. Another bug is that it says my office is dirty, when there's literally no trash. I don't really mind it too much, but it is something to note. Another VERY ANNOYING bug is when you're building your office. Holy crap, I have never had a more painful and terrible building experience than this. I can't place objects in certain places where there's literally nothing there, which should allow me to place it there, while I can place a car display pad on top of another pad without issues. I can't place fences around the whole dealer because in the left corner, I just simply can't place it there for no reason! I've removed the concrete, replaced it, and tried placing the fence, multiple times. The last LARGE issue I'll mention is the grid snapping. It is VERY inconsistent. The floor will snap to the grip around 65% of the time. It's really annoying because sometimes, I have to place and delete a piece of concrete multiple times for it to finally snap. All in all, it's a decent game. However, I would wait for the game to go on sale (like it is at the time of posting this), or just wait for the game to be more polished, because right now, I don't think it's worth 14 dollars (what I bought it for at sale price), let alone 18 dollars at full price.  Also, the game could definitely be better optimized. Pushing the bugs aside, the good things about the game are that it has decent graphics, good gameplay, and is pretty fun overall.

I cannot recommend touching this game until they fix them, as now even just parking a car is a nightmare and an exercise in frustration.

Fun and addicting game.  The cars look great, are fun to collect and customize, and I'm looking forward to having more added in the future.  Thankfully there are no large bugs that really break things.  There are still some things that can be improved upon, such as having less people trying to low-ball your price or having people you try bargaining with do more than just flat accept/reject your bargain price, but nothing that a couple patches can't iron out.  The dev is very active and responsive to the community, I don't think I've owned the game a single day where a new patch didn't drop.  

The roadmap items look like fun, and I am looking forward to them, but I hope we still get some new car releases as they're being worked on.  The world map has a lot of open space and there are a lot of cool things that could be added in for additional activities.

The game is weak in terms of content, 
- The interface needs to be improved. 
- I need to be able to see my experience points instantly and how many more points I will level up in percentage. 
-Should you tie the bargaining to artificial intelligence, it seems like it needs a bit more mental, it seems to work over a percentage according to the level. For example: I say 4000 to the man, the npc tells me 2300, didn’t you see the ad? If the price is 4000, then the bargaining is done over 4000. If the price is too high, customers won’t come because the price will be high according to the vehicle’s index. (This index can be determined according to the condition of the vehicle) 
- Npcs are trying to rip off in vehicle sales. Here, the npc’s profession, the job he does, and his background can be included. This can help us understand how honest that trade is. +Vehicle uses are quite nice, I didn’t have high expectations but I liked it.

Rating: ★★★☆☆ (3/5)

Car For Sale Simulator 2023 offers a simple and somewhat enjoyable experience for those who find solace in the world of car simulations. Picked it up on a whim, and to my surprise, it's proven to be a decent time-passing game in between stressful days.

The game's premise revolves around buying and selling cars, and it's strangely captivating, providing a temporary escape from reality. The mechanics are straightforward, making it accessible for both newbies and simulation enthusiasts. With around 10 hours of gameplay, I managed to explore every nook and cranny of the available content, amassing a comfortable 2 million in-game cash.

However, the downside quickly became apparent - the lack of content depth. I exhausted all possibilities within a relatively short timeframe, leaving me craving for more. While it's understandable that the game is in early access, I hope the developers consider expanding the features and adding more variety to keep players engaged in the long run.

This is my second simulation game, and while my previous experience with Ranch Sim was less than stellar, Car For Sale Simulator 2023 feels more refined. The graphics are acceptable, and the overall gameplay mechanics are solid, providing a smoother experience compared to my previous foray into the simulation genre.

If you're a die-hard car enthusiast, this game might pique your interest, offering a temporary respite from reality. However, if you're looking for a simulation with extensive content and lasting appeal, you might want to hold off until more updates are rolled out. In the end, it's a decent choice for those seeking a quick fix of simulation fun but falls short of becoming a long-term engagement.",1700994957,1700994957,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

First of all, the screenshots and videos don't match the in-game graphics, so that's a false advertisement there. This ""game"" is full of bugs that make it impossible to have fun. 
Your so called customers walk through the display windows of the office and sometimes they teleport instantaneously by the showcased car, you can also walk through the cars, trees, most of the buildings and the NPCs on the street but if you're driving a car you can hit those. LOL? 
Shadows are broken, some places are extremely dark even during the day so I guess there's some sort of an issue with illumination? When you move your mouse, the mountain builds up and disappears in the background. When you start a new game after playing for a few hours, the cars you previously have purchased do not appear in the game, like ever. 

Apart from all of those issues I've stated above, which make the game highly unrealistic and unplayable, I've also been dealing with constant stutters and FPS drops on my system which is riddled with RTX 4090, i9 9900k and 64 gigs of ram.

Played over 100 hours...Endured the Developers disappearing act, where most people thought the game was DOA.  Then the ""Big Update"" came...Drag racing.  The game is called ""Car for  Sale"".  The developers didn't take 2 minute to search that there are SO MANY racing sims done better that the one they jammed into the game instead of focusing on their basic premise.  In fact about 2 weeks after that release, the NHRA released their licensed version of their own drag racing sim.  But the final straw  for me wasn't the mess surrounding the customization of the lot.  or the fact after all this time they still couldn't get characters to walk / look like humans.  It was the ""new"" economic system they created.  It was an unrealistic price for an assessment of a car, but then change the repair and paint costs based on the type of car?  So by the time you're finished customizing the car, and getting it ready for sale, there is almost no profit left for it to sell (especially the high end ones).  So buyer beware, this game was not ready for early release, is FAR from ever leaving early release.  I would look for a more organized polished game with a competent staff and clear road map.  I'm more disappointed than angry.  The game concept had potential.",1698726071,1698726071,False,38,0,0.800057351589202881,3,True,False,True

IRL there are some pretty rude car dealers setting pretty rude prices and they exist for centuries. Why can't I make 2-3k Profit on a car?

Ontop of that, the damn cars accelerate like they're built in 1930s

There is some pretty RNG involved. Some residents sell their car but it's up to you to know if they overpriced it and some heavily try to rip you off with even 20k overpricing. The car brands are also anonymized but you know what kind of car it is. Worse of all, you know it's popular and much heavily priced than in game but you cant sell it for a decent price.

Graphics 1/10, NPCs are stuck in the ground, the world feels completely lifeless, the gameplay is very monotonous and quickly becomes boring, the vehicle physics are abysmal, and the images in the store show things that don't even appear in the game (e.g., cars parked on the street). Therefore, I suspect that many of the game's reviews have been purchased.",1697702571,1697702571,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

My car has a spoiler.

Not just any spoiler. It has spiked edges that make it look like a god damn dragon's wing. Your shitty car doesn't have a spoiler, so it's not fast.

The speed of a car has nothing to do with the engine or any other nerdy mechanic bullshit like that. It's all in the spoiler.

Want to run faster? Wear a spoiler on your ass. Want to type faster? Wear a spoiler on your fingers. Want to think as fast as me? Wear a spoiler as a hat. I would attach a spoiler to every area of my body, but God already made me a perfect human being, so it'd be unfair to get that kind of boost.

So buzz off kid. Before I beat your penis off in a street race. You've probably never even seen the streets like I have. I'm from the hoodest hood. I eat your worst nightmares for breakfast.

This game went from an absolute crap fest riddled with bugs and game breaking glitches (the game breaking glitches being not having a car spawn in during the tutorial that was cheap enough to buy, literally falling through the map, and getting stuck in a fence and the only way to fix any of these was to reset the save and that only fixed the 2 ladder bugs, the car pricing is why I refunded my first purchase), to a well balanced sim with some bugs here and there, but nothing game breaking, in just a few months. The developer/s have shown that they are putting in more effort than some triple A titles (cough, cough, anthem, cough, cough).

Pros:
Active development team
realistic cars
good bargaining system
lots of customization in cars, buildings, etc.
easy to learn  and grasp, not overly complicated

Cons:
Sound bugs (holding an input while getting out of a car will cause the game to keep using said sound until you get back in the car)
Saving causes the game to temporarily freeze
sometimes, after going to bed, it will still be night time when you get up.
while there is a good bit of content, there are still a lot of open areas that could use some filling up

Edit: It has come to my attention that my pc AVERAGES 34 fps... I have a 5900x paired with a 6900 xt... still worth playing, but PLEASE optimize the game. I'm not expecting 500 fps, but with the specs that I have, 150-200 fps should be doable.",1695604863,1697100158,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

It is obviously still in the early stages and I believe that when the other features seen in the video come and also when a minimal story is added, it will be one of the best simulator games ever. If I need to evaluate it from a technical point of view, it gives a smooth experience even if it drops from time to time while playing on my desktop computer. But I can't open the game on my laptop because it opens directly at high graphics settings when the game is first opened. It gives 1 fps from the loading screen and the game crashes. If you force the game to open at low graphics settings at the opening of the game, everyone will be able to play the game. The in-game props and other art elements are actually in low polygon and I am sure my laptop can open this game, but there is a problem with the opening settings of the game. Can you fix this?

pros: 
-game runs smooth
-progression isn't grindy
-car models look great
-npc interaction is fluid 
-has tons of potential 

Cons:
-limited car selection
-limited npc dialog
-limited modifications for cars
-driving is a overly arcadish needs more physics 
-Game auto save is jarring and has caused crashes but still saved the progress

There a lack of direction for the game not a lot of purpose yet needs a story. There is a easy money glitch use the quick save in main menu then play black jack if you win you save again if you lose you exit to main menu load previous save.

For example, I receive a notification saying that I've already purchased a parking spot, even though I can't access it. There are also other glitches, like sometimes being able to buy a Lamborghini for only $10. I'm not sure why these issues are occurring. Please investigate.""

If the developers can make a game and its an early access and still people are getting addicted then i guess at the final stage it will be the best 
Very easy to make money though
First get a car between $10000 - 11000
Then just wash it at the petrol station
Then sell it at around $16500 - $17000
And also you will get exp while buying a car
First unlock the sponge skill so that you can wash the car and get exp
Then buy a bit higher range cars and tune it and simply sell it at a high price 
Yea after the office update the game stuck repeatedly but no worries guys its an early access that you got
Maybe all the data be lost after the final launch (Maybe maybe not)
Just enjoy the game and wait for the final update

I bought this game in late august when they actually did deliver what their roadmap promised, while the game is in very early access it was still  fun and enjoyable to play for a few hours. That being said the game is understandably bare bone as of now, the map is small and there isn't much to do. There are plenty of bugs and some features are just annoying to deal with. In particular the auction system which is the only way to get the ""featured"" cars like gtr, rx7,  etc.

While bugs are fixable, fake marketing is not. The steam page has screenshots of somethings that the game doesn't have, the office seen in the screenshots is different from the one in game, the autoshop too, some cars are missing, the npc cars are different and very low quality compared to the ones you can trade, there are no npcs on the sidewalks, there is no coop or online feature (As of now). I believe marketing something that you don't even have in game doesn't stand up with me. 
While you can add the features later, that's a different side of the story.

Another big No is the fact that the devs claimed in late august that they were trialing their new Office system and needed more time to work on it. Postponing is fine, but if you can't meet the postponed date, at least release some information about the issues, don't leave us in the dark for 2 weeks. 
Lastly, i highly believe that if your game has plenty of bugs, is in such a very early access, you should focus on the game and not start working on your next title. 

As of right not this game feels abandoned. So i do not suggest buying it until further notice from the devs about their plans with the game and some results at the very least.

Here is one example reiterate my point on the bugs:

> You come across rare cars every now and then in the auction. I came across one such car on an auction day and I bought it. It was the first car that came across and I didn't want to see other cars from that auction. I decided to leave the auction to do other things. I decided do one of the drag race at the expectation that my rare car I bought would be there at the end of the day. I got out of the drag race and it seems like the whole auction just disappeared along with my rare car that I bought and the money I spent on it. I would usually laugh this kind of thing off but I seriously spent sometimes hunting for these rare cars and to have a bug like this take it away, it kinda made me want to just stop playing. 

Other than that, I had a good simulator experience with a range of cars and interactions... Shame the bug was this fatal for me. I will be uninstalling soon.",1694624237,1694624237,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Yeah, it's buggy, but it is early access still. Just glad the saving bug appears to be fixed. I probably won't be playing it now until more stuff has been released. 

Some of the achievements don't appear to be working either, which I have submitted as a bug. These include, buying your first car. I've bought many cars, and they are not triggering. I do hope that a lot more features will be added, perhaps making stuff a lot more difficult to unlock so it is something to build up and work towards. Once you start buying the expensive cars, its very fast to make money and unlock all you need. 

I do wish the audio for the cars were better. Some of them sounded a bit trash and unpleasant. There's one car, I can't think of what it is now, no matter what colour you pick, it doesn't add the colour. Every other car does though. Going to the bar is fine, but there's nothing to do apart from Blackjack. Not sure the point of getting drunk either. 

If there is a minimap in the game, it didn't appear for me, nor was there an option to turn it on. Not to worry though! Quite a small map. 

I do hope that more neighbourhoods are added, more gas stations, etc. The day cycle is pretty short too, like, way too short. I wanted to have like 15 cars in my lot before opening but I couldn't buy, upgrade, paint and wash all cars before night time came. Unfortunately, after each night cycle, the cars are dirty again. I tried cleaning all the cars at the gas station before opening again, but, even doing that, the night time came too quickly and yet, once again, all cars were dirty again. 

Like I say, its a good time-passer. I enjoyed it but, there's still a lot more to be fixed / added to make this game truly banging.",1685351071,1694497949,True,0,0,0.788232862949371338,0,True,False,True

2) There are only two types of customers: Low-ballers and good customers.
3) Driving on your own is optional (teleport using bus stops) and not very fun, since the maps is pretty empty and really small.
4) You can just calculate the lowest amount you've to pay when buying and the highest amount you can demand when selling in consideration of your bartering level, which will make you dirty rich in no time without being able to really spend the money.

it's just a usual repetitive game. buy-wash/tune-sell.
just a common user to buy your car. no collectors customers, no enthusiastic customers,

if you are a petrolhead. you'll be bored in a quick time. just few variation of car you can drive or sell here. 
if you are a used car seller, you'll be laugh so hard. because the car was SOLD TOO EASY. 10 cars sold in just an hour (in game).

car damage? don't worry it's just a rusted-like body panel. no engine damage, no twisted mileage, no ex-crashed body. (well it's wrote on the reports) but there's no visual in the car about what i said above. 

i know this is an early access game. i trust the developer will DEVELOP this game to the detail that i wrote above.
but, i'm so sorry.. i'll not recommend this game for today. because what you post in slides above, JUST TWO OF THEM showed in the game.

This game has potential and I want to really like it, since I am really into cars/vehicles. However, there is just too much in terms of bugs and lack of content to do much even with the recent drag race update. What you basically do in this game is run a car dealership, along with customizing the cars you buy and you can also customize the dealership site and your living areas. There are quite a few cars ranging from dodge chargers to BMWs and the like just without brand names/ licenses to approve for using their official names in game. You can sell the cars you buy off for profit and do it all over again or keep some cars for yourself. 

Where the game falls short is the lack of customization for all of these features. There is a limited amount of customization options you can do for the cars and both the dealership/office area and for your living quarters as well. I feel as if there is just limited options and personality to make these how you want them to be.

The controls for this game are awful. I am using an xbox controller and while there is support for it, there is no rumble/force feedback... For a game with cars, you would think while driving around and taking cars from point A to B to get fueled, go racing or crashing there would be some type of feedback... but no this is not to be found whatsoever. If I play a car game, I expect no matter if I am using a wheel or controller to have feedback as I like that type of emersion. The button commands for xbox do show up on screen as guidance but are rather confusing to me as they remain as keyboard buttons rather than switching over to for instance, A,B,X,Y with circles. This did confuse me quite a bit and I mistakenly pressed the keyboard buttons on some inputs thinking the keyboard mode was still enabled. There is also a lack of a ""look around"" camera inside and outside the car specifically for the xbox/controllers that are not an actual mouse and there is no way from my knowledge that this can be fine tuned in settings to have it set to the left or right sticks. But this camera mode works fine on foot and walking with the xbox control stick normally as you would expect. There is also no way to adjust the cars sensitivity to your liking as well. You are stuck with however the cars handle by default.

I also know that there is a alcohol/gambling ""mini game"" I guess you would call it. Not sure what that has to do with running a car dealership. If you try buying alcohol and drinking a few beers and go out and drive a car, it just acts as if you didn't drink anything at all, there is no emersion to that, unless your at the bar playing blackjack or walking around on foot. The drag race is a good feature though beyond that as a mini game as well as the other open areas you can go via the tow truck down the road from your dealership premises. 



Then on to the bugs in game, its just quite horrible and messy as of the drag race update. With the AI, Either there are some ai, or not enough on the map and roads. The ai in places randomly gets stuck or just randomly piles on top of each other or they just go real slow most of the time. No ai appears driving during the night as of the recent update in my experience. Then, when you take the cars in for repair at the repair shop and it goes up on the automated lift, the arms clip into the doors of most cars... There is also a ton of pop-in for the background scenery both at the day and night cycles, that is very annoying. I have everything on ultra settings but it looks everyday in game especially during the day it is either foggy or the horizon is too bright...

The photo mode also needs a little bit of fine tuning as I would like to see options to hide the UI and to be able to take custom photos and upload them directly to steam. Also, the day and night cycles are too fast and seemingly last only 10-15 mins to barely do anything. There should be an option to slow down or speed up the time in 1x-100x like in farming simulator for your preference.

Overall, there needs to be improvements on the controls, customization options and the bugs I mentioned. Hopefully these can be sorted out in the next update with the UI overhall and the office customization update that the devs announced already. For now in this games current state, I just cannot recommend.",1693299143,1693299921,False,27,3,0.729153037071228027,8,True,False,True

It's a good fun for asked price but watch out as it's VERY rough around edges:
- some grammar any typos the most absurd being at the 'welcome screen'
- immersion breaking puppet NPC-s and employee need total overhaul
- car sounds
- cars missing features like badge so you just have a hole in there
- narrow FOV for FP game
- Dirty office message bug 
and so on, won't mention everything since it is Early Access

So what's good?
- buying/repairing/tuning cars
- selling and managing your office is fun
- blackjack

[b]Pros:[/b]
[list]
[*] The progression is well paced. The grind to get money at the beginning quickly turns into an addicting race to become a multi-millionaire.
[*] The car interiors/exteriors are modeled well for the most part.
[/list]

[b]Cons:[/b]
[list]
[*] The English in this game is atrocious.
[*] The conversations with NPCs are repetitive, bland, drawn out, and only make the game worse.
[*] The audio effects for vehicles are awful 90% of the time.
[*] The bugs with objectives not completing are annoying (It's early access but its also not free).
[*] Auctions are incredibly boring and there is no option to skip to the next vehicle. They can easily suck 3-4 minutes out of your life and waste half an in game day.
[*] There is no mechanic to quickly travel without a vehicle (bike, scooter, horse, skateboard, anything) leading to you having to run between your car lot and the mechanics frequently. There's no point in driving because you'll eventually have to walk anyway.
[*] Too many features serve no mechanical purpose, like anything other than the price when listing a car. If they did the game would be more tedious, but it begs the question why they're there in the first place.

It is recommended to add some unfair car dealers in the game where they can steal your money to make the game more difficult because I can literally buy any car in the game at any price and just clean it and repair it then I will still be able to make a profit.

In addition, i think that to upgrades points for protecting your car is exaggeration. Instead, knowing the average car cost desire two upgrades points.

The last point, all the mechanic workers have the same face. It will be more realistic if each one had a different face and name.

Am very excited for the coming updates, and I recommend this game for everyone who likes to play simulation games where he own a store and sell things.

Difficult to judge what value you are adding to the car. Will play a few more hours as there is plenty yet to see.

+ quite a lot of cars (over 50 at the time of the review) including cars that are not found everywhere, such as the Audi Q7 or Škoda superb / kodiaq 
+ So far the best simulator of this work 
+ many ways you can come to new cars such as auctions  hall and car market... 
+Many tuning options for almost every car.  We are talking here about tuning appearance (color of lights, neon...) and not performance and stability.  
+In addition to selling cars, you can also do other activities, such as playing black jack and either going bankrupt or getting rich quickly, and it didn't work for me yet, but it was also possible to load the car on a truck and drive somewhere outside the city where you could test drive your car.

- it's more of a short game. The second you get to super sports and hyper sports, you are simply rich and the game immediately loses any greater meaning. It's not right away, but somehow it doesn't take long if you know how to do it
- the system that determines the price of the car and everything around it in general is still quite bad.  As for me, I tried to enjoy the game to the fullest and honestly take photos of everything as it should and make descriptions, etc... What is really supposed to raise the price of the car, so I quickly found out that all you have to do is put a car in the game without a photo and without a description or maybe completely out of the picture  description and even then the car will be sold and perhaps even for a good price.  And a car that is honestly photographed and described will be sold anyway.  There is no difference yet.  
- I consider the tablet to be one of the rather important things in this game.  Thanks to him, everything is done on the spot and, above all, the car can be photographed.  But it is not said exactly where the tablet is.  The player is not exactly directed to the bar to buy it there.

I got the best car for 50k less than it's real price. Washing is very useful, it gives you 1 skill point exp for every part you clean and 3 skill point exp when you clean the whole car. To sum it up, the game is very unique, though the only problem is i can't download the data (i just saw it is updating about it right now). Another problem is that when you buy and sell the best car there is nothing more to the game. I even bought my favourite car for my own and not to sell it but STILL there is nothing more. I can see this game rising up but it needs a concept update to add more cars to the game. The game is in Early access so yea it has a lot of potential. Sorry i forgot, last problem is that when you buy YOU yourself TCS, ABS etc. Instead of making profit when you sell it, you will lose because customers want it cheap even tho you put things to make your car safe.

-Employees to automate certain aspects of the game
-More properties (eg. Houses, dealerships, garages, etc)
-More upgrade paths (eg. Dealership can have its own garage built in, deeper skill tree, Houses to have bigger space for more cars, etc)
-Auctions to be an all day thing with more than just 4 cars, with cars to come out as soon as the player pays at the end of bidding.
-More depth to the modifications. Doesn't necessarily have to be fancy body kits and spoilers, but tiers of race mod and drift mod instead of just 1 each, for example.

Main issue I have with this game is the price tag. The price of 17.5 euro is quite high considering that this is seriously unfinished product right now. Game is filled with bugs. Only few minutes in game I experienced at least 10 bugs that are not forgiving for the price devs ask for.

Some of the notorious bugs that require quick fixing are:
- Report bug dialog is not allowing you to write paragraph (quite ironic)
- NPC people are walking through objects, spawning and disappearing abruptly, walking and standing/sitting awkwardly like we are in year 2008
- Day to night transition is laughably abrupt (again, like we are in 90s now)
- Car sometimes won't accelerate until you re-enter the car
- Car camera always resets to first person
- Car camera switch is not always consistent (sometimes the camera angle order is not correct)
- English is broken in user interface (wrong/bad translation etc.)
- NPC cars are spawning in laughable rate (on one part the streets are completely empty like we are in pandemic curfew, than we will have 4 cars driving at the distance of 1 meter between each other)
- No collision detection between car and person
- Tablet/phone camera is zooming in for no reason
- Can't look behind the car when in first person camera angle

These are some urgent issues that dev team should fix. There are plenty of minor bugs I can get over for now.

Another thing that is not quite right are some of the game mechanics. For example, tuning/panting/fixing cars is not profitable. You can literally go and buy a car, put it on sale with random title and no pictures, and make profit. It breaks the game when you can literally do nothing and earn money. Also, adding pictures/title etc. when you put car on sale makes no impact on sale.

Cars also feels pretty much the same. 

I would not recommend this game right now. If the price was 10 or less euros yes, but for this price the game is just not worth it. Maybe if the team fix some of the mentioned issues things would change.",1689549099,1689549099,False,1,0,0.504950463771820068,0,True,False,True

Mouse moves vertically like I'm swimming in treacle.

Oh and did I say about the ""Error while downloading the data""?

Wow, starting a game and seeing that and then there's a guide fix, but it doesn't fix the error at all. Just shows how little the game devs care about that huge red flag when you first start the game.

Refund incoming.... I'll avoid, at least for now.

Concept is decent enough, if the devs care enough and don't just want to bleed the £15 Early Access market then vanish when they've made enough money then it seems like a worthwhile game, graphics are poop, but the gameplay concept makes it an interesting game to want to come back to regardless of graphical quality.",1689220428,1689220428,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

It would be nice if there was a little bit more to do in ""Free Roam"".
Also I wish they had a lot of different statistics in game. Like how many cars you sold, what was the most profit on a car in %, what was the most profitable day. what was the day with the most losses, how much money you spend on repairs in total, how much money you spent OVERALL on all the cars you bought (Gross Income) and so on and so on...

Also some tipps on the gameplay. (might not work if the mechanics of the game change)
Upgrade your negotiation first! You can negotiate 20% lower when you buy a car and ask 17% more when you sell it. Buy very expensive cars, because you can negotiate in %. So if you buy a car for 1.000 you can only negotiate to 800. But if you buy a 100.000 car you can negotiate down to 80.000!!! Dont repair the car or do anything to it. Just sell right away and negotiate the price 17% higher. That's how you make the most money in the shortest time! After little time you will be very rich, then buy very cheap cars, store them either in your shop or at home and just wash them everyday for xp.

- On your tablet, there's no way of deleting old pictures of cars that you already sold, for new cars you have to repeatedly take pictures so they appear in the gallery.
- A lot of console errors (which is normal since it's early access, but would be great if there's an option to remove the notifications & errors) other than that 4 hours straight of playing 0 bugs with driving, drinking, etc.
- Would be really unique to have in the database history of sold cars.
- Some more technical stuff would be fun too, transmission failures, engine problems, instead you get other '' major '' problems like that your car is dirty and perhaps a cracked fender.
- Bigger world, options to travel to other states, import cars from a different country as an example.
- More fluent interactions when negotiating and a bigger variety of cars.
I can go on and on, but of course there's a lot to be mentioned, I have high hopes on this one, we'll see how it'll age.
UPDATE:
- Now there is a way to delete old pictures
- No console errors
- 0 crashes, I'm at day 65, no issues with saves, nearly 20 hours of gameplay.
With each hour, I'm enjoying this game more and more, still 2 things that need to be fixed :
- As shown in the trailer that you can buy totaled cars or use them for scrap, there is no such option available, I hope we get it soon.
- Still can't save the overall data of sold cars and points for the global ranking.
Go ahead and buy this game, it's getting better.

I like the idea and it has potential but the game is really unpolished, there are so much that is missing. 

Con
- Controls need to be reworked
- Driving controls is not good
- Menu system is not thought through, scrolling is really bad.
- The lack of information on what is actually going on and how to do things is annoying
- Lack of Focus of the main idea, there are so much stuff like driving around and playing mini games and taking the buss around the place that the main area of actually buying/selling cars gets lost. 
- There's something in the game, I think it's some back-end loading that makes the game lag from time to time when you look around.

Pros
+ Good idea

Summary: the idea is good but the game is really unpolished and need a lot more before I would spend my money on it.",1688471891,1688471891,False,2,0,0,0,True,False,True

Okie dokie.
For those of you who have seen my reviews, I typically wait until I've had a good amount of time played before making a review; this is a change of form. I didn't play this game for long because, admittedly, I was rather disappointed.
+Pros:
+The game is exactly as advertised; you go to a car show or neighborhood and try to swindle customers for cars. There's a lot of diversity in the cars you can find while out hunting.
+Car customization: being able to change the color and sheen of the car is a nice touch.
+It's a relatively simple game with the loop of: buy car, fix it/customize it, sell it, sleep, repeat. Time progresses independently so there is a day night cycle.
-Cons:
-Unfinished*: The game is largely unfinished; human sprites are wonky, some of the interfaces don't work correctly, the driving can be described as buggy and overly sensitive. *Now, I understand that this is early access, so hopefully some of these things will be fixed in the full release.*
-Expectations aren't met: I came to this game after watching Markiplier play Gas Station Simulator and I wanted something more in depth. Now, these are not at all the same game, but this is definitely more of a dealership simulator (like I wanted), but for the price I paid for it, it didn't do it for me; I wasn't immersed in the game.
-Price: So, I bought this game when it was on sale for $10.79, but the normal retail is around 20 bucks usd! This game feels, to me, that it's still in its playtesting phase; that this should be a release to playtesters to work out bugs and improve the experience, but, instead, it is up to the public to purchase this game and find out for themselves.
*Conclusion*
*This game is exactly as advertised, with a simple game loop that may keep some entertained, but that did not do it for me. Developers, I encourage you to continue working on this project, it seems like a labor of love and will do well with some TLC. It's just, for me, this game isn't worth the money (as of the games current release).",1688471065,1688471065,False,6,0,0.54021531343460083,0,True,False,True

- No FOV Slider -- locked to about 60ish fov it feels like.
- Broken English Text
- No explanation of how to do certain things. - The game prompts you to bargain before it tells you that you need to purchase the upgrade with skill points. 
- Cars do their own things at all times. There are ""Racing"" and ""Drift"" kits in the game but does not affect how the car feels at all. 
- Each time you load the game the sound breaks and you have to reset it in the audio settings. 


Suggestion for the game devs: Please try to reel back on the features, no need to make the next My Summer Car, focus on the core mechanics and bring in the new features later. The game feels very wonky at it's current state.

The only way to make profit that way is by getting lucky and having a car spawn at the junkyard, which I never saw. 
Buying cars from the neighborhood/car sale meet/auction and fixing them up/adding drift packages, painting, wheels, etc, NEVER INCREASES THE VALUE OF THE CAR! 
Cleaning/fixing the car may get you a bit more profit but not anything noticeable early on. Only way to make profit is just to buy low, sell high, it's all about getting the best deal. 

You can use the bar/gambling to make a bunch of money quick but the game is called Car for sale simulator, not gambler simulator. 

There's also nothing to do with the car when you get it. Maybe add drift events, race events, rally, car meets? who knows. Endless stuff. But right now? Drive around, I guess?

Rating: ★★☆☆☆

As someone who typically supports indie developers and values gameplay over graphics, I was genuinely excited to try this out. The game presented a unique concept within its genre, but sadly, the overall implementation left much to be desired. It felt as though the development was outsourced to a budget developer from a freelance platform.

The most glaring issue that struck me was the lack of soul and artistic touch in the game. It seemed to be missing that special something that could have made it truly immersive and engaging. Moreover, there were noticeable size inconsistencies with various objects in the game, such as the doors and couches, which were disproportionately larger than they should have been in relation to the player's size. These inconsistencies created a jarring and unrealistic experience.

Given that the game was developed using Unity, it was disheartening to see the missed opportunity to significantly enhance the graphics. It would have taken only a few hours of research on YouTube tutorials to learn how to improve the visuals and, at the very least, apply lightmaps to enhance the overall lighting quality. The fact that prominent YouTubers had already voiced their concerns about the dark car photos, and this issue persisted even in the trailer, indicates a lack of attention to detail and responsiveness to player feedback.

While it had a promising concept, the disappointing execution and lackluster attention to visual details ultimately overshadowed its potential. I truly hope the developer takes note of the feedback and considers making the necessary improvements to provide a more enjoyable and visually appealing experience for players. 

As it stands, I find it challenging to recommend this game, even for those who are usually supportive of indie titles, but I will keep a close look on how it develops and probably will change my review.",1687795728,1687795920,False,1,0,0.482213437557220459,0,True,False,True

Yes it is an early access game and the price reflects this. There are bug at times but the developers are working on fixes and we all need to help them by reporting these bugs. The bugs I have experienced is that the game doesn't always respond when I click the mouse and I have had to Alt+F4 to force close the game at times. Then it works okay when reloaded. That is the only major bugs I have experience so far. 

Good bits I like about the game. I like the open free world map and its explorable. The improvements I would like to see here would to have a minimap like in GTA V in the bottom left corner with icons for the player and the locations of the car dealer, garage, bar, junkyard and so on. 

Things I dislike. There is only one thing I do not like about this game. The time goes too fast and I would like it to be slowed down to half speed so we get longer to buy cars, fix them up and all the exciting stuff that this new game has to offer. Perhap add this as an option to use ""real time"" mode as well as 1.5x to 5x time speed that would give us players a choice. 

Feedback to the developers. 
I would like to see improvements to the handling of the cars and trucks because some of the cars have steering that is too light for a car and there is a lack of the ""feel"" when cornering. I would like to improvements to understeer and oversteering when driving. Something similar to how Gran Turismo would be like. 

I would like to see more variety in the AI traffic with vehicles like garbage trucks, buses and emergency vehicles like fire trucks, ambulances and police cars driving about in the traffic. At night time. Police cars should patrol the neighborhood area and the player should be able to report scammer sellers to the Police in the game so if they sell a dodgy car to the player. The AI Police can and will arrest them. 

I am sure this feedback will be helpful to the game developers and I am so happy to have the experience of playing this game. I look forward to supporting its progress!

It begins slow but your soon earning $1000's at a time and eventually come limited to what you can do next. Although there is a small map to go round, you'll find little things here and there but nothing to scream about. Even though its in early access, the game offers some impressive features for a cheap simulation game. Your easily able to give feedback to the developers and report anything that find shouldn't be happening. I brought this game blind and have invested a lot of my time in this game now having brought it way back and it was released following the demo. 
I know the developer keeps the community updated as much as possible with updates and fixes which is great. The one flaw I would say, the trailer gives off such a good impression but really only advertises the upcoming updates. Don't be fooled into thinking that the game is going to mirror the features on the trailer, these features are not yet released. Unfortunately, from what I've seen there isn't a date yet for these releases :(. That being said - Fantastic game, just bring these updates to us.. Having the car scrapping feature and the new dealerships to purchase will make this early access game so much more appealing earlier on!",1687430575,1687430575,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

It's a bit rough, a few bugs here and there in early access, nothing is a major issue.

Graphics aren't the best, but are pleasant enough to look at, better than a fair amount of games I've played.

BUT THE CARS, there's so much you can do with them already; clean, paint, polish, tune up, among some more customization. They look SOOO good, at least to me. 

The only thing I would wish for is for the cars you sell to be driving around or possibly even show up again later for you to buy, this would give a lot more incentive to jazz up the vehicle if you could see it again later and profit off your hard work earlier.

Note I have a lot of negative things to say, BUT it is early access and there is a good chance that in a year none of this will be relevant.

1. In terms of ""caring"" for the car. Any mechanic game (Car Mechanic 21 for example) does it better. Heck even the customization in NFS games is better/more fun. But this will likely be expanded on in the future??
2. The management of ""stock"" is a boring loop atm. Go to neighborhood->Pray to RNGsus for a car you can buy->check the car show if it's even around->sell your car for minimal profit 9 times outta 10 (or wait for an hour to get tht one customer willing to pay the price for the car)->rinse and repeat. 
Hopefully they'll add better ways for procuring cars, not really a dealership if the only way i get a car is one at a time from my neighbors who somehow always need to sell cars.
3. Customization of the business isn't bad, but very limited and incredibly simplistic in appearance. I fully expect that to change as things progress.
4. The controls are absolutely garbage. I don't like driving with keyboard and mouse, but controllers are barely usable with how the bindings end up and they're completely unchangeable. Sensitivity is insane, I had to lower it by a lot to even be able to use my mouse and then it messed with the controller so i had to change it some again. The driving is incredibly basic and the handling between cars is wildly different. Ridiculously so, some cars will drift at the slightest input and others corner like a container ship (even tho it's a hatchback).
5. As with all Early Access games, the world is VERY empty and there is very little to actually do. Granted the concept (buying/selling cars) is pretty simple but the world itself is just empty and what is in the world is very simple (both in appearance and mechanics/interactions)

Controls are probably my biggest complaint. Everything else is Early Access quality issues and things one expects will be worked on. But the controls are absolutely unusable for me and I'd almost not recommend on that fact alone. But I really like the concept they have here and it'll be interesting what they can do with it. It's also cheap(-ish) in terms of games on Steam so worth checking out.

EDIT: Forgot to mention, updates are coming out at a really  good pace and that is the main reason I recommend despite my issues with the game.

With that being said, this game is not at all worth it in its current state and for its current price. It is extremely low quality and feels as though the devs just made a game for the sole purpose of extracting as much money as possible from the Steam community in the shortest amount of time with the promise of a full game before gapping to the Bahamas. Now is that true? I don't believe so but in the games current state, one would not be wrong for thinking so. 

With both the graphics and the content of a free android/IOS game, I cannot recommend this in it's current state. It is a hell of a long way off the price tag.

Although the gameplay loop feel pretty grindy and the game is buggy, it is entertaining and enjoyable.
But I don't think It's worth buying at this stage.

I mean, the devs clearly know how to use AI when it comes to pictures for loading screen. Why can't they just use AI to have at least half decent translations for the text?

Aside from the translation errors, the car models' quality is all over the place.
Some of the model looks way better than others.
Some cars have the actual rolling wheels laying on top of the wheel model fixed onto the body itself.
Some even have their break calipers spinning with the wheels while driving.

I think I don't have to talk about the bugs since a lot of the reviews already mention them.

I do see the possibility of this game being good in the future. I will keep it in my wishlist.
Or I might buy it back when I'm bored.

However, as I delved deeper into the gameplay, I couldn't help but feel a sense of disappointment due to some missing features that I had seen showcased.

Firstly, the ability to watch the car by Sponge seemed like a fantastic addition. It's a unique concept that could have added an extra layer of immersion to the game. I was really looking forward to experiencing that feature and utilizing it to understand the condition of the cars in a more interactive way.

Additionally, the absence of the junkyard as a gameplay element left me somewhat perplexed. I had seen glimpses of it in the promotional materials, and I envisioned it as a place where I could search for hidden treasures, repair and restore old vehicles, or perhaps even salvage parts to enhance the cars I sell. Its exclusion feels like a missed opportunity to diversify the gameplay experience.

Lastly, the missing features related to office decoration left me wanting more. It's always enjoyable to have the freedom to personalize and beautify one's surroundings, and I had hoped to see that reflected in the game. Whether it's choosing different furniture, wallpapers, or even trophies to display, the option to customize the office space would have added a delightful touch.

I understand that game development is a complex process, and sometimes certain features may not make it into the final product due to various reasons. However, as a passionate player, I wanted to express my disappointment at the absence of these features, which I believe could have significantly enriched the overall gameplay experience.

I sincerely hope that the Cars for Sale team considers implementing these missing features in future updates or expansions. With the addition of these elements, the game would truly become a standout experience and capture the hearts of even more players.

Anyway, Thank you for your attention and for creating Cars for Sale.",1686175698,1686175698,False,3,1,0.483504772186279297,0,True,False,True

There are some things that are not very clear like how to get the tablet or how to use the scrap yard/get the hammer but the developers are receptive to feedback which spells great future for this game. It might be a very big universe in few years.
The issue that most people have with no automatic saving is acually beneficial because there is issues in the game and if the worst happens like you just lost your car and have no money left you can just quit the game and load up from save, if the save was automatical you would have to start again.

Each vehicle is worth about 400$, you get 2 cars a day in game. The tablet is super easy way to attract more attention to your vehicles you are selling, to get a faster and better sale! Also, in the Red Bar in the back left corner through a black door, there is 2 black jack tables, be careful how you play but it is also a super fun and risky way to earn money!

I feel this is a good game with a lot of potential
The pros include
-Interactive web page interface where you can upload photos of the cars and list them for sale
-Skill based progression based on cars sold and cars cleaned by hand. The more you play the more you unlock
-Variety of different cars with different car models.
-Different methods of purchasing vehicles including auctions, approaching people in neighbourhoods and car shows.
The cons
-Some of the car models interiors are very low quality however i suspect this will improve in time
-Some of the cars don't allow you to fully clean them by hand such as the Bmw 1m rep audi tt rep and audi r8 rep
-General performance issues with the game when skipping a night by sleeping in the bed for a minute.

Overall i would consider this to be a fun game however £15 is quite steep for the game in the current condition and also is just lacking the content for the price. I've completed the game to the point i can own anything i want after about 10 hours and after 14 hours it has just got a bit repetitive with nothing new to note. Overall i would purchase it but wait for a sale.

Game runs well, the graphics are decent, lot of things rendering in and out, but that seems general for pc too. As of now, you will have to modify your own controller layout, I might put one up soon of my own but it should only take you 5 minutes. Looking at a solid 60fps, however on first plays there will be large lag spikes for arrival on new areas from bus, looking at 2/3 5 second freezes, but once it's over you shouldn't get it again. Lot of polishing and work needed, but for steam deck I would recommend it. Any other questions, just ask below and I'll answer them.",1685627225,1685627225,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

You run your own dealership - buy cars, fix them up (if you want to) and sell them for a profit. It is pretty eurojank - plenty of dodgy english translations, character models and animations are jank;  nothing really game breaking though and the game itself is pretty unique in both it's concept and execution. 

There's huge potential from the base that's currently in game. The driving is surprisingly good for a game that has no racing, wandering around the town finding cars to buy, then listing them and selling them is a fun game loop. There are also minor side activities that are kind of meaningless but hint at future potential and game mechanics that may be expanded on.. 

The devs are pretty active and there's been pretty regular updates. This game is in ealy access and things break - you may note all the thumbs downs because of broken save games - but that's the nature of early access. If you don't want to deal with that however it may be worth holding off until the game gets closer to full release.

 I'd say this game is worth getting - the 11 hours I've played have been fun and worth the entry price. I'm probably not going to play much more until there's more updates and things to do - but even if the development died now, I'd consider the price of the game well worth the the time I've played.",1685288325,1685288325,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Standards need to be so much higher. If a game is Early Access, that's fine but price it as such. This game is similar in price to Car Mechanic Simulator 2021. That's how absurd the pricing is compared to the quality of what you get. Hell, the very first screen when you load the game shows ""Cars Purchased"" and ""Cars Selled""....

I'm not about to refund and blast a game because of a few typos. The game stutters on my fairly high end PC. Sensitivity and movement is beyond whack. I was pleasantly surprised to see that I could drive with my wheel until I found the brakes didn't work and I ended up bumping a pole. Oh well, i'll just drop into reverse. Oh wait, you can't reverse your car, at least not with any of the buttons I tried pressing (every button on wheel and keyboard).

There's some slight potential there. Maybe the gameplay makes up for some of the mess. But let's get serious. This isn't an Early Access game. Not unless it has an introductory price of $5 until they figure out the bugs and clean it all up. My 8 minutes of gameplay found more bugs than content. Anyway, i've refunded the game. I'll find another copy a different way a year from now and if it's at a reasonable level i'll buy again.

It's a game clearly made by  beginners in Unity with lots of pre-made assets, but it has a lot of good ideas that need more fleshing out. Current alpha is nowhere near current price value. 

This is clearly a game made by a group getting into game making, but I think it has tons of potential. The biggest strength of this game is its solid gameplay loop. The act of buying cars from multiple places and selling them has a lot of factors and choices that go into it, and gaining money doing it is very satisfying. 

The main aspect that needs to be worked on is overall refinement. Collision detection is bad or non-existent for some objects, Environments are empty or busy with models but nothing to interact with. The game also has significant bugs, the biggest for me being cars not re spawning and the car lot not being open as I play in a single session (resetting the game fixes it). 

I also think this game should lean into the humor more. Make it so you fall over if you get hit by a car, make unique dialogue if you're drunk, and make the NPCs completely unhinged!

where do i even begin?

the countless areas just, unfinished, lazily made.
the consistent spelling errors both in game and in updates.
the sickening camera, first time loading the game up looking around was painful. by default you can BARELY look around. that sensitivity is ridiculous. 

the game feels and looks so basic, Early Access is an understatement. 

i understand if the devs are new to this or simply incapable of working without feedback until a certain stage. but as it stands, they released something they knew for a fact would be FILLED with issues.

also, some funny aspects, loading takes a small eternity, the loading screen feels like it was made by an AI [just look at the vehicle on the left side.]

it truthfully feels like its just a generic game. 

cash grab? possibly, does this game have a future? ONLY if the devs take this seriously. i would of took this off the store until its actually ready. they will need to work on this a LOT on ALL areas before this game is stable enough to be considered a game IMO. 

anyways. do not purchase this game when its not on sale. do not purchase this game until its out of early access, and even then do some research before doing so to check if the game is actually worth it.

Buyer beware , it is playable and is a fun game but know that it's a Early Access Indie game.

The game is a literal grind and i'd say when you do about 4-8 hours , you'll become bored because it's just the same old same old.  Wake up , buy some cars , fix,paint,upgrade , and sell. rinse wash and repeat. 
Wait about a month or better and we'll see what they do with the game .

1.  when saving you get a black screen quite often causing your game not to save so you can lose progress
2. it can be hard to make money to start with and you need pateince when selling cars as alot of the time customers dont offer you a price for what you paid for the car.
3. barguin skill level 1 and 2 dont really make a difference when trying to get best price for vehicle

There is a scrapyard place where you can get junk and sell, This though takes time and you do not get alot of money for it but can be useful in a pinch, but me personally dont see the need for in the current state
There is also a Bar which you can buy booze and do some gambling, Again unless you really need some cash this isnt really worth it in my opinion as it can be so easy to lose your money, That said some people have found this useful and been lucky and earned alot of money from it.

Reminds me of Streamer Life Simulator and Internet Cafe Simulator 2 a lot, except this one is far buggier. I know it just released, but for $18? Make it $10 and maybe it'd be worth it. Within 40 minutes of playing it I have completely lost control of my vehicle and just my game entirely and my car goes flying off the map. Even the slightest imperfections on the road makes your car go flying and destroys your car almost 100% of the time. Customers lowball way too often even though my vehicles are fully washed, repaired, and fueled up. It seems that customers insist on buying a $7000 car for $1600-1800. Until they fix the countless amount of bugs, I can't say this is worth the price.
This also seems like a product that will be abandoned within a month or two, just like most of the games with this style do.

TLDR: Intriguing game premise with an empty map, and too many current bugs/translation issues. If the game sees refinement in future updates, then it could possibly be quite a fun little game.

The premise of the game is intriguing. You buy used cars in hopes of selling them for profit after fixing them up (paint, mechanical/electrical, and washing.) You can buy these used cars either by walking around the (very small) neighborhood in the game, or by attending the weekly ""car market."" You'll save the game by sleeping in your bed at your home, which begins--in true simulator fashion--as a container with boarded up windows and a dirty bed. All of this is contained in an open world that you can navigate by either driving your cars or taking the bus to different stops placed around the map. 

Unfortunately, the game map in its current state feels barren. There are vast stretches of flat, empty space on the map, and there is a lot of optimizing needed in the areas of the map that do have objects/NPCs in them. Certain cars have a tendency to flip at random or glitch out. There are large amounts of the game that appear to be still in the works, such as the tablet which shows up on your TAB menu, but cannot be used. The English version has a multitude of grammatical/spelling errors, and in general, the game just feels like a super early draft. 

However, the game shows a lot of promise--especially considering that the main gameplay loop seems to fit a niche in the simulation genre. I would be surprised if someone could keep themselves entertained with this game beyond 10 hours in its current state. However, I am hopeful that this is just the beginning for Car For Sale Simulator 2023--what a unique concept for a game!",1684505517,1684505517,False,3,1,0.5,0,True,False,True

Here's the rundown.....

Positives
-----------
-- Great concept that many of us want in other games and never get.
-- Trading AI isn't bad ... about a 6/10. It works.
-- Added content like the mechanics , junkyard and bar are a nice touch. Makes you want more.
-- Ranking system telling you how you ranked compared to other players. (was removed after a few hours though)

Negatives
-----------
-- Bugs bugs bugs. Developers are reacting fairly fast. Day 1 had a black screen sleep bug that is already fixed.
-- I HATE BAD GAMBLING CONCEPTS! The Bar has blackjack which can be used to ruin the games money system. 
-- Legs seem to be a problem in this game. Creepy to watch.
-- Map isn't that big. Not much content or hidden content. 
-- Late game not much to do. You sell cars faster then your lot can hold. 
-- Driving in this game can be fun but you can skip driving anywhere which takes out the risk. Like blackjack in the bar not having to drive saves you time and money.

Overall it took me 5 hours to build everything and find myself not challenged.
