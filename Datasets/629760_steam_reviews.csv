Как - то раз, на одном из серверов, со мной приключилась следущее:

Я просто играл, в основном дуэлил, делал то что мне нравится. Играл со всеми, в общем приятно проводил время.

Всё было хорошо, пока на сервере не появился игрок с непонятным никому ником. Он стал вызывать меня на фт10, при этом он очень много писал. Из - за языкового барьера я не совсем смог разобрать что он пишет, только отдельные слова: "" mods"", "" settings"", "" binds"". Его сет я не запомнил, только корону на голове, но это не столь важно.

Ну в общем пишет он, пишет. Я стою,  пытаюсь читать и на конец он вижу слово: "" go "". Я вежливо, в своей манере, приветствую соперника и даю ему 10 раз пизды. После чего пишу слово:"" gg"" и продолжаю спокойно дуэлить.

The suggestion for new players: play the game in private servers to practice skills, or watching YouTube and play with the robot.

  It has Complex and rewarding combat, Great graphics, A class creation system which is the only reason I keep coming back, and No Micro-transactions. 
  Gameplay wise, you can normally always find a match and the gamemodes aren't too bad. You got Quickplay modes (Frontline, Invasion, Horde, and Brawl), Ranked Modes (Duel 1v1 and Teamfight 3v3). Most matches are pretty fun until a lvl 100+ decides to wip out his maul and go full beyblade which results in a good 10-15 people leaving. 
  In the Class Creation System you got 345 Armor Pieces, 5 Shields, & 35 different weapons to choose from, plus 23 perks & the actual avatar editor at your full disposal to make whatever ungodly thing you can think of. 
  But in the end I'd kinda recommend it, if its on sale and you got a 24 pack with you:)

Edit 2023
Phew, a few years have gone by, and I made this review when I was a freshman in Senior High, now I'm a freshman in college, but that's not important, we should talk about the game. Looking at the game objectively, it has a gotten a lot better. More customization, female player models, more voices, mods, new weapons etc. The game content wise has a lot and is still improving and getting better. My previous review still stands, it is the greatest medieval hack n slash fighter on the market, albeit not as easy to get into, and I will explain why.
 
However, there is one thing that is plaguing the game, and its the community. When I first played the game, the community was a lot kinder, a lot more new player friendly, and overall positive. But, since then the game's community has gotten downhill. You will be ridiculed, made fun of, and there is no support for new players. The only time I've enjoyed this game is playing privately with friends, or with all the new blood that has come because of the game going free on Epic Games. The game is lacking growth because it is cut off by the higher level players that are outright disrespectful and rude to the new bloods or people who don't play the game 24/7. 

If you can overlook the community issue, the game is incredible and fun. It's just the community that ruins the experience for me sometimes.",1557287272,1708333583,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Before hopping straight into quick play it is good idea to use the server browser to find some dueling servers where you can get a better feel for how player on player combat feels and some of the intricacies around it, just be warned that not all dueling servers are created equal and some of them attract rather toxic communities. Once you get a hang of the game though you will notice that despite it's rough edges and inconsistent net code this game has a truly intense and chaotic skill based combat system that is unlike anything we have really seen before in a medieval combat game.

Voice-acting: ok i guess
Controls: ouch my head hurt
Customisation: it's a better dress-up game than a medieval slasher
Sound-design: ok in some places, awful in others
Community: half of it is funny naked maul men, bards and memers, the other half is sweaty asses who use as many animation exploits as possible bc that's the only way to play this game now, with the poor low level peoples stuck in the middle.
Balance: polearms and anything with high speed or good camera movement can animation abuse anyone
scimitar is op
rapier is op
war axe is op
zwei is op

Maps: vary in quality dramatically;

FRONTLINE + INVASION:
Arid Inv: Fucking boring as hell with the self-pushing cart, barely ever see red win
Arid FL: Barely ever see red win again
Noria Inv: One of the best, if not the best
Noria FL: Quite balanced actually
Taiga Inv: Ok i guess, and balanced
Taiga FL: red wins more than they should
Grad Blue Inv: God fucking awful crap, blue barely ever loses, and stalemates last forever
Grad Red Inv: Pretty good stuff
Grad FL: blue barely ever loses
Castello Inv: The best imo (also bridge is back :D)
Castello FL: the spawn placements are awful
Feitoria Inv: second best imo
Feitoria FL: RED CAN SPEED RUN THIS CRAP IN 2-3 MINUTES
Feitoria ALT FL: town is always contested, keep is never touched
Crossroads Inv: kinda bad, tho dropping a rock on the king and insta-killing him is hilarious when done right
Crossroads FL: HORSE HELL
Camp Inv: it's just frontline without the capture points
Camp FL: either it's a long-ass stalemate or blue wins
Camp ALT FL: red-right blue-left field point is always contested, meanwhile other point is never touched
Mt. Peak INV: it's pretty ok i guess, though blue trying to torch the right objective is cancer for them.
Mt. Peak FL: actually quite balanced
Dungeon INV: it's just frontline but 1 point at a time
Dungeon FL: probably the most comedic (best) map in the entire game ngl
Dungeon ALT FL: everybody is upstairs nobody is on point
Totenwald FL: great map containing everything that makes mordhau great
Totenwald ALT FL: an alternative FL mode that doesnt feel like an after-thought
Totenwald INV: variety makes this map great too

BRAWL MODES:
Pit: Great in all modes
Cortile: Contraband wannabe
Contraband: Easily the best brawl map
Tourney: idk it's forgotten i guess
Arena: meh
Truce: Basic but good, though i'd love to see the castle it's in as an invasion map
Dungeon: hallways alone are too small

HORDE MODES: 
Horde is fun for new players, but becomes a chore for gold later on
Arid: idk havent played it and probably wont
Noria: One of the best horde maps
Taiga: Ok with a good team
Grad: ok with a good team
Castello: i cant remember really, but i think it wasnt good
Feitoria: noble's place gets real crowded real quick
Crossroads: ok i guess
Camp: The best horde map
Mt. Peak: The second best horde map
Dungeon: too easy with the explosive barrels

BATTLE ROYALE MAPS:
yes this game has a battle royale, but it's so dead that no server can ever be found.
it was ok i guess.

OLD/PRE-REWORK MAPS:
yes i am going to talk about the old stuff you cant play anymore because i miss it
OLD CROSSROADS: its just modern crossroads but without the funny mortar tower
OLD CASTELLO: most of the map would see little-to-no action most of the time
PRE-P28H1 CASTELLO: too flat, too little cover.
PRE-EXPANSION MT. PEAK: it's just smaller mt. peak, it's invasion ended at the gates, making it's extremely quick to beat.
PRE-REWORK FEITORIA: they added holes for no reason and redesigned some rooms (that small-ass corridor on last was a slog to get through so well done i guess in expanding it)
PRE-TORCH MOVE MT. PEAK: the torches used to be before the stairs, making it easily accessible for blue, then for some reason they moved them to behind the stairs closer to red, making them impossible to get to.

GAMEPLAY: 
abuse animations and crappy weapon balancing or die.
horses are cancer
archers are cancer
horse archers are cancer to the cancer.

CONCLUSION: 
it's one of the games of all time.

Bards - passive-aggresively capturing and holding points

Plumers - noobs who saved for vanity, so don't mind them

Geralts - they must win all fights while doing a 360 pirouette.

The boxers - they will charge at you with their big steel mittens, dodge all of your attacks and punch you to death once you're out of stamina.

The naked maul wielders - those skinny grandpas should not be messed with, if you see those, f***ing run!

The skaters - they just want to have a good time.

The trappers - they try to lure you into their spider's lair filled with (usually) very obvious traps

The spies - those who do their best to conceal their team color.

Accidental spies - that's just blood!!

The dwarves - just because they're dwarves doesn't mean you can instantly be hostile to them. Let them be!

The scary f**ks - they go with black dyed gear and use the ""cruel"" voice. They're the definition of tryhards in this game.

Default noobs - unpredictable and never seem to fall for feints (because they don't even register those)

As a new player, having just finished the tutorial and taught the basics of a very complex and in-depth combat system, you will go into your first match against players who have played the game for literal thousands of hours.

There is no matchmaking system; unless you play the ranked 1v1 duels mode, you'll never be able to experience the full 48v48 or 64v64 matches against players of your own skill level. You'll go whole matches getting no kills, learning nothing, just running in and dying to things you don't understand. It's deeply unfun, and the fact that the development has just let the game die because of this, and other issues, is frankly baffling. I don't believe they know what it's like for a new player playing their game.

The community is very toxic, chat is a cesspool. I wouldn't recommend engaging with any of it.

The game itself is very fun. It has a deep and complex combat system, a lot of customization of your in-game mercenary; with a myriad of armour choices, emblems, colours, the colour and texture of the metal, and only a few pieces of armour are only accessible through DLC. There are a ton of different weapons to choose from, from little knives to massive waraxes and polearms. Your mercenary is entirely your own; you can even play as a ranger, a support role with fire bombs, smoke bombs, or medic bags to help your team, or an engineer who builds fortifications and mobile spawn points. It has a lot of options in gameplay and it all feels relatively equal so long as you're fighting someone of the same skill as you.

There aren't very many maps, but they are very fun and all feel distinct from one-another.

The two main gamemodes are Frontline and Invasion. Frontline is a back and forth tug-of-war style game, where the team holding more objectives than the other drains the other teams point pool. 

Invasion is an attacker vs defender style game where one team must assault a series of objectives and the other must defend them. Invasion is fairly unique in that each map has new objectives to overcome in different ways, like pushing a battering ram to the enemy gates, burning down their village and killing the villagers, killing the enemy warlord, destroying the enemy water-wheels.

New content is released very, very slowly and in tiny batches. A single new map at a time, a few new pieces of armour and weapons, some bugfixes. 

It's not a welcoming game, it's not fun for the first 50-100 hours, it's toxic and the developers don't seem to have any clue it's happening or don't want to fix it. It has some very fun aspects, the combat, the customisation, the feel of the different game modes. In it's current state it's a dying game, it's not fun for a new player, and I doubt this will ever change. This game once had a peak player count of 60,000 yet the developers squandered the opportunity they were given, they've had years to take any measures to prolong the life of their game or improve the experience for new players and haven't.",1708209590,1708209590,False,44,0,0.736331045627593994,2,True,False,False

It can feel hopeless at the beginning, especially if you die over and over to experienced players. The learning curve is steep. I'd say it's a game where you have to invest a certain amount of hours before you can really enjoy it. Personally I like getting wrecked until I learn so that works for me. Huge + is the fact there's practically no grind. You have certain fixed characters you can play immediately and just unlocking weapons for your custom builds (called mercenaries in this game) cost very little. The only things that are ""expensive"" are some cooler looking armor pieces (but they have the same exact stats as the cheap/free armor pieces). So, it's a dope game mechanically, fun af, silly and with little to no grind required to get started.

Downsides are ping is on average a bit worse than most games but not unplayable by any stretch. 
The first couple of months I played most matches consisted of 65-80% high level players but it seems the game has been rejuvenated by an influx of newer players so it's a lot more fun and balanced matchmaking now.",1708081174,1708081174,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Even though it already has been released for 2 years now, it still has huge potential to flourish, if there wasn't the problem of a egomanic developer who is abusing his power and doing anything but listening to the community. 

Most official servers are full of sweaty tryhards or trolls, you can still find fun lobbies here and there but it's a pain in the ass for new players. 

Give it a try, if you have plenty of time on your hand to recognize improvements but this is what most skilled based competitve games are about nowadays. Easy to learn hard to master. 

edit: since my review it doesn't look like they have added anything significant, same problems prevail, I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone who doesn't have enough time on their hands or not great enough of a frustration threshold but I can't give it a bad review either, the concept is too good. 

2nd edit: The devs have abondened it and the causal player base is gone, safe your money and time. It was fun while it lasted. (7.4/10)",1639160466,1708078938,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I was looking forward to the PvE horde mode, but the enemy AI is soooooo bad, it feels very janky, like an early 2000's game.

compared to Chivalry 2, probably the most similar game on the market:
-Mordhau performance was good, smooth, quick loads

Mordhau isn't just a game; it's an immersive journey that delves into the depths of one's psyche. It's an emotional rollercoaster that can push you to the brink of frustration and beyond.

At times, it can make you feel utterly powerless, as if your very existence hangs in the balance. It's the kind of experience that might elicit expletives and slurs, echoing through the room at the top of your lungs, as if the game itself is testing not just your skills, but your patience and resilience.

But amidst the chaos and the seemingly insurmountable skill wall – more of a towering fortress, really – lies a revelation. Once you've scaled that wall through sheer determination and perseverance, you'll find that those ""sweats"" you once envied are human after all. They make mistakes, they falter, and you start to wonder when you'll achieve that level of consistency.

Yet, therein lies the crux of it all: the haunting question of ""when."" It's what drove me to write this review, fueled by a blend of resentment and masochistic desire. It's a paradoxical sentiment – hating the game I'm reviewing yet advocating for more to suffer as I have.

To those considering purchasing Mordhau, if you find yourself lacking ownership of the game, it's likely because you fear the depths of your own inadequacy. And if you dare to challenge this assertion with the naïve belief that gaming prowess translates seamlessly to Mordhau by saying ""iTs jUsT a viDeO gAmE im gOoD aT tHoSe"", I welcome the opportunity to prove you wrong in a 1v1 showdown.

In conclusion, while my journey through Mordhau has been fraught with moments of frustration and self-doubt, it has also been incredibly rewarding. The satisfaction of mastering its intricacies and competing against fellow players on a level playing field is unparalleled. So, if you're prepared to embark on a challenging yet ultimately fulfilling gaming odyssey, then Mordhau awaits. Just remember, it's not just a game; it's an experience that will test your limits and leave you craving more.",1707526665,1707545148,True,21,3,0.690414667129516602,2,True,False,False

It brands itself as a ""realistic"" swordfighting game, but that couldn't be any further from the truth.

Perhaps my biggest gripe is that almost every weapon is just so damn slow. Mordhau perpetuates the myth that medieval weapons were clunky, heavy and unwieldy. The swords are slow, the axes are slow, the spears are slow, the bows are slow, everything moves at a frustratingly glacial pace. Longswords were not slow weapons, they only weighed maybe five or six pounds at most - certainly not weightless, but light enough to, oh, I don't know, not encumber an already-armored knight?

Mordhau isn't a game of ruthless clashes and kinetic sword fights. It is all mindgames, all the way down. Obviously, nothing should be so fast as to be un-reactable, but everything moves so slow it's painful. Part of it is me - I'm not very good at this game, I admit, but missing a single parry and just knowing I'm about to be instantly killed by some douchenozzle with a maul is just... Not a good feeling. The massive skill divide between new/returning players and the kind of people who can rack up hour after hour every day on this game is teeth-grindingly frustrating, and you can't do anything about it without a massive time investment. This is less of a gripe with Mordhau specifically and more of an issue with this sort of game in general, since getting rid of the skill-based element would be antithetical to the design of Mordhau as a whole, but I digress.

For me, the most insulting part is that Mordhau demonstrates incredible technical prowess on the part of the developers. Everything looks and sounds so incredibly good, and I want to like this game, but I just can't. It's not fun and just reminds me of the original Chivalry with the amount of tomfoolery other players will pull on a regular basis. I feel confident in saying that this game is going to go the way of Chivalry (i.e. murdered by its own community) and is very close to the end of its life cycle.",1563031005,1707227602,False,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

The devs still want to try some new things, so there have been a lot of updates that changed some things, in my opinion, for the better. You also have some new game modes, etc.

I've been playing Mordhau since late 2019. Through it all, Mordhau has remained a go to game for me. I did not have any experience with Chivalry beforehand, nor do I care for Chivalry 2. I stumbled upon Mordhau as background footage for a Youtube video long forgotten to me, and I was intrigued. I accidentally purchased Chivalry first, and after quickly realizing it was the wrong game, I found Mordhau. 

There was (and still is) a skill wall, to be sure. It was not easy initially, and I remember struggling to even riposte. Even though I would get creamed by players who had been veterans of Chivalry and were dozens if not hundreds of levels above me, I still came back to this game. Why? That is a question you can answer yourself by sticking to the game and finding where it incites your own emotions. Perhaps you enjoy larping as an obese knight wearing completely black armor and slashing through enemies with a halberd, or you want to run around wearing naught but shorts and a hat smashing people's skulls in with a maul and screaming French insults left, right, and center, or maybe a support engineer who keeps the enemy at bay, or a filthy archer who knows not of the concept of grass nor showers. Whatever playstyle you want to achieve is likely doable in this game.

You will practically already know if youre going to like this game or not. It features a wide array of skill (and cheese) based attacks, and almost every single death in this game is due to a fault of your own. Each death is another learning experience, even if it is against the very same level 200+ no life Mordhau vets. It is incredibly frustrating at times, and incredibly rewarding at times. 

The community has remained relatively stable for the last year or so. Its nowhere near to the launch size, unfortunately, but this game is not dead yet. People are usually chill, and like to mess around a lot in chat and voice lines / emotes to the point where the psychological battle of chats and emotes is often half of the game. Only when you master the emote keybinds does one truly master Mordhau, or a part of it. 

Infrequent updates and sometimes shitty servers do need to be mentioned. This game came out nearly 5 years ago, and is likely being maintained by a skeleton crew. Regardless, even if there is not a whole lot of new content coming, the content that is here is good enough to be used and enhanced by the players. 

If you are picking up Mordhau, and you are new, stick with it. I've had some of the best laughs and adrenaline rushes from this game that very few other games can match. Even though you might not be able to kill anyone, there will always be someone open to help you get better, and you will get better with time. 

I hope this game continues to go as it is, Ive already lost a few rivals and friends who havent picked up this game in a long time, but to those who keep coming back, thank you for keeping Mordhau what it is -- a living medieval shitpost.",1633622823,1706572870,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

If you want customization, I am not sure there is a better game. There is plenty to do, and I have made a ton of characters that I really enjoy. From swiss guard, to a rapier duelist, to a peasant levy to a viking. All very fun.

However, an annoying thing is in any of the team play, I hate the automatic colors. Red/back vs white/blue. Unfortunately, it makes some of my knights look completely ridiculous or ahistorical (the ones I made as realistic as possible) and frankly, its just annoying. 

My next complaint is specific to 1v1 combat. Wider combat is such a brawl, it doesn't really matter, and its just good fun, however in 1v1s, there is a massive abuse of the animations. I really dont care win, lose since i play the game to have cool knights and swords clash but when a dude is staring at the ground or literally looking the other way so his sword hits at the perfect time and perfect angle, it really pulls you out of it. Not to mention, there is a clear discrepancy between what visually you see, and what the animation/hitbox does. There have been plenty of times i go to stab with a spear and visually it goes through the other persons face but because the opponent knows how to cheat the animations they stab me first despite not even touching me and my spear actively going through them. On top of that, with those janky animations, there sword or whatever wont even touch you, yet it ""hits"". 

Other than that, its a good game, I just wont recommend it because, really, as a new player, I didnt feel a skill-gap. I wouldnt say there is one, the mechanics arent terrible to learn. What the problem is, are these players that abuse the game animations to a degree that its nearly impossible to fight. ",1704830908,1706552007,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

With a combat system that's been flushed out over years of updates and dedicated work from the dev team you wont even with games like chivalry and for honor on the market,you wont find a game with combat and that feels this rewarding to learn and a community better then the Mordhau community. With a long list of different weapons that all play to different strengths and weaknesses and different armor sets offering varying levels of speed and protection to choose from you can really master combat the way you see fit. And to me the best thing about this game is the reward in the kill you cant get one shot sniped from a gun or someone camping once a 1v1 fight starts its a true measure of who is better at the game and who uses the weapon better. You can feel in the fight if you are better then someone if its a fair fight or if they out match you in skill leaving you struggling to hold on to your life. Its a text book definition of easy to pick up and have fun in but hard to master. Great game that has survived the years and multiple other medieval slashers trying to knock it off its throne but Mordhau remains undoubtedly the king of medieval combat games.


That being said I wouldn't be doing the game any justice if I didn't tell you the current state of the game as of 2024. I've played the game for years and would be considered by most a high skill player. This is a very high skill floor game in combat skills,that is currently mostly played by extremely high skill vets of the game and at the very least players who are far above the average casual or new player just picking up the game. These two factors combined can make for an extremely frustrating or seemingly unwelcoming environment for new players and that would be correct. Mordau always has been and always will be a labor of love kind of game. Its not easy but wow does that make the grind to get competitive feel both challenging and extremely fun, its a game where you are going to feel like you earned each kill through actually acquiring skill in a way few games can do.",1706458259,1706462682,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

The game has a highly complex (mostly) melee combat system allowing for a high skill ceiling and incredibly engaging battles. You get a wide range of weapons and armours in your arsenal so you’ll never run out of toys to play with. Your loadout is also highly customisable and besides a few DLC cosmetics you can unlock it all for free by just playing the game. You also get a character editor on par with the Sims, even if you’ll cover your genetic engineering with steel most of the time.

Besides brutal combat the game gives you plenty of emotes and voice lines for non-murderous player interaction, paired with a really fun community you're bound to have fun just messing around and not killing anybody. Some of the game mechanics can be a bit clunky but if anything they play into the comedy and I never find myself frustrated with them.

The only minor inconvenience is that, at least at the time of writing this review, the game is well past its prime and most of the remaining player base consists of dedicated sweaty bastards, so at first you will get your buttocks handed to you three times over before you make a dent in someone’s helmet.

          𝑭𝒓𝒐𝒏𝒕𝒍𝒊𝒏𝒆, 𝒕𝒉𝒊𝒔 𝒍𝒐𝒐𝒌𝒔 𝒍𝒊𝒌𝒆 𝒂 𝒈𝒐𝒐𝒅 𝒑𝒍𝒂𝒄𝒆 𝒕𝒐 𝒔𝒕𝒂𝒓𝒕. 
          You pick one of the standard classes since you're too broke to afford a decent loadout but decide that the ""knight"" class should suffice.
          Once spawned in, you are instantaneously met with a horseback enemy attempting to shove a giant lance up your 𝘢𝘴𝘴𝘩𝘰𝘭𝘦. Skillfully, you manage to dodge their attack with the somewhat-developed gamer reflexes you have already acquired. You make for the battle since you don't want to stick around and wait for the lance-wielding 𝚊𝚜𝚜 𝚏𝚞𝚌𝚔𝚎𝚛 to take another go at you. 
          Suddenly, your teammate on your left-hand side gets impaled by an arrow from a ballista and their body flies to the ground like a ragdoll. You quickly pay your respects and decide to keep on moving in order to avoid being the next supper for the rats that live here. Not much farther you encounter a horde of screaming dwarves sporting a pavise shield as skateboard.
          ""Dσԃɠҽ ƚԋιʂ ყσυ Ⴆαʂƚαɾԃ!!!"" They violently scream as they race across the battlefield.
          You're quite astounded by the mere sight of them but soon establish that they're not a threat to you. Suddenly your attention turns to a very obese knight dressed in shiny, golden armour wielding a hammer and casually crushing your teammates' heads. Rightfully frightened, you run around this alarming entity and are happily reminded that you've almost made it to the objective.
          You finally manage to arrive at the objective with some minor aid from your teammates and you all gather together and take point. 
          Without missing a beat you're struck by an arrow. You manage to quickly regain your senses and locate the cretin that shot you. It's a default archer! One of the most feared creatures in this game and additionally one of few main causes of mental agony. These hive-minded beings all share the same common goal, 𝓟𝓮𝓷𝓮𝓽𝓻𝓪𝓽𝓲𝓸𝓷.
          Because they lack skill they have chosen to hide behind their overpowered teammates in an attempt to be of any value to their team. Their training, which consists of only using a bow and arrow for a good 30 hours, have allowed them to have a certain expertise on the battlefield. Namely, only landing shots when you're mid-duel. 
          While under siege and duelling an opponent, one of the rat-bastards manages to land a headshot on your soft skull and you are swiftly thrown into an unending coma. You try to process what just happened the past two minutes and decide that you need to quit the game in order to recharge your brain and reacquire the will to live.

TLDR: don't be fooled by all the negative comments and reviews about Mordhau. It's truly a wonderful game that has been intricately designed. There is something enjoyable for everyone. From competitive one-on-one duels to beheading people to using a lute and playing any song you like.

it takes a few years for the community as a whole to discover and pick up these exploits (and general skill), at which rate the game inches towards its expiration. the sweatiest of players dominate, the higher skill players begin to feel tedium, the middling skill players start to get frustrated, and the lowest skill players feel compelled to quit entirely

going further on from this point, these sentiments shift up from each rung of skill, stagnating the growth of middle and high class players and shutting off more and more of the general playerbase. there's no big dramatic event or public outcry that kills a game like this, but a slow and eventual rot

i absolutely loved mordhau, but it's almost an entirely different experience now. if you don't have the time and patience needed to treat learning mordhau like learning an actual art or skill, it's barely worth it. even still, the exploit riddled highest tier techniques in the endgame have already driven away many of the greatest, most well known players

for example, i saw 3 newbie cheaters coming back consistently rage hacking over 6 months and still hasn't been banned (they were rage hacking with seemingly unlimited stamina, no cd penalty for failed parry, modified windup time and feint-able time window, auto-parry, etc) and that's probably is just actual newbie with cheat, someone with some experience with the game trying to hide it is a lot harder to prove or spot.

reporting closet cheaters will result in realizing the mods are incompetent and unable to spot inhuman mouse movement, lock on that most players i sent videos to can spot. They will then proceed to gaslighting you and said you spreading misinformation and mute you while your 4 days old tickets has no one looked at while 4 different mods are sending memes in general discord chat.

a quick google for how often people meet cheater in mordhau in 2022 resulting in more sites selling cheat than people still actually care and update about the current state of the game for the developers.

as for balancing, the game is in a decent state right now except for some weapon that is just simply way too good compare to the rest for both accel/drag, you prob will see every sweat hold a greatsword and spam combo-to-feint-parry

as long as you don't take the game too seriously and having a group of friends to mess around with, the game is still solid at it core.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and we adopted our son together. Both are now 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I felt lost and unhappy. I was self-destructive. One day, I was so angry with everything spiraling out of control that I punched a concrete wall in a moment of overwhelming emotion. This resulted in breaking my fifth metacarpal in my right hand—the hand I worked with, played games with, and used to carry my children to bed—the hand I desperately needed to ensure I could continue providing.

Upon learning the severity of the self-inflicted damage, I became almost suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man, with no history of depression or anxiety. I had never experienced anger outbursts, nor was I the type to break down and cry, but I was in a tough situation that truly prevented me from seeing the light on the other side.

With nothing better to do, I looked for a game I could play WITH ONE HAND while recovering. Somehow, I stumbled upon this game and read some of the comments. I decided it was worth a try... I must admit I didn't beat the game, nor did I play as much as some of you. In fact, I may have played this game for only a day or two. That being said, after doing so, I had a new joy and hope for life. I managed to leave behind the pain and suffering that had been thrust upon me. I could experience the joy and happiness of other people. I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ minutes listening to this music, long enough to realize that I would be okay.

After realizing this, I turned off the game and went back to work. My hand hurt a lot, but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so sorry for myself and became the father I needed to be at that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving like.

Today, I am close friends with the mother of my children. We don't fight, argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents and friends.

Now I have 3 children. My third child is, wait, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my separation, and we just unexpectedly stumbled into each other's lives. We have been dating for a year and are very happy together.

Moral of the story: you never know what life has in store for you, and if I had given up when all odds were against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Mordhau has easily the most competent, incredible-feeling, refined combat of any first person slasher available right now. But where it falls flat is that the game just isn't fun for the casual player, and has nothing to offer to them. If you're a casual player and want to play PVP, you're basically bullied into frustration until you decide to abandon casual play and seriously try to improve.

The game is extremely execution-based, skill-based. It demands hundreds of hours from you before you even begin being able to hold your own against the majority of the current active player base. This is partly because of Mordhau's terrible on-boarding that's out of touch and insufficient with the current state of play, and partly because of how the developer support from Triternion has been awful, causing only the most dedicated players to stick around. Few yet somehow still lackluster updates, zero competitive support, questionable-at-best balance, all problems that stack up over the five years this game has been alive.

No matter how good swing manipulation feels in this game, no matter how fun it is, it doesn't matter. Dragging is innovative, but still niche. It will NEVER be intuitive, nor will it ever be a mainstream-compatible core game mechanic.

Mordhau is on a slow decline, and if the last couple updates have said anything, this isn't changing anytime soon. From a player who has wasted nearly 2,000 hours on this game, reaching the third highest rank Elite 3: unless for some divine reason you are REALLY compelled to, do not buy this game.",1615695270,1705191023,False,0,0,0,6,True,False,False

  It was a fun game. I wish that the game devs were still passionate about this game. I felt that it had great potential, as there was nothing else quite like it, but content releases were few and far between. I hear that Totenwald, the most recent release, would be one of their last. I almost wish they would hand their game to some of their top fans to keep things going.
  If it's multiplayer hacking and slashing you want with high skill precision, I can't think of another game aside from chiv that scratches the same itch. It's a difficult game to master, but once you do it can feel almost godlike to be top score with 74 kills and under 20 deaths. Trouble is, you need a long time before you can get that good, a shame since the game is slowly crumbling.
  The game feels responsive, clean, and sometimes a little janky with animation abuse.
  If you're looking for a game with the same addictive potency as crack cocaine, play this game. Just ask one of the game's devs Crush, he's done both.
Just keep the chat box off if you're a sensitive soul. The amount of toxicity that can exist out there is akin to a sewage truck in Dubai. Other times it's full of some shitpost or another.
  For any newbies I recommend throwing on heavy armor, a two handed weapon, and be as aggressive as cocaine bear. It's better to be offensive than defensive in this game, and learn to chamber, it will be important. Bloodlust and Fury are a really good pair of perks once you get good at fighting multiple opponents at once. Try to be as unpredictable as you can, best way to catch people off guard. Pretending to be mentally impaired works too I find.
  Don't be an archer unless you can handle a good hazing. Nobody likes an archer in this game.

Rather than feel like you're actually swinging a weapon it feels more like limp arm failing it around, as if you're just giving it a little push and letting the weapons weight swing itself.

On top of the combat the tutorial does not teach you anything useful, something the community widely agrees on, given that this game just has a wide array of ways to abuse combat, parries and chambers are practically useless. An example would be that you see a swing coming from the right so you parry to the right, should work right? well no actually, because someone can just flick their mouse up and down to go over your parry and back down to land a hit, perfectly fair right?
Some players may offer to help you learn, but by the time you begin learning you will genuinely ask yourself why in the hell a game needs dedicated lessons on teaching you how to fight.
surely you can look up some video tutorial to better explain the mechanics? not exactly, there is a plethora of guides out their telling you how they play, and ultimately you'll understand about jack sht of what they're telling you. Some go as far as to pulling up code and animation hitboxes tell you not to focus on the weapons but to judge attacks based on a players head direction.

In short it's to much headache for a minute dopamine scratch, if a game is going to require some BS form of studying then what is the point. It's sad because I like look of the game and it has decent moments but is ultimately ruined by a needless complexity, followed by poor management of developers.",1684529009,1704864192,False,1,1,0,0,True,False,False

- Cool combat system, its very easy to get ""immersed"" in the game because you have more liberty to do what you want with your body.

- A lot of good moments like horses getting swung in the air, dwarves running around screaming and getting decapitated, a horseback bard giving dramatic music to a random duel he found.

- Cool maps with interesting terrain and weather, there is no repetition between maps, except castles but whos the idiot whos gonna complain about that.

- Good customization and the XP needed to unlock most cool customization items isnt too high, so you can get pretty cool stuff even if youre level 40

- Good weapon and tool variety

- Skill based balance, if you dont wanna die get good, sure theres maybe a few unbalanced things, but it aint as worse as in other games.

Cons :

- RNG based team balancing, leading to one sided match 3/4 of the time. Although the 1/4th of the time is fun. dunno why this is still a problem in a lot of games like this.

- A very small flow of new players, and a low current playercount, leading to most us servers being half full and a longer waiting time for quickplay. (sometimes)

- A very uneducative tutorial, which later on forces you to invest time to watch youtube videos or die a thousand times to high level players just to learn stuff, both are fine, just annoying that you get sent to battle without knowing anything actually relevant.

- Unbalanced maps, some maps have certain points where if the other team has the smallest amount of intelligence, it will become real hard to defeat them.

- Theres no real incentive to play the game at higher levels, in other games you unlock weapons, vehicles, skins, bla bla bla, but in this game, it pretty much stops at lvl 50. Tbh I feel like after that point, il need to force myself to play the game cause there wont be any incentive to continue.

- servers are so bad

- Even though I feel there was a lot of love going into the game, I feel like theres still so much missing to make it unique and become its own thing.

- Modders have made arcade game mods that were really good, but they never got into the base game.

- Game died 2 months after it came out, now its on life support

= all that aside =

its a real fun game, just cant bring myself to actually like it.",1703708956,1704480147,False,0,0,0.462365597486495972,0,True,False,False

Here are the only positive things going for this game:
-Horde mode is alright gameplay wise, but your team will suck ass and will throw.
-Lutebot exists, and it is the only fun thing in any mode that isn't horde. It's fun in horde too. Actually it's just fun in general and worth buying the game for, but only if the game is on a huge sale.
-Character customization is fantastic and still some of the best I've ever seen in my life.

NOW FOR THE NEGATIVES.
-Extremely toxic community
-Repetitive gameplay
-Negligent developers
-More bugs than in the African wilds
-HORRIBLE hitboxes
-PACKET LOSS
-PACKET LOSS
-PACKET LOSS
-PACKET LOSS
-You'll often be votekicked without warning for usually no reason, again because of the toxic community
-Duel servers rarely ever have fair 1v1s going on, it is almost always just FFA and RDM
-The RP servers are gone
-Old horde was better than new horde, but new horde is still okay but old was great
-Battle Royale is gone
-Almost everything is gone
-The devs are openly racist on their own public Discord server

Don't buy this unless it's on like, 90% off clearance. Good for a laugh but that's the only positive emotion it can evoke if you don't take pleasure in self-mutilation.",1562732727,1704429910,False,0,0,0,5,True,False,False

The main emphasis in Mordhau is on a flexible combat system that allows you to cut up the enemy in different ways and defend against attacks. The assortment includes a variety of two-handed and one-handed axes, swords, axes and polearms, etc. d. If you get bored of cutting down enemies while standing on your own two feet, then you can saddle a horse or use ballistas and catapults."" - what people think.

In my opinion Mordhau, this is something similar in the Middle Ages in the periods 1300-1500, then there were very big battles and clashes of thousands of armies, but under our control it became a very fun game where you can duel or go through survival modes, even a jester playing the flute represents a very big threat, like a knight in medium armor and a sword in his hands.

I really like playing Mordhau, so I’ll try to play it more often and buy beautiful add-ons, they make very beautiful armor!

Everything is too expensive, or the winnings too little.. people in heavier armor than you can pretty much constantly outrun you due to the ""chase mechanic"", a 2 handed attack can be interrupted half way with a punch by some random peasant in rags. This is exasperated as enemy bots take turns at hitting you, which puts you in a constant state of ""flinching"". Smoke seems to impact only you as the enemy can still hit you accurately though it, and the usual rock/arrow/turd/axe spam means you will be pretty much showered with projectiles immediately.

 + smoother, better gameplay compared to Chivalry 1, more fighting options like channeling, alternate weapon modes, blocking projectiles, disarming enemies and bringing them to fall, no bs 720° helicoptermoves
 + gory dismemberment and flying heads
 + thrash your enemies with lutes, pitchforks and frying pans and throw dung at them
 + very few bugs, rarely one can get stuck in objects though
 + tons of weapons and armor full of options to modify and customize, emphasis on historical authentic looks
 + many different gestures and calls
 + nice soundtrack

 - The blocking system is the same as in Chivalry 1, which means you can only block for a fraction of a second. This is neither realistic nor fun imo, Chivalry 2 has a much better blocking system and adds some new mechanics, such as holding/charging attacks.
 - The amount of levels is meager, although the layout and the verticality are better than the maps of Chivalry 2. Still, the devs are indredibly slow to release new content and without the help of modders, the game would probably soon have lost a big chunk of the playerbase.
 + Speaking of, the mod support is one thing that makes the game stand out compared to Chiv 2. Some people made astonishing LotR-themed maps for the Horde mode and I sunk maybe 90% of my time into the Horde maps, since co-op is far more enjoyable to me than the sweaty frontline or invasion modes.

Verdict: Mordhau, like Chivalry 1 & 2, is a fun hack n slash game with emphasis on multiplayer. While it is better in almost every aspect compared to Chivalry 1, gameplay-wise it is a mixed bag compared to Chivalry 2. The main advantages to its rival is the full mod support, Horde mode and the historically authentic looking armor and weapons, while overall I prefer the fighting system of Chivalry 2.",1558368740,1703508340,True,2,0,0.546525299549102783,0,True,False,False

Mordhau is a ​first person medieval fighting game with a small community of addicted players who ​keep the competitive side going to this day. The game itself has little to offer, ​essentially abandoned by the developers to pursue Chivalry 2 more (other than the ​odd addition of a new weapon). The casual community has all but died. There are still ​game modes like skirmish which house large scale battles, but the player base for this ​is diminishing over time.

However the main thing to discuss is the unique community of high-end players which ​have developed in the custom servers. The game works off a camera-based drift ​system, essentially moving sword in the direction the camera goes. This system is ​surprisingly flexible in it’s use, allowing for difficult to perform mechanics which can ​outmatch other players. Examples of this are the “wessex” which involved moving the ​sword above the player’s block collision box before dropping down on their head ​(most definitely an exploit in practice) , the “excel” which involves moving the camera ​so you don’t even see the player, making the swing hit them instantly the moment the ​animation starts. It is this exploit heavy combat system which a small community of ​players have used to revive the game. The before mentioned techniques are ​significantly beyond the skill of casual/intermediate players, and require an equally ​good read from the recipient in order to counter.

This community has created an entirely separate game than was intended through ​these exploits, in which instead of doing the Battlefield style onslaughts of the normal ​game modes, they instead reside in private servers and do team or solo duels (known ​as FT10's) for money or prizes. Of all the games I have played I have never experienced ​such a nuanced community within a game, who are so devoted to this style of ​gameplay that their tournaments and group funded competitions keep the game from ​dying. There is also a sense of Celebritiism amongst the more skilled players, who ​instead of getting legitimate fame in the in-game ranked system, are famous amongst ​this community for being able to perform harder techniques than others. This ​community isn’t without it’s problems though, as the lack of attention from the ​developers has caused a completely unmonitored way of talking within the game, ​promoting a large amount of hate speech and discrimination which is just accepted at ​this point.

Overall Mordhau is a game which despite the neglect of developers, has been truly ​transformed by the community into what is one of the most interesting and difficult ​fighting systems of any game I have played. If you haven’t tried it before, I encourage ​you to try it just to experience what a truly large skill gap is like in a game, because if ​you make it to the top like I did you feel that you have discovered a unique skill so far ​beyond the comprehension of other players. That being said the game itself is dull, ​and with the dying casual player base combined with it’s toxic community, it is a game ​which only attracts those who want to experience what it’s like to be a master at their ​respective game. The community is a blessing and a curse but ultimately saves this ​game from being long forgotten.

It is well made, polished, and very smooth. The optimization on some maps is lacking a little, but for the most part, the game runs well and the mechanics are incredibly fluid. I'd recommend this game to anyone looking to get more out of a fighting game. If you liked Chivalry, you will probably love this game.

Update: The meta slaves have ruined the game. If you're new, don't play on duel servers. You will be killed over and over without any remorse, and you will be subject to the most broken animations in the game. The ""best"" players at this game aren't the best because they have quick reactions, good footwork or even good game sense. The ""best"" are at the top because they understand how to use the broken animations to their advantage. You will be hit with a sword, that from your angle, is not moving, and it will deal damage as if it hit you at full speed.

The game is plagued by no-lifes who play only to abuse the animations. And thats unfortunate, because this game used to be super fun and at least slightly balanced. If you run into anyone above level 200, or even worse, someone who hides their true level with the ""unranked"" icon, just find a new server.

All in all, this game used to be worth a buy. Now, unless you are extremely patient, and can handle no-life sweats using animation glitches, just avoid it. Two years ago? This was the best game on steam. Unfortunately, meta slaves have a way of ruining every game they play.

Furthermore, meta slaves will whine and complain if you use the built-in feint function. They will cry about ""gambling"" because they are incapable of reading your attacks. Do not listen to them. Kill by any means necessary. The meta slaves deserve to be banned for ruining such a wonderful game with their bad attitudes and oversized egos.

Update 2: Meta slaves have ruined the game. Can no longer recommend this game in its current state. The community was once fun and diverse. It is now pretty much exclusively meta slaves. Hope they make another game like this. The animation abuse meta has run this game into the ground unfortunately.

Review as of ~100 hours:
Objectively better than Chivalry in that it has a larger player base, a slightly better combat system, and current development. Objectively fails in that it accommodates and encourages players to abuse obvious bugs, weakly programmed mechanics, and map flaws - which the devs only attempt to hide with patches, rather than address. Players often ""teleport"" on high ping, hitboxes are overly broad (watch this ax swing by, but  - woops - turns out he's hit), animation delays (especially with cavalry unit) make play unnecessarily difficult. Players of some merit or creativity often resort to the same nonsensical tactics as in Chivalry, ie swinging mouse wildly to rotate 180 degrees so my sword hits you on draw, instead of strike. Team balance is left to players, and there is no punishment for dodging matches, which often leads to one-sided games unless players happen to assign themselves judiciously. Weapon system feels balanced, but range and hitboxes, and the silent ""drag"" and ""accel"" features do not, but instead encourage the very kind of nonsense people despise other games of this category for. It's like someone made a lazy Chivalry 1.5.
No customer support, no in-game reporting for abusive behavior (other than temporary 10 minute kick).  Tutorial is lacking, too - they should have just made a readme file. I've witness some level 200 players abuse ""reporting"" system (email an admin, have him join game, provoke an enemy into saying f****t, etc.), and getting people banned.

From the moment I entered its battlefield, I was mesmerized by the sheer intensity and complexity of combat.

What truly sets Mordhau apart is its combat system, which feels both realistic and rewarding. The freedom to wield weapons in a variety of ways allows for endless tactical possibilities. Whether engaging in intense one-on-one duels, chaotic team battles, or sieges, every swing of the sword feels impactful and skill-based.

The customization options are staggering, offering players the ability to create their own unique warriors. From armor and weaponry to character appearance, the level of detail and personalization is impressive, allowing players to truly embody their ideal medieval fighter.

The game's maps are beautifully crafted, each offering diverse landscapes and strategic advantages. The attention to historical accuracy in architecture and weaponry adds an extra layer of immersion to the already captivating gameplay.

Mordhau's community is vibrant, fostering a sense of camaraderie and competition. The developers' dedication to updates and improvements showcases a commitment to refining an already stellar experience.

For enthusiasts of medieval combat and multiplayer mayhem, Mordhau is an absolute gem.

This game is extremely punishing for new players because the tutorial teaches so little about the game that most of the higher-skill moves feel like exploits. I can only play co-op and single-player because matches are so hilariously one-sided due to shit player balancing. Who actually thinks having 14 level 200s on one team and none on the other is fair? Very fun game but not in PVP modes.

The character customization is the only reason I come back to this game at this point, and even that is a tedious grind because you have to get shit on repeatedly in PVP, grind out the horde mode, or host your own server if you want to not deal with the no-lifers. Singleplayer gives you no gold and no progression on achievements",1702577531,1702577580,False,38,5,0.681219279766082764,0,True,False,False

I would love to say that this game received amazing post launch content and that the devs listened to community feedback, however this is not the case.
I cannot recommend you purchase Mordhau if you desire the fully fledged multiplayer experience they advertise on the tin, there are usually 10-20 players in OCE servers on weekdays, a far cry from the packed large scale servers of the past. These servers are usually duel servers which for seasoned players are engaging enough, however for new players you will find nothing but frustration, as the game does little to explain its detailed combat mechanics, and you will have your a** handed to you again and again, until you put through an early refund.

This game for a long time was a favourite. I truly thought this was the multiplayer game I'd be jamming for the next 5-10 years, however, with its lack of players due to the sheer lack of post launch content, the devs underwhelming choices around combat mechanics that drove away the majority of serious competitive players, this game has all but died.

Save your money, unless 1v1 duels with people with hundreds of hours more than you sounds like fun. The true large scale multiplayer battle experience that made this game popular is dead, at least in OCE, and it’s dying everywhere else. These duel servers are not good for new players, this isn’t a ""skill issue"" moment, it would be like playing counter strike 2, but where the only gamemode available would be 1v1s, with the only players you could queue against being MGE+ ranked players, sound fun?

Do I think the game is bad? No.
Do I think you should spend your money on it? No.

However, I am one bow death away from giving this shit a negative review. Bows are by far the worst addition to this otherwise amazing game, they have no place here. 

You could argue that they added it since it does fit the theme and is historically accurate, but then they added women. So if we're no longer historically accurate, expel these bows please kind devs.

It is the most infuriating thing when you're holding your own against a 3 enemies with an interesting mix of weapons, you kill 2, you have 1 on the ropes, then boom, you've been shot by an archer, or even worst, a fucking friendly archer who was aiming for the last guy you were going to kill anyway.

It's skill ceiling is very high, and for the first 30ish hours of gameplay you will just die over and over again. It's not at all welcoming to new players, and as tempting as it is for newer players to only used ranged weapons as a crutch, I would highly recommend sticking with melee weapons. Over time, you'll learn how to identify incoming attacks, your perception will improve and everything will finally click together. Once you pass the ""I no longer suck ass at the game"" threshold, it's the most enjoyable and engaging BTB PvP game ever. 

If you enjoy competitive and challenging PvP games, Mordhau is great. If you don't, and want to focus on RP or more party style gameplay, try Chivalry 2, as it's similar, but I've heard it's a lot easier to learn.

""The best game for moment-to-moment combat. I can cosplay as a gnome and beat people to humiliating death with a pan. Maps suck but the community will fix this with Chivalry map ports.

Update: There's good maps now, and an unofficial SDK. Still need a proper, official SDK so the modding community can really take off.

Update 2: You can now play as dwarfs, hobbits, and giants. I upgrade my 10/10 to 11/10

Update 3: Game sucks now. It was ruined when they put in swing slowdown for misses, but in general they have degraded and worsened the swordplay with every update. I genuinely want 1.0 back. It's better. Also, the SDK came far too late. The game is a stinky bog that didn't develop how it needed to develop. Oh and it's being filled with DLC as well; something the game was kickstarted with the promise of not doing. Garbage developers.

kinda turns into: biggest one hit weapons with the longest drags are the best to use. gets hella annoying and can sorta bring your desire to play down quite exponentially.


edit: 12/7/2020 - eh. its a hollywood fighting game. it doesnt have any real technique other than some alternate weapon holds. otherwise its all hollywood esq fighting. long/2h weapons go through walls with no adverse effects while 1h or short weapons get blocked by walls. pretty much makes 1h weapons useless.

Starting as a new player would be extremely difficult at times and downright frustrating.

The 32-64 player modes are fun and the PvE horde mode is fun too. The most fun comes when playing with friends or the few players you meet along the way that don't take it too seriously.

Two easy fixes for this game would be:
1.  Run damage output by swing time.   If someone prioritises the drag mechanic *exploit* that was *never* intended to be in the game, then their prolonged swing will reduce damage based on each millisecond that swing travels without connecting with an enemy.   

2.  Remove the sensitivity option and force players to play.  The sensitivity in this game dictates your ability to play.  If someone has maxed out sensitivity then their drags and accels are far more effective than those that play with a more moderate sensitivity and this dynamic between players forces those that dislike high sensitivity in to a bad experience of game play by forcing them to play as such against players that exploit every loophole mechanic.

These are simple fixes.  *Simple Fixes* and the Devs won't do anything to fix it, and it's a shame because if they had just done so then this game could have been the go-to for medieval warfare games.

Melee mechanics are a steep learning curve, even with a tutorial, but just keep practicing and eventually it will click. Took me about 200 hours of getting slayed to finally feel competitive and freed from the safety net of using a bow. The bow is great fun but can get boring after awhile. Playing countless games of Horde mode and watching seasoned players wreck the AI gave me some pointers and helped me learn some of the basics. I still consider myself pretty new, with 264 hours as of this review.

The outfits and customization is just amazing. I love that the weapons are basic. No damage altering perks or BS OP perk system. This is not your typical ranking system. You earn your weapons by playing a lot and affording to buy them with the in-game currency. Plain and simple but brilliant. Once you unlock a weapon and purchase it with the in-game currency, it's yours forever and can use it on any game mode (minus horde mode where you have to scavenger for weapons and armor). 

No BS micro transactions with real world currency and it feels amazing to buy and unlock pimped out armor and weapon skins. The music is out of this world and just amazing. It suites the atmosphere and along with the battlecrys, there's a huge sense of immersion into that era. The castles and detailed layout are fantastic. Spawn camping is not a thing since gay camping archers only deal 1 point of damage to spawned players. It's like the devs wanted to remind the CoD type spawn campers to grow some balls and focus on the battle.

Everything seems pretty well balanced and the learning curve, although steep, is highly rewarded for gaining experience and mastery of the game. It's a good 1 to 1 ratio of the better you get, the more you enjoy the game. 

Only negative is I wish it didn't consume so much of my life :D

Буду писать отталкиваясь от опыта игры в режиме HORDE, ибо в PvP я увидел в основном стариканов, которые наиграли в это игру 12 миллионов часов и умеют уворачиваться от ударов убрав руки от клавиатуры. SteamCHARTS говорит что на 25.11.2023 в игре 24 часовой пик онлайна 1901 человек. Игра откровенно мертва и равного себе противника в PVP не пытайтесь искать. 

[h2]Графика, звуки[/h2]
Графен тут есть, глаза не вытекают, на 3050 тянет на высоких-ультрах. Больше сказать нечего.
Звуки: Мечи дзинькают, рыцари кольчугой и доспехами звякают. Персонажи орут не отполированным идеальным английским, а как положено, с акцентом, но всё же можно было лучше.

[h2]Gayмплей[/h2]
Как уже писал выше, играл в основном в horde, а значит и писать буду только про horde:
Основная суть режима: вырезать толпы бомжей и бронированных бомжей, и не дать им запинать Барона.
Каждая волна представляет себя несколько толп, идущих с разных сторон. С каждой волной бомжи становятся злее и сильнее, кроме того у них есть гиганты, медленные но очень больно бьющие. 
За каждую отбитую волну вы получаете очко для прокачки и валюту. За валюту вы покупаете оружие, броню и снабжение(гранаты, инструменты и метательное оружие). За каждый матч дают деньги, за которые можно покупать скины экипировки персонажа.

[h2]Моё любимое: о проблемах[/h2]
Первая и самая главная проблема режима horde: кучкование. Бичи кучкуют тебя, бьют все быстро и поочередно и в итоге ничего ты сделать не можешь, ибо все твои атаки отменяются из за большого входящего урона.
Вторая, не менее важная проблема: Нереальная медлительность. Все боты разной степени вооруженности и защищенности бьют быстрее даже прокачанного игрока. Гораздо быстрее. И это при том что их целая толпа.
Боты: Тяжелый рыцарь в режиме хорд, который считается мини-боссом, невероятной степени конченый. Убить его 1 на 1 не возможно. При всей его тяжести в весе, он бегает быстрее игрока, бьет быстрее и больнее чем игрок. А защищаться от его атак вообще нет смысла, ибо даже так урон проходит. 

[h3]А каков итог?[/h3]
В целом попытка - не пытка, но есть проблемы, которые исправить было бы хорошо, но нет смысла ибо игра мертва. SteamCHARTS прекрасно доказывает это.",1671964976,1700898162,False,1,0,0.518072307109832764,0,True,False,False

Trolls have found a way to cheese the $#@$% out of the weapon animations allowing them to accelerate their swings to a pathetically ridiculous speed, taking all the fun out of the game. You shouldn't have to resort to taking advantage of a game mechanic in order to get a kill but unfortunately most of the player base has done just that. There's accelerating and dragging which is great, then there is whatever the fu$k people are doing these days swinging swords and polearms like they're a god da%^ blender.

1. The game has incredibly beautiful graphics. This is certainly a huge achievement.
2. The fencing mechanics are quite tolerable for a game, but they are very complex. Until you play 100 hours on practice maps, everyone will kill you. Once again, everyone will kill you, even the dwarfs with the frying pan. And this, believe me, is very annoying. In addition, as a professional historian and teacher of fencing (rapier, saber and longsword), the game's fencing is far from being true to reality, as is most of the equipment.

Well, with another 1500 hours played since my last review, I think its safe to say I like this game. Is it perfect? No, far from it. It has a brutal learning curve, you need to be willing to put many hours in before you can compete well. The community can be toxic at times. There are some genuinely cool people on here so its not all bad, but you will read some nasty stuff in the chat. But if you let it, this game will have you coming back again and again.   

[h2]Original Review[/h2] 

~Mordhau is a fantastic Melee combat game. As someone who enjoyed Chivalry but ultimately found it massively frustrating, Mordhau manages to succeed where Chivalry failed. For one all the spinning BS from Chiv isn't present here. It makes the encounters feel much more skill based. The skill ceiling is huge, which can lead to the problem of some players being far more skilled than others, myself included. But I rarely feel cheated by the game. If I get killed it's on me, and if I win fight its also on me. If you are a fan of this style of game, you really should check this one out.~",1568897629,1700685835,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

THE PROBLEMS:
In my case, after changing the language (seems like the devs automatically choose the language for you based on your location and forget to consider that there are many english speakers around the globe) the screen suddenly turned green. After almost one hour and a re-installation process  I was able to solve it but my dissapointment came back while trying to matchmake (same reasons from other reviewers) and finally, the lag issues. I was really excited to play this game and hopefully the devs will solve these problems soon. Until that time I -sadly- have to recommend to wait a couple of weeks until it is fixed.

UPDATE:


They gave me 10,000 gold so I guess we are even now.


PS. Most of the issues (the main ones) have been fixed already . (9/10)

Now its not even a shadow of its former being, its a laggy shitfest with manchild moderators who seek to only ban and mute and slander the good folk of Mordhau.
The servers have been downgraded and you can really feel it in the gameplay it was built and balanced with the previous servers performance, not this janky dogshit 

Buy this game if you want: 
- fights with cheaters on thousands of epic accounts they gave away for free
- FPS stutters due to poor game optimisation 
- bad updates including crap poorly lit maps
- fights with players with ping like as though they are playing from burger king wifi hotspot (but they are in mcdonalds) 
- experience mod abuse by absolute manchild types of people who should never be mod in a game 


Never playing this game again

The major problem this game has is that knowing how to accel, drag and how to counter them is the only thing that separates the good players from the bad players and it's a shame because if minor balancing had been done, new players wouldn't leave thinking the skill gap is too high and old players wouldn't leave realizing that there's nothing else to actually improve on. This wasn't an issue when the game was first released because there were casual people like cosplayers and people who just played for fun but now with Chivalry 2 and other competitors, many old and new players have just left this game, leaving only the old hardcore players on the game but they are also slowly getting tired and leaving the game.

1. There is an obscenely high skill cielling. Much of the fighting in this game comes down to abusing animation frames. I.E. Your character is still blocking but the actual block has ended.
2. Weapon fluff. I feel like there is very little value in the weapon variety. Many of the same weapons don't even seem to be consistent with how vastly different many of them seem in speed and damage output. One minute your polehammer is slow, but the next you get combo'd by someone with the exact same gear as you in about five seconds.
3. Teamwork. Teamwork is seemingly nonexistent on your team and abundant with your enemy. Many are likely in  highly organized parties, so be warned. You will be ganked. You will be cornered. You will be smacked by your own team.
4. Vehicle spawn is often seemingly unbalanced and only benefits your enemy.
5. Team unbalancing. There should be a balancing system based on K/D rather than level. You can be trash at the game like me and still progress, hence why they should implement better ways of balancing teams.
6. Armor is almost useless and doesn't offer more than a few extra hitpoints.

Upon release there had never been a more graphically or technically appealing melee combat game, a game that, despite its host of bugs and oddities, was among the most polished Medieval gaming experiences ever. 

MORDHAU's decline was, without a doubt, due to its developers, whose creative bankruptcy and lack of professional discipline allowed their groundbreaking title to slowly die. With what many people believe to be its last update, MORDHAU ended on a sour note: one last map for the community to play around in with no concrete hope of the game's future. 

I put over 2100 hours into this game. I've played since launch. I've been there every step of the way.

OG review

So, this is a Review, coming from a Person who has always had a Cheap Internet Connection, i.e., I've always played with Lag.  And this game is heavily focused on Competitive Online Gaming.  

Compared to playing Call of Duty with Lag, where a bullet can travel in less than a second across the map and end your play, Mordhau is Superior.  Even at 120-Ping and Higher, I can throw Spears, fire the Catapult, Balista, toss a few Fire Bombs...Troll Around with an old Lute and Bust some Sweet Licks...There is so much to do, even if you are initially too poor, or live in a Poor Internet Area...It's SO MUCH FUN, and I can't stop LMAO...seriously, this is Gold.  For anyone who is fairly lonely, and just wants to hear the cries of a 50 other Lonely dudes at 2am in the Morning...THIS GAME IS FOR YOU!!!    

But seriously, I've been able to Duel a crowd of 3 successfully, because even with Lag, you can Faint, you can sorrta Parry, but if you get that First Strike in there, you stand a chance of Morphing or Faking them out.  COD can kiss my hairy scrotum.",1571535558,1698886215,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

The last update is a joke, its content is really, really bad, not to say we waited nearly 9 months for...one map, one armor set...and another armor set behind a paid DLC.
The optimization is missing, they bragged about their ""new rain"" on Totenwald...shit is legit a fix jpeg on the armors (really, test it yourself) and the super duper rain halves your fps.

And lately, the mods and admins showed that they just don't give a shit about it anymore and started playing on public servers. There's no problem with that, truly, but when they start giving fireweapons (which aren't available at all under normal circumstances) to themselves and eventualy to their friends...shit starts to go sideways.
I asked Chris P Bacon (who was giving firearms on Totenwald) to stop, because the entire lobby was either leaving or raging, dude answered ""no, it's fun"", but then others started to tell him to stop, and after killing all of our team, he left.

The best thing is though, that the mods who do this then start recording either theirs or other's gameplay with the firearms, and they go and brag about it on the game's discord.

devs treat this game like it's free to play trashwarez
game has so many cheaters
autoblock, aimbot, speed, invulnerable, and wallhacks
filling this guy with arrows not missing any shots and having the server TELL ME (dealing 25+25+60+60+25) he should already be dead...
but there he is taking his time looking at the ground, picking something up, walking a straight line over a table, and he will hit me one time killing me then the battle recap shows he has full health.
all the while i shot him with 7 arrow from a longbow.

and everything i previously bitched about is still the same, except they added a stamina bar... but it's always fucking full.

update 11/4/2020
the game is dead.
there are no decent servers.
and everything i have previously bitched about remains the same,  with the exception of attacking now drains stamina or something.

_____________________
i thought if i gave it enough time and learn how to play that i would eventually come to enjoy whatever there is to be enjoyed.

but the more i learn how to play the less fun it becomes
i've never had even a moment of enjoyment from this game.

 there are cheats in teh game, but the worst part is that the community would rather be toxic and vote kick ANYBODY OTHER THAN THE ACTUAL CHEATER

but im not even gonna rage post about players on horses riding baaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaack and forth across the map ALL game long just colliding with other players..
and even be willing to teamkill just to get a horse.

or how the developers prejudice against archers manifests in a sick an austere play style handicap

or the broken ""chase mechanic"" that lets you run 2x the speed of anybody who has their back to you

or the lack of any stamina drain,  specifically 2h weapons being spammed ad nauseum at the same speed as teh ""Fastest"" weapon in game.... (?weapon stats?)

oh there's more but it's just not worth the effort making a LIST
i just dont feel this game will ever be balanced enough for myself to enjoy
i predict some things may be changed but they certainly wont make it enjoyable for ALL players 
if the devs hate archers so much... they probably just shouldnt have put archers in the game.... it's ridiculous.

i think this game should be famous for ""narcissistic secret fantasies from devs"" as this is clearly some kind of ""get revenge on all the archers who have interrupted my duels in other games""  kind of game.
and people should just say ""hope this isnt another mordhau"" and they'll think of how the devs linearly /strategically built the game around fucking with archer.

hence i probably shouldnt have bought this game and requested a refund.",1557148452,1698197872,False,4,4,0.29221642017364502,0,True,False,False

From the start of the game there was no moderation but because the game lacked a vote kicking feature server moderators were approved. Moderators in the beginning dealt with chat spamming, team killing or griefing because the players could not. Eventually a vote kicking feature was released along with being able to see who owned the buildables that were put in front of their team's spawn.

With the community being able to regulate itself server moderators who functioned as a living vote kick button seemed to be out of the job... seemed to. 

Luckily for them a few articles came out talking about the toxicity of Mordhau players so the moderators set to work, wage free. 

In the coming months many veteran players were muted or banned for minor incidences. The community myself and others cherished started thinning out. It was very awful to see because there was a loss of skill, talent, a friend to talk to and another head to smash with a maul.

Excessive Moderation is killing Mordhau.

With the bad actors removed from the beginning the moderators moved onto smaller and smaller issues. I knew someone who got banned recently for saying, ""We are the knights of Ni"", a Monty Python reference. Don't believe me try it yourself on an Oceania server with a moderator around. Many other incidences in the same vein can be used as an example.

I myself was handed a 4 week ban for emoting on a dead moderator's body, and previously before that I was handed a 2 week ban for using the insult voice lines in the game. Ban reason? Griefing.

Using the very features in the game is considered griefing currently and the culture of the game is in a sad state. 

Moderators are constantly mocked by players and moderators are constantly muting and banning players for the smallest of things. It's meant to be a medieval fighting game but all the fighting that is happening is in the chat, with players and moderators at each other's throats.

We oceania players tried to contact the developers, but from what we know the moderators in oceania are being given free reign by the head moderator Silverleo to ban and mute those they wish. My brother was banned on the mordhau discord for being related to me when he was trying to appeal his own in game ban. Which is based but unprofessional for a company.

The only solution I see is this:
The living vote kicking buttons are put out of work. They will no longer depopulate the mordhau servers with needless mutes or bans. They will no longer destroy the community they were meant to protect and the community will self regulate itself as it always has after the vote kicking feature was included in the game.

If you do choose to play this game and don't want a head looking over your shoulder, choose to play the community servers and not the official ones.

Mordhau has a steep learning curve but is fun to play. Unfortunately I cannot recommend playing the base game due to moderator toxicity. Ironic, right?",1586584376,1697353273,False,1,0,0.49438205361366272,0,True,False,False

-The servers are working very badly. Blows pass through players and bots.

-Frequent crashes of the client. If you bought DLS for support, you will have to reinstall the client, otherwise the game will not start. Moreover, the reinstallation is done from 0, and not partially.

-There are no compensations for regular departures from the client and servers. Played for an hour and flew out - time wasted.

-If the opponents are a blue team, then you will not be able to distinguish them from allies if they are covered in blood. They will be a RED color, as will the allies. Enemies should always be red and allies green / blue. And there should be their contour lighting.

-If the servers are under DDoS, bots will make hit to you, but you cannot hit them.

-It is impossible to play with your 1x1 friends or only in their circle with bots. To create a lobby, you need to rent servers from them. The shittiest thing to see in a modern co-op game.

-When trying to connect with friends to a match, it often crashes, either a friend's client or yours or both.

-Game balance and matchmaking. There are often 2-3 players of the first level on the server in your team, and there are 5-6 players of 200+ level playing against you . There is no balance in this game.

-Very weak servers. Sometimes it takes 10 attempts to climb the stairs, and the crossbow reloads 5 times in a row. Shots and blows pass through without taking damage.

-Gameplay is poorly designed.

Mordhau has eaten 350 hrs of my life (so far) and I have enjoyed it plenty, from competitive (not so much) duels to invasion/frontline trolling (bear traps are the best), this medieval genre is so rare and kinda hard to get right, but I believe that Triternion has made a good decision in making of Mordhau. Although there are a fair bit of problems from duels not looking like duels and more like ballet dance's to the game not being super newbie friendly, but if u look away from that you have a nearly perfect game. It is sad that its not thriving even though there is not much competition, only Chivalry 2 (which I have played plenty but settled on to Mordhau) is able to compete against Mordhau.

The melee combat is the best in gaming. Simple to learn, impossible to master. No matter how many hours you've put in the game, there's always room for improvement. Unfortunately, this also means that new players don't stand a chance without some coaching and a lot of practice. High level combat is sweaty as hell, and downright frustrating at times. There's room for the casual player if you don't take it too seriously, however.

Content has always been sparse. They have definitely fumbled parts of this game that could have been so much better, but I try to remind myself these are first time developers and a smaller studio. There's a decent amount of maps and game modes to play, and the modding community has helped fill some of the gaps as well. The devs are still working on at least one new map, 4 years after release.

Fashion is where Mordhau really shines. There's a near endless amount of customization to make your characters stand out, and it works so well. You can often recognize someone on the field just by their armor and their heraldry. I wish all games had this level of customization.

Unfortunately, the devs never fixed a very important issue with the game that should not have been ignored. Team balance in a game with such a high skill ceiling is incredibly important. They (eventually) implemented a mechanic that automatically selects the teams at the start of the game to prevent players from intentionally stacking one side. Unfortunately, the ""totally random"" team sorting will always stack one side with high levels anyways. You will almost never see a balance game, it will still be a one sided curb stomping because a proper solution was apparently not worth the effort.This should have been taken more seriously, as the game is just not fun if you have no chance of winning. It's absolutely at it's best when the teams are fairly even, which might happen once out of 20 rounds. It's an incredibly frustrating experience if you're actually trying to win, and is the main reason why I don't play much anymore.

If you like customization, melee combat, memes, have a high tolerance for frustration, and don't care about winning, check this game out. If you're looking for a game to relax after a long day of work, or a fair and balanced experience, consider other options.",1562065076,1696312038,False,0,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Ladies and gentlemen, fellow warriors and connoisseurs of chaos, I stand before you today to unravel a most extraordinary revelation: the intricate interplay between the visceral battlegrounds of MORDHAU and the unsuspecting, yet profound, cauliflower. Prepare yourselves, for this journey is one of unfathomable depth.

At first glance, MORDHAU may seem like a relentless, medieval battlefield, devoid of any vegetable-related connection. But venture with me into the depths of this digital melee, and you shall uncover a web of associations more complex than the tapestry of a knight's heraldic banner.

Picture, if you will, the cauliflower's humble florets, each one unique in its structure, yet all coming together to form a singular entity—a head of cauliflower. Similarly, MORDHAU is a tapestry of individual warriors, each with their own fighting style and weapon choices, yet all converging on the blood-soaked battlefield to create a symphony of chaos. Just as cauliflower's florets unite to create a culinary masterpiece, so do MORDHAU's players unite to craft epic tales of battle.

But there's more! The cauliflower, like MORDHAU's weapons and armor, is versatile. It can be roasted, mashed, or even turned into a delightful pizza crust. Similarly, MORDHAU's arsenal of weapons offers a variety of choices, from the mighty zweihänder to the nimble dagger, allowing players to tailor their combat style to suit their tastes, just like crafting a unique cauliflower dish to please the palate.

The cauliflower's inherent complexity lies beneath its unassuming appearance. Its fractal-like structure mirrors the intricate combat mechanics of MORDHAU. One must master the art of parrying, feinting, and chambering, much like one must appreciate the cauliflower's nuances to unleash its full flavor potential. Both cauliflower and MORDHAU demand a keen understanding of their respective complexities to truly appreciate their depth.

Furthermore, the cauliflower's white color symbolizes purity and clarity, contrasting sharply with the red hues of the battlefield, just as the battles in MORDHAU juxtapose chaos and strategy. The clarity of cauliflower is a reminder that even in the midst of battle, there is room for thoughtful tactics and calculated strikes.

In conclusion, my fellow gamers, I implore you to see beyond the surface of MORDHAU's brutal warfare. Delve into the metaphorical cauliflower of strategy, versatility, and complexity that lies beneath. Just as the cauliflower transforms into a culinary masterpiece in skilled hands, so too does MORDHAU become an epic saga when embraced with understanding and finesse. For in the realm of MORDHAU, where carnage and cauliflower converge, true warriors shall find a taste of glory like no other.",1696181240,1696181240,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

MORDHAU is a game with a very simple concept: You are a person with a weapon, you kill people, they die, you get more weapons, you get drip.

The loop is instantly repetitive and there's a couple of gamemodes to refreshen your expierence, even though the concept is still the same in every gamemode. There are custom servers with mods and roleplay, i was a part of that community and led my own ""clan"", the game had great potentional for roleplay, but it was mostly about the killing and slashing. 

That being said, the concept of the game is simple but very enjoyable, it can make you feel satisfied, challenged or both, this combination of a simple loop, challenging gameplay and interessting moves (drags, accels) and expansive community can give you hundreds of hours of expierence. 

One aspect remains horrible though, the game gets rarely updated and the developers are lazy, the community always agrees on that and tries to survive on what the game has to currently offer.

Good game though, i can recommend.",1696011313,1696011313,True,0,0,0.497766464948654175,0,True,False,False

However this game also suffers from the meta weapon disease, which gets very frustrating. This ties into the fact that the controls seems to not work at certain times and you die cause you cant parry. I've also found that people can parry from behind sometimes so that's a thing. To be short with it, this game can be fine when you do good, and very, VERY frustrating when you get destroyed, this is the only game to this day I've broken a monitor over. That being said i think once you master the combat system there is fun to be had, I have not done so yet, and probably never will, since every time i play online i find myself immediately presented with why i stopped playing in the first place.

The average human reaction time is about 250 milliseconds, 100 ms is the fastest reaction time for the entire human species. Most of attack stages (windup, release, recovery) are more or less around the same values.

And guess what, 90-100 ms is the latency you're gonna get (for Russians especially, considering Russian servers are moved elsewhere). 

There are also times when on packet loss (all the time on 64 players servers) your hand ""spasms"" on parry which is completely neutralizing you, attacks phasing through enemies (no lag compensation or any of that shit btw) and other wacky stuff.
It's all mainly due to the fact that the net code was written by complete degenerates and somehow animations and other should-be-client stuff is affected by your network connection.

Great community.
Great fun.

I have thoroughly enjoyed playing this game in all of it's aspects, I find every game mode and every map fun in it's own way. It is amazing both how simple this game is, and also how much attention and attention to detail it receives from it's developers.  

The combat system is always fun to play with, and  each weapon can be good in it's own way. I thoroughly appreciate how much attention went into this aspect of the game alone, where there is no set 'meta' on what is the best, but really it's whatever you as a player enjoy fighting with. Do you want to be a traditional knight with a longsword or maybe an arming sword and shield? Sure. Looking for something heavier? Try a maul or a  battle axe.  Or perhaps you want to wield a polearm? Go for it. Maybe archery is more your speed? Done. Or perhaps you want to clobber people to death with a frying pan, skin them alive with a carving knife, or even have a medieval lute battle with another battlefield bard? Yes, you can do that too! I'm 205 hours into this game as I currently write this review, and I'm still learning how to wield certain weapons, and having fun doing it!

I'm also very happy with the cosmetics of the game, and just how many options there are across a diverse catalog of armors and armaments that span throughout the Middle Ages. As a history buff, it is fun to play dress-up and cosplay as medieval warriors, or perhaps even fictional ones (such as Monty Python characters!). On top of all of this, there is no beginning restriction on armor, and the game allows the newest of players to access whatever combination of light, medium, and heavy armors, or perhaps no armor at all; progression is pretty much purely cosmetic. (The only exception being weapons having to be bought with the in-game earnable currency, which isn't all that big of a hassle.)

As I said before, the maps and modes are all consistently fun and unique in their own ways, each one being different enough from the last that gameplay always feels fresh, no matter how many hours you've sunk in. I'm always having fun in this game whether I'm fighting in the midst of a large-scale battle, competing for standing in the ranked duels, or if it's as simple as taking part or witnessing something hilarious that is taking place apart from a battle, or on a duel server. 

The people are what make this game truly great though. Whether that's the playerbase keeping this game going steadily along, or the developers paying attention to the community. I find it really funny how there's a silent unwritten understanding to not attack players who are playing instruments; whether that's because they just want to vibe, or because that player is secretly amazing at the game and will mess you up if you try. There can be toxic players from time to time, but that's with any game or community. The good people far and away outweighs the bad, and are always a great fun to play with. I've made a few friendships on this game, and certainly strengthened previously existing friendships on it as well. 

This game is great, and I have enjoyed every minute playing it. I will probably continue playing it for at least 205 hours more...and then some! If you're looking for a reason to get this game, stop looking, because you should get this game for every reason. I wouldn't even wait for a sale, the game is that great and the developers deserve it that much. I'll probably be purchasing some more of the DLC later down the road. Not because I need any of it, it's all cosmetic anyways; But because I want to support the game, the community, and it's developers all that much.

10/10 would 100% this game again.",1695085291,1695085291,True,1,0,0.501326858997344971,1,True,False,False

For new players there is no learning curve; it's a learning cliff.
Details if you are curious:
It's sad because it was very fun in the beginning and even continued to be later on with modded servers and people meming around
This game manages to simultaneously have Chinese levels of censorship from the moderators and some of the worst toxicity I've seen (not even mean words but people going of their way to ruin your game by constant griefing). I've seen guys banned for writing ""biggers"" in chat and yet somehow actual slurs are commonly seen in almost every match.
The moderators are some of the most aggressive, pathetic losers I've seen from any game. They go out of their way to ban memers and openly insult players in the official discord and reddit. But when it's time to ban a blatant cheater they want you to do their job for them and provide them with the guy's birth certificate, current address, photo of passport and the color of his bedsheets. (The game has no functioning anti cheat either lol)
The combat is sweaty af, it is both unfun and unrealistic. A far cry from the promised ""fights that look like fights"", instead the devs chose to listen to a small group of players and keep some jankiness and exploiting in game resulting in them just recreating a less crazy version of Chivalry 1.
The devs listen only to the sweatiest players who are ""veterans"" (and most importantly in agreement with the devs) and on their discord server and reddit. I would actually say that the majority of sweatlords have tried to give helpful advice and recommendations but they get told to fuck off. The Devs do not pay attention to the core issues of the game.
The servers are terrible giving you high ping and pocket loss. Combined with bad netcode (no rollback like would be common for fighting games) results in parry timing being very hit and miss. The difference between official servers and a good server with low ping is much more apparent than in most games. Very often you get hit through your parry because the server didn't see your parry, through no fault of your own! Very fun to be punished when you didn't make a mistake (other than playing this game that is)

Mordhau and its combat mechanics are overall quite difficult, i at level 65 still get beaten often and its not uncommon to come across lvl 200 sweat lords who DO NOT go outside. 

With that being said, once you learn how to play well, you wont stop. There is nothing better than shitting on 2 kids who thought they had you when you were backed into a corner. Ranked for me is boring but 64 player servers are where the golds at. Sometimes everyone will end up attacking the exact same objective and absolute hell will rain down on everybody with people getting decapitated, Blood and fire everywhere, aswell as you swinging your battle axe left and right willing to take out any blue fuck who comes near you and it really is great.

I bought this game back in 2020 and i can honestly say every game is usually a blast, i have so much nostalgia in it and im very thankful to of randomly picked up this game almost 4 years ago. The community is just as autistic and degenerated as each other and sometimes it really does feel like a second home. Thank you mordhau and its community for never stopping to be of some what entertaining!

(TIP:  if your new, you will die alot, click Q to cancel your attacks and be patient with the game, it really does get better)

A new, good map would have been great but then they just had to make it arid, words cannot describe the hatred i feel towards that absolute balls map, every time i see it in a server list or i see people voting for it a little part of my brain tells me to fly to the Triternion HQ and commit arson. I just cannot fathom how they spent over half a fucking year, half. A. Fucking. Year. Making that absolute stinking pile of mammoth feces, its like the devs just dont like fun and get pleasure from forcing players to lose any ounce of sanity they still have. Devs also thought it would be a good idea to rub it in too by adding camels, fucking camels, not a single person has ever asked for camels and there they are, the mongoose devs say they had a 4 legged creature surprise when announcing the update, here i am expecting a dragon or something cool but no we get sand eating fucking camels (might i add these are just the same as the horses that they added years ago but with a different model, they are literally the exact same and the devs 'worked' on them for months). I genuinely hope whoever led this update and the ones responsible for the ideas get fired, nay, incinerated. They should not be near a dev team ever again. A good, enjoyable game turned into a cesspool of dung covered peasants. There was also an 'update' to the ui, when i say update i mean its like the devs went back 10 fucking centuries and used the ui from then, its so garbage, i cant see the writing half the time and everything is so difficult to navigate at this point i just use the default classes, nobody ever asked for a new ui, not a single person, yet they still change it. It might just be me but i cannot understand why devs think it is a good idea to tell players what they want instead of asking, if they just did a vote or asked atleast one player they wouldnt be killing the game right now. To add insult to injury they got rid of the funny spawn screens for no reason, this is literally the only reason i liked playing Grad, the funny spawn screen was what actually got me excited, but no, devs dont like fun, you either play the game properly or you get banned by the god awful moderators who arent even on at all because they have 'day jobs'. WHY THE FUCK ARE YOU MODERATING IF YOU DONT HAVE TIME. But no need to worry guys!!!, devs put a paywall behind new voices which everyone would love, they are just trying to milk every last penny out of this before it dies, want a voicechat? WELL YOU ARENT GETTING ONE, you know why? because devs decided to add a new dlc that you have to pay £4 for, and it isnt even good, the spanish voices sound like fucking minions, i dont know who voice acted for this but it sounds like it was done by aliens. Absolute shit, if there was a way to play this game pre Eastern Invasion 2 update i would 100% wholeheartedly recommend it, it was really fun, do not buy this game, do not go near it, do not recommend it to other people, this needs to be wiped off the face of the earth.

200 hours later - devs realised game was dying after it was dying for fucking years so they decided to make it free for a weekend, now theres just a bunch of fucking new players that are really shit and no fun that ruin the whole fucking experience DO NOT PURCHASE THIS GAME IT IS BY FAR THE WORST GAME I HAVE EVER PLAYED THE DEVS ARE SO FUCKING STUPID THE MODS MUTE ME FOR SAYING THE MOST MEDIOCRE THINGS SHIT GAME HOPE IT IMPLODES",1642348013,1694619417,False,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

But if you're expecting a great and positive community from the players then I would not expect kindness from any of these players. Also the you can make your own character and customize your soldier that you see fit with a wide variety of weapons. But the I believe the community has ruined the fun for this game considering the tryhards and trolls it offers. I know that's game out there but if you want to actually have an enjoyable sword game then I'd purchase a better game that is worth your time. 

I think the developers don't really care enough about the game considering they're hiring modders to make a survival RPG and they won't ban hackers. The developers don't punish griefers or trolls or the negativity this game produces on a daily basis. I actually feel bad for some players who want to have fun but it gets ruined by trolls and the toxic community. The one I truly hate the most about the community is the the fact when you play archer at any point during a match you're cyber-bullied for it and votekicked out or trolled upon horribly. Also people tk or (Teamkill) you a lot and say they did nothing wrong and if you try to do the right thing and votekick them out of the match then the lobby turns on you.

So my conclusion is that this is game is just not enjoyable unless you like dealing with toxic and negativity from players in this game on a daily basis. I hope review hopes people look for a better game to play because I sure as hell don't recommend this game at all considering the game play experience I have from it.",1693761334,1693761334,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I'm tired of dueling with people drastically overleveled than me, I'm tired of the empty servers, I'm tired of the broken hitboxes on horses and thrusted spears, the viewmodels that don't match their true weapon distance, and so much more.

I like the swordfights, everything else sucks ass. best map is Mountain Peak, everything else is a 4-6/10. Also fix the scimitar's damage scaling, I shouldn't be one-shot from a body at full HP with a 3-3-3 build. Dwarves ruined this game's public frantic combat, now a hide and go seek fuckfest of trying to spot the midgit with a maul that still headshots you.

Edit, after several more hours of playing, I found out some maps such as Camp's Blue Spawn and Mountain Peak's Red Spawn both have ballistas in a KILLZONE. I don't need to explain why this is bad game design. Don't put the long range weapons in an area impossible to flank without the map arbitrarily smiting your character for working tactfully.

It can get pretty Chaotic wich is in the case of Mordhau pretty fun. Other maps are ""Castello"", ""Mountain Peak"", ""Feitoria"", ""Crossroads"", ""Taiga"" and the new map ""Dungeon"". Theres 7 smaller maps for gamemodes for 16 players, with various modded maps adn duel servers.

The Community:

The Community can be very toxic at times but most of the time (If you dont blindly atack everyone you see) you will have a great time, even if cases of bullying happends sometimes but the most Mordhau players wont target you for more than one round (especally in deathmatch) And if you just join another game you will probably go on very well, if you want to get gud very  fast, go to an duel server to study the game or just ask players to give u training.
If you play for a longer time you will see the more enjoyable sides of the community like trolling with funny skins or doing hilarious stuff and more theres entire troll servers just to hang arround and do wierd stuff. You will find a simmilar expirience in Deathmatch. you will also develop conections to other players even adding them to your friends list, when you are writing in the chat enaugh or just do something having a great time, Mordhau has not the biggest player base so you can be sure meeting friends or just people you know in the game regurarly wich is fun.

my expirience:

The Game can be grindy and even frustrating at times, but can also be the most rewarding expirience I could have found in a game from Competative duels to trolling with buddies, it´s great if i ever had the chance to refund the game fr 100 dollars i swear i would not do it. 

I hope I could help you with your decision to buy/not buy the game with my personal expirience an a few generell information about the game .

Anyone still playing has hundreds of hours in game and the learning curve being immense. In the end all is for naught as you are forced to rely on a few unbalanced melee weapons and animation glitches to out do players forced to do the same thing.

There are high level players in most lobbies, but you can overcome this by sticking together with your team. This game is really immersive, nerve-wracking, and at times blatantly hilarious. It might take an acquired taste for some, but once you start getting kills and become more confident in the fighting mechanics you'll likely love this game like I do. The customization is fantastic, the maps are detailed and captivating and the gameplay is outright addicting. Leveling is a grind, but not very restrictive. Lots of weapons that are all useful and require different strategies. The player-base is filled with autists and waterbrained types, as one might expect, but they are fun to engage with. There is a lot of potential for this game to grow with recent updates bringing in cool new maps and weapons.

I do not recommend you purchase this game as it's on it's death bed and anyone that tells you it's not hasn't touched grass in several years. Seriously this game had it's run and you could technically still squeeze out a little more fun. It's hit the CSGO point for me. Where you have a love hate relationship. Installing and uninstalling over and over again throughout the years. Until the day comes when you no longer possess the urge to play the game. It's just dead to you and another chapter of gaming to be left in the past where it belongs.

Same thing happened with Marauders!

If you choose to get the game... A simple disclaimer:

-Toxic high level players who haven't seen daylight for years.
-Yes, they think they come from nobility hehe

-Plenty of people are chivalrous
-Plenty don't understand what chivalrous means

Take it from me... if you have the game already it doesn't hurt to hop on and give it another go to see if it's for you or not; first hand experience and all. On the other hand if not just bloody wait for PoE2 or any other game that is coming out. Yes, it's going to be a long minute but I promise you most probably wont get your monies worth anymore(2023+).

And that is exactly what it is. This game has crazy customization and is one of the key features of MORDHAU. The problem that keeps Mordhau on the ground and dead is that there is essentially no updates whatsoever anymore. There are buggy, unfair, and unreactable animations that can be spammed to essentially 50/50 opponents to your hearts desire. This game is the definition of bi-polar. It is either one of the most fun and exciting games ive ever played, or it makes me want to go on a killing spree in REAL LIFE. I've tried different playstyles, different gamemodes, took breaks, but at the end of the day there are too many broken things in this game to fully enjoy it.

As a beginner, you'll discover that this game is incredibly unforgiving. There are very few other novices around, and your only chances of landing a kill will likely occur in larger game modes such as invasion and frontline. Opportunities are often limited to capitalizing on rare mistakes made by experienced players or teaming up to take someone down.
Oh and Killing people in a fair fight? Don't count on that happening much at all.

You have to invest countless hours and suffer immeasurable deaths to simply stay alive. You'll often feel overwhelmed, unable to counterattack, and frustrated to the point of feeling like you're playing a different game altogether. The learning curve can feel insurmountable, like taking one step forward and two steps back. For example i remember when i felt like i had it all worked out, feinting constantly was the key yeah? Nope, that only made me extremely predictable and made me lose all my stamina extremely quickly.

Despite the feeling that you're not improving, trust me, you are. Unfortunately this is the game where the only way you can tell is surviving 3 seconds longer then you did the last time you died half a minute ago, learning and progression in this game come through time, patience, and the frustration of being repeatedly stomped by high-level players. Even after 263 hours of gameplay, I consider myself a rookie compared to others I've met with thousands of hours logged.

But let me tell you about the payoff.
That eureka moment when you top the leaderboard or win a 1v5 fight makes all the frustration worth it, or at least it did for me. The game transforms from a brutal grind to an exhilarating and enjoyable experience. The excitement and satisfaction become extremely addictive.
But then you become the experienced player ""beyblading"" around and defeating newcomers, and then you realize that you are now the one that you were raging at before and cursing out. Personally nowadays I try to take it easy and only play with the fundamentals when in a lobby with just new/newish players (especially on free weekends and such) or I will try to exclusively go after the more experienced players in the game.

So in the end you have to decide if your the type of person that is willing to dedicate so much time and energy to get to a point where you are just AVERAGE at the game. If you want to try then go for it.

The first thing I would suggest for a person fresh out of the tutorial would be to play horde as it serves as a fun way to try out weapons and further learn the gameplay.

After that if your looking to learn but to also get a few kills go for Invasion or Frontline with a the spear class.

But the quickest and most brutal way to learn is to go onto duel servers, but expect an endless beating where you get no kills. If your lucky one of the high level experienced players might teach you a few things. 

Apart from that no matter what method you will take it will take a long time to get good, getting the ability to simply defend yourself for an extended period of time in a 1v1 is the first step.",1691429567,1691466536,True,0,0,0.495495498180389404,0,True,False,False

However, if you don't take the game too seriously, and keep your eyes and ears open, you will experience multiplayer gameplay like you never have before.

This game has a sheer freaking cliff face that is thrown at you in the tutorial, which you can only properly learn in the field. Now, what's out in that field? Everyone else playing the game, including the 200 something players you have the entire combat system tattooed on their chest. I'll keep it brief, but in the current state of pvp in this game, you need to exploit animations in order to win fights, because everyone else is. You can play the core gamemodes in private lobbies with friends/bots, but you won't get any rewards and the bots always fight perfectly, ruining chances of having fun whacking ai.

How about the devs? Well, when the game first took off, instead of investing money into further development of the game, the devs spent it on hookers and cocaine, and it shows. They're are slow as nails, putting out content annually and don't listen to the community, suffering from the ""No, it's the children who are wrong"" problem. The only things they add/fix are what's on [i]their[/i] radar and of course adding loads of new cosmetics you can spend your real money on. If you want to spend your money on good devs, then do not spend it here. 

However, there is in my opinion a really fun and redeeming gamemode: the horde mode. The horde mode is exactly what you want from a horde mode, complete with enemy variety, skill trees that end with special abilities, all taking place on the maps you already know from the core gamemodes. You get money between waves based on performance (Which isn't too harsh if you don't get a whole lot of kills), which you spend on weapons, armor and equipment that match the skills you're going for.

The only reasons I don't recommend this game are pretty hefty: Shitty, money-grubbing devs who don't care about their prized accomplishment anymore, and the incredibly fun and in-depth yet easily exploitable combat system.

[h1]ADHD? Me too, TLDR:[/h1]
This game has a fun and skilled combat system, but unfortunately seasoned players know the exploits, ruining the fun. The devs put together a masterpiece, but after launch blew all the money on actual cocaine, dooming the games chances of receiving proper support. The devs also clearly do not care about the game farther than it will fill their wallets, only updating the game annually and always including paid cosmetics. However, their is a very fun and well put together horde mode, which unfortunately is the only reason I recommend the game.

The moderators are extremely biased and impulsive, and abuse their powers daily on a whim. Community is split between two groups: 

1. Casual fighters (archers, engineers, and less experienced players), memers, roleplayers, trolls, map and glitch explorers (and exploiters), film producers/actors, and comedic content creators (like Deargriph). The players within this category play for fun or to explore non-gameplay-focused aspects or comedic aspects of the game.


2. Competitive fighters, ranked players, duelists, unhinged bard killers (players who kill anything that moves and never learned how to emote), kill montage content creators, and ""feedback veterans."" The players in this category play because they want to win or elevate their own status, and enjoy the competitive potential of the complex and unique combat system.

(a feedback veteran is no-lifer who spends most of their free time on the elitist official discord which only enables people to provide feedback if they are granted said special role-and you can't get the role unless the moderators and other ""veterans"" like you-this leads to most feedback veterans having similar views of the game and causes an elitist and gatekeeper attitude compared to regular discord users)


Both of these categories are perfectly fine, and all playstyles within each category are valid choices and offer unique experiences (in healthy moderation).

HOWEVER, the managers of the game (more specifically, the moderators, who are appointed and given free reign by the developers), cater ONLY to the competitive players, and actively detest the casual players. This is evident in their word choice and message topics on discord, reddit, and in-game. Their perceived elevated status only serves to corrupt them and empower their biased perspectives. They are given free reign, meaning they can make ANY decision to punish a player for ANY reason they see fit. In-game bans can be appealed and moderation activity can be monitored and inspected should an unjust ban take place, BUT THIS INSPECTION IS PERFORMED BY OTHER MODERATORS.

To pour salt on the wound, official server rules are unclear and vague. One category of ""trolling"" includes ""standing around in groups"" (this is not an exaggeration). This means there is no way to be a casual social memer in Mordhau without risking getting banned, and there is no guarantee that an unjust ban can be appealed successfuly because all of the power is within the moderators' hands.

As if the elitism and unchecked power lying within the moderation system was not enough, IT IS AGAINST THE RULES TO CRITICIZE THE MODERATORS! This is not an actual rule. However, it is against the rules to ""engage in witch hunts"" and do a number of actions VAGUELY tied to criticism such as ""insulting"" or ""being a nuissance."" Because of this, moderators are able to punish anyone who criticizes them and their actions even though moderator criticism is not mentioned in a rule.

Mordhau moderators WILL ALWAYS take at least one of the following actions when moderation or moderators are criticized on Reddit or Discord:
1. Lock the post (often after delivering an unconvincing final pinned comment)
2. Ban the user
3. Delete the post

The good thing:
The game itself is nice. It is fun to play. Most of the game mechanics are well made. I also like the thing when we don't have to buy any DLC. Those are just like 5 skin for the price, what is really waste of your money. 

The bad thing:
The problem with this game is the matchmaking, what is just HORRIBLE. You going to be forced to play with people, who are far above your skills. It is very frustrating. I found many times players with 200+ level in the opposite team when I was only lvl 50...
The more you play the better you become of course, BUT you need around 500 hours to be as good as your opponents! When there are 5 guy with lvl 200, you (as a newbie) barely have a chance to win ANY fight. Like that you only learn how to delete this garbage and play something else instead.

Few of the animations are broken. For example the pole axe and battle axe over head animation is pretty bad. Kinda ruins the fun when your perfect timing is still wrong cause of that.

Also need to mention the cheaters. If anyone tells you, there are none in this game, he is lying. Every single game has this problem. The only difference is the report system, what isn't really exist. If you meet with someone, who instant kills you with the weakest weapon you can found or automaticly tracking all your movement with autoblock, you can do nothing. I reported a cheater (who shoots through the wall with any weapon) to valve, and months later he is still playing with the same account...

Unfortunately, the developers did not give a damn about the Russian community, moving the servers far away (the average ping became 110+).
It is sad to realize that our common love for the game has not been able to overcome political strife, which happens not because of ordinary people, but because of politicians.

Now they moved them to Poland and all players from Russia have same experience playing on, I want to stress this, on RUSSIA OFFICIAL SERVERS LOCATED IN POLAND, having 80-120 ping, basically making the game unplayable. And what is more ironic and shows absurdety of situation and foolery of devs is that Russian players have 50-60 ping on EUROPEAN OFFICIAL SERVERS. In other words we have better ping playing on EU servers and on RU servers. Nice job devs.

All in all, thank you devs so much for taking such steps to ensure WE, the players from RUSSIA, get the worst possible experience.

The concept, is really fun. I like the fact that mordhau combat is somewhat nuanced and complex. It makes it feel awesome when you get good and can actually hold your own in 1vMany encounters.
THAT BEING SAID
1) This game is dead as hell. All of the good players have left official servers in favor of duel servers, and a lot of them have left entirely. Most of the players you encounter will be brainless troglodites who don't know how to play an objective game, or godly players who only want frags and also don't know how to play an objective game.
2) The dev team is either lazy, incompetent, or dead. The rate of content updates is extremely slow, and patches just as much so. It's hard to keep invested in this game when even the dev team isn't, and I can't help but compare a game like this to games like GMod, Rust, or DST, where the devs are constantly releasing monthly updates and patches. Maybe it isn't fair to compare it to such titles, but if they would just release regular patches then it would be a lot more bearable.
3) The balance of this game doesn't exist. There is so much cheese and the very same combat system that drew me into this game is what made me quit. There are swords that you can drag so slowly they wouldn't cut a cake in real life but still deal full damage. There are throwing weapons that can be thrown just as fast as your parry can recover. Weapons that one shot on head and can be manipulated to hit later than they look like they should. This combined with the dev team's inability to roll out patches and total aversion to re-balancing makes it an extremely frustrating game experience. 

This game really could have been so much more if the devs actually updated and patched the game regularly, but instead of rebalancing shit they added a shift perspective button to the menu and in a middle finger to duel private servers (honestly the thing that has kept this game alive imo) they cut the size of one of the really fun out of bounds for a popular duel map to nothing. That may sound petty, but when the primary appeal of a game is chilling with your friends having a fun map be ruined is upsetting.
I could make argument for this game if you just want to duel your friends, but to be honest I would personally feel more value from my time playing a fighting game of some kind.",1680573470,1690812283,False,4,1,0.518172085285186768,0,True,False,False

MORDHAU, a medieval first and third-person multiplayer slasher, delivers an exhilarating and visceral combat experience that will immerse you in the chaos of medieval warfare. Developed by Triternion, this game transports players to a fictional yet realistic world where up to 64 mercenaries clash on the battlefield. From massive battles and cooperative horde mode to free-form melee and ranged combat, MORDHAU offers a rich array of features that promise endless replayability. With the latest Patch #27, the game continues to evolve, introducing new content, fixing bugs, and refining the gameplay experience. Let's delve deeper into what makes MORDHAU an exceptional entry in the genre.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
At its core, MORDHAU revolves around epic battles, ranging from smaller skirmishes to large-scale 64-player conflicts in modes like Frontline and Invasion. These engagements offer an adrenaline-fueled rush, where players must utilize strategy, skill, and teamwork to achieve victory. Whether you prefer to take on enemies with a massive greatsword, rain arrows upon your foes, or use siege engines like catapults and ballistae, the game accommodates a vast arsenal of weapons and equipment to suit various playstyles.

One of the most remarkable aspects of MORDHAU's gameplay is its free-form melee and ranged combat system. Players have complete control over their character's movements and attacks, allowing them to develop their unique combat style. The system strikes an impressive balance between gameplay and realism, making each fight look believable and deeply satisfying. With the latest update addressing issues like ballista movement exploits and pommel throw exploits, the game is more polished than ever, ensuring a fair and enjoyable experience for all.

[h1]Character Customization[/h1]
MORDHAU's in-depth character customization sets it apart from many other multiplayer titles. Players can sculpt their character's face to create a unique avatar, and the ability to craft personalized weapons from parts adds a layer of creativity to the gameplay. Additionally, the option to pick individual armor pieces lets players fine-tune their warrior's appearance and function. This level of customization allows players to become the perfect embodiment of their chosen playstyle, enhancing immersion and investment in their virtual persona.

[h1]Maps and Environments[/h1]
The battlegrounds in MORDHAU are beautifully designed, with attention to detail that further enhances the immersive medieval experience. Whether you find yourself in the tight confines of The Pit or the expansive landscapes of Noria, each map offers its unique challenges and opportunities for strategic maneuvering. The latest update fixes bugs in existing maps and optimizes Noria for smoother gameplay, ensuring players can focus on their skills without distractions.

[h1]Horde Mode[/h1]
Cooperative gameplay takes center stage in Horde mode, where players must band together to face waves of enemies. The recent update addresses several issues, such as fixing the explosive barrels griefing and adjusting the noble AI behavior. Additionally, extending revive and respawn times provides players with a fairer chance to recover, while the fine-tuned engagement radius and patrol points enhance the mode's challenge and enjoyment.

[h1]Visuals and Sound[/h1]
MORDHAU boasts stunning visuals that capture the brutal and gory nature of medieval combat. The impact of every blow feels tangible, and players can revel in the satisfying sight of limbs flying as they engage foes on the battlefield. The optional blood and gore add an extra layer of realism for those seeking an unfiltered experience, but they can be toggled off for a more restrained display. The game's sound design complements the visuals, providing a powerful auditory experience that fully immerses players in the chaos of battle.

[h1]Overall Experience[/h1]
As a player who played MORDHAU in it's infant stages, my initial experience with MORDHAU was incredibly satisfying. The game's intense and brutal combat, coupled with the depth of character customization and the vast array of weapons, kept me fully immersed in the medieval warfare experience. The battles were epic, and the satisfaction of mastering different combat styles and strategies made me eager to return for more.

However, as time went on and I became more familiar with the game, I noticed that MORDHAU had become increasingly challenging. The competition grew fierce, and skilled players seemed to dominate the battlefield. The learning curve was steep, and newer players might find it difficult to keep up with the veterans. This increased difficulty could be somewhat discouraging for those who prefer a more casual gaming experience.

Despite the growing difficulty, I still wholeheartedly recommend MORDHAU to fellow medieval fans. The game's unparalleled combat mechanics and realistic setting make it a must-play for anyone seeking an authentic and immersive medieval multiplayer experience. The joy of mastering the combat and the thrill of victory are genuinely rewarding, and the game offers a level of depth and complexity that few other titles in the genre can match.

However, I must caution potential players that MORDHAU is not for the faint of heart. It has become a highly competitive environment, and newcomers may face a steep challenge in acclimating to the fast-paced and unforgiving combat. Be prepared to invest time and effort into honing your skills if you want to compete at a higher level.

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
MORDHAU stands as a standout title in the medieval multiplayer genre, delivering a highly satisfying combat experience that keeps players engaged and coming back for more. With its massive battles, extensive character customization, and free-form melee and ranged combat, the game caters to a diverse range of playstyles. The latest update, Patch #27, showcases the developer's commitment to refining and expanding the game, addressing player concerns, and introducing new content to keep the experience fresh.

Whether you're a fan of intense, large-scale warfare or prefer cooperative play with friends, MORDHAU has something to offer every medieval combat enthusiast. Its believable fights, deep character customization, and beautifully designed maps contribute to an experience that feels both immersive and rewarding. For those seeking an adrenaline-pumping and challenging multiplayer slasher, MORDHAU is a must-play title that continues to evolve and impress with every update.",1561832098,1690480755,True,7,0,0.629629611968994141,0,True,False,False

The swing animations for attacking are very broken to the point where it is possible to be hit by a seemingly stationary blade since the enemy was able to contort their body to have the start of the damage window hit you before the arms of their character even move. On the other end of this is people making their character turn away from you to slow their swing down to cause your parry to be mistimed and still be met with the same amount of damage that would be taken from a blade moving at full speed even thought its barely moving.,1690206299,1690206299,False,2,0,0.518729448318481445,0,True,False,False

If it wasn't obvious I like the medieval genre and anything to do with melee combat aswell as PVP focused games, Mordhau checks each of those boxes

Pros

Progression: is nice, you level up and earn coins to unlock new armor, weapons, perks and equipment.

Customization: there is ALOT you can customize, armor, weapons, characters

Maps: the devs keep releasing more maps and there are also a ton of community made modded maps

Combat: There is some good and some bad with the combat. Overall the combat feels good, you can feel the weight behind your weapons and you get a nice little dopamine hit when the *tink* sound plays on headshots.

Hoard mode: really fun wave style survival game mode that you earn money and perk points in, they've improved it over the years and added perks, a loot goblin and cool 3 tiered loot chests that you can gamble your money to receive either good or bad loot from(there is also regular loot scattered across the maps). There are many types of enemies that will progressively get harder as you get to higher rounds but this balances out because your character will also improve with the perk system, loot, and armor. I really like this mode but like any wave based game mode you will eventually die.

Cons

Sweats: there are a ton of vastly more experienced players that will take a dump on you all day long while you struggle to learn the basics, personally I don't really care but for most players this is what drives them away

Combat: there are some VERY jank animations that are neigh unreadable and make zero sense (carpet drag example: y o u t u b e .com/watch?v=_rRT8fH6kCI), people spinning around like beyblades trying to exploit the drag ""mechanic"" is something very common. In my opinion this could be fixed by introducing damage scaled to the speed of your weapons when dragged but not when accelerated, this would incentivize players to not drag as much since the damage would be vastly lower (which would also make logical sense) however there is absolutely no way that the developers will change drags as they've already confirmed that its an intended mechanic 

Offline play: this game is very PVP focused so if you don't want to interact with players then this simply is not the game for you, the offline gamemodes are VERY limited, I haven't checked recently if they added it but last time I did you couldn't even play the PVE hoard mode without going online, the only option was to fight bots.

also it took me good 30 minutes to find a mod to dm to find out what i've been banned for because you cant message in the official discord server without a phone number linked to the account and more than half of the mods there have closed dms.
also the only support you can get is via third party services like discord, reddit etc.
here's what happened when i managed to ask what i was banned for: https://i.imgur.com/2Ah0ldy.jpeg
the game does not have any kind of anti cheat system or at least it seems like it judging by the fact that i've clashed with actual cheaters a lot which in turn means that all bans are made by mods which are humans and humans are prone to making errors.
the bans received block one's ability to play online in general which means one cannot join nor official nor community servers in my case i was banned because i am accused for actions that were made on the community servers
the game itself is great and i'd even say its the best one so far but the horrible community support power hungy moderators and lack of any anti cheat systems is damaging to the game

if you plan on buying the game i again remind you that i was banned because of an accusation without any evidence and with no way to appeal my ban for actions that were probably made on the community servers ( i assume that is the case since i only play on the community servers because the official ones suck) and no one is capable of avoiding an unjust ban like that because you get banned no matter what kind of server you were playing on community or official and you also get blocked from accessing community and official servers",1587620740,1689816865,False,3,0,0.563492059707641602,0,True,False,False

Had a lot of fun with it, and played it for wayyy too long, I only played it because I literally had nothing else to do during COVID lock-downs.

This game has probably one of the most cancerous and toxic communities I have ever seen in gaming. There's an above average amount of racist people in this game for whatever reason. This game must be cursed by the gods, not only is this community incredibly racist and generally toxic, there is absolutely no help to new players of this game, which catalyzes the death of this game and the present state it's in. Also the devs never update this game. 

In fact, veteran players (lvl 200+) have no intention of taking it easy on new players, this game has a tough learning curve,  but they genuinely are such no lifes that they see new players as exp points.

Even though it makes you want to block all exits to the local Circle K and set it on fire with everyone in it at times, there are a lot of funny moments I had in this game. Ultimately it's a silly knight game.",1612373910,1689746790,False,0,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

As a player with over 1000 hours now, I felt its time I leave a proper, honest review on Mordhau. 


This Game is fun, but struggles to please both the competitive and casual players. The only players left playing this game in 2021 have hundreds of hours. Newer players literally stand no chance against vets, mainly because of mechanics they don't teach you like combo faint to parry but other mechanics you learn along the way like insane drags, broken jpeg accels, wristy twistys, etc. Broken weapons such as the Battle Axe and war hammer plague the community. This is one of those games you need to spend a few hundred hours dying just to fully grasp the sword mechanics and even feel somewhat comfortable. Another issue is the main Dev crush literally ignores us and doesn't even care about what the community desperately wants or needs. I don't see this getting any better either, so rest in peace mordhau. 

[b] side note [/b]
 As of Augest 13th the Backend servers have been fully offline, you cant even play local play or bots. It's been now over 14 hours and still not even a word from the devs as to when this issue will be fixed. Player base is decreasing more and more everyday.

Throwing chickens, logs, body checking someone into a ravine, or even throwing poop you alleviate from your bowels 3 seconds earlier, isn't how you make a superior fighting game, Chiv Players.

Dying Community that consists of the same 2k people (which are all boring meta players).

Game would've been decent if it weren't for musty competitive players ruining the experience with their annoying animation cheese and bug abuse.

The game was literally free for like a week on epic games, it gained about 1k players, and immediately lost said 1k players. Would you like to guess how? If your answer was the horseshit community then you are correct!!

In buying this game you acknowledge that you're wasting money on a dying game, that will give you no entertainment, nor any fun.

Unfortunately, mostly made redundant by the people who have optimized the game to death and only play either a full-armored knight with an Eveningstar or a Poleaxe, or a practically naked guy with a maul. The community is toxic as fuck and the higher-level players in this game abuse engine jank to be practically nigh-invincible in a 1v1, let alone those players who disrespect 1v1s and constantly third-party every fight they come across to rack up kills. Some of the personalities in this game's community are frankly insufferable and are too high and mighty of themselves. However, I believe Mordhau thrives best when there is just raw chaos happening, and the Invasion and Frontline modes are very fun examples of that, as well as the dungeon map they added for the brawl modes that adds environmental dangers and explosives to the map. 

This game has a horrible problem with balancing, and frankly the blocking frames of the maul and feint-spamming should be fixed in this game. This game feels less like a combat game and more like a metagame where you basically just have to weather everything a higher-skilled player can throw at you until their stamina bard depletes enough for you to get a hit in. But even then, they'll just spin around, kick, triple-feint and make you flinch and one-shot you with the Maul for all your troubles, and then say some bullshit like ""Sit."" in chat like they're sooo good at this game.

When writing this review, I'll split it into 2 main sections. One talking about the game as a whole, and the other talking about Mordhau in comparison to chivalry 2.

I'll try to keep comparisons to other games out of this section, because that's for the next section. 
This game has many different weapons, varieties of play-styles, and VERY good performance for still having quite nice graphics. If you've never seen anything about this game before, I'll describe the basic combat. There are a handful of options you can use to dispose of your enemies. You can kick, throw certain weapons, shoot someone with a crossbow, throw rocks at them, and even hit them with a lute! Interesting features aside, the main combat system consists of 3 different attacks. Slashing, (left to right,) Stabbing, (thrusting with the sword,) and swinging from above. Certain attacks have their weaknesses and their strengths. Whether you slash or strike from above depends on which way you're looking, which leads into another interesting aspect of combat, where your sword can reach your enemy quicker if you move your camera in the same direction as your swing. It adds a lot of immersion to the game, as it makes the weapons feel more realistic to use, as they move with your player model. You can block or parry attacks within a small window of time by right clicking, which you can lead into a riposte, (counter attack.) there is also a more advanced technique that can be even more rewarding, called chambering. For example, if your opponent slashes to their left, you can deny their attack by hitting their sword with your sword. You can also feint and pull out of an attack by pressing Q. Anyway, that's really the gist of the basic combat. Outside of combat, one of my favorite things about this game is the customization. There are many different weapons that you can use to change your playstyle. Certain items allow you different capabilities, such as building defenses, being able to throw your weapon, or using your sword in mordhau mode. (Hitting the opponent with the pummel, works especially well against armored players.) You can also change your armor not only in a gameplay perspective, but just from a roleplaying perspective. You can go full out goofy, or just try and look somewhat like a knight. 

Second section: I played chiv 2 for much longer than this game, probably at least 20 hours, but the fact that chiv 2 costs twice as much as mordhau is a goddamn scam. After playing mordhau, I don't think I can ever go back. Chivalry 2 feels quite a bit clunkier and has way less customization. The only real benefits of Chiv 2 are the graphics, and the soundtrack. Also, something important for people like me, with a lower end pc, mordhau runs at least 2 times as better. I have no frame drops at 60 fps in mordhau, on medium settings, while chiv 2 I was getting 30 fps most of the time. Not to just dog on chivalry 2, something much better about chiv 2 is the level of epicness. The start of most maps have a badass cutscene in chiv 2, before 32 v 32 people go charging at each other in a frenzy. However, I'd still say that mordhau's gameplay outweighs Chivalry 2's shinier look. Mordhau also honestly has more ways to uniquely kill people, and better progression. There are catapults, bombs, bows, arrows, swords, axes,  rocks, and ballistas in mordhau. Something that is also very important to mention is that Chivalry 2 just gives you a handful of base classes, and you are forced to play as those classes. Mordhau is much more free, and you have to learn the gameplay for yourself and figure out what you need to do to win. Chivalry 2 is a much more casual and chaotic game, but I think mordhau definitely has better gameplay if you take the time to learn it. I myself am still at the bottom of the mordhau food web, but the game is still infinitely fun. Chivalry two I always felt like I already had all the power I needed at my fingertips, I just wasn't good enough. Mordhau has a much more organic learning curve. Anyway, I'm done writing this review. If you're looking at mordhau by itself, get it 100%. If you're looking at mordhau vs Chivalry 2, consider this. If you want to really get good, buy mordhau. If you want to really have fun, buy chivalry 2. Not to say Mordhau isn't fun, it definitely is, but it's harder fun.",1689190458,1689190458,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Not much skill needed just -Add extra bit of movement to your combat and maxed out best player of the game- 
Combat.. Oh the combat!
Block, Block, Faint.. hit them.. block.. block.. - OR same thing but, guy pokes your back, pokes you again, OR swarmed - OR maxed pro'd out guy? he realises he messed up, crouch hard and flick his head back upwards like neo form the matrix. dodge the hit, repeat cycle with you again. - odd thing iv seen peeved me off, is my tiny one handed sword hit a wall no where close, but guys polearm phases through things im hitting and side-swipes me. I got two clips of it, my squeal was wretched.
ALSO.. speed of weapons, holy crap. Made me maaald bad, tiniest of sword... something meant be fast, still feels so slow, feel like allot of huge hammers nd more just on par with speed of a swing..!!  -Best clip I got so far? Was me picking up a halberg.. shaking my head side to side staring at my feet and somehow killing 3 people randomly in a crowd, blindly fighting without trying worked somehow. -  FUNNY TIDBIT, allot people hate archers? I don't see them as a problem.. cant outright one shot you, so people get upset badly about them, it's wild weird. - ONLY TIME - IV SEEN... archers one shot, is fellow archers, cause of a dumb perk.. turns whole archer v archer into a boneified moment of 2FORT with snipers, side to side zigs trying land single chest shot. - I did piss off allot people playing as a dwarf archer, I used recurve bow, It was extremely fun with the insanely heavy drop and .. well, as I said before -DOESN'T ONE SHOT- so I'd have to land, 4-5 hits in a row... Headshots did a ""little bonus"" but diving between crowds to just pelt a guy was pretty fun. - Other weapons, Only get into was the spears, since poking was fun.. It felt very aimbased smooth, only fastest attack -still slow fyi, aiming for peoples feet / side bits doesn't really avoid a block or clash, so you just have to get lucky if they miss their block.- ANTHER WEAPON... estoc. Only because... I HAVE NO IDEA THE STATS OR BONUSES things do... -PRESSES R- Oh, I'm holding my swords blade... and hitting people with the handle? most times, R throw your weapon at them, AMAZING. or.. grip your blade... ? I dont think it did anything to help you besides look weird seeing my hand holding sharp sword bits-

It's weird because this game has a really fun range system, shooting people nd throwing stuff at people so much fun, but soon as you hit into melee, just feels like gritting teeth waiting for 2nd person join to help or end you and finally put you out your misery.

BUT with age? -Community isn't that big.. So most server I joined had a 28? v 28? annnd... max 6v8, odd blue moon full match *rarely* - downside of not playing game when it first comes out / golden era! now playing with the embers that remain. somehow keep the game alive and going. shout out to those level 200 - 300 fans somereason keep playing, that also ragdolled me, as If i'm a toddler V a Pittbull. 

Like all my reviews, I'm not great at seeing what keeps people playing, if this game becomes dirt-cheap, get it and try it.. it's not an OUTRIGHT bad experience, just not -starter friendly at all.. tad weird.. ? tons of goofy moments but most times you'll just be dying. -skill issues yadayda-

I have 2.2k+ hours on this game, and I can't recommend it to any new player.
First off, there's a very well known issue where new players get absolutely demolished by the veterans and have a very frustrating experience all around, they can't even play the game properly. The devs have never done anything to address that, except some ""team balance"" patches that only made thing worse.

The frequency of new content releases is an absolute joke.

Then there's the issue of the Mordhau Mod team. I would have love it if at least one of them was a decent human being, but it appears they're all snarky douchebags.
The official discord is a toxic cesspit (due to the moderators' behavior) and you're more likely to get bullied and muted than getting any actual help from these people.
They also enjoy banning community favorite content creators (LaraBTW), and their disgusting behavior also led Deargrigh to stop playing the game.
I have been wrongfully gamebanned this week.
When I asked why I got gamebanned, I received snarky passive agressive answers from the insanely immature and unprofessional mod team. I managed to get some info, as to why I got gamebanned.
Basically my account was linked to another account that was gamebanned in March 2023, which I've never heard of.
I also know of a friend who got gamebanned, and who was linked to the very same account.
I also know of a random guy who got gamebanned for being linked to the same account.
Keep in mind, none of us has been shown any proof as to what linked said accounts, so I can only guess there.

Now, alt detection systems generally use a combination of hardware info, ip addresses and such. I don't think Mordhau actually has such a system, so it relies on some person who is not very technically proficient to ""do the math"" so to speak.
From the point of view of that person, I'd understand why they'd come to that conclusion. The 3 people who got gamebanned wrongfully all use linux pcs. At least two of them use the same VPN (Mullvad), which means that at some point we may have shared a public facing IP. (VPN IPs are generally public, so this is pretty easy to check, but try and tell that to Mordhau Mods). Two of us have pretty similar hardware (same AMD GPUS).
Now this is understandable, we have very similar systems that are also very different from the systems other players generally use, and  there's also the VPN thing.
What's been bugging me, is the absolute inability of the team to own up to their mistakes. That is not very surprising coming from the mod team, as they're not really known for their level of professionalism, but I've been more shocked at the """"""community manager"""""", who I think is the dev responsible for our bans.

Some of the best matches are the ones where both teams just meme with each other rather than than duking it out. Sometimes I love this game very much.

Take this game seriously and you will hate your life. I have a graveyard of mice that I broke after some BS death (that probably was my fault, but it don't seem that way at the time). High level duelers for whom newton's laws are just a funny set of recommendations, archers that spread rage indiscriminately halfway across the battlefield, brilliant map design that has instakill ballista aimed at the other team's spawn, teammates that are jacking each other off with emotes in spawn rather than contributing anything to a losing game.

In other multiplayer games with high skill curves, like Titanfall 2 or csgo for example, there is at least a way for new players to deal damage to the enemy. In Mordhau, being good at the game means other players cannot deal any damage at all. For reliable kills, or even any damage at all, new players may have to resort to things like burning oil, rock traps, ballistae, which are all teamkill factories.

The armory is imbalanced, with plenty of easy one-shot weapons that don't give you a chance to reciprocate the damage you're taking. It isn't like all the weapons are one or two shot either. With a normal weapon you can expect to kill a guy in three or four clean hits, while zwies and mauls will kill a well-armored player with just a hit to the head. A lot of weapons have such quick parry times and hit speed that it is next to impossible to deal any damage to them at all even if you've been playing for a while (I have more playtime on another launcher). A knife the size of your finger can parry a pole hammer twice your height with ease, and since attacking gives you a huge speed boost the reach of your weapon only occasionally matters. I've been using spear mostly, but I switched to this greatsword one time and good god was it stupid. Every attack traveled at the speed of light by comparison, despite it being a huge hulking plank of steel with zero room on the handle for leverage. 

The rock traps, oil traps, ballistae, throwable stones, even jousting are stupidly overpowered. All these systems grant instant kills except for oil, which might as well. 

This game is cool and you get to run around with a lance or whatever, but the pvp is ludicrously bad. If you're thinking 'Yeah, its bad if you're bad at it lol! ill just become a god at this game and then ill be unkillable!' dude stop. it isn't going to happen. I could write a small essay right now about the teeming convolution of simply performing one singular attack, about every dependency upon dependency upon dependency. Skyrim has one button to attack. Dark Souls has two buttons to attack. Mordhau has a minimum of five buttons that attack, and each of them rely on any of a million other factors. While it is probably possible to learn all that you need to play this game and stand a chance, you will have to do so while surrounded by players who haven't stopped mastering the systems since day 1 of this game's release - and they won't cut you any slack at all. They'll feint with maul seventeen times in a row and one-shot you from full health, and if you manage to parry them perfectly somehow, good luck because they're just going to do it again.

""How can i enjoy this game?""
The answer is to either enjoy the aesthetic of running around with a lance even though you're never going to climb higher than a third of the way down the leaderboard unless even your sweat itself starts sweating. Or, to find friends to play it with. Friends who are polite and don't use this broken game against you. 

""but Cozy Pie, you say all these harsh things about how the game is impossible, but I've seen you at the tops of leaderboards before!""
Okay so. Usually when I kill someone, I have no idea how it happened. My biggest suggestion for spear users is to remember that you don't just have to poke people. It does less damage, but people are unlikely to expect a spear to come in from the side or down from above and you can sometimes get some sneaky damage. But mostly, just stick with other people and add to the noise of combat. it's harder for skilled players to execute feints and accurate parries when there's a dozen weapons being swung around. You're sure to hit something eventually.",1688592247,1688592247,False,1,1,0.483028709888458252,1,True,False,False

An awesome game with a rather ""toxic"" community most of the time.  Altough if you're experienced in ""unwilling"" communities, you'll be able to make do of it (you can also hide your chat), modding support, custom servers, large weaponry to choose from, voice commands and emotes, great base for role-playing, not just a mindless slashing but also well-thought-out combat mechanics.

Altough its start was accompanied by an imbalanced combat, fairly broken-looking animations and numerous flaws in the system, it has gotten better over the last several patches and has become something worth the money and even more so the time spent. It has its flaws but they are survivable.

It's worth mentioning, however, that the learning curve is fairly high as of now and you'll likely have a hard time in your first many hours into the game but if you're willing to learn, it's rewarding.

Edit, almost 2k hours later, bruh:

...just to add something to the aforementioned; custom duel servers are fun as they are modded often too. As of today, to me this game is more of a comedy relief rather than a serious medieval game. Buying it on sale is a good bargain for the fun you get, but the full price of 30€ is debatable given the state of the game. Still, would recommend.

Mord is a first person real life accurate medieval simulation game where the objective is whatever you want it to be. If the objective is maximise seethe by using bows are riding horses against people who are professional metal stick swingers then that is the objective. If the objective is to find and shred the best tune on the lute and start a music festival with half the lobby then that is the objective. If the objective is to become a level 7 trillion player who masters the blade, forgets how to have fun and complains about archers and rage quits every time their 1v1 is interrupted (on a full frontline server btw) then that is the objective. If the objective is to join with your friends, build goofy looking characters, spam voice lines, laugh at the hysterical situations that organically occur in full lobbies with no skill based matchmaking giving the richest experience of having players who are memers, sweats, and everything in between, then that is the objective. 

This game plays just like mid-2000s online games except with only the good innovations of today. There's no micro transactions, just a few DLC things, and other than them everything in the cosmetic store you can play to earn in game gold and buy, everything. For weapons you have to play to unlock them but they're all so cheap other than the cosmetics for them, so you can unlock anything you want to use for your play style from the start and experiment and try new things from there.

Overall this game is a solid 9/10. The game is grounded, rooted and based.",1688301182,1688301182,True,27,0,0.704654812812805176,1,True,False,False

The game is also very fun and satisfying, especially when you pull off a clever move or chop off an enemy’s limb. Mordhau is not a game for the faint of heart, as it can be brutal, challenging, and frustrating at times.

+ Voice acting and sound design are phenomenal. Sets it apart from any other similar game, absolutely fantastic.
+ True-to-history depictions of all kinds of weapons and armor. With lots of customisation! Mordhau = Fashionhau.
+ Looks great. Far from the most realistic graphics you can have but it's just stylised enough to make things look more clear whilst still looking convincingly gritty and gruesome.
+ Level design is lovely and the whole game runs smoothly most of the time. 
+ With great voice acting come a bunch of taunts/emotes. People using these to their fullest give this game so much character. Hilarity ensues.
+ Still getting semi-regular updates at the time of posting this review.
+ I've not been on modded servers (yet) but I've heard/seen that they can be a LOT of fun. A thriving community is always a plus for games like this.

[b]NOT-SO-COOLS[/b]
- NOT EASY to get into at the start. The whole melee-combat-system is based on specific movements, timing and anticipation of your enemy. With lots of veterans around, you don't stand a chance dueling against them. 
- With this come a bunch of builds that are a bane to noobs: Bloodlust Mauls performing constant drags, spamming faints with small arms, stacking ranged attackers... the list goes on. You'll bite the dust a lot in the beginning, learning how to deal with these players is how you crawl out of the noob pool.
- Baffling design choice: Enemies on Blue team covered in blood are hard to make out. If they wanted blood to be this prominent, they should've picked different team colours. Some people  purposely abuse this.
-Hitreg is unreliable. Not sure how or why, I'm not an expert but shortswords/mauls going further then spears is just weird. War Axes are my bane: they reach much further then their model shows and I just can't get used to it.
- Some maps seem unbalanced for either team. Ironically it seems defenders usually have a harder time. Maps with lots of Ballista/Catapult placements and the like tend to be less fun. If Red caps Feitoria mid, it's simply over, gotta wait 15 minutes for the game to end.
- Matchmaking is meh. Finding a match can take ages and due to the relatively small playerbase you won't really find players equal to your skill level. Some veteran players show mercy to newbies, most don't.
- If you're looking for realism: nah. Some people would like to argue that it is, but it really isn't. Swords should have zero effect on heavy armor but they slice right through. Same goes for many small arms and ranged weapons. Imagine trying to BLOCK a downward swing from a Polehammer, not gonna happen without breaking half the bones in your arms. 
- I started out getting my ass kicked. Then started using Spear with light armor and got some kills, getting into it. Suddenly got bunch of heat in chat about how I'm ""a noob r-tard playing the game wrong"" and whatnot. Half of the veteran players out there are very entitled and don't want you to ""ruin their game"". Ignore these fools.
-On the same topic, kinda toxic playerbase. Half of it is in it just for the fun but the other half is in it to be salty and induce salt. Vets bullying noobs, even in the forums, and then wondering why the playerbase is dwindling. This is a big detriment to the longevity of the game.

And that's it mostly. If you're willing to dig through the saltmines to find comedy gold this can be a game for you. But it's not something you learn in 1 day. I've been playing for 150+ hours and most vets still kick my ass no problem.

I should also mention that I no longer play this game, as I have now moved on to Chivalry 2.

And it really does bother me that Steam does not give users an option to have a neutral rating for reviews. I don’t recommend this game, but I also don’t not recommend this game. For the sake of getting the review posted, I looked back at my last sessions in the game, and have decided if you can get to that point, hundreds of hours later, this game is a thumbs-up from me. 

So first off, let’s actually talk about what made this game intriguing to me. For one, I had a friend who played it and I thought it couldn’t hurt to play alongside him. Secondly, it just seemed fluid. That was from the way melee combat works in games like this, and I believe it is just a superior way to create a melee combat system.

In my garbage opinion, this game has a very nice and welcoming appearance. I haven’t played seriously for several years now, but I still think it has a very good look as a game. Maps like Feitoria, Castello, and Grad capture the glorified chaos of a medieval siege. Maps like Camp, Taiga, and Crossroads all give off the vibe of a blood-stained field as the sounds of clashing weapons and battle cries of warriors with no end in sight. 

And it’s not just the maps that are beautiful. The customization is on-point. The amount of options to choose from is fantastic. Torso armor, leg armor, helmets, hairstyles, beards, decals for your armor and equipment. Weapon customization is too fun. Everything from the guard, handle, pommel, and blade can be tailored to you, and we’re not talking about the insanely expensive and badass custom skins for some weapons that cost tens to hundreds of thousands of gold. Every soldier on the battlefield feels truly unique.

But the main pro of this game is its individualism in the genre of medieval combat, something that not even Chivalry 2 has done. 

In Mordhau, the player has the option to switch the combat style of their weapon with the press of a button. If there isn’t an alternate style to use, you’ll just be your weapon in the direction you're facing. This is how Mordhau got its name, after the longsword style invented by German Knights. The Mordhau Grip, or Mordstreich or Mordschlag which translates roughly to “Murder Stroke” allowed a person wielding a longsword to hold the weapon by it’s blade and use the pommel and guard as a blunt weapon in the event a heavily armored opponent should appear.
Most weapons in the game have an alternate style that gives some bonus or advantage at the cost of another. 

Mordhau is also sometimes very rewarding. Imagine if you will, me playing this game, with some 300-ish hours of experience. Dressed like a viking warrior with a battle ax in hand, cleaving through enemies with ease, parrying and chambering strikes, and winning or losing the match feeling proud of how far I have come in this game. What you didn’t see though, is the frustration, the brutality, and the agonizing grind it takes every player to get to.

THE CONS

Simply, this game is unbelievably fucking hard. So hard that I started to feel bad for annihilating new players, knowing that they were in the same spot as I was. The bottom of the fucking leaderboard. 

Mordhau’s sharp learning curve is what I think contributes most to players quitting. Though I wouldn’t call it a learning curve but more of a learning cliff that is on fire and covered in hideous half-naked giggling dudes with golden war mauls. Being a new player to this game is tough, as it teaches you that life is pain and pain is mandatory, as you die from every swing, stab, thrown javelin, catapult, horse, fire bomb, maul, arrow, ballista bolt, teammate, rock, cannonball, spike, bear trap, and deformed dung-covered peasant caving your skull in with a FUCKING FRYING PAN.

The amount of times I died without even getting a measly assist was so great that I couldn’t even rage properly. I would just close the game, turn off my computer and pace around my room in total silence. Pure agony and self-loathing.


So if you have a high-tolerance for a high skill level with little to no mercy and have the determination to get there, then play Mordhau.

If you don’t, then go play Chivalry 2 it's much easier and more casual and is made for hopping in and fighting in glorious medieval warfare.

Secondly, is the high level players with 1000-3000 hours in this game that have learned the ways that the game didn't know how it can be played. These are people who will read a review like this and scream SKILL ISSUE SKILL ISSUE SEEMS LIKE YOU MAD. 

Yes, there is a very steep learning curve on this game and you need a lot of hours invested in this game to reach a decent level. However, the problem is you are playing against people who have literally 6 months of their life invested in learning how to exploit the living daylights out of this game and if you are a new player it's like a baby fighting a prime Mike Tyson. 

Things I have seen such players do is:
- contort their body model in ways that should not be possible, making it impossible to read their attack swing
- block 4 attacks from 4 different sides while barely moving an inch
- block and then block again before the cooldown for being able to block again is over
- block an attack from directly behind them from a person they were not already in combat with and did not know where there
- swing weapons faster than an accel (a sped up swing) allows, usually with zero reaction time and with a heavy slow weapon that does immense damage
- sprint while attacking where a normal attack swing would slow you down to a crawl

Couple this with bad hitboxes and no damage spread on weapon swings (even as the weapon swing ends, where it is least dangerous, it does the same damage as the apex of the swing) and you get ""veterans"" sprinting around the battlefield in figures of 8's who you cannot hit but they sure can hit you and they will cut down 5-10-15 people before running off or getting shot by an archer or something. I have seen this people end matches with scores of 150+ kills and less than 10 deaths. The game is shocking at matchmaking so you can get 3 or 4 of these players on one team and that means every life you are coming up against a maniac that you cannot touch, maybe even 2 at a time and then you donion rings. 

To top it all off these are some of the most toxic people in the community, surprise surprise the people with no life are toxic, shocking I know... but they aren't the only ones. The majority of the dwindling playerbase is awful and as numbers shrink you will find yourself coming up against level 200+ toxic exploiters every single match. 

It doesn't help that there's about 2 decent maps and one okay gamemode. Expect players to flee the server as soon as a DLC map is loaded because they are awful, but so are some of the base game maps. 

I will admit that I was never a ""good"" player at this game, but I was competent and that is what most people trying to play this game will be and that's why I strongly suggest you avoid this game like the plague. You will enjoy 10% of the gameplay when you come across a fight around your skill level and the other 90% is getting your head smashed in by people who are exploiting so hard that they must be playing with 100 million dpi on their mouse, macros and who knows what else they do. Yes they are skilful and better than me and most others but how they play the game is not how a normal player can play the game.

I sincerely regret re-downloading this game and I will never play it again and I hope you don't too. The only reason this game has any players is because the only competitor it has is chivalry 2 and that's no better. You might as well just stick your nuts between the rock and the hard place. If you're reading this thinking ""git gud"" then maybe consider getting a life. I don't want to learn to break a game just to be in a chance of a fair fight, you are everything that is wrong with this game and the community.",1687116268,1687116640,False,6,0,0.529994368553161621,0,True,False,False

The controls are wonky and don't really work like they're supposed to. I could see this game being incredible with VR tech, but with a keyboard or controller it's too much to deal with. It would work better, if while you hold down the mouse button it would just be a swingable weapon with the movement of the mouse instead of clicking swing or parry. They didn't put enough thought into the weapon swings. It's ""Overly complicated"" to do the basic moves. You can hit someone 6 times and they wont die yet die in 1 swing from people constantly. There isn't really a balance in the game. Little kids using autoblock and aimbot as well killed this one pretty quickly for me.

CONS: 

1) It's not realistic at all; the armor is incredibly unrealistic in terms of functionality. Weapons that realistically should do tons of damage do little damage. Weapons that shouldn't be slow are super slow. You can only throw a handful of weapons, and items like Firebomb are constantly abused and ruin immersion. Tons of immersion-breaking and unrealistic features that I will touch on later.

2) Vote-kicking is entirely unfair; you can be the top of the leaderboard (I always am) and everyone can kick you for no reason, and with how dead the game is there are very little servers to join to resume gameplay. You can do very little team damage and someone can say you're a Team-killer and boom you're gone. 

3) Moderation is unfair and unethical; if a mod or admin is in your server they may or may not (based on personal bias) mute, kick, or suspend you. Unprofessonial to say the least.

4) There is no progression; there's no point in investing your time when you can log in and be the same as you were a year ago when you started. The only 'progression' is making gold from playing to buy cosmetics. Most of which are unimpressive.

5) The notorious infamous and ridiculous unbalance; Everything is awfully balanced. 1H weapons are better than any 2H, especially Scimitars as they deal more damage than a literal Zweihander. Firebombs, horses, catapults, mortars, throwing rocks, and throwables, are all cheap, unrealistic buggy disasters. Horses get stuck on EVERYTHING and their physics make no sense. They fall a few inches and they die. Running into people with horses does tickling minimal damage, whereas realistically you'd be lucky to survive a horse trampling you. Catapults & mortar projectiles explode as if they had some kind of explosive composition to them; they don't. Especially in early history periods, they just lobbed rocks & boulders, THEY DID NOT EXPLODE AREAS. Throwables like Rocks & Throwing Axes do more damage than most weapons and are beyond obnoxious in multiplayer games as everyone uses them. Punching dealing any damage to something in plate armor makes no sense at all. You can chamber a punch with a punch, and you can chamber a punch with a weapon (which would skin that arm off). Swinging a weapon only a few times tires your character out completely, despite the fact that everyone is built like greek god with chiseled abs and huge muscles, super unrealistic. Stabs & swings dealing full damage despite having no momentum at the end of their attack cycle makes no sense. Nor does a full swing glancing blow not dealing damage despite still having momentum. Arrows dealing any damage to plate armor is total bs.

Along with that, the better ping you have, the more the game caters to you. You can perfectly block something but if your ping isn't less than 50 it won't always connect and you die. This breaks immersion and obviously reduces realism as well.

6) The toxicity; the entire community is toxic, and it's what you get when a neglected indie game run by incompetent devs create a highly-competitive multiplayer slasher. Everyone hates everyone else, Every server you join people are shit-talking eachother spewing toxic garbage and projecting their self-hatred unto others. Furthermore there's tons of griefers and TKers, teammates will destroy your buildings you make or trap you in places which may damage, kill, or slow you down. They will suicide as the Noble/Warden losing it for your team on purpose. They will attack you (but not kill you in order to avoid being auto-kicked) or get in your way on purpose. They will block doorways and give enemies free ripostes in 1vX scenarios.

7) They ruined team balance; it wasn't perfect before, but now you cannot even choose your own teams. And the auto-assign algorithm is a joke. It will put all the 100-200-ranked players on one team, and 50s and noobs on the other. If there are +5 more people on one team it will not reshuffle teams, it will continue the unfair match and you lose because of spaghetti game coding. NEARLY EVERY MATCH IS ONE-SIDED. There is a tiny chance you'll be reassigned if you reconnect using the devconsole.

8) Lack of updates, content, & critical features; There are no female character options, and it was only late 2021 that they added black-ish skin tone. And it isn't even fully black it's Arabic. If you want to call that white male supremacy go ahead, I won't stop you. Personally I wouldn't call it that, I just think the devs don't really care about the game. There's maybe a few stale shallow updates a year, they add a few weapons (that are always unbalanced), mostly more unimpressive cosmetics, maybe a map or two. They have hardly any support for the modding community, and have no setup in the Workshop, despite the fact that the modding community could have saved the game from being this dead. Which brings me to my next point...

9) Face it, the game is dead; there is hardly anyone playing anymore, and everyone that does is a sweatlord high-level like myself. Servers are rarely filled, and there's only a few servers even in the U.S. that you can catch some game-play. It's such a small community that I see the same people in every server each time I play.

10) They have terrible server locations; Good luck playing on anything but U.S. servers for decent ping. There are only 1 (maybe 2) servers in other countries. And as a north-central player (Wisconsin) there are no servers near me so I am forced to play with constant 80+ ping. The servers they say are 'Central' are down by Texas and are hardly in the center of the country. I play on East, West, and Central, and I get no different in ping, I always get 80+. Which is awful for a hyper-reactive game like Mordhau.

11) There's a ton of bugs; nothing super game-breaking, and not critical enough to file a report, but just enough to piss you off every time you try to play. Startup crashes, map crashes, swings being caught by nothing, invisible collision boxes in terrain, exploit spots in maps, getting hit through a perfect block, rag-dolling from the smallest falls and dumbest reasons, chambering is so inconsistent and works maybe 50% of the time despite timing and angling it perfectly.

PROS: 

1) The memes are gold; The game CAN be hilarious if you've lost the will to care anymore and if you break immersion. You will not have fun if you are actually engaged in pure gameplay.

Edit:
After a year or so after writing, they've added white female characters and that's it. Lol. No women of color at all, and most of the updates they push are now loaded with over-priced cosmetic DLCs. They add little to no value or content to the game.

The game is still as bad as it used to be, all they did this year really is release game for free on the Epic Games store. Except that;
 the game security is failing and exploiters are rampant, spawning in mounts and catapults outside the map and shoot people inside it. 
And the servers are constantly lagging with packet loss for almost everyone in the U.S.",1648742540,1686790031,False,36,9,0.606252491474151611,0,True,False,False

What do we have 5 years later:
-same absolutely ATROCIOUS community
-same cancer combat abuses, though not being as extreme as in chiv 1
-same point at which some people have so little life that you can not tell them apart from a cheater
For your own sanity, please, for the love of god, only play this with friends, on your own server or find some people who will genuinely have fun with you. There are almost no people left here who still follow some sort of local ""etiquette"" or even having fun, not only playing ""by the gamerules"" and tryharding left and right. Last Epic community integration only made all things above WORSE by allowing previously banned d*ckheads to go back to the game.
Don't get me wrong - game is good and very fun. But it was tempered with by both players and devs to the point of being ridiculously unbalanced, thanks to some whiny high-levels. 
 Now you don't trigger your own bear traps, apparently because that somehow was a problem for your team, not because they are freaking blind idiots.
 Now tier 3 (heavy) armour guy will chase you down while you are naked, because ""duels were too long"" and that was ""not fun to chase people around"", yeah, sure boss, now you almost killed one of the playstyles which actually rewarded some f*cking skill and not animation abuse or feint spam.
 Now they boosted kick to the point of being ""if you are sooo dumb that you can't win anyhow - press that button"", preposterously fast and unreasonably high damage + thru block included, nice job
 And as a nail in the coffin, at some point during updates they added an official servers rules. Which in practice means, even if you don't bother anyone or use exploits/bugs to win - you can get banned. Reason? Exploit = bad. THEN FIX THEM NOT USING TAPE THAT WILL BE BROKEN 24H LATER
 Reminder, game was and maybe still is fine, community is mostly toxic and garbage. If you want some kind of swordplay - go and play Hellish Quart, Chiv 2 or even god damn For Honor if you for a bit more fighting/arcady style. Every spark of joy you will get here will be demolished by some salty 200 (like me) or their adepts. Thanks for taking your time to read through that dumpster fire of mine.

No one is really playing this game, except most of the time it's just one guy swinging a mallet at the speed of light with a score higher than all the other current online players combined.

As with the other ""medieval hand to hand multiplayer games"" of this type, players can exploit the animations to achieve unstoppable attacks and easily win . The community of course is heavily divided on this subject, some claiming this is part of the game and to ""get good"" , others - like me - saying it is COMPLETELY AND UTTERLY BULLSHIT to be able to swing to abuse this system to swing the heaviest and slowest weapons in the game faster than an average player can swing the fastest

-------------------------------------------------------------

If you dont own Mordhau already then you are probably new or inexperienced to this genre of game. 
This review is for you. 
[b] In its current state, i would [u]not recommend[/u] you buy Mordhau unless its heavily discounted (75%+).[/b] 

In a nutshell, I will describe a typical online PVP match..

When a match starts, a majority of the experienced players will jump into spectator mode and watch the teams fill. The purpose of this is to stack the match. So expect all those super pro, fancy skins, high ranking players to be on the same team. This means, if you dont get on that stacked team fast, you will be stuck with the new or learning players that will team kill, team wound, not play the objective, and generally not work together through no fault of their own. 

There are also a few clans that like to pub stomp. Mordhau does not support VOIP so those players on discord have a crazy advantage vs you on your team of mute players.

Now that the teams are super stacked (the meta), the loosing team will now also get to deal with their own frustrated players team killing/team wounding. Which makes anyone on the loosing team with some skill either leave the server or troll because they understand what is happening. The match ends, the map changes and the broken game-play loop starts over.

You will often see the top players on the winning team with ridiculous kill-to-death ratios because they understand the meta (the animation exploits, the weapon exploits, and the map exploits) and farm the casual players. It only takes 3-4 'pro-players' to stack a 24v24 match. Plus there are those who use macros/scripts to give them an advantage.

The weapon mechanics/balance are also.... just bad. Of all the weapon/armor combos that mordhau has to offer, there are only a handful of weapon/armor combos that are being used by the experienced players because they are just so over powered. Swords and pole-arms that can magically phase through multiple dudes in heavy armor causing lots of damage, hammers that seem to instantly swing and one shot. Also, once a player kills another player, they get a bit of health restored (makes no sense) so the better you are the more and faster you get kills. 

Now for the Mordhau Community, oh how toxic. Admins and mods arent really a thing with Mordhau. There is a player controlled voting system that shows team damage%  Is someone trolling you? Vote-kick them (if you can figure out how to do it). Just know, most of the time the vote doesnt pass or they just troll without causing team damage. If you get targeted by a troll, the only real thing to do is switch servers and hope you get to be on the stacked team.

If you have the cash to burn and dont mind the frustrating learning curve, then go for it. You may have a good time. There is even kind of a PvE mode, although only the Mordhau modding community seems to want to expand on it.

Otherwise, Mordhau will turn into one of those uninstalled games in your library.

Game is still dead, game is still trash with animation exploits and janky combat. Don't buy it.

Old review pretty much still stands. Came back because I was looking for something with melee combat, and MH has had a large number of updates. Horde mode is much better, but the game is dead as a doornail. From what I can see when I play there's no more than maybe 30 players online at any time and thats over all servers I could see. The only people who are here are the three 1000 hour gigachads or the few casual people picking this game up because all the gigachads left

Old Review: Game looks cool, has a complex combat system that's difficult to learn and harder to master. The weapons don't behave like you'd expect. Everyone's running 2hands because they've nerfed everything else into oblivion.The game is constantly filled with toxic racists who will shit talk you and drop N-words on you at will. Not to mention they've all probably played Chivalry and this game since launch so you're gonna get annihilated. The only time the game wasn't unfairly aggravating was when I was farming the absolutely broken AI on Horde mode for Gold and XP.

It's more subtle and complicated than it looks, and has a very high skill ceiling. However, I think this is all based on wrong game design. 

The game has a precise physics engine, blades really need to touch your body to apply damage. That means if you pull the camera up, your character will lean back and you can dodge things that way. And that's awesome. 

The problem with that however, is that you can also rotate the camera and character while performing a hit animation. That means you can either delay a hit, speed up a hit, or completely obfuscate any animation. In short, good players will look unreadable, and an immobile blade will suddenly one strike kill you. That to me is bad game design and highly frustrating.

Some people might find it fun though, not me, not at all. I had fun the first 2 hours and the other 4 hours where I tried to learn and improve were just pure pain. I also don't like the idea of not looking at what happens in the game in order to be better at the game, as moving your camera around to become unreadable will make you look away most of the time.

I'll also add that a lot of the high risk moves give 0 reward, you can learn to parry, chamber, dodge, ect... None will create a punish window, the enemy can defend just fine after you countered them. The only strategy is to be unpredictible and unreadable and stress your opponent, and I suspect that at high skill levels, the game becomes all random guesses.",1685649021,1685649021,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

the west US servers are addled with connection issues and despite what the developers might say, they ""haven't always been this bad."" they down budgeted their server pool right after the epic games debacle and hit US west hardest with the shitty performing servers.

one of the main redeeming qualities of this game is the absolutely irreplaceable experience that is free for all. very funny, expressible, and high skill ceiling gamemode. that being said, don't get your hopes too high because chances are, it's far too late.

if you plan on playing this game for the free for all experience don't even fucking bother, even if you manage to play during a low traffic hour and the servers are behaving as expected, you're probably going to be forced into playing one of the 3 absolute most idiotic experiences ever conceived in the 21st century.

you can have the pleasure of being forced into:

[b]Sword Game:[/b] 
more like, bored game! its a gamemode designed to be fun for all skill levels right? wrong. this gamemode is designed to incentivise 'scummy' gameplay. you will not finish a single fucking fight because this gamemode allows perks! such as tank and flesh wound. even if the opponent doesnt have one or both of those perks, the chances of your fight being ruined by someone desperate to finally get past the 'rusty sickle.' you cannot blame the player for this, because they are doing exactly what they have to do to win the gamemode. you COULD argue that the gamemode allows for newer players to become familiar with a variety of weapons, but if you did then you would look and sound like a fool without any ability to think ahead. how is a player supposed to learn a weapon if at the very moment they are finally able to kill someone with a weapon they're forced to use a new one. you COULD argue that it allows for slightly experienced players to become familiar with weapons that they'd otherwise not tried yet, and to that i ask, what was stopping them before? if someone is interested at all in the prospect of using a new weapon they can at any point without hesitation just use the weapon of their choice. you COULD argue that it nerfs the experienced and overly seasoned players to give the newer players a chance, and to that i ask you, have you ever played a game of sword game? because every time i play it all i see is 8 noobs swinging around themselves flagrantly and completely unaware of what they are doing and over on the other side of the map you will see 2-5 people going nuts at eachother and winning based solely on whoever is on the better weapon at the moment. oh and one final note about this gamemode, even if it isn't necessarily a direct result of the gamemode being as insufferable as it is, for SOME FUCKING REASON, a reason only god knows and nobody else, not even the devs, this gamemode is the [i]ONLY[/i] gamemode that will allow you to play their second most recent map, Arid. hell it's not even a good map, but it only goes to show that the developers quite actually don't even consider brawl when procuring the hot garbage that they sell us. they never mentioned it's absence in brawl either. i begged them in their precious discord echo chamber countless times to add the brawl variant of the god forsaken map to the official brawl server map rotations and i was blatantly ignored. fun fact: the deathmatch version of the map file exists and can be loaded into with ease, it's even customized to be a bit smaller to accommodate for the lower player count compared to FL/INV, they just never fucking cared enough to. 

[b]Team Deathmatch:[/b]
this is just a watered down version of the gamemodes that the developers want you to play anyway. this gamemode is addled with missed opportunities, blaring oversights, and just a general lack of polish. you will find that in almost all of the maps that feature team deathmatch there are two large areas dedicated to hosting each opposing team's spawn areas. these areas also host a team discriminate kill zone, basically screaming in bright neon signs, ""[b]SIT HERE, AND SHOOT THE ENEMIES WITH PROJECTILES, THE CANNOT DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT[/b]"" 

[b]Skirmish:[/b]
this gamemode is a lot like team deathmatch, except there are no kill zones, there is no respawning, and the score is first team to 7 rounds won. the developers cannot be blamed for this, but it's still worth mentioning because you will likely have to sit through it. most of the time you will be booty blasted by 2 or more people that are already better than you anyway, and once the only skilled player on your team is the last one standing, you will have to watch them decimate 5-8 people with ease. do that 7-13 times and boom, that is the skirmish experience.

(Edit, I did buy all of the dlcs but that's just because personally I don't want to see the game die, but from an outside perspective considering that they've said it themselves they want to move on to other stuff I wouldn't expect much more out of Triternion, for the devs, GIVE ME A LION HELM WITH THE VISOR DOWN DAMN YOU!!!)",1685554375,1685554528,False,1,0,0.515503883361816406,0,True,False,False

I've spent about 10 hours on public games modes and about 290 hours playing with my friends. 

Why?

1) There's no skill-based matchmaking in the team mode public servers, and the skill ceiling is so absurdly unreachably high that on the casual servers with brand new players on there are always people with multiple thousands of hours (level 200+ players) who are effectively invincible, and there's always 5 or 6 on each team. Even if you play for a few hundred hours you'll just get crushed literally every time in a 1v1 and never win.  I mean never. Not once. You will never, ever beat them. Like Magnus-Carlsen-playing-chess-against-a-crab never. They call it ""pubstomping""; they pick the one hit kill weapons / totally broken animation weapons (mauls, polehammers or zweihanders usually) and go 120+ kills for 5 deaths regularly. Almost all of them use ultra-wonky weird unreadable or invisible animations mixed with perfect knowledge of the advanced game mechanics so you don't even know how you died and can't learn.

This is fine, people are better at games than me, that's cool - I just don't know why they feel the need to throw brand new players into horribly unfun situations where you die thousands of times and can't even learn why. In other heavily skill based games, they at least TRY to balance the teams, and keep the super good players in their own games. I don't want to be in a situation where I need 1000 hours of gametime to not feel like it's pointless to even try.

2) This is my main complaint - servers don't auto-balance teams. The above point #1 would be fine perhaps if the above players were reasonably distributed in 48 or 64 player servers, but at peak hours having a server where you've got 6 of the above level 200+s farming the entire enemy team on their own at 30 kills / 2-3 deaths each after 4/5 minutes happens ALL THE TIME - genuinely, more often than not - with none of them being force-moved to balance it out. On Mountain Peak, for instance, you can easily be completely spawnlocked and often be killed less than a second after spawning by people running into the 5 second killzone just to crunch your head before you're even spawned and run out again. 

What's worse, the above people don't even want any challenge, they just want to ruin people's day and Make Kill Number Go Up, so if they're on the losing side where they might - shock, have a challenge from equally skilled players - they'll actively switch TO the already stacked team so they're just stomping new players.

3) This is THE most toxic, racist, sexist, homophobic, mean group of people in public servers I've ever played in any game, and that's saying something. They'll just be horrible to you and taunt you and be nasty in chat as they crush you. 

If you play only with friends then Mordhau is an absolutely wonderful, compelling, hugely fun game in all the individual game, team, horde, and skirmish gamemodes. You learn together, there are no horrible people, you can laugh at the limbs flying and the beartraps and silly voices and gestures, it is incredibly good fun, it isn't horribly dispiriting and toxic and unfun.

If you play public game modes the opposite is true. If your idea of fun is going 5 kills for 30 deaths against invincible one-hit-kill murderbots with the absolute worst people on the internet screaming racism in chat constantly, until you've spent 1000+ hours plus, play the public servers. 

So yeah, play it - just don't bother playing it with pubbies.",1674245822,1685453705,True,1,0,0.520547926425933838,0,True,False,False

If you play casually like I did you will have a okay time. eventually you will get the hang of it, the player base is mostly leveled up and super toxic. I suggest you turn chat off if you get mad easily cuz it seems that it what it is for now. I still play this game but its VERY unbalanced like most game will not even be close. You will have the occasional good game where it's actually close but most game ur team is either very badly losing or dominating the whole game(talking about the main mode frontline). I would suggest if you decide to play this game get it on a sale and stick to duel matches and rp servers. The main mode is very frustrating to the point where I have to stop playing this game now. Even being at the top of the leader board still feels like losing.

renew now I am suggesting people to not buy this game on sale. The fan base kick me because I kept saying the game was unbalanced uninstalling now If i could get a refund I would what a shit fan base. I got kicked from a server for doing this this game itself is addicting and I would suggest if you don't wanna get angry everytime you play play something else for honor, skyrim, orginal chiv maybe cant take this game anymore I'm done.


I was angry when I wrote that post above, I still play this game. Damn this is sad now. I'm not gonna give this a good review, but its so addictive. I would say just turn chat off and don't talk to trolls. You will have a okay time.

another edit yep: I like this game I currently have over 200 hours, and I can say this is fun when you are near the top of the leader board almost every game. also turn off chat and good game.

edit again lol: So like the playerbase in this game literally makes this game the worse sometimes, like the playerbase will intentionally kick people because a troll told them too its crazy, im ashamed to be apart of this shit fanbase the worse fanbase ive ever encounter if you dont want more stress in your life don't buy this game, its terrible im prolly gonna end up getting chiv 2. I was mad before at this point just disappointed at the playerbase, its so fucking saddening.

7th edit I have a love and hate relationship with this game, it is very toxic.

ehh Im just gonna get chiv 2 only tryhards play this game now not near as fun, so chiv 2 is dying, but this game feels so good when ur winnning but terrible when ur losing.

 I've wasted 341 hours of my life, its mostly regret. I'm a level 69 now so see ya Mordhau I've done my job. 🖕

Wow! just wow! 
This game in a current state and this game on the release in far 2019 are the different games. Amazing UE4 optimization (100+ bots on a map + lots of fire effects, all maxed out and no lags at all\GPU loaded on 93-95%\3080ti\1440p). 
Graphics\map design is top of the top. I really like how it looks!
Soundtrack - i really like that menu music!
 Those devs who, actually, could handle UE4. (Insurgency:Sandstorm (2018) devs should ask them how to do that - sad, but true)
Added builds. Dunno when it was happened, but whoa, now we're talking! Slaying mobs in PvE is so much fun! ( not every time ppl realize what to do, but thats definitely not a devs prob)
Devs finally have fixed that annoying server lag in any region, when ur ping went to the space for no reason.

Now i can say, this game is not a Chivalry or M&B series clone. Thats a different one - kinda  parallel universe infernal slasher, if we are talking about PvE.
Glad to see still new comers in this game and people, who have come back after a while, like me.

Definitely worth the money i have spent on this title!



[strike] ps It looks like a demo. That interface, input lag(1440p\high\80fps), button Q stop working for no reason some times :\ when u press TAB u cant scroll the list, but obviously u could do that.

UPD. Servers are broken.packet loss all the time. Highest ping ever. My network is ok. and i dont have any troubles with ping in another titles, except this one. Guess devs just left this game after M&B announcement.

Upd. 2

<<You do not have any debugging symbols required to display the callstack for this crash.>> Well, seriously, ive been waitin for that update 17 - 1st run and crash :\

The medieval combat, armour and environments were fun (until pvp)

Cons:
The veteran players with thousands of hours in the game make coming into the game as a new player an absolute hellscape and completely suck all the joy and fun out of the game immediately, put your ego aside and let new players learn the game. Also why is there 0 repercussions and cooldown for using the feint mechanic, but you have a mini asthema attack and have to wait 2 seconds before blocking again.

almost half the weapons are unbalanced and genuinely OP, why are there instant kill weapons in this game? Why? Why are shields bad in your MEDIEVAL COMBAT game, certain weapons are so useless that only a small handful are meta or even worth using, which makes combat incredibly stale when you get killed by the 12th level 200 with the exact same weapon in a row in a game. I'm shitting myself from excitement wow. Also the animation abusers, auto blockers and people with way too much free time on their hands which suck the fun out of combat when they do weird animation tricks to hit you multiple times before you can even block or go through your block by abusing an attack animation.

Play the game for just under 2 hours then refund it. the devs will literally never fix the game or balance it properly and from i've heard, may ban me for this review which is just lovely",1684624784,1684625327,False,5,0,0.510462641716003418,0,True,False,False

Overall, I am very split on this game. 

This game can very fun and you can have a lot of hilarious experiences if you just chill out and relax. 
On the other hand, this game has the be one of the sweatiest and most toxic game I have played. I have not played this game in its prime so this is going off someone who his ""new"". 

The community is a very mixed bag, either being full of tryhards who use every technique they learned for years playing the game after hundreds of hours, or you will get players who just run around and try to make people laugh. You'll either get people getting angry in chat over their team not winning or pulling their weight, or you will have players ruin every potential or current moment of joy, ultimately making this games player count dwindle more than it already has. For example, if you play the Archer class or have a character with a bow/crossbow, you will be heavily targeted and trashtalked in the chat for a playstyle they don't want you to have the choice of using. 

This game is very against new players, everyone has hundreds or even thousands of hours of experience and most of these players will stop at nothing at making you miserable through feints (faking an attack), drags (purposely making your weapon move slow mid swing), and acells (making your weapon move quickly mid swing). All of these I had to learn myself, as this community does not care enough to teach you. You will have to learn yourself either through tutorials or through punishment from these techniques. 

If you decide to purchase this game, just don't go to deep into it. Oh, and don't expect any updates that have any importance. Their last update was armor you have to pay with micro-transactions, voicepacks you have to pay through micro-transactions, skins you have to pay through micro-transactions, and 1 gamemode which is just gun game with swords. This is after what I estimate to be after 9 months without an update.

High level PvP is basically the equivalent of triple distilled skunk spray being pumped directly into your sinuses and mouth. It's genuinely the most nonsensical, unenjoyable, iredeemable combat to ever exist in any game.
It's basically just peopled doing ballerina dances and then dealing 75 damage with a drag that doesn't even touch you on your screen followed immediately by an accel that comes out 2 milliseconds slower than your block recovery. Alternatively, they'll literally miss you completely, and then curve space and time by dragging their weapon back into you and dealing full damage. This isn't just some noob ramblings about how high level combat is trash because I don't understand it, you genuinely have to have something wrong with you to do high level PvP in this game.

Low level combat is very similar, with people basically just swinging entirely at random, completely ignoring any sort of feints or morphs and gambling everything, forcing you into a parry-riposte back and forth that will always result in the bigger weapon winning.
New players very quickly discover the simplest method of overwhelming the opponent with attacks that are so idiotic it almost instantaneously gives you brain cancer.

The only redeeming quality to this game is that if you completely abandon any hope of competitive or casual fun in any way shape or form, you can discover an incredibly niche sweaty butt-crack of fun. You simply find the dumbest, least effective strategy in the game, and revel in the fact that whether you kill your opponent or die, it will leave them thoroughly confused.

I've heard time and time again of cronchwrap banning people for retaliating against griefers, and slapping lengthy mutes on people for typing out jokes in the chat.

In this super gory and violent game, you'd better not say the wrong thing or play in any way that isn't completely sweaty and hyperfocused on the objective, or you're going to get hit with harsh punishments by some of the most insufferable and pathetic individuals this game's community ever shit out.

I'm honestly split on whether or not I'm happy the game's population has sunken once again - and to be honest I'm leaning towards being happy about it.

It can happen at any time, and lasts about 0.5 to 2 seconds. Rarely the same will happen to mouse X and Y movement, where the camera is suddenly locked in place for 0.5 to 2 seconds. These two types of input drops happen separately from one another. I can regularly expect these drops to ruin the flow of combat multiple times every match. (Neither occurs within menus)

I have experienced these drops using both my previous G204 and my current G205 Logitech mice. However, they never occur with any other game or program - Only Mordhau. SOMETHING within Mordhau is the cause of the problem, but I don't know what - and I've wasted too much time trying to figure it out.

Just to be perfectly clear, I am aware of swing cooldowns. I know when they activate and when they end. The dropped inputs I am referring to are entirely separate from the swing cooldown system, unlike what some elitists often claim. As an example, I could be running away from a group in horde mode, turn to clip a couple fellows with a swing, and *click* - nothing, I simply just don't attack.

This happens so frequently that I've even unintentionally built up some muscle memory around it. Once an input drop occurs, I'll start spamming left click, desperate for an input to be registered. Of course, that doesn't work out too well. Best one can hope for is evasive footwork and body manipulation, and that another few inputs aren't dropped again for a while.

Oh, right, this is a review.
Well, I guess can't say anything else others here haven't already. Drags are busted, animation abuse is the meta, new players are endlessly pummeled into quitting, etc, you know the drill already.
Also, all of the official servers suffer from constant connection issues due to packet loss. The real cause? Who knows - but complaining about it is the main topic of conversation within those servers half the time. Perfectly fair, sometimes it becomes genuinely unplayable. For as big of an issue this is, I have not heard tell of it being addressed... 

Overall I can't really recommend Mordhau. It's super fun, and I can't get enough of the game itself, (even with stale repetitive gamemodes and all these rampant issues, Triternion did make a fun game) but it's unfortunately not an environment friendly to new players. It wouldn't be even if everyone was kind and well-adjusted. That's just the nature of the learning curve. It's such that it started out steep, but has become nearly vertical. I can't imagine starting fresh with zero prior knowledge would be much fun at this stage of the game's life cycle unless you are playing specifically with friends. However, since there's no way to host a private lobby without paying a third party, (Unreal Engine prevents you from joining a LAN server hosted on the same machine) prepare yourself and your compatriots to be gangstalked from server to server by toxic high levels.

Pros:
- Deep combat. You can spend hundreds of hours training, and there will always be something new to learn.
- Great character customization. Tons of different armor, weapons, weapon skins, perks, etc
- Voicelines. The voicelines are iconic
- Clear skill progression. Your ability to do well in this game is based solely on your own muscle memory and own ability. There are no skills that level up with your character or anything of that nature.
- Some members of the community are amazing.

Cons:
- Fighting well can be entirely based on network connection. In low tick-rate servers or with a high latency network connection animations will break. It will be difficult to read your opponent(s) and the game becomes rather janky.
- Slow updates. Game is fairly old and the devs are working on a new game.
- Small map selection for team-based game modes. There have been new maps added since release, but the amount of maps is less than 10.
- Like in any PVP game, some of the members of the community are extremely toxic, especially to new players.
- Some of the animations don't make much sense.
- Tutorial doesn't cover half of the core fighting mechanics.

I cant in good faith suggest this game to anyone who isnt already in the supreme tism that this game attracts. It, at it's core, is a very cool and fun game where the customization is as broad as your imagination and the fights/servers are typically fun, intense and gory. I picked this up on day 1 and was having a ton of fun, but by the end of the first week after release the sweatiest stinkiest neck beards were already busting down the gates and making this game unplayable for the common person trying to casually game. I put usually 30 to 50 hours on most games that i pick up because i dont have a ton of free time to play; this game is not the place for players like me to have fun. I tried coming back after a long break to try again and i couldnt even get a single kill because i was parried and viciously shit on to the point of submission and uninstalled again. 

Chiv 2 is a lot easier of a game thats more friendly to the weekend warrior that'll play when they can and maybe hit 20 hours in a year. You wont get the level of customization and unique weapons from mordhau, you wont get the mechanics that mordhau offers, you wont get some of the funny moments from mordhau, but you will be able to have fun as a casual gamer who just wants to swing big swords and play a game with knights in it against other casuals. 

If youre a pretty intense gamer and have a ton of time and desire to master one of the hardest dueling medieval games that exist, the $30 price tag wil be absolutely nothing compared to the amount of hours youll dump in this game to be able to compete at even the lowest tier of regular players.

The game features a complex combat system that allows players to perform a wide range of attacks, blocks, and parries. The combat is both challenging and rewarding, and it takes some time to master. (still haven't mastered; still having fun)

In addition to the combat system, Mordhau also features a deep customization system that allows players to create their own unique characters. Players can choose from a wide range of weapons, armor, and cosmetics to create a character that's truly their own.

The gameplay in Mordhau is fast-paced and intense, with battles that can turn at a moments notice. The game also features a variety of game modes, including team deathmatch, battle royale, and objective-based modes.

Overall, I highly recommend Mordhau to anyone who enjoys medieval combat games (or memes). The game is both brutal and fun, with a combat system that's both challenging and rewarding.

Developers ruin the game more and more with every update, which does 2 things right and 5 wrong.
Every update contributes to make the game more competitive and less casual, appealing to a minority of sweaty nerds who spend 6 hours a day training on duel servers.

The developers have no real goal with these updates which take so long to make, most of the time are underwhelming and damage the game even more.

The developers focus more on expensive cosmetics that only a minority of elitists can afford and a few combat mechanics rather that balancing the ridiculously biased objectives in every map and making maps, the game doesnt have many.

I never played a Chiv title so this was my first FPM game with that amount of control and if you are in the same boat as me this is the perfect modern title to start with that has something for literally everyone. 

The graphics are fucking superb, no surprise there being UE4 but this title takes full advantage of the engine's prowess in textures and lighting and it really shows with their metal based assets (all weapons and armor look incredible). 

The level design is excellent with so many details throughout every map that have very fleshed out atmosphere and many different approaches. The game types offer immense variety no matter your preference. Frontlines mode, which is reminiscent of Battlefield, goes up to 64 players in an objective based point capture tug of war with elements of siege warfare gameplay. The Battle Royale mode is intense and challenging. Theres a PVE mode called Horde where you slowly acrue money to get better weapons around the battlefield. You can find unofficial duel servers (just search duel) that play off DM maps and these are some of the best experiences you can have in the game. You pick who you want to fight by flourishing at them and agree to duel. This unofficial game mode really shows how strong the community is behind this game.  

The humor in the game is palpable from the deep character creation system, to the call outs and taunts, to the lute playing (and lute bots you can download that'll play any track you choose so long as its MIDI), to the fact you can pick up a horse turd and kill someone with it. Not to mention the levels of Monty Python you'll achieve having your limbs hacked off one by one as you try to punch your enemy to death with your last arm. 

Some of the best hit detection I've ever seen in a game too. The incredibly advanced melee system never clips and never fucks up. You can channel actual sword fighting abilities such as riposting, chambering, feinting, morphing, parrying, etc. with the animation system landing every time and its gorgeous.

In conclusion its really hard to find anything to not like about this title. Just amazing all around with a community that doesn't take itself too seriously which falls in line with the game's subliminal humor.

I'm tentatively giving this a YES for recommendation.

Mordhau is, and always has been, a game of contradiction. 

The combat is great, the back and forth of a good duel is wonderful. The control one has via their mouse and movement is spectacular and feels fantastic.

The community is a mixed bag, you have tryhards who with their 2k hours, dunk repeatedly on someone level 7 who downloaded the game today, and then wonder why new players aren't sticking around. 
Others take pleasure in the sillyness that mordhau often promotes; From perks like [Dwarf] and [Peasant] to the abominations people have made in the editor. A lot of the fun comes from this, helped along by some frankly topnotch voice lines.
   Then there is what is often dubbed the ""Maulman"" often times, the ""Naked Maulman"". Individuals who usually dress with the minimum of clothing and wield the maul. A oneshot weapon to the head, which they will take great delight in slamming into the back of said head mid duel. Often to the point of frustration.
   Players absolutely can be toxic, often to an extreme and liable to say the most horrific of things, particularly when things do not go their way. On the other hand, there are sweet players who will happily teach you the basics, duel you a bunch and dance to the closest bard.

Mordhau never seems certain whether it wants to focus on the competitive scene or the community. On seriousness or sillyness.

If you want my advice:

Go into it with a relaxed headspace, enjoy the flow, embrace the meme and have a good time

The horde mode was simple—as at the time, it was a simple mode in which you're supposed to fend off a sh*t load of NPC's and help out others fighting off the NPC's until the very last round (if I remember it correctly), this was way before the developers added the Noble, which apparently you're supposed to defend which is stupid. Different matches—such as free-for-all's, team deathmatches and battle royales—were very fun as well. But nowadays, [i]MORDHAU[/i] isn't as fun as it was back when it was released in 2019.

[i]MORDHAU[/i] isn't as fun nowadays, as there's a whole load of those with high levels (including those that are above level 200) that will always if I could say... outskill you. In other words, getting shat on by them constantly, so it definitely leads to the point where as the high level players (including veterans) becomes the majority, [i]MORDHAU[/i] will no longer be a fun game as it was before. What also makes [i]MORDHAU[/i] not to be fun nowadays is the toxic community (though it would be the best for you to ignore the community and just play the game if you're willing to do so), the votekick abusers, and those who will whine about having their 1v1 session being interrupted by some other player in a free-for-all match—although the whole votekick abusing and the constant whining about the 1v1 sessions being ruined in a free-for-all match has been a thing since the release back in 2019. Seriously, if players ever try to 1v1 each other in a free-for-all, they don't expect for other players to kill them and ruin their little 1v1 session. If they wanted to do 1v1's, they should've either: went to a duel server, host a private server that would be reserved for two players (this is resourceful to those that want to practice) or go to the ranked match (the main duel match in which you can either do 1v1 or 2v2 if I remember it correctly).

Now for those that want to play this game, take my advices. Don't expect to not end up getting shat on by the high-leveled players. It will always happen, and it doesn't matter what server you're in. Don't expect for the players to not abuse the votekicking system, although this doesn't happen always. Votekick abusing will happen if you somehow outskill a low level player (especially of those who are coming from EPIC Games), or if the players are whining about their stupid 1v1 session being ruined in a free-for-all match or if the players are just votekicking you for the sh*ts and giggles (in other words, for no reason). If you're looking to farm gold for your cosmetics, low-level players are the best way to go (although this wouldn't last for a while, as the minority will mostly become high leveled players too, since recently most of the EPIC Game players are now in the 40's to 100+ range (thus the minority becoming another majority group overtime). Ignore the community and play the game, don't get involved in any discussions as some of the discussions in the community hub; are cancerous to the very core. But however, this is the internet so don't expect anything good out of the community. And if I can think one last advice that I would provide you with it would be this. If you ever uninstall the game, don't try and go to the community to say your farewells. Because you won't get any farewells in return. The community members and players don't care about your farewells and of how you simply had enough of the game itself. Just uninstall the game, and either play another game you'd consider to be more fun than [i]MORDHAU[/i] itself, or go outside and touch the grass, and be in connection with nature (if I were you, going outside and touching grass would be the best option than anything else).",1644909068,1683532927,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

But instead of patching exploits within PVP combat like abusing animation exploits or banning feinting scripts... They instead find it preferable to add fortnite DLC skins and women to the game. This 100% flies in the face of their promise of ""historical accuracy"" when the game first came out. Sure, the community made it silly by fighting with lutes or making funny builds, but saying that makes the game not historically accurate is like saying CoD isn't a shooter if some people in the community started using melee only.

PVP combat just... Relies on abusing broken aspects of the game. The combat is insanely fun at first at the low and mid skill level, but once you get into people abusing the systems that the devs REFUSE to patch (they seriously added women before patching the broken aspects of their game, I just... What a world) and veterans being toxic and unforgiving while exploiting the game... It's literally Chivalry all over again. Solid combat system, but absolutely no development/focus on patching exploits or cheesy tactics. I am almost convinced the devs do not play their own game.  

I have to caution right away: DO NOT GET CHIVALRY 2 INSTEAD!! Chivalry 2 is butt, I would not recommend it either. I would recommend this game a million times before you get that one. Despite the hiccups with the combat, having to learn the god-awful ""drags"" and it not having proper blocking features... I still find the 240 combat more fun than Chivalry 2's shallow directional combat.

Grinding to get enough money to play dress up is insane. Like, I enjoyed playing with their customization system, but the grind for gold in this game is just not well balanced at all. It's like expecting you to spend thousands of hours on the game to unlock everything. In a game with a customization system like this, and the ability to mix and match... Why? Just why? You had an above-average customization system going for you, and you just squandered it with horrible currency balancing/progression. Like it's fine if you know exactly what you want to get and you have like one set of heavy, medium, and light armor, but not if you want to play dress-up.

This game had huge potential. And they probably could have met it after release with the right focus and vision. But ultimately, they squandered it. The game is dying, and I can fully say that the devs murdered it. The devs just absolutely ignore the players. Which isn't TOO uncommon in the gaming sphere, I could list a dozen games that suffer from that vice as well, but it just absolutely killed this game.",1620168851,1683519934,False,1,0,0.525000035762786865,0,True,False,False

So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him.

Here's the rundown. You jump into different objective or deathmatch based games in lobbies of 48 or 64, spawn in as one of a variety of classes (or make your own), and run around the map cutting people's body parts off and screaming constantly. The combat includes directional attacks from most every angle, directional blocking, parrying, dodging, faking attacks, and more advanced techniques like chambering, morphing, and dragging. If For Honor was Rock, Paper, Scissors, Mordhau is Chess. There's a wide variety of weapons that are all relatively balanced, each with their own strengths and weaknesses, and they can be complimented with various armour pieces and character perks, so there's a lot of options on how you want to play. Light armour? Heavy? Bow and arrow? Naked dwarf with a massive sword? All of these come with a huge pool of cosmetic options that are 95% earnable through in-game currency. There's a few small DLC's that are entirely optional cosmetics that aren't necessarily cooler than the free ones. Anyways, the gameplay boils down to slaughtering your enemies with your weapon of choice while dressed in fancy clothes.

Here's the thing though: you are going to struggle for the first hundred hours or more. You have to really WANT to play this game to get initial enjoyment out of it, because just like any online game, it's full of long time players. The skill ceiling is extremely high and the game's been out for a while. Furthermore, a lot of players migrated over from Chivalry (the first one) because Mordhau was, from my understanding, a passion project of a few devs who loved Chivalry. They're very much the same game in a lot of ways. There can be a lot of advanced swing manipulation that can be challenging for seasoned players to read, and impossible for noobs to even begin to understand. It takes a while to understand the nuances of combat properly enough to be able to hold your own against certain players or fight more than one person at a time. In the meantime it can be easy to get frustrated.

BUT. For every high level player with the one-shot weapon doing ballet spins and slaughtering your team, there's three more players who are doing silly cosplay, running around insulting one another using the in-game voice commands (very extensive), or dramatically playing an instrument on the field of battle. So even if you're getting absolutely slaughtered, there's still plenty of ways to have a good time. There's also a ton of duel servers where you can hone your skills against good players in fair 1v1's, but those lessons learned tend to fly out the window when you're swinging wildly in a crowded hallway in a normal lobby.

If you're interesting in visceral first-person (or third) sword combat with great customization and a high skill ceiling, this game is definitely for you. It's extremely rewarding and satisfying to stick with it, and there's a lot of enjoyment to be had. There's nothing like spamming laughter and insults as you methodically mow down the enemy team, only to be suddenly decapitated mid-sentence and forced to watch the world roll past wildly as your head tumbles down a hill.",1561525363,1683518797,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Yeah seems about right. Do note that this is made by an indie team. Therefore, things like content and bugfixes may not come as fast as you'd like. Then again it's still faster than getting new TF2 content from Valve...you guys should buy this game so the devs have more money to crunch out content faster by getting more hands on deck

combat is very fluid in this game so the Souls Rule applies here: Git Gud. DO spend some time dying a lot in duel servers (and getting absolutely destroyed by a LV 300 feint-spamming naked maul main) because the best players have overridden their instinctive urge to parry (and get punished by a feint/drag). Highly recommend you learn the basics of FPS swordfighing at Chivalry 2. if you're good here, you're even better in Chiv2 (where the action is not as immediately punishing as Mordhau). since Mordhau combat is mercilessly immediately consequential, you can clearly see the skill difference between someone good (me) and someone REALLY GOOD (that aforementioned LV 300 feint-spamming naked maul main that just caved your head into today's bolognaise sauce)",1556608523,1683454443,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game features intense battles with a variety of weapons and customization options, as well as a strong emphasis on player skill and strategy.

One of the game's main strengths is its combat system. The game uses a complex and challenging combat system that requires players to master various techniques such as feinting, parrying, and chambering in order to defeat their opponents. The system can be difficult to learn, but once mastered, it allows for satisfying and immersive battles.

Mordhau also features a wide range of customization options. Players can create their own character and choose from a variety of weapons and armor to use in battle. The game also allows for extensive customization of individual weapons, such as adding different grips or blade types to create a personalized fighting style.

The graphics in Mordhau are impressive, with detailed character models and environments that bring the medieval setting to life. The sound design is also well done, with realistic weapon sounds and immersive battle music that add to the overall experience.

However, the game's community can be toxic at times, with some players engaging in harassment and hate speech. Additionally, the steep learning curve of the combat system can make the game difficult to get into for new players.

Overall, Mordhau is a challenging and immersive medieval combat game that offers a unique and satisfying gameplay experience. While the game's learning curve and toxic community may be deterrents for some players, those who enjoy intense multiplayer battles and in-depth customization options will likely find Mordhau to be a rewarding experience.",1683409643,1683409643,False,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

The gameplay in Mordhau is fast-paced and challenging, requiring strategy and skill to succeed. The combat system is complex but satisfying, allowing for a wide range of attacks and maneuvers. Whether you prefer to play as a sword-wielding knight or a bow-wielding archer, there is something for everyone in this game.

What I appreciate most about Mordhau is its attention to detail. The graphics and sound design are excellent, creating a realistic and immersive environment that adds to the overall experience. The customization options are also impressive, allowing you to personalize your character and weapons to fit your playstyle.

Another standout feature of Mordhau is its community. The game has a dedicated player base that is both welcoming and helpful, making it easy to jump into matches and learn the ropes. The servers are also reliable, with minimal lag or connection issues.

That being said, Mordhau does have a bit of a learning curve. The combat system can take some time to master, and the game's difficulty can be daunting at first. But with practice and perseverance, it becomes an incredibly rewarding and satisfying experience.

In conclusion, Mordhau is a fantastic game that is well worth the investment. Its engaging gameplay, attention to detail, and welcoming community make it one of the best multiplayer combat games on the market.

Your normal match will consist of nonstop voice spam(turn it down/off in your options and thank me later), bards who complain in chat the moment they get killed, no-life rank 200+ calling everyone else bad while going 86 and 2(we get it, you don't have a life).

Weapon wind-up is dumb especially when someone hits you for almost your full HP from a swing into a feint into a swing that they morph and you get slapped with the pommel of the handle and almost die.

Makes no sense when weapons that have shafts can damage from any point, weapons that have weight take no time to generate striking power(feint into full damage? yawn), small/light weapons can effectively block bigger weapons.

3rd person allows for the most annoying hit reg I've encountered(and I've been playing games since dial-up so I would know).

Akin to Chivalry, Mordhau has fantastic core gameplay, fun to play maps, and lots of customization options. However, this game is not welcoming to new players or returning ones, as the majority of servers are full of level 200+ players who routinely exploit mechanics such as dragging, feint spamming and team stacking. You will see the same several high ranking players in practically every server at all times. If you go into a low population server to avoid them, it’s only a matter of time until several join and exploit their way to the top of the leaderboard. In Mordhau, players can switch teams at any point during the game, only if the teams are still even in terms of players on each side. High level players will routinely join a single team early on and subsequently stomp the opposing team since team balance is non-existent on official servers. Despite enjoyable core gameplay, the overabundance of exploiters and tryhards have cemented this otherwise enjoyable game as another Chivalry situation - exploitative, broken mechanics forever being the meta and a stagnant, ungrowing playerbase. It’s only a matter of time until the game dies out permanently, as the addition of crossplay did not bolster the player count for more than two weeks before it returned to the same low numbers it held prior.",1556730371,1682831306,False,2,0,0.54356849193572998,0,True,False,False

It'd be a great game if it actually ran well.

The servers are LAUGHABLY bad. Chivalry, a game about 10 years this games junior, has better servers than this. The game is near unplayable in almost all US East servers, and almost all US West servers as well most of the day. Sometimes the function fine for maybe a few hours but most of the time they are dog****. Like SUPER bad.

To put it in perspective, it is a known community meme to go in chat and everyone constantly go ""oh ****, packet loss, here we go again!"" Then the round turns into talking and people ****posting in chat until it fixes itself.

Do NOT buy this game until they figure it out. In fact, this has been going on for so long, you're probably better off waiting for Chivalry 2 and getting that, as it will be out before this is fixed I bet.

You also can't talk about how you dislike these 'features' because you are immediately told to git gud by the community. 

I might only have 170 hours in-game, but every time I tried to play its fun for about 10 minutes until it becomes soul-crushing pain trying to deal with the constant lag, animation abuse, and toxic community. Spend your money elsewhere until the devs decide to fix this mess.

Update 2/7/2020

The admins on private servers are now out of control. They spawn in items and abuse their powers. Can no longer even recommend this game on sale. Spend money elsewhere devs will not fix the game.

Lovely game. Community is way better than it used to be. You will find the normal toxicity you can find in about every game but you will also find a lot of great people. The community is pretty active with people who make use of lootbot to play music with in-game instruments or people who make loadouts and cosmetics (frankensteiner or normal ones) and the fighting groups that organise... groups fights. 

Right now if you pick it up knowing it's difficult at the beginning and you like medieval games then you should at least clock in 50 to 100 hours in the game. 

As for the content there has been a bunch lot of new cosmetics, new maps, a good amount of new weapons, and a lot of reworking on map balance and features.

[*] Content updates are few and far between and when they do happen they are often poor ones that do not add enough to justify the long wait time. For example, the developers had previously updated the game to help the issues of long load times. They instead broke their game so that every map looks like melted wax and it severely decreased performance for most players. Along with saying this will take DAYS to fix. if I remember correctly it took them over a week to fix it. An update will happen and you will normally have to wait months for an issue, be it major or minor, to be fixed.

[*] Almost every map is unbalanced in some way shape or form, enough where everyone knows what side has the best advantage and that team immediately fills at the start of a match.

[*] Mordhau also has a major problem with people that have a little too much time on their hands. The only reason this is a issue is because people can learn the absolutely busted mechanics to become unkillable by the average player through normal means. Anyone you see defending this is one of the people keeping the game from getting better and not allowing for it to become popular again. Even Rust updated their game to make combat a little more fair to both sides but still gives players who have more time a realistic advantage

[*] For my last point. The developers originally touted this game as a ""historically accurate medieval combat fighting game"" I don't mind the little bits of dopey fun here and there but they recently added women into the game (After announcing they would before the game was even released 2 or so years ago) I don't understand where people thought women were common combatants on the battlefield but this is just outright wrong. Since the earliest recording of man women very rarely fought on the battlefield. Only when it was absolutely necessary such as being a last defense. But here we are seeing women in a supposedly historically accurate game.",1557203065,1682307814,False,0,0,0.438270807266235352,0,True,False,False

-Better customisation than any other Medieval H&S or Melee-focused game on the market

-Satisfying winning streaks (if you can get them)

-The parts of the community that aren't sweating nolifes are probably some of the friendliest people you'll come across in the genre

Cons

-Unstable server connections and blatant lack of protection from hackers

-While a lot of the competitive players left, the majority of the toxic level 100+ that torment new players are still there

-Literally zero development prospects, Triternion don't so much as have a roadmap anymore, to say nothing of the devs blatantly ignoring the advice of the community in favour of doubling down

-Gameplay balance is completely absent at times and even Frontline and Invasion can feel completely one-sided

-Borderline unrealistic grind rate to get to higher rank/price customisation



If all you're looking for is a Hack-And-Slash with goofy voice acting and goofier warriors to fight against, this is it. Unfortunately, given that Triternion has basically abandoned it to work on another project and there's still a large, toxic wedge of the community that thrives on making the game unplayable for new players, you might as well get Chiv 2 and have a lot more fun.",1682260232,1682260232,False,5,1,0.529914557933807373,0,True,False,False

However despite all its flaws, some players passionate about the game decided to stick by when most of the player base quit.

But something changed in the past months. The moderators (with or without the devs' knowledge) decided to go after these players. Muting them for having the wrong thoughts or saying something that MIGHT be interpreted in another undesired way, banning and even permanently banning them if they don't share their vision on how to play this game. Essentially doing whatever they could to push them away.

Luckily there are unofficial servers where they don't have any power, but it's sad to see the state of Mordhau in 2023.

As someone who was initially captivated by the promise of medieval battles in Mordhau, I am disappointed to say that the game has fallen off and the server experience has been nothing short of terrible.

One of the most frustrating aspects of Mordhau is the state of its servers. The game has experienced a significant decline in server performance, with frequent lag, connectivity issues, and long wait times to join matches. This has greatly impacted the overall enjoyment of the game, leading to frustrating and inconsistent gameplay experiences.

Moreover, the game has suffered from a lack of meaningful updates and improvements. While Mordhau initially garnered attention for its unique combat mechanics and intense multiplayer battles, the developers seem to have lost momentum in keeping the game fresh and engaging. The lack of new content, updates, and bug fixes has led to a stagnant and repetitive gameplay experience, leaving players craving for more.

Another issue is the toxic community that has developed within Mordhau. The game has been plagued by toxic behavior, including harassment, racism, and trolling, which can significantly detract from the overall enjoyment of the game. The lack of effective measures to address and mitigate this toxic behavior has contributed to a negative community experience.

Furthermore, the game's overall balance has also suffered. There have been persistent issues with weapon balancing, hit detection, and overall game mechanics that have not been adequately addressed, leading to frustrating and inconsistent gameplay experiences.

Overall, Mordhau has fallen off from its initial promise of intense medieval battles. The server performance issues, lack of meaningful updates, toxic community, and gameplay imbalances have all contributed to a disappointing experience. As a fan of the game, it's disheartening to see the decline in its quality and enjoyment, and I hope that the developers take decisive action to address these issues and bring back the game's former glory.",1675386879,1682105889,False,1,1,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Update 12/1/2019 - Unfortunately, although the core gameplay experience has only improved since I last reviewed this, the community has only become worse. Toxicity is the norm on every server you join. Muting and not being able to communicate in a team game is a terrible solution to this. Communication options need to increase and the community needs to get fixed.

q:why i have 80 hours
a:im addicted but i hate this game


note:after being free in epic games a lot of people joined the mordhau and this made me change my review.

I hesitated buying this game because I believed it wouldn't be that fun, but honestly this game is terrific. Graphics are top quality. It's a beautiful game with well designed maps and fantastic effects. The gameplay is crazy, yet smooth, there is strategy yet chaos and it all blends well to create the best battle sim medieval game I've ever played. Furthermore, the customisation is perfect. There is a mechanic put in place to allow that you don't get overpowered yet still strong. You can make heaps of characters and customise them as much as you want, both with cosmetics and upgrades. My only issue is that it's too easy to get the best items and it leaves you grinding for accessories. Despite that, this game is incredible and at the time of this review I only have 12 hours.

It is of comfort to us as humans that we may have peace after death. For me however, fear of death is something that I am quite familiar with. Take a moment to ponder this; what would be your last words before your untimely demise? What would be your final thoughts before sailing down the river Styx? Would you have a moment of acceptance and peace, or would you despair? What sparked this? You see, my current situation is one that you may deem... not ideal. A guppy faced lunatic with a maul is currently sending themselves towards me with ill intent. Reason with him? I don't think so, he seems quite malicious and that maul is getting awfully close to my head. 

Alright, here's the plan; I parry his first swing and return one of my own. 

Well that's a problem, it seems his first swing was a fake and the real swing is coming now, I will have to duck this if I want to keep my head. No problem. 

Well that didn't work, it seemed he anticipated that I would try to duck his attack and is now launching his maul towards my head at terminal velocity, I will surely die if this hits me... Yep.

It's happening... I am shaking profusely and my pants have been completely soiled. This is the end isn't it? I had so many things I wanted to do, so many dreams to chase all for it to end like this? NO, I REFUSE! PLEASE, GOD, I HAVE NEVER PRAYED TO YOU BEFORE BUT IF YOU SAVE ME JUST THIS ONCE, I SWEAR I WILL NEVER QUESTION MY FAITH, PLEASE!  

I shut my eyes and prepared for my inevitable death.

*WHOOSH* AUGGGH 

Huh? 

I open my eyes. Before me, my attacker lay in a pool of his own blood, in his chest lay an arrow.  I turn around to catch a glimpse of my saviour but he is nowhere to be found. Instead, perched up against a wall, an old yew bow. I pick up the bow, with this, maybe I too, can save a life.

the game is best when you're slightly mediocre. when you suck it sucks, when you're the best you suddenly realise that, just like any game mechanic that does not involve RNG, there's a system you can learn to be the best.

the servers are iffy on how it will go roster wise, could be a bunch of vets versus brand new people , sometimes its a mix, but its still pretty fun to get into the action. the private servers for dueling are definitely a blast and a good place to find people willing to teach you the ropes.. albeit in the most embarrassing, ""getting clapped by a training sword"" way possible but still a good experience. 

i can solidly say playing this is much funner with friends, but you can easily make friends by just finding equally goofy people to hang with. (shout out to the boys running Gordon Ramsay loadouts!) but if you can get your friends to squad up with you, its a great way to have a friendly competitive competition with your buddies.

only thing i daresay is godly annoying about this game is voice spam... the amount of Posh voice-line Dwarfs on highest pitch is Narly, especially the french female voice, and the new Irish voice.. **the pure insult spam** its funny but when its 7 dudes creaming at each other in unison its .. OOH BOY.

other than that i heavily suggest people play this! you'll get your rear end beat in over and over again but, it takes some beating and defeats before you start to get better and dish it out yourself!

I entered the world of MORDHAU unknowing to what horrors I would put myself through. 

Let's start with the blocking. Blocking is useless and doesn't work as you can block 20 times and then when you decide to hit, the guy youve been blocking 20 times still hits faster than you, complete bs. Some weapons don't actually seem to have the swing speed they are supposed to as I can run up to someone with a one handed weapon to be out swinged by a two hander. 

Hits not registering. Sometimes the hits on enemies just won't register. This is extremely frustrating and stupid? Why is this a feature? You can run after some guy hitting him, your weapon going through the man, but yet do no damage? why? this doesn't make any sense to me???

Pros:
- Flexible character creation system for various play styles and extensive cosmetic customisation
- Solid graphics for the time of release. Solid sound design.
- Melee mechanics are tight and responsive. It is easy to grasp but hard to master.
- Character emotes and voice lines give the game a very unique and quirky personality
- Easy to party up and play with friends in a group

Cons:
- Steep learning curve
- Lots of shit talking (could be a pro if you enjoy shit posting however)
- Slow output of content updates from developers
- Limited number of maps and game modes
- Limited player base when the game is not on sale depending on region
- Unfortunately lacks an auto balance system by rank/play time in team game modes

One last note for new players that may not be having a great time. It is reasonably possible to get hang of everything with more play time. There are also community guides available that can be very helpful, duel servers are great for practising the melee mechanics with a friendly opponent who won't just rush and staunch you with morphs and chambers. The team game modes invasion and frontline are the easiest to get into because you can always stick with team mates (strength in numbers). Finally there are certain weapons/play styles that may be easier to get the hang of than others, you could always chill as an archer or equip a spear or halberd for a long reach advantage.

One of the main points people seem to bring up in their reviews, is a toxic community. That might be the case for different servers, but the european server is mostly filled with funny and friendly people. 

The game mechanics are very similar to chivalry, so if you have played Chiv or Chiv 2 you should almost feel right at home.

I can understand why people complain about the mechanics and then leave a negative review, since it can sometimes make you wanna throw your screen out the window, but that is not a Mordhau issue. That is a complex close quarters fighting mechanics issue that any game like that has. 
If you start out completely new to this kind of genre, I would very much recommend you play the tutorial and maybe start out with some 1v1 duels, people are often willing to help out new players, be it with a little practice or giving tips.

What I absolutely love about the game is the variety and ""less"" fantasy look of armor and weapons. They look quite grounded in reality and most are based off of real examples.

However, I can't recommend this game to people with different tastes than me because of how hardcore it is on new players. There are many mechanics that take hundreds of hours to master. You have to master these mechanics if you want to stand a chance in PvP, and PvP is usually what most people enjoy. Some of these mechanics include attack morphs, feints, chambers, backsteps, and more. One last negative of this game is its servers. I often find myself disconnecting, crashing, and having a high ping or packet loss. This is due to Mordhau's servers being bad. My computer can take a beating, it can run high-quality games and the Sims 3 on high graphics (you'd know what I was talking about if you were a simmer) so I was surprised to find out I was having issues with this game. I looked up on how to solve my problems and it turns out that this game simply has poor servers. However, I myself enjoy this game because fighting the AI is fun. The game also has fun gamemodes such as horde. Horde is a masterpiece. I get to fight waves of AI while having random superpowers (this gives me a superiority complex).

Chivalry, but better in every way.

Amazing game with loads of hilarious moments every single match, it's fun even if you're not great at it.

Huge variety in terms of customisation and weapon choice, it's great to see a PvP game where everyone doesn't pick an OP meta weapon, all the weapons in the game are based on circumstance and mainly, personal preference.

If you're on the fence, you'll likely enjoy it, so buy it any ways.

Update: Can not recommend it anymore. There is no casual playerbase left, most of those still playing have hundreds or thousands of hours in the game, with every unreadable animation memorized, every tiny possible glitch and abuse of the fighting system at their fingertips. Drags to the moon and back. Attacks accelerated so that they hit instantly. They will slaughter anyone new coming in, while also being the most toxic, racist, childish, 4chan-loving basement-dweller community I have yet seen. 

You either put in hundreds of hours to try and catch up or be endless cannonfodder. Team objective mode is mostly impossible since there is no enforced team balance and usually one team will completely stomp and farm the other. Your team may also meme around mostly, especially the folks playing this all day since release that are just super bored since there's no new maps and nothing, but with like half your team sitting around doing nothing, spamming pseudo-french creaky-voice voice emotes/insults.

Sad, because something like a F2P change and regular content drip and cosmetics like a battle pass would probably see this game growing again, but I doubt that that is likely to happen. Great game, but now far past its prime.**

This game is skill-based, it's knowledge-based, and it rewards those who put in the time to master it. Which is great, because all of that knowledge you'll probably gain after playing 15 matches or so, and half of the skill required to master it is actually needed. In Invasion, which seems to be the most popular game mode, you can probably win at least SOME of the time against about 2/3 of the players, regardless of skill level. It is just the situation where you're fighting someone who doesn't have the brazen confidence of a madman. The other 1/3 of the players you'll lose to near every time, since you're fighting A) naked maul guy, B) full-armor bloodlust guy, C) (and this is very rare) someone who has actually gotten very good at the game, or D) a pair of partied buds who are more than content to stab you in the back while you fight the other one. I say this with very low amounts of sodium. I've played little over a day at this point, and I've seen a number of people in the community to the point where I recognize some of their names. IT'S SO FUN, because of the myriad levels of skill in the community. Some matches you'll stomp on people who never quite understood what a feint is, and other matches your entire team will be wiped about by a midget and somebody with a tree branch. The game is fun just because of the sheer level of shenanigans that you'd be hard-pressed to find in most other competitive games.  It's fun just to watch yourself slowly get better and better at the game, going from two kills a match to twenty.

So, the game used to be a beacon of hope for a medieval melee combat genre, used to be the best in the neighborhood, actually. Massive battles with 84 players servers, freedom of character and roleplay, ah, there were times..

But for the last 2 years devs started to take out all the freedom of choice from the game, and restricting players in their actions more and more. 
It all started with limiting areas where you can walk, then restricting some areas where you can build, and finally defining most areas as restricted for building, leaving only some spots where it is allowed. This, of course, has no logical in-game explanation, it is just a message [i] you can't build here[/i] , invisible walls or [i] death in 5 seconds[/i].
Landscapes and buildings are also getting reworked to become less realistic and interesting for the sake of preventing players creativity to alter the gameplay.

So the game just tends to become more linear, like a plain boring tunnel from objective to objective, with enforced rules.

Admins also tend to ban people for exploring game mechanics and opportunities, which were presented to the players by the developers. In general, admins tend to abuse their power in this game, there is an opinion, that banned players count is higher than remaining players base.

A short list what you used to have, but no more:
- nerfed catapult to unrealistically weak level
- no freedom of building anymore, now only can build where it is not really needed
- added forced team auto-balance with no option to choose your team in at the start of the match
- reduced max server size from 84 to 64 players
- rebalanced most weapons to be very much the same instead of inspiring gameplay variety
- reworked most maps to be more linear and boring, removing chokepoints and realism

Some can say that linear slasher is fine, but we already have chivalry for this, why make Mordhau the same?

I witness degradation of the game for years, and I can tell, as of today, it is only accelerating.

The game uses a directional attack system, allowing players to swing their weapons in a variety of directions and angles. The game also has a complex parry and feint system, making combat feel strategic and dynamic.

In addition to the satisfying combat, ""Mordhau"" has a great visual design, with impressive graphics and detailed character models. The game also has a robust character creation system, allowing players to customize their characters with a range of armor, weapons, and cosmetic options.

""Mordhau"" features a range of game modes, including team-based battles, free-for-all duels, and objective-based siege battles. The variety of modes and maps keep gameplay fresh and engaging.

One potential downside to ""Mordhau"" is its high learning curve. The game's combat system takes some time to master, and the game can be punishing for new players. However, once players have put in the time to learn the mechanics, the game offers an incredibly satisfying combat experience.

Overall, ""Mordhau"" is a fantastic medieval-themed combat game with a deep and complex combat system. The game's satisfying visuals, character customization options, and variety of game modes make it a must-play for fans of multiplayer combat games. 9/10",1680152515,1680152515,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

They use cheats to make the melee combat unfair and then try to make you feel bad about it.  Really really really sad.  Hate to give it a negative revievv, but honestly at this point vvhen the exact same behavior can be found in literally actually every single online video game, if you can't keep your game safe from such people, then you're getting a negative revievv from me from novv on, if only to keep others safe from psychological harm.  There is no point in playing ANY multiplayer video game at this time.  Its just not fun.  Its *exactly* the same in every single one I've played for the past 10 years.  There's like 5-10 cheaters pretending to be hot shit and everyone else struggling to get a single kill / victory / vvhatever the objective of the game is.  If you ask them kindly to stop they either make fun of you or try to convince you that they're not cheating, you're just bad.  Some of them actually want to convince you of this to hide the fact that they are cheating, while others want you to know that they're cheating and just want to make you upset.  They try to undermine your confidence because they have none. They try to make you upset because they're upset.  I mean, think about it, why would anyone ever cheat at a video game?  Like, why not just jump in and have fun, who cares how well you do, who cares who wins, its just for fun.  And if you want to be competetive, that's fun too.  If you want to improve your own personal skills, that's fun too.  So why ever use a cheat?  Only someone who believes that it is *impossible* for them to be as good as they want to be would use a cheat.  Someone who, deep down, has *completely* given up on themselves.  And they envy those who haven't.  They say, if I can't have fun, then neither can anyone else, so I'll just use my cheats and wreck the game until everyone leaves.  And that is actually their way of asking for help.  They are saying, ""how do you have confidence?""  And the answer to this question is, ""You just do it.""  There is no way to do it but to do it.  Confidence is a choice.  Believing in yourself is a choice.  Being a good person is a choice.  Don't let anyone fool you otherwise.  Anything else is just an excuse for past mistakes being used to make new ones.  
As a final note: To whatever object you attribute your confidence, you do so at your own peril, for when you lose that object, you will also lose your confidence.  But don't worry, you will find it again.  It has in fact, been within you the entire time.

The game's graphics are detailed and realistic, with well-designed character models and environments that create a sense of immersion.

The gameplay in Mordhau revolves around intense melee combat, with players using a variety of weapons and strategies to defeat their opponents. The game offers a variety of game modes and challenges, each with its own unique mechanics and objectives. The game is easy to pick up and play, with intuitive controls and challenging gameplay mechanics that make it accessible to players of all skill levels.

One of the standout features of Mordhau is its emphasis on strategy and tactics. Players must carefully choose their weapons and approach each battle with a plan, as reckless attacks can easily be countered by a skilled opponent. Additionally, the game's multiplayer options allow players to team up and compete against each other, adding an element of social interaction that is both enjoyable and engaging.

However, the game's steep learning curve and unforgiving gameplay may limit its appeal to some players. Additionally, the game's reliance on skill-based combat may make it less accessible to casual gamers or those looking for a more relaxed experience.

Overall, Mordhau is a great game for fans of medieval combat and strategy games, offering a unique and intense experience that rewards careful planning and skillful execution. Its realistic graphics, emphasis on strategy, and challenging gameplay make it a standout title, but its steep learning curve and unforgiving gameplay may limit its appeal to some players.",1589130883,1680141259,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Verily, I say unto thee, such weapons are an affront to the very spirit of knighthood, and those who rely on them are but craven cowards who lack the true courage of a knight.

What is the worth of a man who hides behind a tree and looses arrows from afar, like some timid hare fleeing from the hounds? Nay, it is the warrior who stands firm, blade in hand, and faces his foe with all the might and skill that God has granted him, who is truly a hero.

Have we forgotten the ancient traditions of chivalry, handed down to us by our forebears? The code of honor that demands we meet our enemies on equal terms, face to face, and prove our worth with sword and shield? Such values have no place in the hearts of those who would slink about in the shadows, raining death upon their foes from afar.

And what of the knights who do take up the bow or crossbow? Are they not shamed before their peers, deemed unworthy of the noble title they bear? Better to lay down the weapons of the craven and take up the sword, to fight with valor and honor and win glory on the field of battle.

So I say to thee, ye who would take up the ranged weapon: put it aside, and take up the sword. Show thyself a true knight, worthy of the honor bestowed upon thee. And if thou wilt not, then go and hide in the shadows like the coward thou art, and leave the battle to those who have the courage to face it head on.",1680107746,1680107746,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

after spending 12k on chivalry over 10 years I can confidently say that chivalry 1 takes a significant more amount of skill to master, if you want to be better than 99 % of players in the game its not that hard. its the 1% that make it difficult by milking every janky mechanic they can. swing manip feel natural and smooth in this game, some things need tweaked even now in 2023 though considering you can fully drag around someones parry box if you are good enough.

buffering is self explanatory and should be removed along with chambers. balance movement speed / momentum mechanics to encourage faster footwork in deal with feints IE: forced misses when you fall for a feint.

chambers are just free gambles, leading to most high level fights being feinting in eachothers faces repeatedly and whoever panic parrys first loses. boring mechanic and was implemented simply to appease the average joe that cant deal with feints in a fight.

overall i reccomend this game for casual fun, the competitive scene is toxic as it should be with any melee game. its up close and personal.

if you're like me and a super try hard, dont take it too seriously. this game was not designed with competitive play in mind. and the comp mods dont help besides giving you extra FOV and some minor weapon changes.",1680037948,1680037948,True,1,0,0.497925341129302979,0,True,False,False

Since the last half year the game has gone downhill fast, there are lots of cheaters and generally high level players, making playing archer basically the only option for new players.
As the player base is so low most players these days are hardcore fans, which have, like me, lots of playtime and give your start in the game a quick halt.
95% of the player base are basically walking med kits for level 200+ players.

Despite these facts the gameplay itself is still very good in my opinion, however you can't really enjoy the game, when there are power tripping mods, getting mad when they get killed one time too often and deem it as trolling (which I've heard of in several occasions), while themselves insulting to the hardest and literally giving bans with insults in them. But not just killing the wrong person might ban you, also playing the lute (nice feature) too much might make them ban you, as it ""disrupts the team balance"", so they say.

The main reason for me to write this review after such a long time is, that I've just been banned ABSOLUTELY randomly.
You must know, that I've been inactive in this game for around 2 months, just logging in for a small game every few days, and I absolutely can't fathom what I've done to justify a ban.
Moderators on their discord have seemingly no knowledge why I've been banned, but well, 'he got randomly banned so it must be justified'.
At least a small info would've been nice to know what else isn't allowed anymore.

As a new player you won't be really having problems with the mods I guess, as you can't really defeat them as a newbie and thus won't trigger their egos.

If this review made you optimistic about this game, go ahead and buy it.

There will probably more negative reviews of people being banned in the near future, let's see :)",1609117056,1680017102,False,5,0,0.53823089599609375,2,True,False,False

SUGGESTIONS COMMUNITY WANT:
- Let us choose between Invasion/Frontline (OR JUST DELETE INVASION)
- Let us make custom GAMES! FOR FREE
-Add both Old and New HORDE MODE (many loved old one more- it was like an arena)
-Add TEAM DEATHMATCH/ELIMINATION to quickplay (many would love that, focus on a massive fight not objectives)

THOSE THINGS ARE WHAT COMMUNITY WATNS AND WOULD LOVE and would grant literally MANY FREE PLAYERS (and dont use the excuse that it will divide playerbase, it will not, not doing that will just remove them forever, NOT DIVIDE IN SAME GAME)

-Horde players will straight up love both modes 
-Massive Team Deathmatch on officials will be adored
-Frontline is good (invasion ruins it, it is like a plague if u force us to play it)
-Multiple gamemodes- multiple varieties and reasons to play
(possible- CO-OP invasion)
 

Being afraid that it will divide community is dumb - that way it gets ""divided"" in ""i accept it or i stop playing""

Frontlines/Invasion really needs some sort of soft rank system to organize players, but Hive Skill can't just be transferred 1:1 due to the difference of the two games and the Dev Team is already small as shit so there's just too much stuff to do and too little time I guess? Certainly doesn't help that there's currently no financial incentive to update the game as it will never sell as many copies as it did on launch.

First off, the hygiene of the devs is really concerning. I mean, you can tell from the game itself that they're not exactly the cleanest bunch. And that lack of hygiene definitely bleeds into the development of the game. It's buggy as hell and it's been in development for what seems like forever. Like, come on guys, take a shower and get to work!

But let's talk about the game itself. Mordhau is a slasher genre set in a medieval world overrun by clowns. You have to prepare your loadout and fashion to perfection, fortify your mindset, and fight off hordes of not very smart people. The graphics are definitely not the best, but I guess that's to be expected from an indie game. The real issue is the gameplay. It's clunky and unintuitive, and the controls are a nightmare. It's like the devs didn't even bother to playtest the game before releasing it.

And don't even get me started on the community. It's toxic as all hell. You try to ask for help on the forums and you get bombarded with insults and condescending comments. It's like they don't want new players to join the game. And honestly, who can blame them?

Some weapons are busted, i.e. Saber, bardiche, greatsword, just to name a few of them. There is a reason sweatlords play only a handful of weapons and full heavy armor set: because alternatives are just not viable in any way with this combat system.

Combo speed on miss has been significantly reduced, which makes high attack speed weapons that much useless and the animation you get when trying to combo on miss makes it feel like you're a dying old man who can barely even lift his arms up. Compare this to the absolutely busted animations people can pull off from ripostes, that either looks like a carving knife accel or a turbovirgin drag that tippy touches your torso on the last frame but somehow still cuts you in half.

I've found many people in this game I thought were just being goofy (kicking people off ledges, killing with admin commands or weapons and whatnot), till I found out the majority of these people actually acted out of malice or having a power trip. 
Most of the admins in duel servers are infantile degenerates who take the game way too seriously or enjoy letting everyone know they're in charge.

Other than that, the game's fine, but in no way do I recommend it for people who haven't gotten into it yet.

Cons:
- the combat can be very tacky and cheesy at times, and a lot of hours need to be put into it to actually comprehend it and build the muscle memory for it. it is not the most accessible, to say the least. it's like a fighting game in that regard.
- non-negligible population of edgy alt-right man-children, other misc. reprobates, and proselytizing christians in the chat. thankfully there is no voice chat feature, and the text chat can be turned off, paused, or you can mute specific individuals.
- this game doesn't exactly have a large or fast-growing community. you will see similar faces every so often. 

Pros:
- the individual character customization is unmatched in this genre of games. the 'cosplay' scene is half of what makes this game. you can make your knight look as serious or silly as you want. you can see people dressed as minions chasing down mario with wooden mallets, michael jackson strumming on a lute and doing a moonwalk, etc.
- as a part of this varied customization, you are free to make a class with whatever kinds of armor and weaponry you desire. this is very refreshing compared to chivalry 2's class-based customization-restricted system.
- musical instruments (read above) that have dedicated communities of developers who make playing them accessible and finding midi format music for them easy.
- individuals can get up to some wacky antics and make for some pretty funny unconventional warfare.
- when you do manage to get kills, it feels amazing.

would I recommend mordhau? if you want an accessible knight game with a sizable population, no - chivalry 2 is probably the better option. if you want a knight game where you have to put in a lot of hours to learn, but are rewarded with a humorous and more soulful experience, and can tolerate the neanderthals in text chat, then yes.",1591851649,1679464376,False,1,0,0.5,0,True,False,False

I'm quitting for my own mental health at this point. Though I may stick around for some Horde, which is the only gamemode where toxicity is at a minimum.

If you want to become a rage-filled piece of garbage, this is the game for you.

EDIT: Tried going back to PvP. Didn't end well. Absolute garbage as usual. People will pretend to be your friend and teammate only to stab you in the back for pure trolling goodness and to piss you off. Then, if you have a female username, all the dudes will simp for you and stand by your side no matter what because you know, simps. Also, I really wish YT tutorials weren't a thing for this game. There was a time where learning the game mechanics took actual skill and not someone simply spoonfeeding you the entire time. You got level 20-50 dudes fighting like they're level 200 tryhard sweaty shitbirds. Disgusting. Horde is the supreme mode.

EDIT 2: Once again, tried going back to pvp. Again, full of sweats even in the casual servers.

be warned--this is not an easy game. 1-4 hits, even in heavy armor, and ur dead. and get ready to die A LOT...i played for like 2 or 3 days before i got a round where i went positive. the learning curve is a bit steep, but the tutorial teaches u a lot of the tactics (accel/drags, morph/feints) you'll find online so u dont suffer too much. also theres lots of ""dueling"" deathmatches where u can find plenty of other beginners to practice with.

 theres lots of play options too. anything from head to head deathmatches, to fighting hordes (warhammer /COD zombies-esque style), to large scale battlefield tug-of-wars where u fight over positions (domination style control points). its predominantly mp, but theres a local function with bots so u can learn on ur own or play by urself and learn the maps if thats what ur feelin at th time. 

ive played both chivalry (1) and this, i prefer this imo. its a bit more technical (although not by much), which i prefer hardcore style games. so if ur torn between th two, id opt for this one.

random tidbit: u can make ur own custom loadouts---which i love---so its easy (for me) to spend hours coming up with new loadouts or optimizing the ones i already made or changing the skins. also theres no limit---endless loadouts. dope.

now for th things i dont like so far:

parrying (this games de facto version of blocking) has a ""zone"" so any strikes in the zone are deflected---annoying when ur smashing someones skull from behind and they magically ""parry"". also annoying because striking in this game has directional aspects, but blocking is just based on the parry cooldown and direction has nearly no bearing on a successful block (unless ur using a shield). basically the angle of play is to force ur opponent into using their parry prematurely which then opens them up for an easy strike. i get it, but i dont like it very much.

thats really my only complaint ---aside from that i wish there was like a campaign or something more for sp....but the game doesnt suffer for it, just something id personally like to see in this game. everything else is all gravy. a very fun game.


get it and enjoy swathing a path thru the battlefield---highly recommend",1679310574,1679311219,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Now I know it's a niche game, but right now there isn't that many new players, so the game is dominated by high level players, if you bought this game when it first came out then it's perfectly fine and the game holds up to this day as the best melee game.

However, the game can't retain new players because of the skill gap now, so if you want to just goof around and not play to always defeat an opponent then it's the perfect game but if you want to grind expect a lot of resistance from your fellow veterans. 

The game is very toxic, so stay away from chats, you can hide it if you want. There are also some people who grief in the game (placing spawners, so you can fall to your death when you use these spawners), team kill you and then abuse the vote kick system to kick you from the server.

Some voice lines are extremely annoying, they can insult you with voice lines and also belittle you if you are not good enough, they scream in your face and so on, there isn't an option to disable those, unfortunately.

Some weapons are broken and unpredictable so even if you are a veteran you will still be surprised by some wacky animation even thought the developers said in the beginning of the development that they want to avoid these kinds of animation, they still exist.

Updates has slowed down, but they're still putting new updates every couple of months.

This is the kind of game that you want to play it when it first comes out, so right now I can't recommend it, even thought it is the best melee game right now.

Edit: every negative review is either someone complaining about the community or something that is their own problem like input lag (?) or people using certain builds for their characters.
The community in my experience is very good, maybe some banter at most. It would be rare to find someone very blatantly racist and/or rude to the point where you would want to change lobbies (I recall seeing one person that was kinda mean).
The other comments talking about dying to the vets of the game just cant deal with failure. I remember my games going 0/40 and still having fun, until i properly started learning enough to hold my own in fights. A lot of the fun came from seeing my skills improve and eventually winning against skilled players.

First and foremost, let me say that this game is not for the faint of heart. The combat is visceral and unforgiving, with swords, axes, and maces clanging against armor and flesh alike. You will need to be quick on your feet and sharp with your blade if you hope to emerge victorious from the fray.

But oh, what a fray it is! The battles are large and chaotic, with dozens of players charging headlong into one another like a storm of steel. And yet, even in the midst of all this chaos, there is a sense of strategy and tactics that makes each engagement feel like a true battle of wits and skill.

The graphics are also a sight to behold, with detailed armor and weapons that look as if they were plucked straight from the pages of history. The maps are similarly impressive, with sprawling castle courtyards, open fields, and winding medieval streets that create an immersive and believable world.

And let us not forget the audio design, which is truly outstanding. The clash of swords and shields, the whinny of horses, and the bellowing of battle cries all serve to create a truly epic soundscape that pulls you even deeper into the game's world.

All in all, Mordhau is a game that will satisfy any warrior's thirst for blood and glory. So arm yourself, don your armor, and take to the field of battle. For victory and honor await those who are brave enough to seize them.",1678785354,1678785354,True,2,0,0.485106378793716431,2,True,False,False

Still sucks. You can really tell the devs half assed a lot of combat in this game. You can spam feints all day long at no real cost to your stamina, but blocking with a shield is an act of God and requires perfect timing. Every match there are people in the general chat crying about the game dying, but they don't understand it is because of them it is dying.  99% of this game is just deadangle hits and people looking at the fucking sun while they just crazily swing because they can swing all they want, all it takes is one mess up of a block and you die.

The amount of time you have to put in to master the game's combat is simply too much for the average player, I don't understand why anyone would tell someone to play for 100 hours just so you can be ok at the game. Every match is filled with veterans who have spent countless of hours mastering the game's mechanics, so trying to play or learn the game is made even harder. Dragging has to be one of the most annoying mechanics that I've ever seen, not only is it visually unappealing it feels downright unfair to go against.Not to mention accels, that can make your weapon go at the speed of light, this made even obvious when using a one handed weapon. Since there is no held block it makes it even harder to block drags and accels, its made easier for the ones who know how to use drags and accels to kill new players. Some of the weapons in the game feel broken such as the zweihander and the polearms, the drags on those weapons are simply unreadable at times, I've seen duels with players using these weapons and it looks like a contest of who can exploit the game the hardest.

To start, the game itself is not for anything other than fucking around. You will not find serious, or even skill based combat here (despite many saying otherwise.) The only ""skills"" on display in this game are glitchy tech, aiming entirely away from your target or spinning like a madman (which will work nearly every single time no matter what.)

There is no balance in the game period, this is the only way the game is 'historical' in any context, war has no equalizer other than fire and death. That being said, you will find players with extremely tiny characters, making it difficult to even keep them in sight, or towering characters making their attacks wipe 4 heads off at once, which negates much of the combat when you throw in passive skills such as tank (with damage resistance and such)  and can stack your own created warrior in your choosing with stipulation of equip limit.

My gripe with the game is that while most other things are fine, funny and entertaining, your fashion of defense is atrocious. You are limited to counters ONLY, there is no blocking at all unless you equip a high equip load shield and hold it up, you cannot even thrust with a spear over the shield while doing this. To top it off, even as you do that (seal off your attack capability entirely) your actual block window doesn't even cover the area in front of you correctly. 

In addition to all of that, the community 9/10 times will become frothing at the mouth the second you question anything in the game, say you parry an attack, the ""Parry"" at bottom even shows up, but you get hit in the shoulder and die in one hit from full health anyway. Which translates to a skill issue apparently, despite timing the block and looking at the attack, my shield even reacts and sounds off, but the attack still goes through despite that. 

Only play this game if you want to be frustrated at how this game believes a fully trained soldier cannot hold up a defense longer than .75 seconds at a time, and then has to rest for a full second before raising to block again.",1678481449,1678481449,False,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

The sword play when you pop off gives a dopamine hit unrivaled by other games. The arsenal of weapons have a wide variety with how you can expect each one to play and they generally stay true to what you'd expect (Minus eveningstar using poleaxe anims lol). The swing manipulation is a super rough system for new players, and when abused to the highest extent feels awful.

The worst part about this game is honestly the devs, not anything personal with them the game just doesnt get updates.

I'm not really into these quasi-medieval multiplayer battlers anymore. Too many sweaty folk, and I don't wanna get any on me! That said, Mordhau has had an interesting PvE mode for a long time, and it was massively overhauled around 2021. Maps were expanded and spawns rethought to better support Defenders vs. Attackers. All buyables are in your base, you can respawn or be resurrected, and there's now an excellent skill system!

Previously, tougher melee bots were a chore to fight, while the really tough ones were almost impossible to melee without dying. Respawns and the new powerful, allied NPC have massively helped improve wave balancing, but the skills have entirely solved all the worst issues of yesteryear by bringing much needed customization through specialization! The choices are quite diverse and generous, so it's fairly easy to multiclass—so to speak.

Want to sprint across the battlefield [i]really[/i] fast, like a scout, and redirect a huge threat from others? By all means! Want set up ballistas, traps, and throw fire? Well, engineers are better than ever! There's so much more to it, I could go on for many more paragraphs, so I'll end this by saying the aesthetic avatar customization is just as satisfying.

629760,86912765,76561198066571270,272,17,18076,0,18032,1682052700,"I'm not going to lie and say that I didn't/don't enjoy MORDHAU. It's a very fun game with a very high skill ceiling. If you're a fan of this style of game (i.e. semi-tactical, one-on-one), you might have some fun playing this. However, this game is not for the casual player. Despite having 300 hours in this game, I would not consider myself nearly skilled enough to compete at medium level -- low-medium, probably. The community is generally fairly friendly in non-competitive scenarios, but the gloves typically come off once people get angry; don't be surprised to see some of the nastiest, most vile types of people orbiting the chats. I even recall an official server moderator kicking someone from a game for 'using a bow.'
There's a lot to learn in MORDHAU and a lot of mechanics to advance at, but that does not necessarily make it fair; you will run into enemy players that have an ungodly amount of skill in regards to animation manipulation, though this isn't the majority of players. The game is not currently at the state of decay in which no new players join, so there should be plenty of low or medium skill players to come up against if you've considered how to learn to duel or fight in general.
Servers on the West Coast populate maximally at 2 per large game mode, thus giving you a decent amount of room to try different game modes if you would like to. You may find yourself having a lack of direction due to the slightly strange customization system (insofar as creating new warriors), but it is still a great, expansive system with plenty of variety for customization -- on par with (though, arguably better than) the customization system from Halo: Reach, albeit minus the achievement armors.
All in all, MORDHAU is a fun game with a decent community, though there are certainly some outliers in regards to toxicity. You will find that most players are kind and generally communicate solely through the in-game chat mechanic, which you'll find out more about if you try the game. It's hard to say that I'd recommend it necessarily because you will find it to be a very big time sink, but if you have plenty of free time and have found yourself disinterested in other types of competitive games, give MORDHAU a shot. And even if a competitive experience isn't your taste (in which case I might not recommend), there are still large-scale game modes in which you can learn mechanics and eke out a few kills.

MORDHAU -- Main game
GAMEPLAY 8/10 -- Complicated but not to the point of being frustrating. Almost every fight feels like a new experience. This is a fairly niche-style game, it being an FPMS, but you might be surprised to find that the style is pretty amicable and easy to pick up.
STORY N/A -- There really isn't any story, just war.
BEAUTY 9/10 -- Incredibly impressive given this is not a triple A game. Not beautiful but definitely pretty good, along the lines of Rainbow Six: Siege.
SOUNDTRACK 9/10 -- While it can be a little repetitive, the music in this game is honestly good and sets the mood.
COMMUNITY 7/10 -- You will see a lot of people complaining about toxicity but insofar as verbal toxicity (i.e. writing in chat) or trolling goes, there isn't very much. Most of the time, people are just enjoying themselves, and you'll find plenty of people willing to interact with and joke with you.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ing minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you.",1636563109,1678172646,True,0,0,0,1,True,False,False

Duel servers, everybody is always really salty & toxic when you kill them and either rdm, try to get you kicked, interfere with duels, and trash talk if you dont play by the book. Meaning if you dont have second wind perk with a 2 handed weapon youre essentially going to get bullied for being beating other players. Nobody is really helpful unless you find people that actually enjoy teaching people other than that community is horribly cancerous. The casual multiplayer is janky as all hell with little to no cohesion, its just a meat grinder to the closest group of people or OBJ. 6/10 times youll find yourself getting your head hacked off by a teammate who either doesn't know how to use their weapon, or they have no awareness at all. I think it needs a lot of work still and they need to do something about how toxic this game really is. It's not an understatement. those being toxic in game admit to the state of the game, yet still willingly contribute to it. A voIP chat would lighten the game up a bit i feel so people dont feel invincle behind a sword and screen going keyboard warrior. RDM is heavy with this game beware.

It has been a year since the initial release of the game, and the game shows no progress for the comp scene other than having a ranking system that is absolutely awful, using global charts instead of regional ones.

There is a lack of spectator tools to allow for the growth of the comp scene, since viewers don't have resources to follow on the action. The game is absolutely boring to watch stream wise and will never attract sponsorships, and along with a racist dev crew, makes the game a PR nightmare.

Its as good a time as any to be playing

Mechanically, I applaud this game, it is mostly consistent in its combat, which is obviously the main offering it provides as a large scale medieval battle game. The visuals are pleasing and the game runs mostly smoothly maxed (the feitoria map has serious performance problems no matter what)on a mid range gpu like the gtx 1060. Matches are fun for new and old players, though the lacking tutorial provides a hostile skill floor to new players, which the developers should work on fixing.

The progression system has no pay to win and allows the player to customize their characters heavily, which is a key point of my enjoyment of this game, as practically any character build can be pulled off and enjoyed in the average match with enough skill.

The real flaw with this game is those who play it. The game has no report option, and nearly all matches are filled with at least 1 or 2 whiny and toxic players spewing every racial epithet and homophobic slur one can think of, with the only advice given to deal with toxicity being to just mute them and tune them out. As a result of this, the community has developed a considerable alt-right underbelly which thrives under the lax moderation presence in Mordhau. To date I have experienced toxic direct harassment about twice in 24 hours, and have seen it occur passively around 50 or more times.

For a player with friends or parties to play with, Mordhau is an enjoyable game with moderately fair and punishing combat. For the individual, I would suggest putting it into consideration if you want to deal with the cesspool that lies hidden to the average purchaser, because it is an eventuality that you'll end up experiencing it. 

Did I enjoy my time with Mordhau? Yes
Do I recommend Mordhau? Yes, but refer to my toxicity statement

I will say that other comments about try-hard players are true, it can be quite frustrating because the learning curve is so high, and the combat is so unforgiving. It definitely requires many hours of effort to master, but I don't believe that's any fault of the developers given the scope of the game.

As u block they can just drag harder to make it so your small window of blocking dose nothing and you are taking unavoidable damage and die to this constantly as 90% of people who try to win in a pvp setting abuse this. this making the game just seem dumb and not skill based in a skill based pvp game basically ruining the game in whole unless they do a huge rework of 2h weps this game is going to slowly die off,1676659158,1676659158,False,2,1,0.5,0,True,False,False

I will say however the community can be mildly toxic, with a large pool of players who play the game far too often. The sweats wouldn't be an issue if there were low level only servers, to the best of my knowledge there were at one point, but the people who play too much made smurfs and made them redundant. I hope this paints a decent picture for any possible buyers.

Edit: Been playing awhile longer, changing my rating. At this point it feels like a game I cant really put down if I want to enjoy it. If you aren't willing to play and practice consistently (IE maybe you wanna play something else sometimes) you are going to get constantly smacked around by high level players.  Community response (obviously) is git gud, which is fair and correct. I just wish however, there were better ways to learn than getting smacked around by five level 200s with several hundred hours in the game while playing frontline. There is a dueling mode if you dont prefer field battles, however the level difference in 1v1 duels can make it near impossible to find matches. Even if you do find a match, it'll still take consistent practice and match making to understand how to stay alive against long time players. Still worth the buy, just be ready to get your Sh** kicked in a lot.

Final edit: I give up dude, I cant keep up with the high levels and I cant find a server where there isnt only a meager handful of people my level to fight with. If you have the time and patience to learn go ahead, Ive been dealing with the skill wall for about 50 hours now and still havent found a reliable defense against a level 245 throwing off 5 feints and 3 change ups for one attack while hes larping as a tornado.

Mordhau is the game that will make you feel like a medieval badass, hacking and slashing your way through the battlefield. With its unique combat system and wide range of customization options, it's no wonder that this game has garnered a loyal following. However, like any game, Mordhau has its fair share of pros and cons.

Pros:

The combat system is unique and engaging, requiring real skill and strategy to master
The customization options are extensive, allowing you to create a character that is truly your own
The game's graphics are stunning, with beautiful landscapes and intricate character designs
The game has a great sense of humor, with plenty of tongue-in-cheek references to medieval history

Cons:

The servers can be terrible, with lag and disconnects ruining what could otherwise be a great game
Hackers are a real problem in Mordhau, ruining the experience for legitimate players
The community can be toxic, with players hurling insults and taking the game way too seriously
The learning curve is steep, with new players getting slaughtered left and right until they figure out the combat system

Overall, I would give Mordhau a 7 out of 10. It's a fun game that is definitely worth checking out, but it's not without its flaws. If you can overlook the bad servers, the hackers, and the toxic community, you'll find a game that is truly unique and engaging.",1676373515,1676373515,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

A developer may be able to patch out exploits, but once the community has figured out the fighting system in its entirety, there isn't much even the Devs can do (except for maybe constantly changing timings or hitboxes, which would undoubtedly be very annoying for everybody)

All in all bravo for developing this game! I wish I could play another one just like it all over again. 
It is a heap of fun to play with friends.

For me, i kept finding toxic people making disgusting sexual comments about vulnerable groups like children and going into horrible detail. You can mute them, but they use discord servers to operate and will gang up on you if you ask them to stop, they vote kick you from the only lobby or start being abusive in chat.

The graphics were so realistic, I felt as if I were transported back to the bloodsoaked battlefields of yore. The gameplay was intense and satisfying, with a plethora of weapons at mine disposal. Mine personal favorite was the trusty sword and shield, but I must confess, the flail was a fearsome weapon indeed.

The battlefields were as vast as the kingdom itself, and mine enemies diverse. I didst find myself facing off against all manner of foes, from peasants to knights and even the occasional giant. But as a seasoned warrior, I emerged victorious at every turn.

And let us not forget the online multiplayer, which was as chaotic as a siege. I didst make friends and enemies in equal measure, and the battles were fierce. 'Twas as if I were reliving mine glory days, but with the added boon of being able to respawn.

The only criticism I have is about the piss poor development throughout the years.
Feels like nobody has a clue at Triternion about what they have to lay focus on, especially the balance between new players and veterans.

If you want to buy this game, just wait a bit since they are trying to add an 'arcade mode' in with basic combat, since as of right now the learning curve is insanely steep, it takes roughly 200 hours to get somewhat good at the game.

If you aren't that much into combat but still enjoy the multiplayer medieval aspect, there are some amazing mods, like the Mordhau Survival RPG,  that focus more on hanging out and have fun with eachother, instead of going full sweatlord.",1674214341,1674214341,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

At first the combat seems kind of simple, but it's really advanced and nuanced and takes a lot of practise to get good. Honestly it's the best melee combat system I've ever played in a video game. It took me a while to even get my first kill vsing real players, but it feels so good when you start to figure out the mechanics and are actually able to get kills.

No other game has made me laugh as much as I have here. The voice commands/gesture system is so expressive and Mordhau is so immersive, you just have so much control over your character, and some of the interactions you have with other players is just fucking hilarious xD I love it.
This game has genuinely helped me through a lot of shit. If I'm having a bad day, or don't know what to play I jump on a duel server and run around with other dwarfs screaming and emoting at eachother. Then if you get bored of running around as a dwarf you can go serious mode and practise actually getting good at the game and enjoying the amazing weapon/armour customisation and combat system.

This is probably the longest review I've ever left for a game, but this game's brought me so many good times I felt it deserved a proper write-up. 
Personally I hope the devs never stop working on this game, or at least are able to make a sequel at some point :)

The developers of this game are the kinds of people who believe that it is their duty to protect you or I from people with ideas or ideology's different to their own. 
They commit such a self righteous act not realizing that by destroying free discourse and silencing someone for their beliefs or ideas, only ever leads to that person becoming further radicalized into their ideology. 
In short these developers are self righteous fascist who, if they had the opportunity to make what you think and say illegal they would gladly vote to do so.
Much like what they do in the United Kingdom. 
You know, an Authoritarian country where people don't have the freedom or liberty to defend their selves nor their ideas from criminals or the state. 
Hate the truth all you want, suppress peoples freedom of expression, squander the lives of those who died to bring you freedom and look where it gets you, your children and your grandchildren. 
Your good intentions and hubris will pave a road to hell on Earth; a reality where you are just a slave to an authoritarian machine where video games are a thing of the past.

 - Masochism

When some parts feel like a well built mechanic that was ment to replicate combat its quickly ruined by strange meta builds. 

When looking at the game on the whole its just seems like the devs dont want to try and balance or rework things that have become ""game breaking"" and the community  is ruined by what plagues most games now ignorant racists and toxic players.

update 2 Horde survival mode: all weapons at players spawn (""to be noob friendly"") = no more worth exploring/moving around the map

update 4: eastern update changed totally the hordes game mode instead of creating a new one...:
- Add of perks ?? no more the ""everyone get the same, only player skills"" principle
- One perk gives invulnerability... seriously ? (so much for realism)
- No more a survival as you have to protect a guy (bot)
- No more a survival as you can get your teammates out of their graves... (during the same wave they died)

Combat just feels (paradoxically) too clunky and slow and yet too focused on twitch reflexes rather than planning and forethought, and armor and shields too impotent. Basically just comes down to whoever hits first generally survives due to how staggering works. Likewise, not being able to chamber and hold an attack renders timing unnecessarily complicated, and the fact that *all* non-thrusting attacks are diagonal or horizontal makes fighting effectively as a group essentially impossible. I now find it to be in an odd position of being both too realistic and not realistic enough, inherently favoring faster weapons and punishing players who rely on more ponderous and impactful armaments by making the armor one would rely on to pick up the defensive slack nowhere near unable to turn aside any blow, and making such weapons so cartoonishly slow and clumsy one has to stand out in the open at the perfect distance and swing at exactly the right angle, and just *pray* the other person is oblivious and doesn't just parry or move, or gently tap one's abdomen with a shortsword and somehow stagger a fully plate-armored juggernaut. If combat were faster and more precise, if would be more unforgiving but at least it would make individual fights actually fun, and not a slugging match to see whose stamina drains first. If armor worked as armor actually does, it could result in an interesting decision between being able to tank most light to medium blows but having much slower stamina regen and probably being the first person to get targeted with absolutely everything. Properly implemented armor could result in individual clashes between two combatants still being short and brutal, but necessitating an overall slower and more measured approach right up to the moment weapons start flying, and could be more fun for the tactically minded. Horses control like bicycles in all but the most open and flat of ground, acceleration and deceleration take far too long, and the few maps that have space for cavalry to see use don't really spawn enough horses for proper mounted battle. I remember War of the Roses, back before Fat Shark took it out back and shot it, had a perk that allowed you to start with a horse. Something like that might be a decent idea, if not necessarily the easiest to balance. The equipment customization options are nice, and a lot of work was clearly put into them, but are clearly price jacked to increase grind time - and I don't find the prospect grinding for entirely cosmetic items for days on end particularly fun, especially when I simply don't find combat too fun anymore. It shouldn't take absolute ages to save up enough gold to get a slightly different maul or helm. What variety there was in the earlier days has grown stale, and really only Horde entertains me anymore. Barely.
One good thing I can say, the community seems to have mellowed out a bit. The most outwardly toxic of sludgeborn trolls seem to have left. Probably still lurking somewhere, but nowhere near as bad as I remember it being.

I will probably hop on and play some on occasion in the future, but I highly doubt I'll care enough to put much effort into it.",1561691891,1673451076,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Not gonna lie, It's definitely going to be a rough time and there will always be players that can dance circles around you before killing you off with some weird attack.

The best part is when you realize that the best tricks are not about abusing the animations, but about mind-gaming successfully. 

Playing 3rd person helps you avoid damage from sides, but playing in 1st person is so immersive you'll likely dodge in real life from time to time.

EDIT: Nowadays it's moderated by abusive leftist geeks and nerds. One of those (Void) was so butthurt about some meme'ing in chat that he perma banned me from overall matchmaking. I will switch to Chivalry 2 now I guess. Ignore the the old review down below. The game itself would be still great without said SJW taking away any anarchy, liberty and fun that once made this game even more special.


Mordhau is a medieval slasher with sheer endless customization options. It's not beginner friendly but if you carry some dark souls spirit with you and won't ragequit after dying the 100th time ye might start to learn the, at first glance simple looking but quite challenging, combat mechanics that can be combined with each other in countless ways.
It's also surprisingly well balanced at its current state. The devs are a very small but sympathetic team, that truly love their game. Ofc it takes much time for them to bring new content (which still comes in steadily) but it's all free and no micro transactions at all. Everything is earned by playing and gitting gud. I personally will prefer this over Chivalry 2 any time due to various reason (starting from fluent combat with high skill cap, almost unrestricted Knight/Archer/Peasant/whatever customization, good graphics, going to even the devs staying with their game)

Now to a point that many found negative... The community.
Be aware it's completly anarchic. You will encounter friendly brothers in arms, skillfull player trying to teach you, amusing bards, roleplayers and funny cosplayers but also over the top toxic edgelords, tryhards and trolls at the same time. Personally I love the chaos. I made up my own rule ""Do not take ANYTHING too seriously in this game and you will have a good laugh"" and what can I say except that I kinda enjoy the anarchy that you can't find in most nowadays games.

So after all it has become one of my favourite games, which delivers much of rememberable and comical moments.

But...
Get Gud. Mordhau is a hard game to master but not hard to pick up on the basics for, best place to do this is doing the tutorial a few times and then hopping into some Horde mode to learn advanced mechanics and get yourself some gold to spend on cosmetics and weapons for you loadouts. 
A lot of Mordhau is toxic, it happens when you have a high skill floor multiplayer game. Some people genuinely want to help you get better at the game if you don't follow advice or learn from your deaths you will continue to experience a high level of toxicity. But, if you do learn from every combat encounter then you can be the one talking shit back. 
I adore this game but there's one more piece of advice I can give you, and its probably the biggest one. If you have a ping of over 80 ms, don't play Mordhau. you need a stable internet connection to get the most enjoyment out of the game, and ping of over 120 ms makes Mordhau utterly impossible to play. If you consistently run 60-80 ms I highly encourage you to stick to Horde Mode, but if you have consistently 60 ms or below the whole game is open to you.",1673202199,1673202199,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

This game is a better attempt at this style of game than chivalry. The skill ceiling is understandably very high and new players with no chivalry experience will suffer a lot. The community has a lot of friendly faces who can teach you the ropes, but it does take some time to get any good at the game. As a new player stick with groups and be a part of the second (rear) line so you can support the moderate or highly skilled players when they throw off the guard of foes. do that and you will still nab lots of kills while also gaining some experience nessisary to fight on your own.

Whatever you do, DO NOT go straight to the dual yards first thing as a newb. it is beyond comprehension how difficult some of the higher skill players are. You won't learn much from them instant killing you. Wait until you are at least somewhat competent in frontline and then try some of the weakest dualyard patrons (they are still insanely difficult, but winning is realistic at this point).

There are also lots of ways to play an effective support from using catapults to building things, to throwing or shooting via bow.

READ FULL REVIEW: [url=https://videogamerate.com/game/mordhau]HERE[/url]

Mordhau is a multiplayer medieval combat game developed and published by Triternion in 2019 for the PC. It offers a deep and satisfying experience that is perfect for players who are looking for a challenging and strategic multiplayer game.

One of the standout features of Mordhau is its deep and satisfying combat. The game features a wide range of weapons and armor, each with its own unique strengths and weaknesses. The combat is fast-paced and requires good reflexes and strategic thinking, and the various game modes offer a good variety of gameplay experiences. The game also features a robust character customization system that allows players to create their own unique warriors.

The graphics and sound design of Mordhau are also noteworthy. The character models and environments are detailed and well-designed, and the sound design is fitting and immersive. The game also features a variety of maps that are well-designed and offer a good balance of open and close quarters combat.

Mordhau does have some minor issues that hold it back. The game can be prone to server issues, and the matchmaking can be somewhat slow at times. The game also lacks a single-player mode, which may be a turn-off for some players. However, these issues do not significantly detract from the overall enjoyment of the game.

Fun Factor: 90/100
Mordhau is a highly enjoyable game that offers deep and satisfying combat, a wide range of weapons and armor, and a variety of game modes. The character customization system also adds an extra layer of depth to the gameplay.

Visual & Sound Quality: 85/100
Mordhau boasts detailed and well-designed character models and environments, as well as fitting and immersive sound design. The various maps are also well-designed and offer a good balance of open and close quarters combat.

Replayability: 90/100
Mordhau offers a high level of replayability due to its deep and satisfying combat, wide range of weapons and armor, and various game modes. The character customization system also adds an extra layer of depth and replayability to the game.

Level of Challenge: 80/100
Mordhau offers a good level of challenge for players. The combat is fast-paced and requires good reflexes and strategic thinking, and the various game modes offer a good variety of gameplay experiences. The character customization system also allows players to tailor their warriors to their preferred playstyle. However, the game does not offer much in the way of difficulty options, so players who are looking for a more difficult experience may be disappointed. 

Overall, Mordhau is a deep and satisfying multiplayer game that offers endless customization and strategic gameplay. Its deep and satisfying combat, detailed graphics and sound design, and robust character customization system make it a standout title in the genre. While it could benefit from better server stability and faster matchmaking, it is still a highly enjoyable game that is well worth checking out for fans of multiplayer games.",1630692510,1672864558,True,0,0,0.518555700778961182,0,True,False,False

Even larger weapons are actually not so heavy (at least, if you're decently fit), so it baffles me how your character feels like they're performing some feat of strength when in reality it's just swinging a longsword from A to B. I mean... I'm a damn shortie and I swing swords faster and better than these fellas. Shame on you!

But enough babbling about realism, this is a videogame after all. The fact that you may know how to swing a sword but will still get wrecked to shit by folks who are either more experienced or just lucky is one hundred percent realistic, and it totally reflects my experience as somebody who actually trains with swords and other melee weapons in real life (yes, I repeated that word by word). As does the fact that just charging head first into battle may INTIMIDATE your foe, but will not outright DEFEAT them - and without proper technique and mastery, you may just grab the damn sword and impale yourself, no cap.

But again, at the end of the day, this is a videogame. It's meant to be fun, and it is. So why are you reading this? Get out there and clobber some folks (or get clobbered, I won't judge). Happy fighting!

P.S.: to those wondering about the Mordhau grip: yes, it exists!
We reviewed that in longsword class. You grip the sword by the blade (not with your palm directly on the edge) and no, you DO NOT automatically get hurt (unless the blade slides on your palm). Striking your foe with the hilt and/or the pommel is also way more brutal than it sounds - you do NOT want that to happen to you.",1672838692,1672838894,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

It's been a while. So much of a while, in fact, that my stance on this game has changed completely into a sour and dour (rhyme intended) one.

Before I go on a massive tirade. I want it to be known that I tried to get into this game multiple times. I really, really wanted to love MORDHAU but I just cant. I know to this game's community Im a ""fucking trash N00b"" by playtime alone, but my opinion matters more than they'd ever admit so I'm stepping up to the podium.

MORDHAU can be best described as an abusive relationship. When it first came out it was simply the best game of the genre. It looks good, played extremely well at first, and when everyone was new and trying to figure things out it was the best time I had ever spent in a video game by a wide margin. Every now and then I think back and reminisce about just how much goddamn fun I had early on, those moments were truly magical. Being a former War of the Roses player, the combat was a total breath of fresh air. Many times it has made me want to reinstall the game and try to catch that magic again.

And then I play it and remember exactly why I stopped.

This game has fallen into the exact same pitfall that the original Chivalry did, in that the combat is now just a Gimmicky Jankfest. It does not feel rewarding at all to me, personally.

It isnt fun getting one tapped by a naked with a maul, dragging so hard it doesnt even look like the fucking thing is moving.

It isnt fun getting killed over and over and over again by the same 3 guys because they play the game like a full time job and you dont.

This does not mean I'm against ""getting good"". I mean, fuck, I'm in the middle of playing Elden Ring as of writing this re-review. My issue is that I shouldn't have to feel as though I'm abusing a shoddy codebase and wonky physics engine just to have the tiniest bit of fun. I stopped playing War of the Roses for this exact fucking reason so why would I subject myself to it again?

I havent even scratched the surface, like how this community despises the idea of a held block because ""lack of engagement"" yet Chivalry II can implement a system that works and proves this game could easily do something similar. Or like how the developers and staff are some of the worst people I have ever seen interact with other human beings. This game just completely breaks you.

Simply put, I think US Marine Boot Camp would treat me better, and that is a major problem. A vast majority of people will never put more than 10 hours into this game and move on feeling fed up and frustrated.

Remember how I said ""my opinion matters more than they'd ever admit""? New Blood is vital to any online game, especially so if the game's core focus is Player vs. Player interaction. The game feels like it actively discourages new players and tells you to fuck off. This game is dead and dying because most new players dont want to deal with it.

Its really telling that even *I* feel this way, because I am no stranger to having my soul mutilated and do it with a smile on my face (I played WoT for 9 years and have four-THOUSAND hours on War Thunder, my soul is a fine fucking powder at this point) and yet this game managed to break me multiple times.

I'm just done for good and going to Chivalry II. Yeah sure its ""Floaty and Looks bad"" but it is at least *accessible* for way more people.

Sorry MORDHAU, can't say I didn't ever try.",1558942570,1672587475,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Having played enough to ""git gud"" (about a week of on and off play for me), I can safely say those people are liars. This game is incredibly fun, and once I found a loadout that was fun and powerful for me, I was topping scoreboards and even occasionally lopping off the heads of the best of the best. It was a lot easier to kill skilled players by cheesing them with one of the many cheesetacular weapons/tools than dueling them, though. If you can't beat them honorably, fight dishonorably!

TL;DR:
This game is a 10/10 for anyone that

2. Can get killed by people who genuinely outskill them without throwing a tantrum about it

Easy to learn but very very hard to master, 
this is the kind of game or if your opponent has 20h played more than you are going to rekt you EZ.
But it was really fun play, mechanics and physics of weapons are really well done.
The community is very funny, most of the players have honor and respect the 1vs1 duels, even on battlefield has multiple.
There are some toxic and troll players which make a lot of noise but it's a short minority.

2022: there are a lot more trolls and hateful people that when I started, sadly most players quit the game for some unknown reason. 
1v1 and 3v3 ranked servers are empty, There are only some players far too superior to you in terms of skill who go completely crazy and insult you with all their names when you manage to kill them as a casual player, a player added me in steam contact to continue insulting me lol, quite pathetic. to believe that the most respectful players have left.

If you hated the ballerina combat of Chivalry then you won't like Mordhau either. Back-breaking Drags nearly impossible to read, and Accels hitting faster than you can Parry make for a frustrating experience at high levels of play. Having to win using those tactics yourself subtracts from the glory and makes the game feel more like a test to see who can cheese the game the hardest. It also ruins any sense of realism the game might have had.

For those who don't know, a Drag is where you draw out the swing of the attack as long as possible so it hits on the last frame, and an Accel is where you turn your camera to swing closest to the enemy so it hits on the first frame. While I am fine with these types of attacks in theory, they are far too powerful in this game. You have no choice but to master and spam alternating between them (while sprinkling in feints), and that's the problem here. We end up with a game that has much less depth in its combat, and every ""good"" player fights the exact same way.

Accels/Drags Explained Visually: https://i.redd.it/slhb0z5tfhy21.png

These are made worse by animation issues. Sometimes the weapon model phases through your body BEFORE it hits you. And you are hit at the end of the attack when there is zero momentum left, yet still take full damage. This is terrible visual feedback and makes reading when to parry artificially difficult.

I rarely feel like I lose fairly in high level duels, but instead like my opponent abused the mechanics more than I did. Mordhau does not reward you for playing fair, quite the opposite. The devs should have toned down these mechanics but instead they caved to Chiv vets over average players, since they were the ones filling their pockets during Kickstarter and testing the game. Now the opposite is true, and your real customers are not impressed. Fix this if you want us to continue playing, or this game will be dead in a few months as its broken meta becomes more and more apparent. Sometimes you will already see only 2k people playing!

The fate of this game is in your hands now Devs, and time is running out. Mine certainly almost has.

See my forum thread about this if you'd like to share your thoughts: https://steamcommunity.com/app/629760/discussions/0/1638662230369949291/

UPDATE: Mods deleted my thread, which contained no more than a link to my own review and some extra points. This is corruption.

2020 Update: Even though the lying devs said they'd look into the problem months ago, the animations are STILL not fixed. Players have only gotten better at breaking the game too.

He was the creator of a game called Mordhau
It was a hit, with players all around

He was on top of the world, making lots of cash

He started to believe he was better than all
Ignoring the needs and wants of his players, he had a ball

But the more he ignored them, the more they'd complain
And soon the game's popularity began to wane
Crush didn't listen, he thought he knew best

Mordhau is a game of immense depth, a battle between two pros for example, is filled to the brim with micro adjustments and psychological assault.

If you're only looking for casual fun, a week is about the time it will take for you to grasp the basics of the combat system. There are fun modded servers, and there is also a roleplay scene.

the combat. omg the combat is the worst thing i have every had the displeasure to deal with and the community is as blind to it as a headless bat in the daytime, feints have such a stupid window that does not line up with the animation it makes the whole thing a joke to try and learn. getting attacked by multiple people is a mess since either you learn how to abuse this games bad design or you just suffer and its never going to get any better.

parrys...these sad attempts at counters are a joke. you have such a fast recovery that you wont ever leave a dual until one of you runs out of stamina. you have to kick but its sluggish and had poor reach and fully exposes you plus you cant really turn into it so you just get hit normally.

combat speed. my god its so slow, from arrows having drag mid flight like its in the water to swings feeling like im trying to do tai chi during combat. look i get you wanna keep ranged weapons from being too broken in a game but cant you try to make them not suck? its so damn annoying that almost every indi dev that makes any game in the dark ages the first thing to be ruined is bows like classic doom rips offs making mini guns suck for some reason.

combat flow. good god its rather play battlefield 2042 and say it was worth my money than play these terrible missions, trying to push or hold ground is so bad because everyone is either trying way too hard to be good with a weapon thats trash or spin slashing so you can hit everyone its a joke. there is hardly any reason to use medkits since you die fast and they dont re spawn so i have to go out of my way to try and heal the team wile they never use them EVER. or i try to help hold the line but i cant hit jack most of the time because spears dont act like they should.

hitboxes. this is the worst thing you could experience in any melee based game, dark soul cheaters are not even this frustrating, spears have such a broke range you miss most of the time because you have less range than it look/feels. the weapon is so slow to ya KNOW JAB that it makes me regret using over having a weapon that can do more than 12 damage to a foe with a slash. just use a halberd.

the player base is also some of the most toxic people i have every ran across, its about as bad as rust players. they just want to ruin your day so they can feel better about themselves. every time i try to give this game a chance im reminded why its a dying game and deserves to be.

dont bother honestly. your basically joining a dead game of normally only 5 or so matches and never any full lobbies and with such bare bones mechanics and game modes its just a ripoff.",1657481507,1672029422,False,0,1,0.45267486572265625,0,True,False,False

But updates have basically crawled to a standstill and the focus of the few we get are... wrong. The playerbase in OCE is dwindling in the duel circuit (barely 1 full server) Support seems to be for modes no one really cares about. Front lines players literally show up for a week or two then leave. Personally, I think with chiv now on steam they should have doubled down on the dueling and skirm aspect of it even harder. Chiv seems to do larger battles better and the larger maps look nicer. Mord should have focused on its much tighter combat system and focused on ranked, dueling and skirm. Where the majority of long time players seem to be, to have a core playerbase like that would have made it a much more healthy game more akin to counterstrike or something. Maybe could have introduced smaller modes too, something like a 5v5 objective based mode, so on. Again, to really focus on the smaller scale skill based combat that mordhau is really strong at. The effort that went in castello could have been 3-5 smaller duel maps or small objective maps. Mordhau could have then been positioned as a tighter smaller scale experience, since those kind of suck in chiv. Missed opportunity, I guess.

TL;DR - I don't recommend picking it up anymore. you missed the good times unfortunately.",1579694885,1672022068,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988,3,True,False,False

Pros
+ Fun, engaging combat mechanics that get better over time.
+ Very high skill ceiling.

Cons
- Boring to play alone. (though that wasn't an issue for me)
- Overpriced, you will either love or hate this game. Why price it at 30USD if all but 1 gamemode is PvP only?
- Balance issues. Very strong combos like maul or spear and shield take little skill to use and a ton of skill to defeat.
- Toxic community. Not everyone is toxic, but most are. I would say this community is worse than Overwatch, For Honor, and Call of Duty.

If I had to rate this game I would give it a solid 6/10. Buy the game on a sale, small developers like this need a bigger budget and a larger team.

Here's some advice for the dev team.
Tone down ranged weapon damage and increase the point cost for picking ranged weapons, then decrease the points required for ranged weapon perks. That small change will remove many ""Problem Builds""",1671814377,1671814377,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

not fun outstanding issues with dueling and overall the game itself  needs to be fixed especially the ranked mode the elo system is such garbage  you lose absurd amounts of elo for 1 loss and gain so little for winning even at lower ranks it should be that way only on the higher ranks like every other game with a competent ranked system also dont buy this game unless you have more patience than there is people in the world (8 billion and ongoing for measure)  cause the game is dying and its only sweats left that understand the game  furthermore im not gonna say its all bad cause it can be fun at times but the skill gap and learning curve kind of defeats it so its hard to enjoy yourself especially solo because like having 10 more active hours than someone can make a huge difference in conclusion this game has a fair share of bugs huge learning curve  toxic community not casual in the slightest and if you want a fun casual slasher game just go play chiv dont buy this garbage until they fix it

edit 674 hours

 - this game still  sucks dont buy it , it is 2x worse than it was before but yet i still play it because i have no life and commit to the pain


-edit 820 

game is dying still and it also still sucks dont buy it community is a mix of good and bad  the best way i could describe is a fucking high school and the servers are classes theres so many clans and types of people and notable characters but gam sux d!cK and balls and isnt worth buying (game servers keep going down)


edit 860

red parry is when you parry an attack before it hits you but the game doesnt let you parry you can find when you get a red parry if you open console and type ""m.debugnetworkparry 1""

- horrible game fix red parry it ruins the game even more than the devs continuously do with the stupid updates , especially at higher levels of game play its even worse because you completely read an attack and HIT THE PARRY BUTTON WAY BEFORE EVER BEING HIT and the game says no and just doesnt parry and you get hit its so frustrating and takes the fun out of it cause i did half of the games point read an attack successfully and parry it  but then i cant cause the game is shit , i am not a bad player but im not saying im the greatest but im far from the worst and i find myself losing easy duels to red parry like i dont stand a chance and furthermore THE COMMUNITY OF THIS GAME HAS JUST ACCEPTED ITS 5H!T AND JUST PASSES RED PARRY ON AS A GAME MECHANIC CAUSE ITS SO COMMON

Doesn't help that this game's version of skill expression makes you look like a total goober with no leg bones and a weightless sword, instead of a medieval knight.

I've enjoyed it immensely and had a great time playing it during the height of its popularity.

As the unofficial continuation to torn banner's Chivalry Medieval Warfare title, Mordhau gave a large portion of the player-base the updates that saw slower and slower releases. As it's own title, it was an ambitious project taken on by players who grew tired of waiting for their favorite developers and decided to put their own efforts to the test. Mordhau used to be concept art on the torn banner forums, and it has achieved much since. I would say that Mordhau has earned it's place on the higher echelon of the niche of the genre. A place it rightly deserved: It has been, and still is, the dominant title in the field.

That said, history repeated itself too with Mordhau. Content updates have been steadily growing apart and players have been largely left to their own devices on official servers without much moderation. Truly, a dog-eat-dog world, as depicted by the original teaser trailers. Like torn banner, Triternion decided to appeal to the section of it's player-base interested in cosmetic variety more often than that which asked for substantial new content (e.g: maps and/or game modes). And latency has become an issue for a large portion of those who stayed for long. Like torn banner, Triternion came out with DLCs too late for many to notice and/or care. And like torn banner, concrete modding support arrived a tad too slowly.

I cannot speak for the European and north american stages as I am located in the Asian one at the time of writing this review. However, on this end, the game has mostly emptied out. The competitive scene never really existed here, even with dueling and ranked system being implemented. These days most servers are empty with the exception of a few, and on very specific days and times (at which the same people always show up). No new challenge comes in, and no new rotation of players drip in to enrich the game's skill and technique based trope. Because of this, the game has moved into the frame of 'same old' for me personally. Is this the same in Europe and north america? Maybe. I don't know.

Like chivalry medieval warfare, and Age of chivalry that preceded it (as a half life mod), I think Mordhau was a passion project more than it was a lasting title, and without constant innovation it fails to compete against other games in the market. I feel that new players coming in will have an extremely difficult wall to climb before they enjoy the game, and will face the same players again and again if they even find someone to play with in the first place.

I hope that Mordhau will inspire the next big title to come out in the future. I feel that it's days are past.

Brief Updated Review:

Player numbers are dwindling but, you will still find a game. Combat is still fun and rewarding. Class creation system is great and keeps me invested. No Micro-transactions. You will get curb stomped by some players who probably have not put the game down since release. I play purely for the chaos of frontline and invasion (Both objective games). 40 vs 40 games when the servers are somewhat full. If you have a poor internet connection, then you probably want to avoid this game as a spike in your ping can be fatal. This game will drop new players and old players together, but it is probably for the best (See full updated review for my reasoning). Finally, players have had a few server stability issues.

Overall, still fun if you do not care about your kill/death ratio. Come for the chaos and class creation system. You will get better and not fall for feints eventually, took me a lot of time. I really hope this game gets a spike in popularity as it is a great game.


Full updated review:

I reviewed this back in 2019 and some of my points still stand, but I thought I should update it since a fair bit has changed. I was level 22 when I first wrote the review and as of when I add this, I am sitting at level 80.

To start off this game is still great, I have been coming back to Mordhau through out the years and have seen the best of what the game has to offer and the worst of it. It is a difficult game to get back into as you will get that high level player that will wipe out the server. I am level 80 with 300+ hours but you can find players who are at level 200 and it is a slow levelling process.

New players and old players:

You may think it is bad for an experienced player and a new player to be thrown together and well… it is but the active player numbers are not exactly high.

How Chivalry (the game that Mordhau is based off) handle new players was it gave those level 1 – 15 their own server to learn. This was great but high-level players would just create a smurf accounts so they could join those games. Also, when you hit level 16 you were dropped with everyone else and at that point players had far more advanced techniques. Level 1 – 15 on Chivalry was a chaotic mess of luck. Whereas 16+ was a lot of feinting, avatar abuse, ect.
So, it is probably for the best that new players and old players are put together. As they will learn a lot faster.
(I welcome feedback on this topic as it is what discourages new players from enjoying themselves on Mordhau)

Closing thoughts:

Appreciate all feedback I have been giving never expected a review to do this well. I want Mordhau to stand the test of time as it is fun and great to comeback to. Probably gave the impression that the game is dying. I would love to be wrong, but I am finding myself using the server browser to find fuller games instead of pressing quickplay. I took a break around patch 18 – 19 and came back January of 2021 so it feels like a lot has happened in Mordhau in these past 3 months.

2019
For existing players:

Yes, it is rage inducing. Yes, that sword did hit you. ""How?"" very easily, you didn't block it. Player with maul wondering how they lost to a player with a training sword? All weapons are different. Each with their own speeds. Yes, some weapons hit harder than others. Some are longer than others and yes that guy on your team blind firing the catapult DOES deserve to die, no one will blame you if that player was to disappear.

You must accept that 80% of the time, you are the one who messed up. There is that 20% due to internet connectivity and sometimes lack of hit registration (Seen players complain but never happened to me).

If you ever struggle when playing, try out third person. You might find yourself surviving 3 vs 1 encounters. Also, try to create custom classes and look at the weapon stats. Also, there is an offline mode you can use to practise against AI.

For potential buyers:

If you anger easily or prone to rage quit, then this game isn't for you.

It is rage inducing and you will question half the hits you take/inflict. But in a 32 vs 32 match it is very chaotic. Allies and enemies charging into one another and then immediately stopping because they really want to protect their Kill Death ratio. That lute player somehow playing Metallica... There is a lot to take in. A load of unique classes as well as a class creation system. You want to have 3 lutes on your person at all time? Go for it.

Gameplay:

The weapon combat is great using your mouse and avatar to make swings hit faster or slower. The various strengths of each weapons. For example, spears are better at stabbing than for swinging. Weapons will collide with surfaces which will stop their momentum. Parry’s and feints are available allowing you to psyche out your opponent. Armour affects your movement and overall damage you can take. Armour is located on three areas: Head, Torso and Legs. There is chambering which I do not fully understand and most of the time I’m to mystified by it to realise I should strike back.
You can create your own class which is a ton of fun. The system works by having a limited amount of points and every item costing points dependant on strength of item. There is medical equipment you can carry that helps survivability of you or your team. There’s an engineer class that lets you build fortification (Only in specific areas) and ballistae. Engineer tools are available for create your own class. You also have access to perks when creating classes. Bows I do not personally use. Prefer to swing a sword in a hazardous environment than shoot from a safe distance. There’s probably a lot of information I’ve missed, feel free to fact check me.

Extra (Just things):


There are 3 stages you will go through when fighting larger skirmishes with your allies in MORDHAU.

Stage 1: ""I'll just use stabs and therefore, won't hurt my allies!""

Stage 2: ""Whoops sorry! Didn't mean to hit you there!""

Stage 3: ""Why are you standing within axe-swinging distance?!?! Do you have a death wish?!?""

If you see a lute player on the opposite team. Let them pass, they’re likely late for their gathering and deserve the right of way.

Now the player base is divided personality wise. You have the tryhards which every game must be a win otherwise the game is ♥♥♥♥. The casual players who will emote and are more likely to be friendly. You will have the new players who can often be found wondering to parts unknown and endangering the wild life (Other players with their dam catapults). You also get the team killing for horses or siege equipment. I like horse as much as anyone, but I’ll dismount for class with a longer weapon than mine and of course if they… ASK! Yea, no one ask for anything and just expects you to know better? Players complain when they’re killed by anything. I had a guy complain after I killed him with his own throwing axe. Not all players are like this, but you only notice the annoying ones who team kill, disrupt funny moments, etc…

The community… Most are ok… But holy crap do players get mad. Either I didn’t notice it before or Crossroads has unleashed MORDHAU players inner demons. I’m no angel, I get mad too. Holy crap though, Toxic as all hell some days. However, there are a few funny players that make it worthwhile. On Grad me and an opponent took turns firing the ballista, it was surprisingly civil. I would fire, step away then he would fire and ect.

Also, lute players are still alive and well. I’m disappointed in the backstabbing ones though…

Feel free to correct me on any points.

I played this game for a while, and it is heartbreaking to give this game thumbs down, for it has been the source of a great distraction from everyday problems. 

However, the community seem to dwindle and is getting rather toxic.  The issue lies primarily with duel servers, as few individuals seem to experience power trip, actively bullying, votekicking players over nothing, while administrators playing favourites. The whole dynamic is unhealthy and it further contributes to the slow death of this definitely not new game. 

If you still would like to give this game a shot, then I suggest staying away from duel servers is a good recipe for good mental health. It is not COD level toxicity just yet, but overtime you will eventually be targeted by few empowered individuals.

A couple months ago, my wife said she was going out for a ladies' night. She asked me to take care of my son, so I immediately obliged. ""Yes Ma'am,"" I told her. After a while of waiting, she finally left and I could play my favourite game, Among Us. I hopped on my laptop, booted it up and my desktop loaded, complete with the 'Red Sus' background and all my Among Us Impostor fan-art. I was shaking in excitement. I slowly dragged my finger across the track pad, and watched the cursor as it glided over to the Among Us icon. Among Us. My absolute favourite game of all time and quite possibly the best and most well-made game in the entire world. As I clicked the button my body twitched with joy at the thought of being the impostor again. My fingers drummed impatiently on my desk as the Innersloth logo faded in, and then out. Then the main title appeared. I immediately looked at pink as she slowly floated across the screen. Oh, how I wish I could feel those luscious, soft asscheeks. Pink is my queen. The real woman in my life. My wife could never be as sexy as Pink is; her soft footfalls in electrical as I peek at her curvy form from inside a vent, waiting for the right time to strike. I could never get close to Pink, however, as if she had some kind of sixth sense, she would always leave before I could reveal myself to her as the impostor. I press Practice, to warm up my fingers before my first intense game of Among Us. I hit Blue in Comms, then cross the hall and vent to Specimen, murdering Green in cold blood. The thrill of killing an animated character in an online game has never been such a rush. I then move towards Reactor, stabbing Yellow in the back and then running down the corridor to the right to access Decontamination. I move quietly through the halls, like a snake about to strike its prey, and I see- Oh no. It's Pink. Standing there motionlessly as I face her directly. Her visor shows no emotion. But she knows. I can feel it in the air. I can't kill her. She is too beautiful, too angelic, the light reflecting off of her pink bodysuit, like stars on a voided sky. She doesn't run. I am moved to tears as I caress the screen, kissing it tenderly. ""Goodbye, Pink. See you soon. It will all be okay,"" I whisper in a soft, reassuring voice. Then as my cursor hovers over the kill button, I hesitate. Thoughts of love go through my head. Red having reddish-pink sus children with Pink. But I have to. As the impostor, it is my duty to kill. I press the 'Kill' button and watch as my character beheads Pink silently. All I hear is the spurt of blood. There is no rush. There is only Red, standing by himself in Fuel. Pink's lifeless body laying on the floor beside him. I feel nothing at first, then immense sadness, like I'm at a loved one's funeral. My son knocks on the door, interrupting my brief moment of mourning. He asks, ""Dad? Are you going to make me a snack?"" I tell him to shut up, and my voice cracks. I break down sobbing. I killed her. I killed my one true love. God, forgive me. I open the door to my son, and he has a confused look on his face. I say nothing, and walk to the kitchen to make him a sandwich. Tears roll off my face into the bread as I lay it onto the counter. Lettuce, cheese and meat, followed by a sad swirl of mustard on top. My son is quiet. He sits on the couch, and stares at the floor. There is a depressing air around us. I serve him the sandwich and walk back to my room, contemplating life. If I killed Pink, how am I to be trusted around my family? I cry for hours, and finally my wife comes back. She sees me bawling on the bed like a child who dropped his ice cream. She then asks me why I'm crying and mutter, ""I killed her. I killed my only love, Pink, in Among Us."" She is filled with rage and slaps me across my face. I feel numb. She asks for a divorce. I don't reply. Instead, I take my laptop and get into my car, driving to a nearby hotel. Fast forward a few months to the divorce. It was quick and painless. After court, I ask my former wife to take me back.

""I can't take you back. You've always been this way. I was sus of you from the start.""

4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes.

This game is not good, yet it's better than its ""competitors"", quotes because both of those games are known to be terrible (Chivalry, For Honor). This game is simply a lesser evil when you compare it to both of those, and it's what people play because there just isn't anything better for now.
Do not buy this game unless you're okay with going into a game all about exploiting mechanics and simply breaking it and considering that skilled play. Both of the games mentioned earlier are known to be like this and Mordhau is not different on that matter at all.

First off, I'll say what this game does better than its competitors.
There's a lot of cosmetic options available to you, with no microtransactions to gate them away from you. Unfortunately, you have to play the game for 50+ hours or more to even unlock most of it. With my playtime I only managed to unlock a modest set of cosmetic heavy armor and skins for one sword, any further would require me to dip a lot more hours into the game. So you have to live with looking pretty bad outside of heavy armor until you play the game for a long time.
There's also the fact that slashing your sword actually feels good. Getting to hit opponents, making a follow up attack, along with the sound effects tied to them (specially for blunt weapons), is great. You also have access to upward slashes, which Chivalry didn't have. But that's about where the good things end.

Balance in this game is absolutely miserable. Movement is terribly slow yet it's possible to chase down a player too hard and bumrush them. You're not likely to survive a 2v1 at all unless you have hundreds of hours in the game already and can do some godly parries (including parrying attacks coming from behind, which is unrealistically broken). Most of the time you'll get yourself beaten up by other players that simply have more hours than you, because they parry absolutely everything you throw at them. Once you learn how to parry yourself, duels become just a parry contest to see who misses first. Missing a parry is extremely punishing and you're probably dead the instant you do miss one, due to stunlocks. There's also the fact that there's tools for high level play that greatly reward vets, like being able to ""chamber"" an opponent's attack into your own attack, by mimicking their attack direction with the same timing for a parry. You simply cannot do this unless you're really good at the game, and you'll see vets making use of all the tools available to them and making everything a completely one sided experience. This game is about getting trashed and being okay with it, and just learning to deal with getting everything thrown at you all at once, let alone getting into a 2v1 situation.

There's also plenty of glitches in the game and some completely questionable design. Most issues are more visible in the Horde mode of the game, which is a PvE mode that pits your team against waves of enemies, and it's possible to absolutely break the AI to the point they cannot move. Just before uninstalling the game I was in a Horde match and a guy joined the server, told us we're all bad at the game for not doing a certain exploit, which he then went and rushed to do himself, and it broke everything so much that things stopped rendering properly and the server crashed, making us all lose our progress. All because exploiting is considered skilled play. But that's the Horde mode, which shouldn't be used to judge this game, though it's still terrible.
In actual multiplayer matches, it's just frustrating in general. You might have your sword hit an ally when it shouldn't have. Your ping might delay your attacks just enough to make the game act weirdly and not show that you got parried. Your sword might hit the wall *behind* you as you try to attack, even if you're not using an overhead slash. The game's rendering might just glitch out and some things just won't show at all (but thankfully players always render). It's really unstable.

The development for this game is also really slow, the updates are tiny, and the devs have yet to deal with most of the issues this game has. They just dripfeed the community, and they recently made an update to try to alleviate the gap between the low end and high end players, but it still feels like absolute ass to play, and it only made the high end players angry.
The community is also miserable. People spew insults left and right, vets get triggered by anyone not being okay with the game's balance (while the game's playercount drops steadily, having only a consistent vet playerbase), and people abuse certain mechanics as much as they can.

It's just not fun to play at all. Yes, it is better than Chivalry and For Honor, and it certainly is cheaper to play than For Honor too, but the state this game is in just isn't worth it. If you're looking for a medieval slasher to play, unfortunately I have to tell you that you should just look away entirely for now. People look forward to Chivalry 2, which sounds to have seemingly questionable design choices, but for some it'd be better to try that when it comes to Steam eventually, over playing this garbage any further.

I'd give this game a 4/10. It's not good at all, yet it's not the worst. Maybe try it with a big sale, but if you're on the fence, maybe just stay away. It's not worth it in any form. Just play some other medieval game/franchise for now like Mount & Blade, specially M&B Warband, though they're not first person games.

EDIT: After trying Chivalry 2 on the free weekend I can no longer consider ever playing Mordhau again. It has effectively dealt with part of the issues I had with this game, making it a ""better"" game. That game isn't flawless for sure but, once again, new slasher game comes out, it's slightly better than the previous big one, so go play that. Do not waste your money on Mordhau.",1619129149,1670653204,False,9,1,0.544937372207641602,14,True,False,False

as of now the netcode is much improved and the game is quite enjoyable, if anything though i feel like less maps tend to be picked than in the past it ends up being the same few over and over again and the novelty has worn off a bit now with the game. it would be nice to see a few new maps. there is now a lot of weapons and armour sets to the point of becoming over saturated now. also still not a fan of the amount of cosmetic dlc in a £23 multiplayer only game.
would say give it a shot on sale and have fun still rate it above chivalry games but below arcane warfare

Sounds like a good time in theory, right? In actuality you load into a match, pick your character, spawn and promptly die. You get maybe 10 - 20 kills a game if you are lucky, but you were killed by the same lvl 250 twenty times, burned alive by the fire bomb spam six times while fighting a winning battle, watched a midget play a lute and flute on the opposing team and then get stabbed in the back and mauled by 10 random people, tried to duel a honorable knight only for either your team or theirs to double/triple/quadruple team you/him, you were shot by enemy and friendly arrows at the same time while trying to deliver your black powder to obj, and you made friends with a enemy only for their team mate to attack you and while engaged in combat, your good ole buddy decapitates you when you least expect it. Great match, lets do it all again a million more times and that is the entirety of the game. It is not new player friendly, so don't expect any chance of winning any fights for your first matches due to the fact that the only people insane enough to continue playing this sweat fest of a game are now lvl 1000 and have mastered every possible way to feign their attack, deflect your blows, hit you while 10 feet away with their 10 inch knife, stab you while turned backward, and get to you at just the right time to get the finishing blow on you after you just fought off half the team. 

But lets say you don't want to play front lines and would rather just duel some people. Good fuckin luck. The only people who are playing the mode are the best of the best. They have only played this game and no other since its release and everything that is described above about the lvl 1000 is multiplied by ten for these people. They are practically wearing the invincibility armor you said you had on when you were playing outside with your friends and they attacked you ,floating with their pack a punched hammer on a stick that takes ten years to swing sometimes, and other times, two seconds.

The game is like trying to be realistic in some instances but is just not at all in others. I don't think knights walked up to enemies, jumped up and kicked them, feigned ten times trying to make the other block and then destroyed them blow after blow because they were swinging their sword at the speed of light.

So, yeah, the game sucks, but their is a portion of me that keeps wanting to go back and get better just to prove I can. This objective is a losing battle as everything above still applies. Don't get it if you don't want to rage quit after every two games and just have a fun stabby time. Get it if you hate yourself, want to prove you can be good at the this goofy game to no one and waste you life dying over and over and over and over and over to a naked midget with a maul and a lute who looks like he came straight out of a idea you had while high on shrooms and crack.

2/10, will most likely return tomorrow and get mad at pixels that kill my pixels due to a skill issue.

the game cant decide if it wants to be realistic or arcadey so it kinda does and fails miserably at both. However it can be fun to walk around as a naked maul man or build traps. but thats really it. the combat is completely unrealistic in every sense the large battles COULD be good if the game had any form of communication beyond a text chat and some meme voice lines but otherwise it's just 1v1 until some people show up and gang bang you.

I enjoy Horde most of all; not for the [i]riveting[/i] gameplay, as I could find more enjoyment in poking a dried out snake on my sidewalk. No, what I love most of all in this squabble to defend the noble are the funny little Chests which sit invariably in the center of every map. A medieval form of a slot machine, I get the patented Gambler's itch just thinking about them. Oh yes, the mere thought of putting 1,750 coins from my Knight's dabloon sack into one of these chests, at a chance to either win big by getting the Maul or the Zweihander, or lose it all as God thrusts a greasy turd unto me, laughing at me, mocking me, oppressing the Gambler for attempting to satisfy his needs. Personally, I believe that every game mode should feature some form of in-game chance; the opportunity to check out of a hard fought assault on the castle in exchange for some roulette and poker.

But I digress, as this post is not about the King's Casino which should be a mainstay on every map. No, my discussion must return to that Horde. Recently, I have gone to satisfy my itch, to try and win big with the big chests, when suddenly some sort of sick comedy befalls me; I put in my dabloons, the chest breaks open, when suddenly I see my winnings, sometimes an axe, a sword, you name it, fly through the air. This is routine, a nice bit of acrobatics on the weapons part and some keen hand-eye coordination on my part to try and catch it. But sometimes, they are slippery, and I am unable to grab it before it reaches the ground. This is when the terror takes hold. I see my weapon make contact with the earth, and just as quickly, [i]it disappears from view[/i]. Like a fart in the wind, the weapon ceases to exist, no chance to see what I won, or what I lost. It is gone. Vamoose. And I'm left sitting there, limp ♥♥♥♥ in hand, staring unto the empty ground where my weapon should be. What is a gamblin' man to do? When his itch is satisfied, only to be spat on in just the same amount of time? Many nights I have sat, pondering the inordinate amount of money that I could have potentially won, since a slippery little war axe decided to slip through the map, unto the void, out of my hands.",1669353448,1669353448,True,3,3,0.519790589809417725,2,True,False,False

For maybe seven Patches. 
Then, they completely tricked, trapped, robbed, and betrayed their playerbase, by gradually turning their game into precisely what they promised, throughout several years and dozens of Developer Commentaries (both video and in written form), it WOULD NOT turn out to be: exactly what Chivalry is. 
In other words, busted clean in half, and balanced around this fact, rather than tightening up the gameplay, so that fighting does not inevitably result in whoever can exploit glitches the hardest... which they promised - didn't assure, didn't claim, PROMISED - they would not turn MORDHAU into. 
There are dozens of other serious issues that have been created, both on accident, and some of them, frighteningly, on purpose, that I could elaborate upon.

But on the simple and clear basis of them lying to me, and not having the spine to stick with their original goal, which was to emulate Chivalry, but without the jank, I can no longer recommend it. 

It now has more fcck-y issues than Chivalry does, if not more, and tuned up to 20. 

This mostly happened because the developers have proven, among possessing other character flaws, to lack the wisdom to know when to tell their Players that they're idiots, thus ignoring terrible advice, or suggestions, and when to actually consider beneficial ideas. 

It really makes me sad. This was solid game, for a good year, more or less.

A couple months ago, my wife said she was going out for a ladies' night. She asked me to take care of my son, so I immediately obliged. ""Yes Ma'am,"" I told her. After a while of waiting, she finally left and I could play my favourite game, Among Us. I hopped on my laptop, booted it up and my desktop loaded, complete with the 'Red Sus' background and all my Among Us Impostor fan-art. I was shaking in excitement. I slowly dragged my finger across the track pad, and watched the cursor as it glided over to the Among Us icon. Among Us. My absolute favourite game of all time and quite possibly the best and most well-made game in the entire world. As I clicked the button my body twitched with joy at the thought of being the impostor again. My fingers drummed impatiently on my desk as the Innersloth logo faded in, and then out. Then the main title appeared. I immediately looked at pink as she slowly floated across the screen. Oh, how I wish I could feel those luscious, soft asscheeks. Pink is my queen. The real woman in my life. My wife could never be as sexy as Pink is; her soft footfalls in electrical as I peek at her curvy form from inside a vent, waiting for the right time to strike. I could never get close to Pink, however, as if she had some kind of sixth sense, she would always leave before I could reveal myself to her as the impostor. I press Practice, to warm up my fingers before my first intense game of Among Us. I hit Blue in Comms, then cross the hall and vent to Specimen, murdering Green in cold blood. The thrill of killing an animated character in an online game has never been such a rush. I then move towards Reactor, stabbing Yellow in the back and then running down the corridor to the right to access Decontamination. I move quietly through the halls, like a snake about to strike its prey, and I see- Oh no. It's Pink. Standing there motionlessly as I face her directly. Her visor shows no emotion. But she knows. I can feel it in the air. I can't kill her. She is too beautiful, too angelic, the light reflecting off of her pink bodysuit, like stars on a voided sky. She doesn't run. I am moved to tears as I caress the screen, kissing it tenderly. ""Goodbye, Pink. See you soon. It will all be okay,"" I whisper in a soft, reassuring voice. Then as my cursor hovers over the kill button, I hesitate. Thoughts of love go through my head. Red having reddish-pink sus children with Pink. But I have to. As the impostor, it is my duty to kill. I press the 'Kill' button and watch as my character beheads Pink silently. All I hear is the spurt of blood. There is no rush. There is only Red, standing by himself in Fuel. Pink's lifeless body laying on the floor beside him. I feel nothing at first, then immense sadness, like I'm at a loved one's funeral. My son knocks on the door, interrupting my brief moment of mourning. He asks, ""Dad? Are you going to make me a snack?"" I tell him to shut up, and my voice cracks. I break down sobbing. I killed her. I killed my one true love. God, forgive me. I open the door to my son, and he has a confused look on his face. I say nothing, and walk to the kitchen to make him a sandwich. Tears roll off my face into the bread as I lay it onto the counter. Lettuce, cheese and meat, followed by a sad swirl of mustard on top. My son is quiet. He sits on the couch, and stares at the floor. There is a depressing air around us. I serve him the sandwich and walk back to my room, contemplating life. If I killed Pink, how am I to be trusted around my family? I cry for hours, and finally my wife comes back. She sees me bawling on the bed like a child who dropped his ice cream. She then asks me why I'm crying and mutter, ""I killed her. I killed my only love, Pink, in Among Us."" She is filled with rage and slaps me across my face. I feel numb. She asks for a divorce. I don't reply. Instead, I take my laptop and get into my car, driving to a nearby hotel. Fast forward a few months to the divorce. It was quick and painless. After court, I ask my former wife to take me back.

""I can't take you back. You've always been this way. I was sus of you from the start.""

If you like Chivalry, you're 100% gonna love this game.

The mechanics are similar to Chivalry's, but with a few different mechanics and no ballerina spinning. So it's Chivalry with the bug fixes.

All in all, the launch took forever, but honestly I think it was worth the wait.

Edit: There are quite a few reviews claiming that they were banned from the game and not using cheats, yet, the devs are looking into every unban request that was put into their forums. As far as I know, the manual reviews for about 900 people have come back as them actually using a cheat program and just claiming they didn't cheat.

Don't trust the negative reviews from people who are banned.

Edit 2: The entire community is toxic

Edit 3: The game has had a few combat updates, making dragging harder and trying to prevent stupid attacks like waterfalls and wessex attacks. Pretty good, give it another shot if the dragging turned you off from the game.

Edit 4: It's seems that updates are slow, but the devs send us snipets on their Discord server. If you ever feel like there's no updates, check in with their Discord server and check out what they're working on.

The game is the perfect incarnation of the genre in that everything that happens in game (net code etc.) is visually represented in a way that is actually real and not 'gamey' (in the sense of min/maxing and exploits). The game needs some more maps for variety and, perhaps, to balance some damage values, but this is the first $30 (full price that is!) game that delivered all the goods right up front. 8.7/10

- Nerfed kicks
- Made reduced friendly fire and faster health regen the default, making the game more arcade-y
- Made loadouts needlessly complicated, and also made the UI worse
- Added terrible, poorly balanced maps that are just way too big for their own good, and aren't interesting
- Added SBMM, even though they said they would play into the opposite of this trend
- Made several things just less visceral and unpredictable (horse jousting, friendly traps) because losers kept complaining
And just generally made the game wacky and stupid.

Different weapons and armor each with different stats, along with character customization, allows you to make many MANY different knights or naked rock goblins.  Very violent with dismemberment, but blood and gore can be adjusted in settings, making MORDHAU suitable for varied audiences.  Servers are available for renting and joining, and modding is included.  Leveling up becomes increasingly harder, giving players the ability to rank up immensely in skill and exp.  Weapons and armor cost gold and gold is given at the end of every match depending on how the player preforms, weapons are cheap and easy to acquire, however, most armor is not, so spend sparingly.  Overall MORDHAU earns an easy 9/10, with the only disadvantages being money is hard to acquire in large amounts, no skin colors other than IRL, and can be difficult.

Also comparing this game to my experience on Chiv 2 since its the only competitor.
All you need to know about mordhau is that it is a broken game that wont be repaired and that it is the closest you will get to a virtual martial art (regardless of whatever UFC, Boxing or martial art fighting game being made).
Combat is fluid and expressive but you are not going to see the combat get fluid and expressive yourself unless you sink a couple of hundred hours into the game. Game is not new player friendly at all and has a horrible massive multiplayer teamfighting experience but this is the game you want to buy if you are looking for a more competitive smaller based team fighting or dueling experience. If you are looking for an easy to get into fun to play with friends multiplayer fpm slasher you are honestly better off buying chiv 2. 
Also Id like to address something I see a lot of people complaining about both as low level mordhau players and Chiv players it that the game is too hard or complicated. I have absolutely 0% proper ""coaching"" experience with anyone whatsoever. I just kept dying over and over again in order to learn  how to play the game, the game is not that hard and its more brainless than one might think. (mouse 1 go brrr)

TL:DR Broken and dying game with a great combat system for dueling and smaller based game modes but a rather unbearable massive multiplayer combat experience. I do not recommend this game to new player unless you wholeheartedly understand to see results in this video game that you will have to spend some time learning concepts never introduced in any other video games before.",1620531715,1667979275,False,2,1,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Like always, we'd love to hear feedback on the game, and we're always looking for ways to improve. Please let us know any feedback, comments, concerns, etc. that you have; we'll absolutely take them into consideration. Anyways, please be civil and keep things polite down below. Thanks!

As for our meeting this week, no bullet points this time - we actually had a pretty short meeting overall. Everyone's got their heads down, focusing on final touches before we release. We're eyeing a release in the coming weeks (can't say when exactly), and as of today we've finished up all map changes and the addition of our new map, Dungeon, as well as cosmetic integration, localization updates, etc.

We're more or less 'done' with the update, but we have one known bug with faces we're hammering out, as well as lighting builds, and some text overflowing UI boxes in certain languages. Fixing the face issue will require some small tweaking, but the rest should be pretty trivial to fix in the coming few days. Once all that is sorted, we'll be doing a last-minute pass on testing the release build, and we should have the update out!

Like I said above, we can't say exactly when the release will be - bugs can always rear their heads, and some might take a bit longer than expected, etc. - but we feel like we're on the right track. Thanks for your patience, and we're excited to let y'all get your hands on patch 26 soon!

Hello. I don't really write reviews like this often so sorry if isn't that good. (its also 1am and my brain is tired so I'm probably going to edit this the next day.)

-- FOR THE NEW PLAYERS --

This game is fun. When I started playing this game, I was unsure if I should keep going or just quit it, refund and never think about it again, But I am glad I didn't. My first experience for this game was doing the tutorial, having a bit fun, playing hordes and then frontline. When I started playing frontline I got people doing these weird moves and tricks like faints or the ""come at me dodge."" which made me confused and gave me a less fun experience, But I didn't quit right away. This game can be ""scary"" at first. You have people being toxic in chat, doing these weird moves and etc. but once you start playing and practicing more and more the better and more familiar you get with it. As I started playing I also got tips from my nephew which really helped since he was the one that convinced me to buy it instead of chivalry (and this was before chivarly was on steam.) So I recommend you to maybe watch some videos, but I am mostly self taught with these things. If you are just starting out then I suggest you play versus bots, play hordes and then some brawl (Best brawl gamemode is Team Deathmatch / Deathmatch imo)

-- FOR THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE NOT PURCHASED IT YET --

To the people that haven't bought it:
This has many reviews about the toxic and sweats of this game, but do not let that drive you away. This game is fun, and you get used to the 10  - 20 year olds who act the same age and say stuff in the chat (which you can turn off.) 
I don't see anyone talk about the good side of the community. Every game has a good and bad side to it. The randomness and fun you can have with other people is amazing. You become friends with the enemy, you see all the goofy little random characters running around, fighting, playing the lute or flute and etc. You can have a great time with this game really. I recommend you try this out and if you do not like it then refund it.

-- MY RECOMMENDED GAME MODES FOR STARTING OUT --
If you are just starting out, I believe these are the best ones to start out with:

Team Deathmatch, Deathmatch, Hordes.

These are probably the easiest modes to start out with so you don't get too overwhelmed (I mostly recc Hordes at first, but others are great too.) I hope you have a wonderful day my friend. Cya!",1667780243,1667780243,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

To put plainly, the game is dying with a dev team so far up their own ass it's embarrassing. Content and balance patches are sometimes as rare as twice a year. This compounded by the skill gap from new players to veterans is astounding. The amount of meta-knowledge that goes into a fight now is staggering to a new player.

High level gameplay has devolved into who can exploit the ""meta"" weapons' animations to be unreadable. Namely you'll only see the Greatsword and a few polearms (Poleaxe/Bardiche) being used by people that are borderline NPC with their fighting style. It's also worth mentioning that if you wanna abuse these people, just spam stab and let them chamber their stamina away, or kill them when they try to gamble. Watch out for the wonky animations they will employ back though, but you'll get used to reading them...eventually.

The community is hit or miss. You can find very friendly people, or edgy kids (or people that act like kids at least). However, the hyper-competitive players are arguably the worst given their stockholm syndome to the aforementioned fighting styles, they will just tell you to 'git gud' if you criticize their precious methods. On the flip-side, I've had countless hours of fun on chill duel servers with friendly people not sweating their brains out.

The good things this game has going for it is namely the combat feels really rewarding and fun to do, everything I'd want in a medieval fighter. The animations (when not being wonky on purpose) are solid. The customization options you are given are also phenomenal, seeing the cosplay people make is always charming.

The game is still fun if you don't take it seriously, but as time goes on and through the people you encounter, the cracks start to show and the paint starts to fade.

Edit 2022:
After 1 year little has changed. They added some maps and some cosmetics which is nice. I took a 5 month break after the last disappointing update and was not shocked when nothing changed for the better. They added women which is nice for cosplay and fun.

You can find hilarity in every death, so even when you're losing it's entertaining, and most of all it has modding support, so anything is possible. One time I played on an Elden Ring themed map, complete with bosses. 

My main advice for new players, first, do the tutorial for the free 2500 gold it gives you, then look at the discussion on the steam page, find the post that says something along the lines of 1v1 duel etiquette, and read it. After that's done, join a dueling server from the server browser (deathmatch) and ask in chat if anyone could help you with the basics. If you cant find anyone to help you, at least it can prepare you for the harsh realities of swing manipulation. After your trial by fire, use the server browser to search for servers to join, it lets you choose servers hosted in your area.

If you enjoy repeatedly bashing your skull against a wall when trying to figure out what goes on inside the developers' heads then this game may cater to you. 

Frontline is fun. Either you run your opponents over like a freight train or you can force square peg in circular hole. Do you know what is not fun? Invasion. Frontline's younger brother that caught every single defect running in the family tree. It may look shorter at first glance, but the objective is to fit a much larger square peg into your own smaller hole (No, you are not allowed to stretch or lubricate beforehand.). Do you like having options in games? I know I do. I love approaching things from as many areas as possible because I enjoy chasing shiny objects in the wind. Do you know what makes me sad? When these potential areas from Frontline are cordoned off because it's a no-no area in Invasion. Don't get me wrong, there's nothing wrong with wanting your own space, but for fuck sake does it have to take over an entire city block for each objective? Should Invasion be canned? No, I don't think so. Sure some of the objectives like hide the sausage in the tower may seem like the pinnacle of interactive gameplay, but that's not my gripe with it. My issue is that it should STAY IN ITS OWN LANE. Stop bundling it to the glorious Frontline gamemode like it's some bargain bin product reject that needs to be off the shelves. There are dedicated duel servers for intricate mating dances, I just want to ballista people or wander through the sex dungeon and toss rocks at newly spawned blues as a red on Grad again.

How about the community? You'll either run into people that disagree with the decisions the developers have made in various extremes or people that look the other way in various extremes. No, the game isn't complete shit, but it's also not the best medieval game to grace mankind (yet, but highly doubtful). Sharing criticism doesn't mean one is ungrateful towards the game's company for just existing, it can mean that one wants the game to improve and see its future success. So stop circle-jerking each other in a fucked up ouroboros, form a conga-line instead.

Also make sure your computer is a powerhouse or you may get cinematic silky smooth frame-by-frame gameplay. Even then there's no guarantee that you won't experience stuttering issues in certain areas.

Did you think I was going to talk about the core gameplay mechanics in this review? What's there to talk about, it's a Mario Party minigame stretched out, deep fried, then distorted. Equip 3 rocks and anger the floating 2-handers. Equip a rapier and buckler with dodge and perform botched mass circumcision. The inventory system is your oyster, so go and fuck it, tiger. Feinting is for the indecisive and morphing is for Power Rangers, so there's no reason for either one. Just imagine you're playing cookie clicker but you drag your mouse sometimes I swear it'll be a good time.

For the final score, I think it's 5.9 screaming manchildren out of 10 optimization issues.
