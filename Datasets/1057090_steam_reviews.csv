If you loved Ori and The Blind Forest, this game is a must have. 
It's hard to think of a better platformer.

Everything is made perfectly. Graphics are insanely beautiful, amazing soundtrack, amazing gameplay, it's very hard to master (prepare to be pissed off sometimes), but in the end, it's all worth. 

I almost died at the end, it's simply perfect. 

No other a game made me cry like an idiot. This one has...

Just buy it. It's worth every coin.

I love metroidvanias. I've played quite a few and I love the genre. Ori and the Will of the Wisps is simply just one of the best games I've ever played and one of the best metroidvanias I've ever played. I have to say, what puts this game apart from the competition is the music. The music in this game is unbelievably good. Throughout the whole game, it is well written and expertly conveys the emotion and tone of events/areas. Besides the music, I have to say that this game does everything else just so right as well. The storybuilding, the environments that are so unique and just flow together, the sound design, the gameplay and controls. There is just something so special and so refined about this game.
If you somehow haven't elected to buy and play this game yet. Seriously do. If you haven't played Ori and the Blind Forest, do that first, even. I will gush about how good this game is, and I believe a lot of that is built off of the foundation that is the previous game. Plus, having played the previous game, you will be a lot more familiar with the world and characters which is a nice thing to have going into this game.

It's same game as first ""Ori and the blind forest"" but everything is better(graphic,movement,feeling). Personally I love the graphic and movement design and I think it's a lot better than first ""Ori"". If you don't care about the story(but its good) just play this part first.

If you liked the first one, you will like this as well. If you didn't, likewise. It's still beautiful, fun, tricky, adorable, and it still has some control issues. You can play it with controller, mouse+keyboard or keyboard alone. Allegedly, controller is fine? Haven't tried it. Some things, such as ""bash"" are nearly impossible to play with keyboard alone. And a few levels, I had to change back to keyboard alone, as I really needed both hands on the keys.

For those who never played the first one: It's a cutesy platformer - seems particularly well liked by woman players, but with some weird fantasy story.

The art and music are the best part of the game for me. I really wish, they'd give us a photo mode in this game, just so i can take screenshots of all the pretty sceneries. They really improved on art in this game, because all locations don't look empty anymore, and each area actually looks unique, rather than just being a recolor of any other one.

As for gameplay, despite them clearly improving the combat system a lot, platforming still is this game's stronger side. My favourite two abilities are still Bash and Launch, as they feel the most unique and are really fun (and usefull) in combat. What i don't like are the Grapling Hook and the Spirit Light. The Hook is insanely inconsistent in how it works and i've messed up many parkours because of it. Spirit Light just goes against the game's design in general. Not only is it very slow to deploy and hard to aim, which goes against everything else focusing on fast-paced combat and movement, but it also kinda ruins the point of bash.(And you can use it to cheese certain platforming section).

As for combat,the system was absolutely improved. I would argue it's one of the best ones out there. The problem is similar to the first game, where you don't have enough stuff to fight. There are only 5 boss fights in the game and half of them happen before you get any abilities unlocked. Another thing i don't like is how the animation and artstyle ruin a lot of fights. Enemies either need an extremely basic attack kit, or they have too many different animations to be sightreadable.
This is especially true for bosses. Other than that i do geniuenly love the system and how it let's you change your tools on the fly.

Theres so much attention to detail that it offently leaves me confused they only needed 5 years to complete this masterpiece of a bob ross painting. And its not just my opinion. The whole community and players outside of it has stated that its one of the most articulated and wonderful pieces of work they‚Äôve seen. It might as well be used as the definition for eye candy. But its not just the artstyle that‚Äôs good. Far from it infact. My personal favorite mechanic of this game is the movement. As I stated before the game is a 2d platformer. Its movement is very floaty and light which is perfect for a 2d platformer. Meanwhile the floaty movement is good what really makes the movement good is the skills you get. I wont get into detail of what those skills are so you can enjoy the game yourself. But the skills only serve to compliment the already extremely good movement. You have to think while moving around which just makes it even more fun because you have to strategies. And when it comes to combat the movement helps it to become so much more fun then it already is. Which brings me to the next part of the review. The combat. The combat is incredibly diverse with you needing to collect charms that help you unlock upgrades to specific abilities. Theres so much creative stuff you can focus on. And the more you play the game the more your creativity can get because as you progress the more charms you can have on. Unlike the first game in the series. The sequel bring a much more diverse and fun gameplay experience. And what I really like that this game does is you needing specific upgrades to unlock different areas. But what‚Äôs even better about those upgrades is they aren‚Äôt only used to explore the giant and beautiful map. they‚Äôre also there to serve as combat abilities. Talking about the map its so big and diverse in themes. I cant go into detail to much because I want u to explore yourself but theres so many little secrets and areas to explore. But the map isn‚Äôt really that confusing at all. The enemys and abilities only help to bring more life to the surroundings. Enemys are also a really great thing in this game. While they aren‚Äôt to hard they aren‚Äôt to easy. Sure if theres one youll have no problem but if thers 3 or 4 youll have a fun challenge. And the game doesn‚Äôt overload you with these enemys. They are very balanced and don‚Äôt need some overely complicated plan to kill. Meanwhile the bosses are a real challenge but not in annoying ‚Äúmeant to be hard‚Äù kind of way. They are balanced but still extremely hard. I only really didn‚Äôt have a fun time at the 3rd boss but that was just me having ‚Äúskill issue‚Äù. And the bosses designs are so brilliant and  fit their respective areas so well. Same goes for all the little npcs around the map that gives out little side quest that aren‚Äôt hard at all. And the npcs are so lively it feels like im actually helping someone whenever I finish their quest. The same goes for all the shop keepers or other npcs that aren‚Äôt quest npcs. The achievements in this game are brutal. But that isn‚Äôt really a bad thing. The achievements in this game are very fun to complete and not something u have to do to make the story feel completed.
Talking about the story its very good. The world building it sets up for you is amazing. Although it could have been better im happy with how it is. The game doesn‚Äôt feel to fast or to slow. Sure it can take a while to beat but you‚Äôll never have a ‚ÄúOh my god when does it end‚Äù moment. You‚Äôll probably be stuck at one of the puzzles but it‚Äôll only take 10 minutes to figure out. And the way they set up the puzzles isn‚Äôt just to throw them in there. The puzzles fit so well with environment its like you have to do these things to progress and not just ‚ÄúOh this is a puzzle that I need to complete‚Äù and I think that‚Äôs so impressive.  Ori is a amazing game that takes my breath away every chance it gets. I hope to dear god you play it because it would be a shame if u missed such an amazing experience.

[b] Pros [/b]
- Great visuals all around
- Heartfelt story with impactful character animations
- Very atmospheric
- It feels as though the environment reacts to your every move
- Absolutely amazing soundtrack
- Satisfying sound effects throughout
- Fast game start-up and loading time (19 seconds total)
- No crashes and almost no bugs/glitches
- Comprehensive character stats are available, which I personally very much appreciate
- Plenty of side quests and achievements to keep you busy for awhile

[b] Cons [/b]
- Getting to some of the rare items can be frustrating at times. 
- The tutorial doesn't cover some aspects such as purple walls, but that's nothing a bit of YT can't fix. Edit: a LOT of Youtube vids, as there are plenty of ""secrets"" in the game :)
- Game was built using a proprietary game engine from a untrustworthy company. 

As an ardent open world RPG fan, I initially found it downright preposterous that I was able to enjoy a metroidvania game to such an extreme extent.

As a sequel it tries some new things but mostly sticks to what the first game implemented and improves them. 
So if you liked the first, it's the same but bigger and improved!

Graphics, music and platforming are it's strong suit.
The movement is incredibly fluid and the whole game brims with atmosphere.
While the combat is hugely improved compared to the first game it's not the games strongest suit either. 
The story is good, at least the how the whole game feels alive and vibrating with a lot of background work from visuals and such. The actual story around Ori could have been better or well more world building involving their story since it's hinted at points.   

+ Fun platforming and movement with intersting skills to traverse levels
+ Graphics, atmosphere, visual desing in genreal are amaizing 
+ Music
+ Nice power progression curve - both movement and combat

- Combat feels a bit lackluster. Bosses often have werid  and frustrating hit boxes 
- The story is a bit bare-bones and predictable, sad scenes don't hit hard because you kinda know what and how it will happen
- More world building around Ori, the spirits, the decay and the world  as a whole would be nice
- The auto save feature is a step back from 1 where you clold make you own save spots

If you like platforming, Metroidvanias and a visually very appealing game then I can recommend Ori 2 despite it's few flaws!",1660564949,1707261045,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Some boss fights, the last one _especailly_, pushes their platforming design well past what it was designed for.  Games can be hard, but killing your players with bad telegraphing, changing telegraphs mid-fight, showing a boss health bar when they can't be damaged when previously they hid it, shockingly hard hitting attacks and unavoidable environmental damage are just bad design.

Really disappointing that they got too big for their britches and pushed out this garbage.  Only buy it if you're okay with never finishing a game because the designers hate you.  They took a hard left into just grief for grief's sake, at least the original game had sympathetic enemies.  This one's enemies are bad guys who are bad because they're bad, with no redemption.

THIS DOES NOT MEAN I THINK WOTW OR DOOM ETERNAL ARE INHERENTLY BAD. THEY'RE BOTH COMPETENT GAMES BY CAPABLE DEVELOPERS AND THE FACT I HAVE TO SAY THIS IS INDICATIVE OF A LARGER PROBLEM WITH RABID FANS.

The game itself is... fine. Nothing in the game is egregious enough to have me outright say it's a 'bad game'. I didn't encounter any glaring bugs or major performance issues.

BUT, and this is two massive, jiggling, face-destroying cheeks worth of BUT... it's not a good sequel to Blind Forest. It doesn't improve on the first game, rather it wipes away most of the unique takes (i.e. movement over combat, save-anywhere, etc.) and pastes Hollow Knight on top, to... middling success.

Blind Forest was *not heavily focused on combat.* And that felt perfect! The levels play to the games strengths, and the platforming and movement ""flow"" carries the gameplay very well.
It frustrates me to no end that Moon Studios removed the unique (and *fun*) low-combat-high-movement focus in favor of a by-the-books metroidvania (read: Hollow Knight) combat system, sacrificing many opportunities for the chase sequences that made the first game truly unique, while not adding enough back in to make this another unique experience.

I understand that having animals inhabit the environment and interact with Ori makes sense, but lord it's just MORE Hollow Knight again. Map dude who sits in a specific spot then f*cks off, merchants for buying new weapons that you'll never use because there are like 15 different enemies, quests because sure, charms... Okay I admit I do like the charm system, that's neat, but it's STILL Hollow Knight.

Ori is not Hollow Knight. I don't care how good you think Hollow Knight was, it spoiled any chance Blind Forest had of getting a true sequel, as Doom Eternal did with Doom 2016.

For the obvious good parts: Visuals are great. Soundtrack is great. Chase sequences, where they still exist, are still phenomenal. The powers, new and returning (Bash, Dig, etc.), are all interesting.

But it pisses me off that they were so willing to copycat another franchise, as if there's nothing left to be explored of the previous direction.

And possibly the worst part is: they actively deny they took cues from Hollow Knight. For the love of all that is good on this godforsaken Earth, at least admit you were *inspired* by it.",1623923572,1707195977,False,22,3,0.562203288078308105,0,True,False,False

After 100%-ing (on a save, not all achievements)
the game, I have this to say.

This was an amazing game. I VERY much enjoy it and after not fully playing it in a long time,
playing it again and 100%ing this save file, was a breath of fresh air.
It was like I played it for the first time again, I forgot how much fun the game is.

Scenery & Art Style is Beautiful, Music is Beautiful, and aside from one or 2 wacky physics on things in the background, It was a very good game.

The Game itself is a Metroidvania, and a good one at that. Non Linear, so you gotta explore and see where you can and cant go to yet yourself, it never tells you specifically where you can at that time.
Abilities are all really fun, tho some are more useful then others, The quests are actually pretty good, One really sad, but y'know, Its Ori, Its gonna make you cry with the story.

I Highly Recommend if you are brand new to any of the 2 ori games, Play Blind Forest First. Things'll make Just a little more sense at the beginning.

I seriously forgot how much I love this game.

This followup to ""Ori and the Blind Forest"" is better in possibly every way and sets a gold standard for narrative platform gaming. It's got beautiful art, vibrant level design, a fully orchestral score, the works. It feels like you're playing a lost Pixar movie (including the schmaltzy story) and you're missing out on a classic if you skip this one.

Pros:
- Platforming and movement are masterclass in design. Smooth and snappy. Controls like a dream.
- Probably the best looking platformer out there. Looks incredible at 1440p and 60+ framerate.
- Some of the best character animation out there. Truly outstanding work here. 
- Movement abilities are fun and varied.
- Tons of secrets and collectibles without being overwhelming.

Cons:
- Combat is better but still not great and many combat abilities are borderline worthless. Spam X to win.
- Bosses can look great but don't offer much challenge.
- Forward path can be a little obtuse at times, backtracking can be a chore.
- Lots of particle effects and detail can obscure puzzle clues (like levers) or confuse platforming (teleporters are especially a problem).
- Story can be corny and overly predictable at times. Really sappy stuff.",1706940536,1706940536,True,2,0,0.519230782985687256,0,True,False,False

I played the first game, I loved it, but I can't do the same thing again with the same control issues that somehow feel worse then they did all those years ago. 
It's difficult to carry on with a game where the main appeal of exploring its beautiful world also subjects you to clunky and very often inconsistent controls and movement mechanics.

*Update after playing more*
Sadly the game didn't grow on me. Worse - it started to feel more and more like a chore. The plot and pacing feel very slow and drawn out in sections, it feels like the game doesn't respect your time and certain level/design decisions were made just to pad out the game duration.

Better than the original game in almost every way, improving on most of my criticisms for Blind Forest. Yet it also lost a bit of uniqueness with that.

Improvements:
- even prettier with new graphics
- environment looks more vibrant and visually simpler to distinct
- you get decent traversal much earlier and aren't put through artificial suffering
- old save system where you ""paid"" for checkpoints with energy is gone and replaced with banal set checkpoints around the levels (which is still good, old system was a pain)
- ending is much better
- bosses and combat overall are done very differently and are actually good
- escape sequences still suck, but not as much
- MKB controls are much better (except for stupid sand dash, what the heck were you thinking devs)

Mild criticisms:
- lost opportunity to make serious side-challenges for the new combat - not much use getting good at fighting honestly
- level design quality is much better overall, but seemingly went too far from ""too annoying"" to ""too simple"" - again, except for the sand area that feels like it belongs in the first game",1706807352,1706807352,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Gameplay wise, it's a much more fun and richer experience ‚Äî with a whole new set of skills and ways to unlock and enhance them, you'll feel much more powerful than what you felt in the Blind Forest.

It has a touching story, the environments and backgrounds are drop-dead gorgeous, friendly critters are cute while the enemies are menacing or grotesque, soundtrack is relaxing and it has an amazing tranquil, but slightly dark atmosphere.
Gameplay doesn't lag behind at all either. Controls are responsive and smooth. Ori is super swift and nimble, so once you acquire more abilities the movement and combat are some of the most satisfying I have experienced in a 2D game.
Level design is neat, there are a lot of nooks and crannies to explore and certain amount of back tracking necessary, but it is not too complex and areas are easily visually distinguishable. On top of that, the map is fairly helpful and you have clear goals, so navigation is fine even if you are not well versed with the genre. Each zone has its own gimmicks and the world changes as you progress through the story, so it doesn't lose momentum.
Do not be fooled by the vibrant visuals and serene atmosphere - Ori still has challenging platforming parts, intense chase sections, boss fights and spirit trials. It can be a little difficult to distinguish everything on your screen when fighting several enemies at once during the combat trials due to all the colors, effects and high speed of the game though.

For this game, arts are of equal importance as gameplay itself. It is narrated alongside evocative, euphonic soundtrack‚Äîa symphonic suite, really‚Äîand rendered in a colourful art style full of contrast and light. It combines both realism (e.g. of foliage, rocks, bark, and mushrooms) with fantastic elements, giving off the impression of an enchanted, moving canvas.

Is Ori and the Will of the Wisps challenging? It is entirely possible to play through this game leisurely and without significant challenge as there are multiple modes of difficulty to choose from. They vary in damage values and the cost of purchasable abilities. Ori and the Will of the Wisps is noticeably easier than its predecessor: self-regeneration, powerful abilities, and fewer one-shot mechanics all lessen the risk of death. On other hand, escape sequences had been replaced by boss fights, although they greatly differ in difficulty.

Many new and interesting mechanics had been added: Grapple, Launch, Water Dash, or Spirit Edge elevated combat to a faster and more fluid experience. Controls feel responsive, so moving around feels satisfying, solving puzzles and defeating enemies gratifying.

What we have here is genre-defining platformer, rightfully so. While it may have borrowed ideas from the likes of Hollow Knight, its artistic vision remains wholly unique, uncompromised; its systems sophisticated and dynamic.

that the ori series have got to be the best games i ever have or ever will play

the gameplay is made PERFECT and i never ran into a bug in either game from beginning to end
and i would put more details on the gameplay but this would be 10 minutes long then
but i will say when i played the second game i could not have been more impressed with how much was in it
the art is beautiful and really captures the magic of oris world from the light ori emits to the beauty of the fauna in the forest
and the story is absolutely amazing from the beginning of the first game to the end in the second game
it has made countless cry and really feel for ori or other characters in the game
ori isn't just a everyday game its a piece of art that deserves to be popular more than any other game ive played
sadly its not as popular as it deserves
i dont know if theres going to be a third game or not because they left the story to where its possible
but i also feel like they wanted it to be a forever cliffhanger and end the story of ori where it did leaving people with countless thoughts on what happend next
and after knowing the end replaying the game you watch the cutscenes in a totally different way thats to hard to describe

Thankfully, this game improves and fixes all my issues with the first game, with the 2 biggest improvements are the level design and the combat.

To start with the level design, the first game was fine. It was super linear and some of the levels felt frustratingly random. There is nothing wrong with linear, its just not what I expect in a metroidvania. Fortunately, this games level design is a less linear, which gave me a much greater sense of exploration. Unlike the first game, I did find my self backtracking to get to new areas using new powerups, which was nice. I also found a lot more secrets in this game, but I‚Äôm not sure if that is because there are more secrets in this one, or just that they were made easier to find. The annoying levels and areas from the first game seem to be nonexistent in this one.

The combat is the next massive improvement. The first games combat was pretty bad, spam-y, and auto targeted. There wasn‚Äôt really any skill involved and it just felt annoying. This game has a proper combat system with several attack types. It feels good and is such a big upgrade from the first game.

In addition to those changes, there are a lot of small changes that make the game feel better. The graphics are nicer, the checkpoint system is much improved, the game is longer, the game has side quests now, there are more upgrades now, abilities feel better, and probably a few more I‚Äôm forgetting.

On the downside, starting the game without most of the abilities unlocked in the first game felt a bit annoying, but it does not take too long to get many of them back. I also had some stutters in certain areas when playing on my Steam Deck, but it really was only a small handful.

Overall, Ori and the Will of the Wisps is really great.",1705961219,1705961219,True,23,2,0.663304388523101807,0,True,False,False

Moon Studios has crafted a masterpiece that not only builds upon the strengths of its predecessor but also introduces new elements that elevate the entire experience.

Visually, Ori and the Will of the Wisps is a work of art. The hand-drawn environments are stunningly detailed, creating a mesmerizing world that seamlessly blends beauty and danger. From lush forests to desolate deserts, each area feels distinct and alive. The use of lighting and particle effects enhances the atmosphere, making every frame a visual spectacle.

The narrative is equally compelling, weaving a heartfelt tale of friendship, loss, and resilience. Ori's emotional journey is complemented by a cast of endearing characters, each with their own struggles and stories. The game effortlessly tugs at the player's heartstrings, delivering poignant moments that resonate long after the credits roll.

Gameplay mechanics have seen significant improvements, offering a perfect balance of challenging platforming and satisfying combat. Ori's expanded move set feels intuitive, empowering players to navigate the world with precision and grace. The introduction of new abilities keeps the gameplay fresh and exciting, while the variety of enemies and bosses present formidable challenges that require skillful mastery.

The soundtrack, composed by Gareth Coker, is a true standout, enhancing the emotional impact of the story. The music seamlessly integrates with the gameplay, creating a harmonious experience that immerses players in the magical world of Ori. The combination of visuals, storytelling, and music forms a cohesive trifecta that elevates the game to a level of artistic brilliance.

While Ori and the Will of the Wisps is an exceptional game, it's not without a few minor flaws. Some players may encounter occasional frame rate drops or minor bugs, but these issues are overshadowed by the overall polish and excellence of the game.

In conclusion, Ori and the Will of the Wisps is a triumph in every aspect. Its captivating world, emotionally resonant story, and refined gameplay make it a must-play for fans of the genre and newcomers alike.

Frankly though I feel like the amount of hp and energy you can get is too big, it's way too easy to beat further bosses (you can just get hit and heal)(I played on normal mode)(I mean it's not like I beat them on first try but still) while in the first ones you had to learn every enemy's move. But I still enjoyed myself, it was really cool that all bosses were different but it was kind of frustrating sometimes when I lowered their hp enough to get to the their next phase just to get to know new mechanics dropped so I had to experience them a few times to finally understand it well enough to not get killed at the start of that phase. So maybe these 2 boss ""-"" multiplied by each other give a ""+""? Could be. Oh and actually it seems like that's my fav platformer now. Oh right and wasn't this game awarded for its music or smthg? It kind of surprises me, I love the music, true, but I barely noticed it bc of the animations and mechanics outshining it, sorry, I'll probably come to appretiate it more after listening to it on spotify by focusing just on it.",1705755855,1705755855,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Got me to play different Platformers and Metroidvania

=====================================================

Idk i feel lazy to leave reviews here on Steam, but this game is by far my most favorite, been playing it on and off this whole year, I purchased it around 2019 along with blind forest before the pandemic and i couldn't play it after that cause i was playing on a ""Computer shop""

finally got to play it on my brothers Laptop and got to continue where i left off during after i met Kwolok, this game was so Beautiful engaging, the Gameplay, the music, the scenery the art, EVERYTHING, I always wanted to play ""Ori"" after i watched the full Playthrough on Jackcepticeye's Channel back in 2015 or 2016, i was quite obsessed at Ori's Design at the time, needlesly to say i still Am and it reminded me of that when I did got to play the game for real this time around the beginning 2023 and finished ""Blind Forest"" right after, kinda of a weird thing to play the sequel 1st before the Original but i dont really care, it didnt matter much.

I play on and off especially now that i'm working and i still can't put this game down, i play it while im playing a different game, i move on a different game while i still regularly play this along with it, it has become a ""Comfort Game"" At this point and kind of an Obsession really.

Was part of Hollow Knight's community at the time (still am) but i do feel a very bad taste when people compare this to Hollow Knight and with obvious complete bias whenever they do, i will admit i might be be bias as well, but i don't really see this close to being Hollow Knight just for it to be compared to it. What Saddens me is the community for Ori's Franchise is a lot smaller, the game is quite big in the gaming community but it still feels very ""Underrated"" in my Opinion. (Hot take: this game has better combat but lacks Enemy variety, Bosses and encounters IF they also focused on combat and with the amazing platforming of this game, it would have been amazing)

also this is the 1st game on steam That i got to 100%, i usually dont do that, but thats what happens if you wanna keep playing something you Absolutely love, it was suppose to be Terraria but i couldn't play it at the time, moved to mobile and now theres more Achievements added on top before i got to finishing it on PC.

i guess this game introduced me ""Back"" to playing Metroidvania, got to play HK on Xbox on august to finished it and purchased it on Steam around November and finished it, might 100% it... maybe",1705630375,1705630375,True,3,0,0.525547444820404053,0,True,False,False

I fully support the route they took, which is basically more of the same, with some slight tweaks, and combat completely overhauled.

Ori2 is still a metroidvania.  The graphics are still amazing.  The animation is still incredibly fluid, and controlling Ori still feels great.  The new combat is fantastic, it really adds another layer to the game.  

Ori 2 was always going to have a tough time following up the original, in terms of plot and feels.  The first one is just so... tight.  Ori 2 begins right where the previous game left off.  Events take you to a new place, and you have a new adventure.  Ori is still a heartfelt, wonderful journey, but it has trouble reaching the high highs of the original.  Additionally, sometimes while you are playing, it feels like you are re-living the first Ori games greatest hits, rather than playing something new.  

Any complaints I have are merely nitpicking.  Ori and the Will of the Wisps is a fantastic game and a worthy heir to the original.   Once again I was totally blown away by the work of Moon Studios.

It's because there's just so much added to the gameplay from the first game that I can't even make it through the Will-O-Wisps without a trainer.  The first game was more straight-forward of a platformer,  with an amazing story, music and graphics.  The sequel went a bit too 'Hollow Knight' with the gameplay additions:  too many weapon choices, upgrade choices, side questing and character interactions.   

Now, I do still love the updated graphics, the newish story (another dark owl rejection line I suppose) and some of the gameplay additions, but not enough that I want to attempt to play this game ever again.  

I will still play the original from time to time though.   Ahh well.",1705221824,1705221824,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Cons
- frustrating if you don't know where to find something needed to progress. This happened more than once. It was needless and annoying. I resorted to a guide three or four times, which I really don't like to do. But I don't like wasting my time searching for needles in haystacks, either. 
- often challenging in the wrong way. You know what to do (a certain series of jumps, say, or projectile re-directions), but actually doing it is really grindy and time-consuming and not at all fun. In the end, this happened one time too many. I quit the game and uninstalled it there and then. Shame, because it ultimately is a good game.

Ori's second outing borrows a lot from other Metroidvanias of recent years to improve upon the original. In particular Ori 2 adds skills, similar to Hollow Knight's charm system, where you can pick and choose certain bonuses, abilities, and/or buffs to Ori. The combat has had a complete rework compared to the previous entry. You know wield a melee weapon, that coupled with positioning and direction inputs makes for more engaging combat encounters.  

Just like the original, the highlight of the game is the visual and audio art. The game's look is a major improvement over it's predecessor, mostly due to it's better lighting. An issue I had with the original was how some foreground and background elements blended in too much. That is not an issue in this entry; As part of the combat overhaul, it looks like there was extra care to make sure enemies and their actions can be recognized easier. 

Ori tells a great story in the new land of Niwen. This time around there are more NPCs to interact with throughout your journey, even going the route of having a ""home-base"" in the middle of the map. This entry is somehow even more emotional than the first and is masterful in the way it tells it's story through set-piece and quiet moments alike. 

Ori 2 stumbles in some of the same areas as the original. The map design feels very similar, possibly with even more hand holding than before. Another complaint is that the power-ups don't feel as impactful as before. New abilities either supersede previous ones or are more one-off, only used in specific environments. I would have liked to see more varied abilities.

Overall, great game. One of the most artistic platformers I've played.",1704845699,1704845699,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Lore/Storytelling: Similar thing in this game compared to the Blind Forest in that the lore is simple and easy to understand, but quite compelling in a sense. Although I would have liked it more if the lore had some more depth (i.e. backstories for individuals for instance, or more history about the past in general). Other than that, the lore is understandable and nice! 7.5/10

Art/Design: No complains here once again! The game retains the same compelling art and design features as the Blind Forest, however it steps it up a notch. Everything is bright and decently colorful, while remaining easy to tell things apart (Foreground vs Background). I would say that the game's main feature is in the design of the game itself, which is why I would rank it a 10/10.

Gameplay: For starters, the game-play has seen improvement from the Blind Forest, however not everything has been fixed. Highlighting some things that have changed: Improved wall climbing physics, improved clarity, added difficulty (Bosses included, still kinda janky), Longer play through length (>10h), Overall better mechanics and ability system. Talking about the bad things, I did not enjoy the system of charms and hearts/energy. The charms seemed very weird and does not allow for any real combinations or big improvements (i.e. Hollow Knight does this VERY WELL). Moreover, the system for energy and life cells seemed a little too easy for me. For instance, by the time I made it to the end of the game (which includes a fun boss fight!), I could easily tank everything in my path without any worry. TLDR: Gameplay needs to be harder and more sophisticated, however it is still a big improvement from the Blind Forest. This results in an overall 7/10

Final ranking is a 8/10, would recommend.

It's definitely much better than the Blind Forest...in almost every single way. The combat feels way more satisfying and controlled, and I love how you get more weapons and attacks as the game progresses. Also, the exploration is a huge step up from the original game, where the endlessly annoying Sein is always telling you where to go--meaning you don't really get a chance to explore at all. But now the map is bigger, and fortunately Sein doesn't exist to show you the way you're supposed to go. Another amazing change in the sequel is the addition of boss fights, which just didn't exit in Ori and the Blind Forest. The art and music was never a problem in the franchise, but I'm glad to see they're keeping the beautiful and stunning art style.

Overall, I give Will of the Wisps a 10/10. I'll even say it could be on par with the masterpiece that is Hollow Knight.
It's not that I hate Ori and the Blind Forest, it's just that it was a little too linear and the combat was mid in my opinion. (I would give that game a 7/10 or an 8/10.)

I personally think this game is 10x better than blind forest.

Pros:
- great level design and great movement abilities. 
- incredibly satisfying fluid movement for both the combat and especially the platforming.
- Music and visuals is GODLIKE. Absolutely beautiful. Music is used perfectly. Every area for me is memorable, and I don't think I ever thought of disliking one.
- Story is simple, but nice. No in-depth lore that is hidden away like in soulslikes. The story is given to you right away. The story is nice and simple, easy to understand, and incredibly satisfying all the way through.
- Sidequests aren't hard or require unecessary reused backtracking.
- Map is well-designed and it's very hard to get lost.
- Character designs are on point and memorable. The world is MUCH more lively than the forest of Nibel.

Opinions / Cons:

I don't have many bad things to say about this game. It was delightful all the way through.

- Game is quite short (around 11 hours). I did every sidequest, collected all spirit shards, abilities, health and energy upgrades on hard mode without online guides. However, dong a platinum might take some significant effort due to the achievements wanting handicaps. I personally think it's harder to platinum ori than elden ring or hollow knight. The length of this game isn't a con, I actually like that they didn't do unnecessary padding.
- Combat feels underutilized. There are very few bosses and enemy types for the amount of abilities ori has. The few combat encounters the game does have are incredibly satisfying. The combat still adds a lot of depth to game though.
- Collecting the spirit lights around the map are a hassle (only for competitionists)
- There are some parts of the game where the UI will bug out. I collected an Ore and died after, but my UI still said I had it. When I restarted the game, then it told me the missing ore locations.

However, this one also achieves to be a good metroidvania unlike the previous game in which there was a great lack of abilities and a very limited world with not much to do. This game on the other hand, solves all the problems the previous game had as a metroidvania. It has a big map to explore, has a great number of abilities to play around with, and of course it also has a good combat system with enough depth to satisfy most players unlike the previous game in which all you could do was to left click as fast as you can.

The game is an absolute masterpiece from start to finish. Boss fights are fresh and exciting, with the right amount of challenging. Each environment is realized in extensive, gorgeous detail. The soundtrack, as ever, you'll find staying with you after every play session: its exciting and epic when it needs to be, and delivers the right amount of kicks to the heart too. Gameplay is fluid, responsive and fun. Whenever the game feels like its about to get stale, it throws new challenges at you. The game never lets you settle: it's constantly throwing new mechanics at the player. 

Combat is a step up from Blind Forest, which is a running theme with Will of the Wisps: this game 100% earns its title as a sequel. Whenever somebody asks me what I think a ""true sequel"" looks like, I will point to Will of the Wisps. Moon Studios have gone hog-wild in this sequel to Blind Forest, taking everything a step up, including even the story. Much like Blind Forest, the story is heartfelt, tragic, beautiful, and most of all, bittersweet. I won't spoil the ending, but I will say this about it: I, as a person, am not easily moved to outward displays of emotion when I play my games. Only a few games that I've played can I boast have actually made me tear up a bit, or take a second to contemplate what I just watched.

Will of the Wisps is now on that list.

What else do you want me to say? If you're reading this review, having the slightest bit of hesitation: don't. Buy this game now. Right now its a whopping $13.18, which imo is a bloody steal. Stop hesitating, get this game and play it. It's an adventure from start to finish, and imo it is Moon Studios' magnum opus.

The levels are brilliantly designed, the controls are excellents and the lenght is the right for a game of this style. In adition, has a challenging gameplay, with a great stand of difficulty, but not unfair.

The artwork is amazing. There are many scenarios, all very different from each other, with a very nice artistic design and a very varied color palette. On the other hand, the soundtrack is one of the best OST I've ever heard in my life.

In brief, Ori and the Will of the Wisps is simply one of the best 2D Platformer/Metroidvania of all time.

Very very recommended.

I'm mostly talking about the story though. I doubt there's many gamers out there who could skip on this story. It was sad, deep and happy at the same time. If I said Blind Forest had a great story then Will of the Wisps is beyond this world.
I was however a bit annoyed by some of the bugs in the game - note this comes from the high expectations I had before the release.
Also a few features seemed like they were taken from Hollow Knight, like the map building, save feature, etc.. but the boss fights were pretty amazing compared to escapes from Blind Forest - although I did not welcome that feature at all at first.

[list]
[*] The spider boss is almost undefeatable without a very specific, nearly useless powerup which you don't even need to reach said boss and at no point does the game tell you about all that.
[*] There are numerous, luckily short passages where the game revokes your control over Ori or forces you to do something. I understand why this happens and it does add to immersion, but I really dislike not having full control over my character at all times.

Ori has become that game for me that I now compare all other games to. I've played it all the way through at least twice at this point and I can easily see myself  playing it through every other year or so. It's just a spectacular game and I'll outline my reasons for saying so below. As of this review I have logged just under 50  hours into Will of the Wisps (about 90 combined with game 1 and 2), have of course played the first one one (Also, you can play Will of the Wisps without playing The Blind Forest and not be confused, although of course I recommend doing both because they're so good) and for reference I play on PC and enjoy other games such as Terraria, Hollow Knight (although I never finished that), Spyro, Gris, and Kena Bridge of Spirits. 

1) Game-play is fantastic. And I mean this in every sense. No where is the game clunky, glitchy, or buggy (at least not in my experience). Movement and platforming are extremely smooth and not frustrating (when it was frustrating it was only a skill issue not a game issue). You progressively learn more skills that you can mix and match to fit your play-style and different combat situations (I love how they changed the abilities from game one). Combat itself is challenging (and the bosses in Will of the Wisps are admittedly harder) but if you've been playing the way the game teaches you to play and use  your abilities appropriately it's not overly challenging (punishing combat is why I didn't finish Hollow Knight for reference). 

2) Puzzles are just challenging enough and very rewarding. I love puzzles-platformers/games, I love finding secret collectibles and generally enjoy games where the main character is trying to make the world better or fix it from evil. Like the combat, the puzzles can be challenging however if you are learning the skills the game is trying to teach you usually they are self-explanatory and I don't recall having to watch many walkthroughs to figure things out (plus that takes the fun out of it). The Puzzles themselves are training for whatever combat you may need in that level or beyond and I think they do a fantastic job at preparing you for that. As opposed to The Blind Forest, Will of the Wisps has so many more side quests which are completely optional but oh so fun and I've done all of them. It adds so much replay-ability and diversity to an already long game with huge map which means you get to play more Ori. 

3) Like most - if not all - other reviews rave about, the atmosphere is incredible, just as good if not better than Blind Forest and still somehow original even though unique. Again, I mean this in every sense. The emotional story-telling is on point (the ending to this game makes my cry so so much in a great way). The level/map design is superb with every area so distinct and unique, even from Blind Forest. And THE MUSIC. The music is absolutely incredible of course, and it also is unique per section of map which I love it's not just the same music the whole game. The game is so beautiful to look at and play, it's actually not annoying to run around at the end collecting everything and finding hidden places because it's just so pretty (yes, I'm a bit of a completionist and so I had to get that achievementüòÇ). 

I literally could go on and on, but if you're still reading this and haven't purchased/played the game(s) what are you still doing here?

- Boss fights feel out of place

Ori and will of the wisps is a sequel that fixed the mistakes of the first game. It is smooth to control Ori and to the precise jumps it needs. Additions of the shards can make certain platforming sections easier such as glue, or make combat easier for you. You have variety of weapons you can choose from, such as a bow, hammer or a sword.

Oh yeah. They finally added close combat so if a creature is about to it you, you can hit it back instead. 

The progression felt natural and wonderful. The abilities were enhancing your movement abilities, but the level design is done in a way that lack of them does not hinder your ability to move and control Ori at all. What I also love is the addition of double jump right from the get go.

Collectables are mostly optional but it is fun and rewarding to collect them. The health and energy cells surely helps traversing through and other things such as the ore has cute things connected to it such as building your base to look better and better not only giving you the looks but also the possibility to move easily around.

Instead of leveling system they have chosen to do currecy system which I like more as it gives you the flexibility to buy items you want without needing to get unecessary things before. If there is some limitation it is linked to story progression (The monk won't give you unlimited breathing under the water without you unlocking the possibility to swim first) or to the items (You cannot buy upgrades of the weapons or the tools to it before you get the item.) 

You won't have as much troubles collecting the needed currency as there are many things you can do. Sidequests, races, arena's that you can find all over the map without being forced upon you.

And this game finally switched from having to manually save the game to actual autosaves. It might seem like sure thing, but if you have played the first game you would know the terrors of what manual saving was. It was replaced by healing ability which is more favorable for harder platforming sections

My negative that I can see is the fact, that the game tries to have bossfights where it doesn't need to. The wonderful artstyle and soundtrack could carry the game well to just the discovery and chase scenes that the first game had with the better adjusments to it, but instead they are doing bossfights which seem bit out of place and wonky for this game, that is though small low for the ammount that they made better.

- Very satisfying platforming mechanics
- Compared to the first game the combat is way better it's probably the best change they made to the game (there are many new abilites that are used for fighting and it's more skill based. In the first one you had only two types of attacks and both didn't require aiming)
- What's also new are quests and shops where you can buy and upgrade charms (the mechanic is very similar to ""hollow knight"")
- Graphically the game looks amazing 
- The soundtrack is great and complements the environments
- The story was good and enjoyable
- I played casually through the game and 100% my save file in 13 hours (there are still some achivements I could do but they require to complete the game from start again without dying once / under 4 hours so if you want to challenge yourself you can try to do it)

From the moment the game begins, you're immersed in a world so beautifully crafted it feels like stepping into a living painting. The environmental design is nothing short of breathtaking. Every frame of this game could be a work of art, showcasing a mastery of color, lighting, and atmosphere that is a testament to the talent of the game's creators.

The animation is fluid and expressive, breathing life into every character and creature you encounter. As someone who breathes and lives 3D animation, I can't help but admire the attention to detail and the seamless integration of animation with gameplay, making Ori's journey feel both epic and deeply personal.

The storytelling is equally impressive. It's a heartfelt tale that tugs at your emotions, taking you on a rollercoaster of joy, sorrow, and triumph. The narrative is woven seamlessly with the gameplay, ensuring that every leap and every challenge feels meaningful in Ori's journey.

In addition to the stunning visuals and compelling story, the soundtrack deserves a special mention. It complements every moment of the game perfectly, enhancing the emotional depth and the overall experience.

""Ori and the Will of the Wisps"" is more than just a game; it's a testament to the power of video games as an art form. It's a masterpiece that resonates with my journey from a solitary child to a cherished community leader, much like Ori's own journey in the game.

- More difficult platforming in some spots

Ambivalent:

The art is utterly gorgeous, the story is beautiful and heartfelt, and the gameplay and combat design are extraordinarily fun. Especially compared to its predecessor, the combat and movement feels incredibly fluid and comfortable, allowing a wide range of playstyles and making boss fights never feel unbeatable, even in hard mode. My favorite aspect of the game is how well it builds and portrays its world and atmosphere - by the end of the game, I felt truly invested in the world, its inhabitants, and the story and history of the forest. Like Hollow Knight, another of my favorite metroidvanias, the world just feels so real, so alive. And I almost forgot to mention - the music (oh my god the music) is PHENOMENAL. Some of the best and most ingeniously utilized music you'll ever find in a game, without a doubt. WotW is most definitely worth the purchase, but I do recommend you play the first game (Ori and the Blind Forest) first!

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and we adopted our son together. Both are now 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I felt lost and unhappy. I was self-destructive. One day, I was so angry with everything spiraling out of control that I punched a concrete wall in a moment of overwhelming emotion. This resulted in breaking my fifth metacarpal in my right hand‚Äîthe hand I worked with, played games with, and used to carry my children to bed‚Äîthe hand I desperately needed to ensure I could continue providing.

Upon learning the severity of the self-inflicted damage, I became almost suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man, with no history of depression or anxiety. I had never experienced anger outbursts, nor was I the type to break down and cry, but I was in a tough situation that truly prevented me from seeing the light on the other side.

With nothing better to do, I looked for a game I could play WITH ONE HAND while recovering. Somehow, I stumbled upon this game and read some of the comments. I decided it was worth a try... I must admit I didn't beat the game, nor did I play as much as some of you. In fact, I may have played this game for only a day or two. That being said, after doing so, I had a new joy and hope for life. I managed to leave behind the pain and suffering that had been thrust upon me. I could experience the joy and happiness of other people. I relaxed for 5 ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• minutes listening to this music, long enough to realize that I would be okay.

After realizing this, I turned off the game and went back to work. My hand hurt a lot, but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so sorry for myself and became the father I needed to be at that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving like.

Today, I am close friends with the mother of my children. We don't fight, argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents and friends.

Now I have 3 children. My third child is, wait, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my separation, and we just unexpectedly stumbled into each other's lives. We have been dating for a year and are very happy together.

Moral of the story: you never know what life has in store for you, and if I had given up when all odds were against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

The art for both games are phenomenal. 

Regarding the 2nd game, it builds up on the legacy of the first and ramps it up to 100. The levels are very well designed and exploration. This game is very fun. The site are hilarious and as usual the platforming is challenging . The first 10 hours of the game was tough for me but once I got the launch projectile skill, the platforming became trivial.

Teaboy's Basic(ish) Reviews....I read a lot of reviews when looking at games on Steam, and it quickly gets tiring ‚Äì those who write involved, down to the micron scale reviews, although helpful, end up like looking at War & Peace when you‚Äôve only got time for a quick 5 minute dump! This is middle of the road and to the point ‚Äì not easy for me as I tend towards sesquipedalian loquaciousness! Vociferously Verbose? Alright, verbal diarrhoea. (Although I hate panning a developer‚Äôs work and all the time, effort and love they put into designing these ‚Äì it is their life after all ‚Äì this is my honest, personal opinion of my level of enjoyment. Sorry devs!).

A note on time played: My Steam clock does not seem to work properly, indeed, it even minuses time on occasion! Plus, I have a tendency to wander off and leave games running at times, so time played may not be entirely accurate!


Teaboy‚Äôs Tonsil Titillators or Toenail Titbits! (Rating)

Tonsil Tickler (Totally Tops): The frenchy of which you always dreamt! To quote a master, ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs got a tongue like an electric eel and she likes the taste of a Man‚Äôs tonsils!‚Äù. An absolute masterpiece and joy to play.

The Tits (Terrific): Everyone loves playing with these! Not THE best bit, but such fun on their own you can be lost for hours....mmmm. What most games you really like score ‚Äì perfection is so rare after all.

Torso Teaser (Taker of your Time): It‚Äôs a flat stomach....sure it‚Äôs nice to look at, run your fingers over, slobber on a bit, sometimes that bellybutton gets your motor running....but it's just basically the corridor between the two ‚Äògaming rooms‚Äô. The definitive ‚ÄòMeh‚Äô - the middle ‚Äòsideways thumb‚Äô option for which everyone on Steam cries.

Todger/Tadger & (scroTum) Taters (Tedious): Is it an ‚Äòa‚Äô or is it an ‚Äòo‚Äô? Who cares! The meat can be fun to play with for about 5 minutes of your entire day, the rest it just hangs there and generally gets in the way of doing something else. The main problem of course, is the two veg sticking to your inside thigh. This is what this game feels like ‚Äì the occasional/rare bouts of fun, the rest bobbing like a 19th century British Policeman (now you know why!).

Toenail Tornado (Total Toss): A playthrough so appalling it‚Äôs like being trapped in a Turkish sauna with the ugliest, hairiest, fattest, sweatiest beast of a neolithic hominid who‚Äôs trimming his toenails using pliers and the splinters are reminiscent of a scene from the Normandy Landings. My god how did this get released!?


Teaboy Touts (Score): TONSIL TICKLER!!!!!!!!!!!!


The Review:

This is for both Ori And The Blind Forest & Ori And The WIll Of The Wisps (they are effectively the same game).

I think this is my Favourite Game Of All Time - hence the dozen exclamation marks above (my fave number)! When I played the 2nd one, I preferred the 1st, and I Still LOVED IT!

This is an action platformer that is more platformer than combat but plenty of both - unlike things like Blasphemous which to me is just hack n slash. This one requires learning and skill with a bit of timing to boot. Both games have the same controls and movements and map type and controls. The differences are obviously a different map (same layout format) and a change in the skill progression. In the 2nd game you purchase upgrades from a couple of creatures and you have to juggle abilities by selecting appropriate ones as you go through the game (there are many more than 1st game). I'm not much of a fan of this, after playing Baldur's Gate on the Playstation 2 with my brother (we always pronounced it Bal Jers - sounds so much more fantastical than the Boulders they pronounce it in game!) so many times as we Loved it, then the sequel introduced crafting and we spent So Much Time in the selection screens reading n swapping n forging....it totally destroyed the flow of the game. Luckily, Ori is not like that, it's much more basic/easy, but due to my personal experience I don't like the interruption. But for others it adds choice. It also is necessary for progression on a few occasions.

Other than that, both games are pretty much a continuation of each other. Playstyle is identical, which is the Perfect decision by the devs because the first game was Excellent. Don't fix it if it ain't broke! You increase a dual power bar as you level up, allowing more/stronger abilities. The abilities you get are great fun and vital at the same time - they get assigned to buttons of your choice as you unlock them.

A lesson to newbies I learnt the hard way - if you can't do something/get somewhere, it is because you yet lack the ability! I tried for ages to get places until I finally learnt that I had to go somewhere else and earn an ability! So if stuck, go to another area of the map you've yet to do. Trust me, you'll find a new way to jump or whatever and then you go, ""Ahhhhhh!
NOW I can go to that other place."" In the 2nd game I deliberately upgraded one skill tree to get a particular ability I knew from the 1st game makes it so much easier, however, I could not get it after getting all the upgrades it required....it was the same old story as above - some abilities are earnt through in-game progression, you have to open a part of the map/do something/complete some quest AND upgrade! Take note!

Movement speed is super important in platformers as many games are so sloooow.  This game is, yet again, perfect!  You move quickly, and the abilities can boost that significantly.  This is important as the map is large and there are, in my opinion, too few jumpgates.  Still, going back and forth is a lot more acceptable than most games that force you to backtrack.  The hardest part of this game is finding all the hidden items which will be the greatest reason for backtracking.  There is sadly a single glitch in the 2nd game whereby about half of players, myself included, could not 100% the game as one 'complete the set' never goes above 97% (one gem short kind of thing even though you've found them all).  

The action AND platforming can be frenetic at times, which is actually massive fun. Boss battles can be a bit annoying - like a side-scroller where you have to learn the right way by dying constantly and repeating. This the ONLY flaw in this otherwise perfect game in two parts!

And the music....the opening title screen tune....It is heartbreaking that it is so short - it's one of the most brilliant little tunes I've ever heard. Pure joyous magic.

Sadly, it seems from the ending that they will not be making another. I'd buy it without a second thought if they did.

The meticulously crafted environments, characterized by vibrant colors and intricate details, elevate the game to a visual masterpiece. Each frame is a work of art, bringing the mystical world of Ori to life with a sense of wonder and magic. The level design is equally commendable, seamlessly blending beauty with functionality to deliver a platforming experience that is as challenging as it is visually captivating.

The emotional depth embedded in the narrative adds another layer of richness to the game. The poignant story of Ori's journey, filled with moments of sorrow, hope, and friendship, resonates long after the credits roll. The nuanced character development and the connection forged with the spirit companions, the Wisps, evoke a genuine emotional investment from the player.

A standout aspect of Ori and the Will of the Wisps is its evocative musical score. Composed by Gareth Coker, the soundtrack complements the game's emotional beats and atmospheric nuances flawlessly. The music serves as a guiding force, intensifying the impact of key moments and creating a deeply immersive experience. The synergy between visuals, narrative, and music is a testament to the meticulous craftsmanship behind the game.

The challenging platforming elements, coupled with demanding boss battles, contribute to the game's overall excellence. The decision not to grind for skill upgrades adds an extra layer of difficulty, enhancing the sense of accomplishment when overcoming obstacles and defeating formidable foes. The finely tuned balance between difficulty and reward keeps players engaged and invested in Ori's journey.

While some may find the game's level of difficulty daunting, it ultimately adds to the sense of achievement when conquering each section. The commitment to a challenging platforming experience sets ""Ori and the Will of the Wisps"" apart in a genre that often relies on nostalgia rather than innovation.

In conclusion, Ori and the Will of the Wisps stands as a testament to the potential of 2D platformers in the modern gaming landscape. With its mesmerizing art, emotionally charged narrative, and challenging gameplay, Moon Studios has created a masterpiece that transcends the boundaries of the genre. It's not just a game; it's an emotional journey that captivates players from start to finish, solidifying its place as one of the finest examples of gaming artistry in recent years.",1701250938,1701250938,True,25,1,0.713681697845458984,0,True,False,False

I finished this game for 2 days, with a total 12 hours on my first run save file and it's kinda fast for a first time. FYI, i finished my first run with a total completion 64%.

Yet, it really shines with its flawless gameplay that constantly evolves with new abilities and its fantastic level design that offers a lot exploration capabilities and some breathtaking platforming sequences. Precise control mechanics and fluid animations offer an amazingly pleasant experience that you won't find elsewhere. Miraculously the ""more is more"" logic of the developers crated a game with coherence and made it feel always interesting and rewarding.


Manometer: 9/10[/b]


The good
 - Gorgeous visuals. A majestic world with amazing colors, atmospheric lighting, faire tale vibes and various different places to explore. Although its atmosphere is eerie and magical, it has some dark parts and manages to immerse you right from the beginning.
 - Awesome gameplay. It's easily one of the most pleasant and fluid platformers ever made. Ori's movements are so smooth, transitions are seamless and its skillset always evolves so it never get monotonous. There is a big variation of upgrades, abilities and weapons that you can find or purchase and transform the whole experience. There are plenty of clever ideas and it's great to watch Ori's evolution from the initial just ""run and jump"" guy.
 - Precise, effective control mechanics Everything works flawlessly and it's awesome how cleverly they managed to fit all these abilities and combos in simple button combinations. Players get used of every new move quickly and can feel every movement in their fingertips.
 - Amazing exploration feeling. It's remarkable how the world opens gradually and how it lets you organically discover all these scattered hidden secrets, shards, orbs, other characters, vendors. It's nice that it gives you a lot of clues on the map so you don't just search entirely by luck. You take the clues and try to find the hidden path or a clever way to reach certain things.
 - Fantastic, smooth animations. Except of Ori's amazing movement set, everything inside its world feels alive. Plants, branches or water are not just static background elements and make it even more immersive.
 - Great level design to support some breathtaking platforming sequences that require continuous movement and good timing. Each level adds new elements and mechanics so each time your approach is different.
 - Battles are nice and pretty pleasant. It's not packed of enemies everywhere but there are some sessions of cool battles. There is a pretty good variation of well designed enemies with a variety of abilities and attacks.
 - Cool, epic story with some nice emotional moments. World's lore and all the pieces of information and backstories that you learn gradually make it even more interesting.
 - It has some nice side missions and a set of unique NPCs. Characters are well designed and there are a lot more than its predecessor, forming small communities and making the world feel more inhabited.
 - There are some parts with great cinematic sequences or chases with timed events and epic things happening at the background while you're running. Cut scenes are well made and atmospheric too.
 - It has some challenging small trials scattered in the world. They're speed trials or battles with waves that can give you some nice rewards.
 - Amazing calm music to accompany you through your exploration. It never gets tiring and during battles it raises the tempo to fit the action.
 - Simple yet nice audio design. Environmental sounds are good. Sounds of movement, slashes, explosions and more give you great feedback.
 - It doesn't want to mess with your nerves so it offers constant checkpoints and doesn't punish you with losing things when dying. Yet, some may find it too forgiving.

The bad
- After its middle point, at least in normal level of difficulty, when you start to have a lot of life and energy cells it loses its balance and gets rapidly easier and easier. Mobs, projectiles, nails, lasers don't feel dangerous anymore so you don't worry much if you get hit a few times. This affect massively the way you approach it and make you less careful. Also there are two or three ability shards that are clearly overpowered and simplify the game to a point that almost ruin it.
- Bosses are well designed visually and offer some cool cinematic sequences, but they're only few of them and their mechanics don't look very imaginative or refreshing. It's ok though. The game is more of a platformer than a souls like.",1700928159,1700928159,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Now that i have a 100% savegame, here are my Opinions on the game: 

+ The Story is nice 
+ The Artstyle, i personally love the depth in the Backrounds and the Whole theme of certain Areas. 
+ The Soundtrack is a easy 10/10
+ Controlls felt easy for me (played with a controller) and the gameplay was as fluid as it could get
+ Its not short, i have spend about 16 Hours (normal difficulty), but it could take you more or less,  
depending on your type of gameplay and the difficulty you play on
+ The Bosses are a welcome new mechanic, which is implementet well. 
+ Archivements, gives some who are into it some things to do and archive, even after you have played through

- There are a number of bugs atm, that could have been fixed while you are reading this, but here are the 2 discovered and impacted my gameplay:
    -> Clipping into walls with [spoiler] the bash and the water dash [/spoiler]
    -> While [spoiler] bashing off enemy projectiles [/spoiler] ,  ori sometimes gets catapulted across the screen way to strong, amost looks like an instant teleport.
- If you are fighting larger number of enemies, it can get messy and you might loose track of the fight (to many particles and effects imo)

The Game improves in most, if not all aspects of its predecessor and is a really Charming Game. I can just reccomend this game to every fan of Metroidvanias.

[i]Honestly its one of those rare moments when alrdy amazing game becomes even better. 
For me [b]""Ori and the Blind Forest""[/b] been one of best examples how to create something more than just good platformer. It had smooth and responsive movement, visuals that can easly be used as your wallpaper, music which can hold you in main menu for some time after launching the game, and of course the story while being simplistic leaves memorable expirience.

After listing all above you would think ""It cant get that much better"" but it does. One of first big improvements might be new combat system, it allows you to fight your enemies with huge arsenal of weapons and skills without touching ground and flying all over your screen dodging projectiles and boss attacks. Yes [b]""Boss fights""[/b] another thing that been added to the game and when you learn their patern those encounters becomes more enjoyable than FromSoftware games, cause you not limited to dodge and attack buttons and able to use your own flow of fight. 
Then there is optional collectables\upgrades that can improve Ori in different ways it can be slight buff or change to ability mechanic, maybe utility stuff like enemies provide more exp but reciving extra health and damage and so on.[/i] 

Now to smaller additions:
[u]Even more new movement abilities[/u]
[u]NPC and Quests[/u]
[u]Non-linear order for locations[/u]
[u]And of course onion ninjas included[/u]

Also, I especially love the fact that, rather than just restoring the land in the previous game, you also restore the life it once held.

All the great things from its predecessor return, but better in all aspects, plus epic boss fights that will give a great challenge to players. This is a wonderful example of a sequel that, without exaggeration, improves upon its predecessor in every way. The controls are tighter, the worlds are more fun than ever to navigate, and the worlds are more vivid than ever. Will of the Wisps is, for sure, one of the best Metroidvania and 2D platformers ever made.

It is also clear that much more time was put into the story of the game, which has a certain knack for tugging on the heart strings more than once, though the gameplay is more than enough to justify playing this game if you don't care about the story as much. Right now, there are some technical and performance issues that may disturb the experience but are fixable over time, which I really don't bother with and deny my not giving it 5 stars. It's a must-play. And believe me, tears will be shed. Kudos to Moon Studios for showing us all over again how to blur the line between a simple ""game"" and ""art"".",1693489936,1700672046,True,2,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False

By all means, I am far from a game connoisseur, but there are so many qualities about this game that could easily bring it up to #1 spot on my list of platformers:
- The magical and fantastical aesthetic of the game is consistent throughout with it's high quality backgrounds, VFX and characters
- The fluidity of movement and combat gives players an easy and free way to travel from point to point (by far my favourite feature)
- The progression and new abilities only build on the combat and movement, making unlocking new areas even more exciting
- It's pretty much an open world platformer, with lots of hidden secrets, side quests and freedom, allowing for progression to be made at your own pace
- Puzzles/races as well as fighting, which gives it more variety and adds on to what more you can do after completing the game
- Plenty of useful upgrades for all sorts of abilities and passives

My two points of criticism would be: 
1) How repetitive the story can be sometimes, with it's dragging loop of similar boss fights/chase scenes in each different area or losing Kuro and having to reunite later on once again. However, the game itself can be fairly short and is not too heavy on story so it doesn't really hold too much against the overall experience. 
2) How unguided, obscure and ambiguous quests are, especially at the beginning. I must say, there were times I did have to google parts as there was no explanation behind most things. Who knows, maybe I'm just a bit dim.

Overall, great game if you're as into fluid combat/movement, nice animation, aesthetics  and soundtrack as I am. For how short the game can be, the extra plot and repetitive bosses wasn't a huge deal breaker for me, especially since I completed it within 2 weeks with a 19 hour overall play time.",1682809420,1700670512,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Many times in game trailers we are promised a flow of action, but more times than not those promises are just lies, but not in the case of this game.
The mechanics are introduced in a well paced manner and they can all be mastered easily, allowing for the solutions to the various puzzles to be almost second nature after a while.
Same goes for how immediate one takes action during the majestic escape sequences.

And, by the way, I play with keyboard and mouse, no controller, which could be surprising for many.

All save points are placed in a non-frustrating distance from each other.

The graphics and the sound design, including the made up language, are just perfect, coherent and wonderful to experience.

I will keep this one short by saying that the only improvements over Ori 1 are things quite literally stolen from games like Hollow Knight.

Otherwise developers have not learned anything from Ori 1.

Trial and error chase sequences? Yup.

Everything is lava endgame? Yup.

Terrible moon logic puzzles? Yup.

Unfulfilling exploration? Yup.

Final boss that completely disregards all of your upgrades, all of your effort of playing a metroidvania, cause your healthbar might as well not exist in it? Yup.

Basically everything I said about Ori 1 in the past is still true here except its so much worse cause the developers had time to learn from their mistakes and they did not.

That makes all of their mistakes just so much more.

This is also a proof that good graphics and music do not make a good game. Your game needs actually a good gameplay. Feels like the devs really wanna make a walking sim or a visual novel rather than a game considering how often then are downright antagonistic towards the idea of the player having any control.

Give your money to Hollow Knight, Bloodstained or even Blasphemous.
If you ok with older games, seek out Cave Story, Iga-made Castlevanias or Super Metroid.

[h2]In-depth[/h2] 
[h3] ‚öîÔ∏è Gameplay & Exploration: [/h3]  
  
Puzzle platformer is still the key of the game. Despite having a larger map to explore, this time around, with the additional abilities and tricks you can pull off, it seems a lot faster to get from an area to another.

The game introduces new abilities while requiring players to reactivate and relearn old ones. Ori is more capable this time around when it comes to its arsenal, but still fragile in combat. The game features excellent traversal and progression mechanics, with periodic main narrative follow-throughs necessary for full completion. 

Boss fights are challenging, and chase sequences are less frustrating than the first game.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lD_mAKechc&t=2s
 
[h3] üòÑ Fun: [/h3]

Like the previous game, I've enjoyed this game a lot and it was nice to return to this world.
 
[h3] üèû Visuals & Presentation: [/h3]  
  
The game boasts gorgeous visuals with notable improvements, featuring intricate details in the world. Although the impact may not be as strong due to the fact that it's not too far from the original and that sense of newness is kinda of gone. Still,  it remains one of the most stylistically impressive games.

Like before, yet even more improved, there are different map sections exhibit diverse biomes, ranging from lush forests to candy-like landscapes, deserts, frozen areas, and dark caves. 

Like before, there is a map like an ant colony. It looks weird but fits well within the game's context and adds to its overall appeal.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3046285181
 
[h3] üîä Sound & Voice-Acting: [/h3]  
 
The music this time around is a lot softer, and despite featuring an incredible soundtrack, I honestly enjoyed the end song of the first game more. Nevertheless, there's quality in all aspects, from the voice acting performed by characters that can't be understood, to the beautifully crafted sound effects.
  
[h3] üìñ Story & Writing: [/h3]  

Ori and the Will of the Wisps takes Ori to a different location: a mysterious island, after Ori and Ku, his little owl friend, get pulled in by a strong storm while flying together and are separated as they both fall on this new world. You continue to play as Ori, the mysterious and cute spirit creature capable of using its energy to solve puzzles, fight enemies, and overcome obstacles.

Your journey starts as you explore this vast new world. Although the map is three times bigger than the prequel, the sequel does a great job of making you feel as if the map isn't so vast, thanks to the fact that you now have many more abilities to enhance traversal, exploration, and movement, making the experience more intense, rapid, and interesting.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3046282624
 
[h3] üßµ Length & Difficulty: [/h3]  
  
The game can take some time to beat and complete, especially if you plan to have multiple runs. It's fairly difficult when it comes to some areas or boss fights, but if you play the game right from the get-go in highest difficulty you'll realize that the most challenging part is the boss fights.

[h3] ‚≠ïÔ∏èVerdict: [/h3]  
Although there have been great improvements made in combat, graphics, and the story, there was something about the original that I enjoyed more. Maybe it's the element of newness, or the fact that the music resonated with me differently, but overall, I think that if you've played and enjoyed the first game, you'll enjoy the sequel just as much. It's a worthy package that should be played one after the other as it holds a dear spot in my heart.",1696530645,1699719628,True,28,0,0.748560011386871338,4,True,False,False

Spectacle of colors, beatiful orchestral music and fluid animations. Controlling Ori is fun on it's own because of how responsive and animated it is.
Different locations with distinict vibes and motives, gameplay-wise, some are better (Baurs reach, Luma pools), some not that good (Beginning areas, Midnight Burrows, Silent Woods).
It reuses a lot of cliches from the genre, but they are still well made cliches.

You die a ton, but it has nothing coming close to stuff that Hollow Knight or Celeste have, game actually gives you a lot of help (resources, secrets), which is a biggest flaw to me, because combat and enemies (besides bosses, which are a nice show, but mediocre boss fights) are a chore you rather avoid than fight enjoyably. Which is a shame because there is a lot of upgrades/shard/abillities to experiment with, but in the end you just spam that big arrow and basic slash and facetank everything(even platforming stages!!!) because the game spams health upgrades like it's nothing (hardest difficulty btw)

Story is basic, not overshadowing gameplay, villain is decent enough, ending is fine (And it reveals that Ori is actually Dark Souls: Family Edition). Never felt like it's cheesy or infantile (Maybe one moment, but still - very minor thing).

Lacks more complex secrets, some mistery, and more challange, but overall - if you liked the 1st one, you will like the sequel even more.

If you've read my review for Ori and the Blind Forest, you know I absolutely adore this franchise, and have many commendations to give. Ori and the Will of the Wisps improves on its predecessor in so many ways, overhauling the save mechanic to be automatic, which is a welcome change, and is very forgiving, causing the player to lose very little progress if they die. 

On the improvements: First and foremost, the combat system has been completely overhauled, and all for the better. Once you make some progress in the game, you will have a wonderful variety of weapons to choose from; using them is smooth as butter and quite satisfying. The talent tree system has been replaced with shards, which is very reminiscent of the charm system from Hollow Knight. The abilities from the original Ori have been streamlined, eliminating the frantic search for which button to press.

Ori and the Will of the Wisps is less linear than Blind Forest, which I personally enjoy because it stays truer to the classic metroidvania formula.

I referred to The Blind Forest as a masterpiece, and while I stand by that sentiment, Will of the Wisps is a level above the original in so many ways, It is truly art, and I would even go so far as to say that Will of the WIsps is likely as close to perfect as a video game can get. I could not suggest this game more to anyone. Moon Studios has shown through their work that they consistently create high quality and enjoyable products, and I will definitely be buying whatever game they decide to sell in the future. If it is anything like the Ori franchise, I will be more than thrilled to experience it.

Edit: I have continued to enjoy this absolute gem of a video game, and upon replaying several times, I have what some may consider a small compliment, but it is truly high praise coming from me: though it is almost criminal to try and rank them, given how delightful every single area is, Mouldwood Depths has become very dear to my heart. This is rare, given that I almost universally dislike dark areas in video games, but the creativity and care that went into the creation of Mouldwood shines through, and I always look forward to replaying it, not to mention the excellent use of motif in its music.",1635055481,1698620360,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The narrative and visuals still stay in the same fantasy, childlike theme but it improves on the first game by a lot.

The general platforming still stays upholds the same qualities as the first game. In the Metroidvania department. Ori will always make you progress in a linear fashion from area to area like in the first one, which is unlike other games in the same genre. It does reward you for diverging from the main path with collectables though.

The fighting mechanics have been changed and for the better. You can now swing a sword at enemies which is so much more engaging than the turret orb thingy of the first game.

It still has the same problems I had with the Blind Forest about its explicit story telling but I've come to accept that Ori is this kind of game.

I was happy to repeat the last boss ""fight"" in the original Ori because I knew that every death was my mistake. I don't have the same feeling here. Almost every time I died was because Ori didn't bury into the sand or It was nearly impossible to control him in the narrow sand corridors  on the keyboard.

EDIT: Recently, I decided to give the game another go, this time using a controller. I must say, the difference in the gameplay experience was like night and day. The controls were easy and smooth, allowing for precise movement and combat actions.

However, it's worth noting that the problems with keyboard controls still stand. If you're stuck with using a keyboard, be prepared for a less-than-ideal control scheme.

This game has the most satisfying movement system I've ever used and the combat is much more interesting than in Blind Forest.

I played on hard and the only real complaint I have is the first boss is ridiculous on hard (not sure on other difficulties my first playthrough was normal difficulty on switch a while ago) it 2 hits you, and has a very small window to attack without getting absolutely destroyed, and if you don't keep the pressure on the boss it will corner you and crush you, body and soul, so expect to die many times, which sucks because every time you do die you have to repeat a 10-20sec running away section before the fight begins, which gets kinda annoying after a couple of deaths, after you get past the first boss nothing feels unfair and as you unlock more and more movement options it gets really satisfying just getting from point A to point B.

The bosses are fun and can be a little overwhelming at first but learn their tells and find openings to attack and you'll get through without too much trouble, though you can make them pretty unforgiving if you have a bunch of charms that increase enemy damage dealt and your damage received, as well as one charm that increases both enemy health and damage dealt by 70% which does apply to bosses, most of those charms I keep on for general gameplay to boost my damage and increase rewards and I don't bother changing them for a good 10-20 attempts because I'm stubborn, and as far as I'm aware bosses don't drop directly anything they give you scripted rewards so I'm pretty sure the only thing the +70% charm does during a boss fight is make the fight harder.

One other minor gripe is the game doesn't capture the mouse to the window/monitor so if you have multiple monitors you will click out and minimize the game, it does auto pause on loss of focus so it's not a big deal but it can be easy to lose track of your mouse during a boss fight or escape sequence which can pull you out the groove, obviously this isn't an issue if you use a controller.",1698241700,1698241700,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

This game sucks.  Whatever ""heart"" that they tried to build into the story is completely lost in the complete lack of direction in this story.

I have made two attempts at this game (5+ hours each) and have gotten completely stuck in my progress at virtually the same point.  I have back-tracked multiple times over the revealed game map and I can not find a way to proceed in the story.

There are assets that look to bar me from content I am not ready for yet, but none of the abilities I have will allow me to proceed.  The warp points are way too spread out to allow you to go back and attempt your new abilities without a LOT of back-tracking.

I don't need my hand to be held but c'mon....don't make me give up because I don't know what to do next.

This is little more than a 'cynical' cash-grab. The only thing I can say was done well is the eye candy. The game has about 15 hours' worth of gameplay in it.

They care so little about the game, they didn't even fix some of the noticeable problems with the first game: 
 - the map still doesn't correctly show all areas that have been explored (and sometimes barely shows walls, so you think you didn't fully explore an area when you did). 
 - The controls are incredibly loose and you're fighting against them to get the character to do what you want at times. (Your character sticks to the wall like a magnet.)
 - The gameplay is incredibly shallow.
 - The game may as well be linear. It's really not a metroidvania. You can go anywhere at any time, you just *may* miss some secrets the first time around. Realistically, I could get all secrets with the equipment I had by about 5 hours in. There's not much sense of mystery, like 'How do I access this area? Will I get some upgrade later?'. Mostly it's straightforward.

Additionally,
 - The game is incredibly easy (apart from the occasional boss battle, which are just frustrating really.)
 - So many platforms gesticulate, flop and smush around like they're made of gelatin-- even things that are supposed to be hard rocks or wood. I think the devs were very impressed with themselves for making this interesting visual effect, and so they spammed it everywhere. Another sign the devs don't care about the game, and just see it as a visual art project.
 - The gameplay is frequently interrupted by the most predictable, repetitive cutscenes-- they copied the setpieces from the first game too, so it's not even novel the first time you hide behind barriers to avoid a big owl in the background. For some reason, you can skip some of these cutscenes but not others.
 - They tried to ripoff Hollow Knight's badge system, and they failed almost completely. 
 - The story is terrible and so nonsensical at times that it would be funny if it weren't embarrassing. Things happen because they thought 'this is the kind of story beat that should happen at a time like this', with no connection to the worldbuilding or narrative. Big frog gets possessed by shadow creature (without any warning or narrative setup) because that's just the kind of thing that should happen in a game like this. And of course it finishes with a boss battle, after which he overcomes the possession and then dies. It's extremely predictable and generic, and it doesn't even fit in with the narrative. The visual of the shadow creature carrying the big toad is so absurd-- there's no reason the shadow creature would try to attack you with this huge, cumbersome toad. It's an extremely ineffective way to attack the player; it's clearly done because they devs have no understanding of narrative or art, even at a layman commonsense level, and they just thought that's the kind of thing which happens in a story like this. 

With the story being so nonsensical, yet predictable and generic, and no improvements made to the noticeable flaws of the first game in regards to gameplay, it's hard to see this as anything but a visual arts project for the dev team.

If you haven't played Hollow Knight yet, play that.

I'd make a comment about the story, but I don't want to spoil it. So I'll skip over that for the most part. But this game does give a bigger perspective on the universe Ori lives in. 
There's alot more to this game than the first one, and the first ability gave me goosebumps (good goosebumps). It made me really excited and that alone was enough to hook me (granted, I was already excited after playing the first game).

WARNING! SLIGHT SPOILERS BELOW!
(Continuation as of playing the game again a year later):
Okay so playing the Ori games a second time a year later, finally doing hardmode on this game and as well as a few other achievements... 
The game is literally addicting. I love the platforming and battles here. So fucking addicting.
Like once I made a shard build that maximized my damage and Resilience, Hardmode Bosses felt like Normal Mode Bosses. 
Like omg. 
I literally love running around and just platforming. BASH, LAUNCH, AND GRAPPLE ARE LIKE SO MUCH FUN!!!
And note, I really really really really reallllllly suck at platforming too.
The game was literally getting more addicting with every playthrough.
I really wish they'd make a child for this series.
Both games are peak.
Gameplay mega peak.
Story super peak.
Art is giga peak.
The soundtrack is amazing and really immersive. 
Like everytime I finish the boss fight, I literally want to cry at the ending scenes no matter how many times I see it, even barely remembering the story. 
LIKE SRSLY.
Big Bro Ori is the bomb.
I want more!!!
They said every land is the same. A light and a tree that supports it. Lets see more of the Ori universe!!! We've only seen two lands so far!!!

Building upon the success of its predecessor, ""Ori and the Blind Forest,"" this sequel takes players on an enchanting and emotionally charged journey through a beautifully hand-drawn world.

The game excels in several aspects. Firstly, its visuals are simply breathtaking. The game's stunning art style and attention to detail create a magical atmosphere that draws players in. The lush forests, intricate caverns, and diverse biomes are a testament to the artistry of the developers at Moon Studios.

But it's not just the aesthetics that shine; the gameplay is equally exceptional. ""Will of the Wisps"" refines the platforming mechanics of the first game, providing a smooth and enjoyable experience. The addition of new abilities and upgrades keeps the gameplay fresh and engaging. The combat has also been enhanced, offering more variety in how you approach and defeat enemies.

One of the most memorable aspects of this game is its storytelling. The narrative is emotionally charged, and the characters are endearing. Ori's journey is a heartwarming and often heart-wrenching one, as you navigate through themes of friendship, sacrifice, and the power of hope.

The soundtrack, composed by Gareth Coker, is a work of art on its own. It complements the game's emotional depth and artistic beauty, immersing players further into the world of Nibel.

While ""Ori and the Will of the Wisps"" is a near-perfect gaming experience, it's not without its challenges. Some may find the difficulty spikes to be a bit steep, and there are occasional bugs or performance issues that can detract from the experience. However, these minor flaws are easily forgiven when weighed against the game's many strengths.

In summary, ""Ori and the Will of the Wisps"" is a must-play title for fans of platforms, storytelling, and beautiful art. It's a captivating and emotional journey that will leave a lasting impression, and it solidifies its place as one of the standout games of its genre.",1697947655,1697947655,True,0,0,0,0,True,True,False

The game is also way bigger than the first one, they have implemented NPCs, quests and skill building. You can collect equippable upgrades, use different weapons/fighting styles now. 

Even if what i'm about to say is negative, i still highly recommend the game because the negative comments are only MY OWN experience, and a lot of people (who enjoys a little more strategy and puzzling) wouldn't agree with me. I play for the story and relaxation.)

With all the new stuff to the game compared to the old Ori (which was a very simple platform game), this game was a little  too overwhelming. There were just too many abilities to keep track on. Some abilities were only used in certain regions and never outside of it which was unnecessary. The Burrow ability was super wonky, you could only burrow when the blue indicator showed up and because it shared the same button (i use controller) as Dash, sometimes when you wanted to burrow, you'd dash instead and lose your momentum, it was insanely frustrating. 
There were also too many weapons and some parts in the game required a certain weapon to proceed (like hitting a wall) was very annoying because you'd have to change them back and forth very often.

I still loved and enjoyed the game very much, however i dont think i will be able to finish it because it's just too much and i am starting to lose interest in it.",1697767364,1697767364,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Before I get to the review, if anyone has played the previous part, the ending may not be to their liking. Yes, the ending is open, but I have small objections to the plot. The plot is naive in my opinion because the creators focused mainly on what the presented world is built on - it begs that this time the Light will give way to Corruption/Darkness. The main villain, Stone Owl Scream, is unlikely to convert - excluding her from owl society should have more resonance and teach the Light a lesson she won't forget. Mechanically, this production is a colossal development of the previous part.

Benefits:
- Production lasts for a good 15.5 hours
- You can say that this installment is a kind of platform semi-open world because there are side quests and side activities in the form of races or arenas with opponents (I don't know who came up with the idea to achieve finish the game in 4 hours?)
- Music phenomenal as in the previous part
- The sound of the environment is even better and deeper than in the previous part
- Difficulty level well designed - Normal
- The contrived language that was heard in the previous part is even more emphasized
- Compared to the previous part, there is not so much felt loneliness here because the multitude of characters with whom you can talk and push the plot forward is a huge plus.

Defects:
- I don't know who designed these zakichanke spikes but nothing has changed from the previous part - more and more damage the newer the level and the further in the story
- The digging/sand mechanic is underdeveloped and should be better designed
- Icons disappearing from the map after death even though the next autosave has not been reached
- No detailed graphics settings, instead there are three different graphics profiles - at least the anti-aliasing should be outside these graphics profile.

Final Rating: 8/10.

Dealing damage from the spark in BF was kind of clunky at times, but the different weapons of WotW were great and allowed me to mix it up for whatever play style I was feeling at the time. The combat is good, but the place that this game excels is the story. This game made me cry like 3 different times. The soundtrack is out of this world and helps you feel every chase or cinematic. 10/10 would recommend!",1697190246,1697190246,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

The game's story has some issues, and I've basically given up hope for a DLC that gives us a better ending at this point.

The OST, gameplay, and storyline were all top notch and if not better than the sequel. What stands out between Ori and the Will of the Wisps and Ori and the Blind Forest would have to be the combat system, as in this sequel, it follows through with a rather dynamic boss battle system to progress which I think brings a lot of life to the gameplay. Sure, the order of progression might be confusing to most people, but I think the essence of having free will to make the choices yourself bring out a lot of adventuring as you are exploring the map. But besides that, one area of concern in Ori and the Will of the Wisps would be that it isn't low-end friendly as compared to Ori and the Blind Forest, the graphics can sometimes be rather demanding, the gameplay and cinematics may become choppy, but that rarely disrupts the smooth flowing of the gameplay.

Playing ""Ori and the Blind Forest"" first is not technically required, but I do recommend playing it first. The worst part about this game is that it does rehash some parts of the original, but also has so many mechanical and design improvements (many of which are not-so-subtly borrowed from Hollow Knight) that it sorta nullifies the gameplay of the original. It also feels a little shorter, but that might be because for me the muscle memory of Blind Forest carried me through about 2/3 of the games challenges.

Other than that there's nothing bad to say. The graphics are incredible. The platforming is satisfyingly technical yet feels buttery smooth. The new world has a lovable cast of characters in diverse biomes. The plot takes a bit to get going but brings it home with some very emotional resolutions.

The combat system has been flushed out and is actually really comprehensive and dynamic. Due to the refined combat system, fighting enemies and bosses is much more enjoyable rather than just mashing the same button. The bosses and enemies are much more diverse and include a challenging but fair skill level to beat. 

The movement mechanics have drastically improved despite Blind Forest already being so fluid. The main difference is that you get more useful and comprehensive movement techs earlier in the game rather than going through half the game and finally getting a double jump like in its predecessor. A good metroidvania excels in movement and getting the best movement tech early in the game will keep the player motivated and enjoying rather than struggling and bored. 

The story surprised me on how elaborate it was and I think it was a perfect continuation from the previous title. The characters were so charming and unique. Many side quests along side the main missions and the map flushed out everything in a readable manner. 

The score is exceptional and I did not think it was possible to create better tracks than Blind Forest. I truly felt immersed in many of the sequences and the music was perfectly pitched in the background. Alongside the music was the amazing art direction. Blind Forest already excelled in this department but it was taken to the next level in this game. 

Among the many compelling attributes that Ori and the Will of the Wisps inherits, it's the little things that count. And I won't mention exactly what these are but as you play the game, the small touches really showcase the passion and drive the team had when developing this game. A level of quality and attention to detail that you don't see in modern titles. 

I think Moon Studios absolutely knocked it out of the park and I am looking forward to what they can bring in the future. For the $7.49 sale price, this game is an absolutely gem.",1696391835,1696391835,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

like most games, the game get easy once you get a grip on it
in ori there is an exception that there is to many other great games (like HK), it introduces you to a new mechanic after beating you up for finally understanding the mechanics you have learned so far
most of the puzzles are challenging but also fair
although the story didn't interest me that much the ending got me really sad when ------ if you seen the ending you know
there are not too many boss fights which is kinda unfortunate- though the point of the game is platforming with fighting
the graphics are beautiful and fit with the theme the game is going for

so far the only complaint I have is that ori sometimes doesn't stand out from the background- there were points where I died because I couldn't find him
I suggest to try the game for yourself, and if it's too expensive- every now and then there is a really big sale on it

The biggest strength is the movement; it feels amazing flying around the map with multiple jumps, boosts off enemies and their projectiles. You need to unlock a few abilities, takes maybe 90-120 minutes before the game really opens up and becomes a lot more enjoyable IMO. Once it did I was all in, up until that point I was a bit bored. 

The combat is easily one of the weakest parts of the game. If you've played games like [i]Hollow Knight[/i] and [i]Blasphemous 2[/i] to name a few examples, you're gonna be pretty let down by this aspect of the game. I honestly enjoy the escape sequences from the original Ori more than any of the boss fights here which are all super easy. The combat is so strange because everything is easy, but at the same time, making the enemies more challenging wouldn't necessary make it better because the attacks you have kinda just suck and feel underwhelming. I also found it really annoying that you can only have 3 abilities equipped at once; most games like this would typically allow you to use all your abilities via different button inputs, or a better control scheme so that felt pretty bad.

Similar to the original, the game is beautiful, and the music is amazing. It's certainly a game that is more accessible to newer Metroidvania players, and will be more enjoyable if you haven't played some of these other titles that have incredible combat. Regardless, it's still a fun experience and offers music and visuals that are thoroughly enjoyable. Not my favorite, but a good game that I'd recommend.

Ori and the Will of the Wisps is ABSOLUTELY gorgeous, in like, every sense of the word. Graphically and artistically. There's VERY little to take you out of your immersion, other than Shriek's model clipping through itself in one (1) cutscene. The whole world is beautiful (Luma Pools is actually heaven I think) and the music... GOD the music.

I turned that sh*t up to 11 and blasted my eardrums out and y'know what? Worth it, every time. The frosty music for Baur's Reach actually had me crying when I was running through it trying to get 100% completion.

Some of the chase sequences had a few moments where I was like ""Man, I don't know where I'm GOING"" and it got me killed more times than lack of skill did - so that's annoying. However, it's a minor gripe.

Something Ori and the Will of the Wisps has over its predecessor (Ori and the Blind Forest) is the combat. I have nothing against the combat in the original game, but it's simply better in the sequel. You have more options to fit your fighting style (melee, ranged, mage, whatever), it feels smoother, and when combined with the new movement abilities, it gives you nice, clean gameplay.

Every boss was FANTASTIC with only one giving me trouble and a headache so bad I was forced to take a break. [spoiler]Mora was mostly fine, my biggest gripe being with her tells. 
When she summons spiderlings, she screeches. When she tries to melee you, she screeches. When she spits acid at you, she screeches. See the problem? It plays the same sound for every attack. That doesn't help me figure out what she's doing ahead of time, so I took a lot of cheap hits.
I died a lot during her last phase where she makes the arena dark, but that's due to my own idiocy in not realizing I could just... turn on my light spell and simply not take damage.[/spoiler]

Overall, I enjoyed the HELL out of Ori and the Will of the Wisps - more than it's predecessor? I don't know! It's been so long since I've played it, I can't compare them that well. (if i replay it in the future i'll let y'all know) Even if I do replay and find WotW worse, it will still have been a good, worthwhile experience.

Lastly, the only reason I'm not talking about the story is because... it's Ori. Y'all know the story baller as f*ck, I don't gotta tell you. (I cried by the way, if that gives you an idea.)",1695794406,1695794406,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It is incredibly beautiful, enchanting, adorable and the graphics are outstanding. The music is honestly one of the best soundtrack I've ever experienced. I often listen to it when I don't play, the composer can be proud. 
The story is beautiful and makes me cry each time. Very touching and well told. 
One of my favorite part of the game is simply how amazing it is to move in this game. It is so quick, reactive and satisfying. Especially as you unlock the last abilities, you really feel like a god moving around the platforms. It's really outstanding. 
It makes it even hard to play other games as they all seem too slow and sluggish compared to Ori.

He is so dedicated to composing game music and so dedicated on making it fit every moment of the game, that he played it for over 1000 hours during his 4 years of working on the score. The 4K HDR looks insanely good and the world is beautiful. I can't stop staring at the main menu. Ori's responsiveness is even better than in an original game and is incredibly smooth. This game hits emotionally hard again. We finally have more flexibility when it comes to saving. The ending is good, bittersweet and I like that the cycle is completed and it is a perfect closure to both games. I could praise this game for hours. This and Hollow Knight are the best that the metroidvania genre has ever had to offer.

Everyone is praising this game and for a good reason, so I will focus on what could have been better about this 9.5/10 game:
-I was a little disappointed with how little time we were able to play as Ku. Watching the trailers, I assumed that more focus would be given to her in both story and gameplay. I was hoping for some mystery about the owls and that the plot would go a bit in that direction.
-The main ""antagonist"" is not as good as in the first game. In terms of how we fear her and in terms of her origin story, which is just sad and that's it.
-Platform challenges and escape sequences seem less challenging, and that is what I enjoyed in the first game. I loved the satisfaction of beating the Ginso Tree sequence in the original. Dying 30 times to that epic music was amazing. On the other hand, we get Spirit Trials as a challenge.
-I liked the addition of the NPCs, and the Mokis are really cute, but these RPG elements decreased my immersion. Don't get me wrong, there was nothing wrong with the way they were executed, but you should be in a dying land, desperately looking for a way to save it, not being distracted by a friendly chat, doing quests and building. I don't want to spoil, but compared to the original game, the land's situation should be even more dire.
- I liked the boss fights, but Hollow Knight does it better, and I think the game should focus on what it does best, which is chase/escape sequences and platform challenges that have been shortened and made easier in this game. However, HK doesn't have such responsive movement, so it's still enjoyable and refreshing to have those fights from time to time, especially fight with Mora the Spider (and that music change in the middle was crazy!).",1695477556,1695477556,True,0,0,0,1,True,False,False

Some mechanics feel weird, which is probably where most of the difficulty comes from. However, at the same time, they are super creative and unconventional. In terms of how this relates to other metroidvanias, it seemingly takes inspiration from a lot of the ones I played up until this point, but does it so well that it is hard to be upset about it. The visuals are perfect and the OST is a really awesome twist on the first game's sound track, as well as new tunes that make the journey feel much darker but still emotional. Gotta address the elephant in the room for differences between this and the first game [spoiler] Combat is refined and now there's bosses and boss chases and they are awesome, they did not slack here whatsoever [/spoiler]. I kind of felt weird about all the different movement options towards the end of the game, because I often misinputted due to the time pressure, and forgetting that certain movements are mapped rather than LB or RB on the controller. Exploring in this game is great, and there's virtually no punishment for going the wrong way [spoiler] especially if you have the instant teleport item [/spoiler].

Another masterpiece from Moon.
Another gem, another diamond.

Same tight and intuitive gameplay, beautiful soundtrack, amazing graphics and art style as before.
More of the same awsomeness in a new adventure, could've we asked for more?

We can see that a lot has been influenced by and borrowed from Hollow Knight in this one, from the Spirit Edge similar to the Nail and the Shards just like the Charms. These aren't bad additions, it does add more flexibility in a build you could make with the Charms and where as the Nail in Hollow Knight allows you to bounce off of enemies by attacking down, in Ori, a hit resets your jump count so if you're hitting and jumping right, you can keep being airborn, which feels -so -good.

You'll find most of the shards exploring or from some NPCs and this is where you'll get to select your double jump, your wall grab as well as other buffs and other helpful benefits. You unlock more shard slots the more you go.  

The main abilities are now in a wheel that you can access with LT, stopping time, allowing you to select your skills and put them in your shortcuts (X,Y,B). This is where your main attack, Spirit Edge, is as well as Recover for life recovery, fire orbs, a spear and such.

It feels a little too much compared to the simple and effective way the first game was built around, unlocking your abilities felt more natural without having to select them, but it's well done still, I got used to it without much issues, everything flowed well because the game got great design in overall. 

Differently from the first game where you had a skill tree where you would spend the Spirit Light you're collecting, all the shards and abilities can be upgraded with Spirit Light at certain NPCs now.

Talking about NPCs, they now also give some side quests and we got a Trade Quest like in A Link's Awakening. The throwback.

So, one more time, one of the best Metroidvania.
A third game would be more than appreciated because there's nothing like it.

Ori and the Will of the Wisps is just another masterpiece. Just like Ori and the Blind Forest (which you should play, if you didn't already do it), get ready to be amazed by the beautiful soundtracks and places and be prepared for another emotional story.

The gameplay is just as amazing as in the first game, except you have more abilities (which you can upgrade AND you can use more than one), the open world concept feels more open as you can explore every place multiple times, the saving system changed into an autosave method (which can work in your favor a lot of times) and you get to meet lots of NPC's with all sorts of cute tasks. ([spoiler] except one task that will give you a big punch in the heart. You'll see what I'm talking about [/spoiler]). The visuals are just breathtaking and the music fits beautifully. You'll get through all sorts of emotions, from anger to sadness, from depressed to being incredibly joyful. 

The combat system is really changed. Now we have interesting bosses ([spoiler] the last one shouldn't be a boss. Remember that punch in the heart? Double it. Actually, triple it [/spoiler]) with amazing moves and abilities. Each weapon is required in certain places and the amazing thing is that you can change your weapon any time you want. Even when you're mid battle! There are lots of upgrades for your weapons and you can even get new ones. Speaking of upgrades, you can equip lots of them with the help of shards that you won't miss. 

The controls are as amazing as ever. Everything feels so smooth, especially when you progress through the game and you get some more abilities. Basically, you take everything good from Ori and the Blind Forest and you bring new and better elements to it. 

The visuals are just out of this world. I know that it's been said numerous times, but I just can't help it. Every place (even the not so friendly ones) seems like it's from some amazing fairytale or picture. The lighting system combined with amazing details gives life to the world of Niwen. Of course, we can't forget about the soundtrack that really brings every place to life. Gareth Coker is this amazing God that can create soul piercing soundtracks for the Ori franchise. Every piece is so intense that it makes everything so real. The original theme from the first game is wonderfully ""sneaked"" into the new soundtracks that it kinda gives a feeling of nostalgia. 

Now, the ending (more like a rant) [h2] MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS! Everything will be covered and I'll post a spoiler free conclusion [/h2]
The ending finished me. I've never been this devastated after a game since the first Ori game (even then, it wasn't THIS bad). [spoiler] In my opinion, this game has two endings. The soul wrenching, heart stomping, stomach punching one and the other that doesn't really feel like an end (more like a sequel posibility). Over the course of the game you'll find an even sadder owl story. The first ending involves her and I'm really not happy with it. Call me a brat, but I enjoy happy endings, especially for characters like this poor owl. This game talks about forgiveness and redemption, but this is the part where it fails. After you have to FIGHT with this character, you have to see the saddest cinematic in the whole world and then you have to accept the fact that nothing can be done. And don't get me started with the fact that nobody remembers her, nobody goes to visit her, she doesn't even appear in the credits (in the little arts between credits). It feels like nobody cared about her, EVER, and that's just so heartbreaking. At the end of the game I didn't even know how to feel. Sad or angry for this seemingly rushed ending. You can't get us invested in this sad story and expect us to have the will to fight her. I hope that there'll be a definitive edition that will give her a happy ending. Or at least a sequel with something related to this story. [/spoiler]. It's an Ori game, so you should expect to be emotionally drained, but I feel that everything was much more emotional and sadder.

So yes, I really REALLY recommend Ori and the Will of the Wisps. I recommend the whole Ori franchise. This game isn't called a masterpiece for nothing. You'll be welcomed into amazing worlds that are brought to life with the help of stunning visuals, cute and amazing characters, emotional stories and out of this world music. You'll find yourself taking screenshots from minute to minute (I think I have 500 of them) and you'll love every nook and cranny of the world that beautifully appears before your eyes.",1694997350,1694997350,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I love Ori and the Blind Forrest, definitely one of my favourite games.

That's why it's especially sad for me to experience the terrible technical state Ori and the Will of the Wisps is in currently.  

[code]Everything I talk regarding performance is related to the current patch.[/code]

I for one can't even start the game despite having quite a good rig, far beyond average. It just crashes. 
But when it doesn't crash I have no sound. 

The no sound issue and the crash on the startup is very much widespread issue. 
A lot and I mean [b]a lot[/b] people have or had at least one of it, but it seems that a lot of new buyers of the game actually experience both and can't fix them, the way I can't, being not able to actually play the game we all paid for.

I can't even start it in most of the cases.

There are people that have no problems but thing is there are a lot of people that do have gamebreaking technical issues that Moon Studios doesn't bother to fix apart from mild ones.

One of the source threads: https://steamcommunity.com/app/1057090/discussions/0/2968397584537393710/?tscn=1609641038

The game itself is terrific. It improves on the legacy extensibly and delivers a stellar gaming experience Playing on a second patch if bought on a sale is way to go.

I can play on the previous patch, but this doesn't change anything I said regarding the current patch, it's still doesn't work correctly for a lot of people.",1609666160,1694124021,True,0,0,0.507065236568450928,0,True,False,False

The platforming mechanics is nearly identical to the first game with a couple additional move sets to really enhance Ori's abilities. You get the bash mechanic pretty quick, which is nice, cause that might be ONE OF THE GREATEST GAMING MECHANICS EVER INTRODUCED up there with revert in tony hawk. 

You get a nice selection of shards that enhance your ability. You can specialize them to your play style. I went for pure platforming often opting to use grapple and bash as a primary attack option, shit was so fun. 

The combat system is really robust now, almost overwhelming, being that I felt like I could only really sink my teeth into a couple of the weapons where most of them, I just scratched the surface with them. But honestly, it's still great that there is so many options to stylize your combat. 

Story is beautiful, much like the last. Graphics were fucking gorgeous. 

The one thing I can't really forgive is rip-off Cornifer (Hollow Knight map guy),
I don't even remember the map guys name, not charismatic, not comforting, just kind of weird and forgettable.

I wish they had one of the Mokis be the cartographer or.. something different, I dunno, it just felt too much like a rip-off.

There lies a tale, beautifully twisted and twirled,
Ori and the Blind Forest, a vision to behold,
A game of light, of stories richly told.

From ethereal blues to sunset's warm muse,
Each shade plays a part, every beam, every ray,
Crafting an atmosphere that sweeps us away.

Mechanics not just tools, but a dance of the sprites,
Synchronizing seamlessly with the moon's gentle lights,
With each leap and bound, the forest comes alive,
A testament to gaming, where art and action thrive.

The narrative is a beacon, its message shines bright,
Keep the fire within, never surrender the light,
In a world that may sometimes seem dark and askew,
It teaches us goodness, to ourselves be true.

An ode to nature, to its power and grace,
A reminder to cherish, protect, and embrace,
The trees, the rivers, the air that we breathe,
Respect for the wild, a promise to bequeath.

Ori stands as a testament, a beacon so clear,
That in gaming, beauty and meaning cohere,

Lies a journey of heart, a soulful surprise.",1693692574,1693692574,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The graphics are 20 times better than the previous game's (Already awesome) graphics, and the combat is much better too! As while the first game's combat (Though great in its own right) usually amounted to mash the attack button while dodging the enemy's attacks, and maybe occasionally use the bash or ground pound attack when you unlock them, Will of the Wisps' combat is much more in-depth. There are multiple weapons to pick from, more ways to attack, and the combat feels a lot better overall! As for the world map, it's absolutely humongous! And yet it still manages to be easy to navigate! The game also features actual boss fights, unlike the first game, which only really had 1 miniboss, and a bunch of chase-sequences. The boss fights in this game are great too,  and since this game has multiple different weapons to pick from, the boss fights have a lot of strategy to them too! But even though this game has actual boss fights, it also has chase sequences like the first game. And they are just as great if not better than the first game's! This game also has actual NPCs, and sidequests, unlike the first game. Notably, the characters, and sidequests are really in-depth, like for example, if a character at one point mentions having moved from a different area of the map, leaving their old house behind, the old house will actually be located at that part on the map! This results in the world feeling a lot more alive than the previous game's.

Combat is really fun. Not on the level of Dead Cells fun (still my favourite metroidvania) but still some superb, top tier stuff. I especially enjoyed pairing that ability which lets you shoot arrows faster with that one ability which lets you shoot multiple short range burst arrows. 
Graphics wise, this game takes the cake, and should honestly be a standard for 2D platformers. The game is just beautiful to look at. I will leave it at that. 
Story wise, I think it was solid, like an 8.5 out of 10. Some parts I would most certainly change, but overall it wasn't drawn out a whole lot, and the run time felt good for the price of the game. Some of the puzzles were quite tricky (most of which I had to find guides on how to do them on YouTube) but they were genuinely well designed and fun to go through, though challenging at times.

And so since Ori here is the last platform game I'll ever play - it was an absolutely wonderful farewell.   Ori and the Will of the Wisps has encompassed forty years of platform gaming evolution and was an absolute delight to play ... just like Pitfall was back in 1982.    

Thank you, Ori - for making me experience - for the last time - the sheer simple pure joy of a platformer game.    I couldn't have asked for a better one.

What is great about it:

- Heart and emotion
- Characters
- Abilities
- Side quests
What could be better:
- Collectibles
What sucks:
- PC controls

So, my #1 tip is to get a controller, or play it on a console, so your controls don't suck. There's so much amazing stuff in this game it'd be a shame to let just the controls ruin it.

Better than the first game (Blind Forest), and you don't reeeally need to have played the first one to play this... so feel free to just skip Blind Forest and start with this one.",1647080472,1692774366,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The great:
Smooth gameplay, revised and expanded abilitiy/movement systems from the first game, much larger map, and absolutely gorgeous visuals and animation (the new, and more plentiful cutscenes were always a treat). This time without optimization issues!

The good:
More chores via side quests but that's meh at worst, and up to personal preference. Though it is fun unlocking all the new stuff by completing them and really pays off when it comes to the harder challenges you get to after (I didn't even get close to completing them all).
Story isn't anything extraordinary from one casual playthrough, but doesn't need to be either. It's very wholesome and touching at times, and the villain(s) are genuinely intimidating, both through presentation and fight difficulty. It does what it needs to and ties the whole game together very nicely.

The meh:
could just be me being dumb but I don't get why, storywise, Ori would lose most of his abilities from the first game and we have to get them back here? Not a big issue since the player progression feels really good nonetheless, in my experience and opinion.

The bad:

Genuinely no significant complaints off the top of my head. I got this on sale but it's still well worth it for full price today.",1692653795,1692653795,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

iv'e played this after playing the blind forest and hollow knight, iv'e seen alot of similarities from hollow knight itself. Not all games were perfect but this is something worth trying if you want something new.

[WHAT I DON'T LIKE]

- [ENDING]
 like anyone else did,i got abit annoyed and complaint from the ending itself. is it just me or its too early to jump straight to the point at the end? . Like no warning or anything for the final scene and just like ""Ok the ill do it"" no hesitant or solution to the problem. Im just like... why????? is there no other vessel or anything??????

- [LACK OF CONTENT]
Maybe some of you who have played and finishing this game feels satisfied but i dont, similar to the previous sequel it lacks of in game content when you compare to other games like hollow knight. The problem is i want more :(, I NEED MORE

[THE GOODS]

- [MUSIC]
the taste is subjective but this is one of the best ost ive heard in any modern games, fits perfectly with the surroundings, intense moments, and boss fights. every area has a character itself thanks to its very good level design and the theme.

- [STORY]
its simple, reconnecting Ori with Ku and his family. But the progress what i feel is making this game special, from the memories in the Beginning with naru, ku and gumo until meeting new strangers like kwolok,opher, the mokis and everyone else. its a one long 20 hours journey and i like it...... until the ending.....

- [MECHANICS AND ABILITIES]
Just as i said from the start, it took some hollow knights mechanic's as a inspiration and it wasn't a bad thing since it was an improvement compare to the first sequel, i think this is just me but some abilities was a bit overpowered making it a bit unbalance. Besides that, i had fun with it, easy to learn and hard to master i would say.

- [VISUALS]
Just like the first game, its a gorgeous world to explore. ""Very good graphics"" my friend played the first game and this is the first thing she said to me. This second game was an improvement. with the music theme fits perfectly with each different area and cutscene and outstanding visuals making this game more than word ""alive"".

overall its a refreshing game if you want something new, better than most modern games today. This game is a hidden gem. Worth the buying on sale for just 2-3$. 

if you said ""compare this to hollow knight""........ i dont know what to say about that since the game itself was very differrent from one and another. Even thought its 2d platformer and a metroidvania. Ill say just enjoy these games :)",1691949505,1692163996,True,0,0,0.472440958023071289,0,True,False,False

The graphics, music, and sound are amazing.  The platforming is quite good as well.  The combat is better than the last game, but still very weak.  As I said in the last game, they should have made a platformer rather than try and be a metroid-esq game.  

The last boss is the best example of that.  First, there is no enemy anywhere near as hard as this at any point in the game.  You go from decent combat with abilities you can work with to the mess the last boss is.

The game shows you where an attack is coming from, but never shows you what the actual hitbox is.  I kept getting his by the ground stomps because I would move just outside of the where the head would be to get some hits in.  Neither the head nor the marker on the ground are anywhere near the size of the hit.  That head is another example.  I could stand a full Ori width away from the head, but still get hurt when I tried to attack it.  The last phase shows the really bad design.  The projectiles come at you with pure RNG.  This means you can use them to keep up, but suddenly, the direction you were moving in from them becomes empty and the nearest one is literally on the other side of the screen.  This will kill you through no fault of your own.

Really, if they left out the combat and only did platforming, it would be a truly amazing game.

While the emotional impact this game's story had on me was not as substantial as Blind Forest's story, I still loved every second of it. The pacing of the ending was also a lot more well done, as well, with a very long and exciting buildup to the final boss fight. While this wasn't a complaint of mine, I've heard a lot of people say that Blind Forest's ending was very abrupt.

At first, I was a bit annoyed at how much this game was taking directly from Hollow Knight. I felt like those mechanics were Hollow Knight's own, and that no other game deserved to take them and use them for themselves. By the end, though, I really started to appreciate how much the gameplay benefited from the intense swordplay, charm system, and NPC-oriented quests, all mechanics that also appeared in Hollow Knight. Game studios taking inspiration from other games in their genre to better the overall experience is a very good thing, and while I didn't realize that at the start of my playthrough, I'm glad that Ori took this route.

The combat, abilities, charms, movement, and visuals are all a huge step up from the first game, with everything feeling just about perfect.

I really enjoyed the first Ori for the most part, with the exception of about 4 running away sections (Ginso Tree escape, Forlorn Ruins escape, lava escape and Mount Horu escape) which were extremely frustrating. It's a beautiful game with a beautiful story and beautiful music. I also really appreciated how the size of the map doesn't detract from how the routes you have to take are pretty obvious.

This sequel improves on the original in so many ways. The story is much more engaging. The difficulty is more balanced, there's only 2 parts in this one that really pissed me off (Kwolok and sandworm escapes) as well as maybe the feeding grounds part but that was more just bloody scary. This game autosaves which makes life a lot easier than the soul link feature in the first game. The addition of Lupo and his maps is also an absolute godsend for exploring new areas, compared to Map Stones which I wasn't a big fan of. Replacing the ability tree with spirit shards was also a great idea as it made it easier to get to the good abilities without having to grind for spirit light, and the combat shrines just took that an extra mile and meant you could get levelled up to be incredibly overpowered which made the game fun as hell. I love that there's a hub that you can build up, complete with many of the new characters which add a lot to the world and the feel. And it's just a generally addicting and damn fun game to play, I enjoyed it loads. The running away sections, when they're hard, are still not at all fun, but that being said I really enjoyed the bossfights that weren't present in the first game. Very much worth playing.

You're now halfway across the room. Oh you mistimed it or made one wrong move in that 15-button combo? Try it again until you get it right. Or better yet, you made it all this way without the key?

The good: Very pretty. Good platforming gameplay with lots of variety. As soon as you finish with one mechanic, another one is thrown in. Not many bugs, smooth performance on a 1060 graphics card. Good save system. The boss fights are good fun, interspersed with chase scenes. Difficulty is well balanced and game is neither too easy or too hard. You can go off and level up if a fight is too hard, then come back stronger.

The bad: The story fell flat for me, came across as a children's book. The soaring ""aaa aa a aaa, aa a a aaa"" type vocal music was way over the top, muting it made the game better. There were a few moments where I thought puzzles were too confusing, but online walkthroughs solve that issue.

- Like its prequel, this game is gorgeous. I found myself occasionally stopping to take in the backgrounds
- The characters still feel a little too small in proportion to the rest of the screen. This can be a boon on sequences that require careful planning, but I still felt like Ori was a bit tiny in some parts
- The music is amazing; the full score is comprised of well-performed orchestral pieces
- All the voice acting being done in a fantasy language makes it a little difficult to judge, but it seems mysterious and bassy enough

[b]Story & Vibes[/b]
- The story is as mysterious and symbolic as ever. You'll have to explore, collect items, and complete missions to get a better feel for the game world
- It's worth it to dig in a little bit. It makes the ending that much more poignant if you know what's going on
- In all, if you played the first game and made an effort to remember the bigger plot points, the story here is pretty good and provides great closure to the series
- The vibes oscillate between cute, mysterious, and scary

[b]Playability & Replayability[/b]
- Like the first game, this is a masterclass in metroidvania puzzle platforming. It's hard and you'll die a lot, but it never feels cheap or impossible. If we're going to continue comparing it to the first game, I'd say Will of the Wisps is a bit less challenging than Blind Forest
- This is a subjective opinion (aren't they all?), but I found myself enjoying the level design a bit more in this game. Areas like the little grove with all your friends and the watermill were really interesting. It's not that they were bad in Blind Forest. On the contrary, the level design and map were excellent there too. I just found myself having an easier time making a connection between my unlocked abilities and the places they allow me to access this time around
- There's way fewer chase and stealth sequences this time around. I was happy for the reduction while I was going through the story, but I wound up actually wishing there had been a few more of each as I was watching the credits roll
- The bosses were also pretty good, but won't pose much trouble if you've gotten the hang of beating bosses in more combat-intensive metroidvanias like Blasphemous, Grime, or Salt & Sanctuary
- I'll probably play both games in the series again one day. They're too good to not revisit sometime again

[b]Overall Impressions & Performance[/b]
- No performance issues or bugs to report
- I found myself liking Will of the Wisps just a little more than Blind Forest. If it comes down to any specific thing, I'd say it's the design involved in the watermill area. It's the best environment in either game in my opinion, and I had a blast exploring it

[b]Final Verdict[/b]
- [b]9/10[/b]. The Ori series gets a fitting and beautiful ending. Seriously, if you like Metroidvanias with challenging platforming, this series is can't-miss. Sure, it's not as complete a package as something like Hollow Knight, but I wouldn't rank Will of the Wisps far behind it",1691445220,1691465025,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[spoiler] So basically, Moon had no plans for a sequel. This is obvious because Blind Forest was a complete story. Microsoft wanted another game and Hollow Knight was popular so they copied it. As for the story, they copied it from the first game and added some things here and there. This story is the product of crunch and different writers working on it. 

The ending is the scrapped ending which was intended for BF (where it would have worked better). Here it feels unnecessary, forced and rushed. We are told that Ori should stay and become a guardian of this forest, but we assume that she will be mobile like the other guardians, and also she has already accomplished a lot in that state. But no, Ori has no choice but to die by fusing with the light that we met five minutes ago even though there was no immediate danger like fire and even though Niwen was doing fine for the most part. (again these factors were different in Blind Forest and that's why the ending would have worked better there). I do not consider this game canon.

This is also an attempt to kill off the main character so the devs don't have to do another game (they said themselves ""we can't make Ori games forever). Moon may have succeeded on this (and dividing the community), they will not do another Ori game but Microsoft could still do it, although I have no expectations.

The game felt a lot more fairer then the first game since you could easily make one mistake and die in it, and if you didn't save by a portal for a while (cause you had no energy e.g), you could get sent back far, having to recollect anything you collected previously. This game uses automatic saves from time to time which removes the worry of having enough energy to save if your in a bad spot,

1 thing I appreciated was being able to fast travel to any well without having to go to another first. This helped with completing puzzles for collectables and begin able to fast travel instantly to the next, saving time along the way. 

Overall, if your played the first game and like it, you 100% need to play this game if you haven't already, there is no reason not too. Once again the game is beautiful and has an emotional ending.",1691343126,1691343126,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

When I played the first game , I enjoyed it a lot, it had everything a game has to offer : great story, interesting cutscenes,great music, amazing art,great game mechanics, a functioning upgrade system etc. 

After finishing the first one , I thought the sequel wouldnt get any better than that, boy was I so wrong.Here are the great improvements I think they made over the first game :

-Fighting : First game did have good mechanics, but fighting was ok , most of the time I would evade from fighting with creatures .However with this game, they improved the animations greatly, you can do 2-3 combos mid-air, when you give damage to enemies, enemies do show that they were attacked etc.I think they were many feedbacks regarding about this and they improved it into this wonderful mechanic.

-Upgrade System : This is also something I think they changed it for the better. In the first game , upgrades were in a menu which you can access through your latest save point. This made it easy to access from everywhere which was good but the upgrades were this tree-like structure which branches out to three distinct branches and if you wanted to get a spesific upgrade on a branch , you had to obtain the previous upgrades in order to do so -chain like- . So an upgrade like triple jump was only available late-game (you could receive it mid game but then you probably had to not upgrade the other branches to receive it).
In this game ,they removed the saving points completely. Game auto-saves now and I think this was a needed change because let's face it , manual saving sucks (or I suck at it lol). And since they removed manual saving ,instead of this  upgrade menu ,they turned it into a merchant where you can buy the upgrades from. And they also made it limited to a certain amount of slot (3 at start but could be extended to 8) so that it cant be used all at once but you can remove the upgrades from slot and replace it with another one easily.Since the slots are extendable , once you are late game , you could have sufficient amount of slots to beat the game etc. Overall this felt like a great change .

-Quick Travel : This was also a vital addition which was given to player's desire.In the first game, you could only quick travel when you reach into one of those pools where you can warp from one pool to another. But sometimes you would be far off from one and getting there could be time-consuming for some players. With this addition, you could warp to the any pools around the map so that you don't need to walk all the way to get to nearest pool and then warp.That was a nice touch.

-Open World : First game was also an open world-game but lacked the open world features and felt empty walking around the map -objective wise- . Second game however, turned this vast area into a better open world style and added some RPG features. In this game , you could get side quests apart from the main ones , and this helps with exploring the map, finding areas that are not mandatory to find, extending gameplay length etc. I finished the first game without exploring a huge area that had 2 upgrades which would have helped me better with exploring the rest of the map and was essential in obtaining some of the upgrades which I couldn't obtain because i lacked those upgrades.
As I mentioned before, merchants instead of upgrade trees or buying the map from a vendor instead of activating the map yourself breaks the feeling of being alone in a huge area where it doesn't make sense to not have any living beings around. This was a great change that put the game on a even higher level than it normally is.

The only thing i would reproach about is the main gameplay - playing the main quests- , had it not been the boss fights, It pretty much felt like doing the same thing in the first game. Go to that area, grab that thing, go to the other are and grab the other thing; once you have it all collected, go to boss area , fight the boss etc.Only difference was the boss fights and not gonna lie , boss fights were much better than the  tree sections of the first game.But this was something that is mildy annoying and didn't effect my opinion about this game .
That being said, I think my overall ranking of this game would be 9/10.",1691333682,1691334231,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

My first real video game experience was playing Rayman 1 on the PS1, then later Rayman 2: The Great Escape and Rayman 3: Hoodlum Havoc on my old Gateway computer.  This was accompanied by the Crash Bandicoot Trilogy and and the first couple Spyro games on the PS1.  Rayman was my favorite though: the mysterious and magical primordial forrest and whimsical characters and (slightly) dark plot elements and wonderful music had me in love.

I grew up, and played other games (mostly FPS and RPGs), and I longed for a game to fill the hole the Rayman franchise left in me, as most other platforming games just weren't the same.

Then I discovered Ori.  I played through Ori and The Blind Forrest, and what a wonderful surreal experience!  It felt like fresh air, and gave me feelings I hadn't felt since I was a kid.  So naturally, I played Ori and the Will of the Wisps.

It was every bit as good as the first Ori game, and actually improved some aspects that were lacking in the first game. It's improved graphics will be harder on older systems, but the game is even more vivid than the first game (which is impressive!).  Punchy controls, fun and engaging mechanics, and beautiful story and soundtrack make this game one of the best experiences I've ever had playing a game.

Fantastic game.  I am sad that there are no more Ori adventures for me to experience, but perhaps in the future there will be more!  If you're still on the fence, just get the game.  You WILL NOT regret it.  (Unless you haven't played the first Ori game, then go buy that one first!)",1691281878,1691281878,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

The first Ori game was great but it was that, just a fun and worthwhile experience for time spent and price paid.
What the hell was this game.
They completely reinvented the gameplay while improving everything that made the first game good, that being the soundtrack, style/graphics, and the narrative.
It's unreal how fluid playing it is, it genuinely feels like it's not real, like it shouldn't exist, but it's just that good.
Ori controls beautifully, and the upgrades to his moveset make you feel incredibly satisfied after pulling off some insane parkour, MVPs being the amazing chase sequences.
They also made the combat far better, following the Hollow Knight system of shards that you can equip to your playstyle, that complement not only Ori's combat but also his moveset (like a triple jump).
The weapons are also diverse, though I only found myself using the heavy hammer, the sword and the arrow, but that's just my playstyle, yours will probably be much different.
The story while not God of War levels, made me cry, very hard, at multiple points, I genuinely feel for this world and its characters, and the ending is a masterpiece.
The soundtrack doesn't follow the usual ""Not the focus until a boss battle or emotional moment"", I found myself stopping just to listen to the overworld soundtrack because of how beautiful it is, it elevates the experience by that much.
Genuinely a masterpiece.",1690998010,1690998010,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Much like it's predecessor, Ori and the Will of the Wisps (WotW) is visually and musically stunning, and continues the story shorty after Ori and the Blind Forest (BF) left off.  The biggest distinction I can make between the two games is that in WotW, Ori feels more powerful and accompanied by friendly faces in an otherwise harsh world, whereas in BF, Ori felt much more frail, isolated and alone.  Nonetheless, the world of WotW is just as threatening and vast as BF.  Will of the Wisps is a worthy successor to Blind Forest, and well worth a playthrough!

The Full Summary:
WotW retains the charm and beauty that made me fall in love with BF, but this time around, Ori feels like they've grown since the last adventure.  While still very much a Metroidvania-style platform adventure, combat is much more heavily emphasized here than in BF.  Throughout WotW, Ori gains a plethora of upgradable powers that make exploration and combat a breeze. 

Also unlike BF, this world is inhabited by friendly faces.  This takes away from the sense of isolation, hopelessness and dread that gave BF such a distinct feel, but nevertheless Ori still feels like this world's last hope, seeing as how many of the inhabitants of this place mention that they haven't seen a Light Spirit like Ori in their area for a very long time.  This is also emphasized whenever you stray too far from the central hub area, as much of the terrain is dark, desolate, and dangerous. 

While the above does change the flavor of the game when compared to its predecessor, this is still very much an Ori game at it's core and plays just as smoothly as BF.  And personally I appreciated having a friendly, more alive world to explore.  The ally creatures, and even some enemies, reveal backstory and lore, making the world feel much more fleshed out.  It makes it feel like you're fighting to protect something in WotW, whereas in BF you were fighting to restore what was lost.  

The story was a delight to play through, and finding every collectible and side-quest was a nice challenge on top of the story.  There are also Combat Shrines and Spirit Trials that test your combat and platforming prowess, respectively.  So there's plenty to do if you need a break from questing. 

Will of the Wisps is a fantastic follow-up to Blind Forest, and absolutely worth a play through, especially if Metroidvania-style games are your thing.",1690137266,1690858525,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Feels like someone wanted to make an animated show but resorted to making a game because that was the only way they could find finding for this trash game. The game is full of abilities but I can only use 3 at a time like what the fuck? I have 5 charm slots but three of those are NECESSARY to traverse the world and buy upgrades so in reality I have 20 charms but I can only equip 2 a time. Boss fights were boring and needlessly tedious. The platforming is difficult and has the potential to be fun but fucking fuck of god so frustrating because of how the dash and sand dash buttons are unintuitively assigned to different buttons. This is a good example of a game where RESTRICTING abilities or making them more complex to use (through charms/shards or button combinations) would've actually made the game fun instead of trash. Soundtrack was fire though. Loved it. Honestly, though, fuck this trash. Never make another game please. Also people need to stop sucking this game off like it's the holy grail from god. If all it takes to make a game good is good art direction, soundtrack, and story then go watch an anime or something instead of playing a game.

Played this game. It captured me in the same way Hollow Knight did.

- you can cheese a lot and it's tempting(kinda fun though)
- the story can be confusing at times

5/5

Definitely an improvement over the first game especially in regard to the mechanics. I can definitely tell this game copied Hollow Knight in regard to the ‚Äúspirit shards‚Äù which are essentially ‚Äúcharms.‚Äù The combat is far more enjoyable and not repetitive like the first game and the different environments is a lot more fun this go around. This game definitely had more challenge to it as well. I also enjoy the fact that I could 100% the game without needed a strategy guide. Only once or twice I had to look up for some help in regard to getting to a new area.

Overall, it addressed my gripes about the first game in a lot of creative ways. It also made escape scenes a bit more forgiving and less time consuming. Really the only knock I have on the game is that it certainly copied aspects from Hollow Knight. I wish it wasn‚Äôt so overt in doing so but I will say the game stands on its own just fine. The general story and new characters are enjoyable as well.

I can‚Äôt sit here and say it‚Äôs better than Hollow Knight but the gap between the two is not much. This is arguably easier to pick up and adapt to as it still is not as hard and allows for traveling and ease of getting around much easier. The strength of the game is platforming and that is something that I can‚Äôt say any other game can compare to because of how downright fun and complicated the platforming can get. It‚Äôs hard to find anything to not like about this game truthfully. It‚Äôs quite enjoyable and did something that few sequels do and managed to improve the obvious flaws from the first while not changing the formula too much.

Ironically, throughout my experience playing this game, the thought of ""Hollow Knight did this better"" was usually at the back of my mind.

Hollow Knight doesn't have 3D models; instead it has fantastic artwork, tight controls, and challenging gameplay.

Ori's aesthetic is similar, but it's more 3D and your character has inertia: I literally spent a good 4 or 5 minutes trying to jump onto a small platform because of this.

Ori also gives you a lot more text to read. In Hollow Knight, you can collect a Mask Shard, Vessel Fragment, or other important item, and there's little to no descriptive text, because none is needed‚Äîeverything in that game is intuitive. By contrast, every time I got an item in Ori, they gave me a lengthy explanation about what it does and how I should get ready to collect a bunch more of them. I'm sure not everyone will feel this way, and I'm probably making a huge deal out of something that's not very important, but for me it felt like I was being patronized.

I felt the combat fell a little flat for me, and the world did feel a little empty towards the end of the game, but I ended up enjoying it nevertheless. There are a couple games that get a better value for the $30 pricetag, but I ended up snagging it on sale and enjoyed my time with it. Worth your time if you can get it for cheaper.

This is my first time playing a game in this series, and I ended up 100% it on Normal. I might revisit it for the Speedrun achievements or to play it again on Hard, but I don't really feel a strong urge to do so.

PROS:
- The game is visually stunning. Backgrounds look phenomenal, and the various details like the flora in each region help sell the game's world. The character animation is also incredibly good, both in gameplay and in cutscenes, doing a good job of selling emotion without dialogue. I wish more games looked like this.
- The Sound and the Music of the game is also fantastic. A lot of work was evidently put into both the sound design for gameplay and the score for the game, and it really shines through. It reminded me a lot of the Armello SFX, which are also amazing.
- The platforming feels REALLY good. The game gives you access to a lot of things that just chain together really well, and I think the complexity really works in its favor. Plus, I'm a sucker for anything bullet time, and bash tickles my monkey brain in a lot of different ways.
- This game feels OK to 100%? There's not that much content, sure, but I'm grateful there's no 40+ minute endurance challenges or esoteric puzzles that I have to bash my head into for hours to solve. I do wish there was some more variety, but fully completing the game doesn't feel actively bad, which I enjoy.

CONS:
- Combat feels like an afterthought. Enemy variety is pretty low (I can think of maybe like 4 distinct non-boss enemies? There's a couple of variants but you get my point) and normal enemies never really feel like a barrier after a certain point. This game also gives you a ton of flat combat buffs (do more damage, etc.) that make the game easier without making it more fun/interesting.
- Bosses were also super disappointing. None of them really feel engaging, and the game does a poor job of communicating both when you get hit and when you hit the boss back. 
-  Some late-game abilities kind of trivialize a lot of the platforming challenges, which is both a blessing and a curse. It makes traversing the map a lot faster and more fun, but also takes a lot of the puzzle solving out of the equation. Wish there were a few limits on it (use energy or something idk).
- I didn't really mesh with the story at all. Part of this may be the fact that I didn't play the first game, but I never really got super compelled by the main story. You don't really get to interact with a lot of the main forces opposing you outside of hearing other people talk about how bad they are, which feels a little flat from a storytelling perspective.
- The game is noticeably buggy. Several memory leaks just happen throughout my playthrough, and lag leading to input delay was also a thing that happens sometimes. For a game that is so polished otherwise, that was kind of shocking to me.
- For a Metroidvania, it feels like backtracking is very underutilized. Never felt the need to go back to older areas until I was already trying to 100% the game. I think the game would have benefited if they had cut a few areas and put that effort into bulking up the remaining areas with more secrets, quests, and puzzles.

This game felt very casual on my playthrough. Dying is never really a setback and you almost always have the resources needed to accomplish something nearby. This could be a positive or a negative depending on who you talk to, but it was definitely very prominent in my mind when I was playing through the game. The game is at its best as a platformer, the movement is well thought out and engaging and the map design helps accentuate the game's strengths. The combat feels very straightforward and would be where I would want to see the most improvement in a potential sequel. This game's presentation is a standout quality - the animation and visuals are heads and shoulders above other similar games. It was a good experience and I would recommend it to anyone interested in trying a new 2D platforming/exploration game.",1689447342,1689447342,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

From the very first moment I stepped into its magical world, I was captivated by the sheer beauty and attention to detail that permeates every aspect of the game.

The graphics in Ori and the Will of the Wisps are a true work of art. The hand-painted environments burst with vibrant colors and lush landscapes, creating a living and breathing world that feels alive in every frame. From the swaying grass to the shimmering waterfalls, every pixel is meticulously crafted with love and care. The animations are fluid and expressive, bringing the characters and creatures to life in a way that feels both natural and fantastical.

Complementing the stunning visuals is a musical score that is nothing short of sublime. The haunting melodies and atmospheric compositions perfectly capture the mood and emotions of each scene. Whether it's the gentle piano keys during a moment of tranquility or the crescendo of orchestral triumph during an intense encounter, the music in Ori and the Will of the Wisps elevates the entire experience to new heights. It tugs at your heartstrings and immerses you deeper into the world, creating an emotional connection that is truly profound.

Beyond its audiovisual splendor, the gameplay in Ori and the Will of the Wisps is a joyous and satisfying experience. The platforming mechanics are precise and intuitive, allowing for graceful movements and exhilarating traversal through the intricately designed levels.

The combat is engaging, requiring strategic thinking and skillful execution to overcome formidable enemies. The game strikes a perfect balance between exploration, puzzle-solving, and thrilling action, ensuring that every moment spent in its world is filled with wonder and excitement.

But what truly sets Ori and the Will of the Wisps apart is its ability to tug at your heartstrings. The narrative is beautifully crafted, exploring themes of love, sacrifice, and the power of friendship. It weaves a heartfelt story that resonates deeply, and the emotional moments are delivered with such sincerity that they left me teary-eyed on more than one occasion. The characters are endearing and their relationships are beautifully portrayed, creating an emotional investment that makes the journey all the more impactful.

To keep it short, I am shocked by how good the story is with limited dialogue and as for the abilities its fantastic. The movement is incredibly smooth and super fun. The only downside to the movement is that it is a little cluttered in how many movement abilities there are. Its a little hard to manage how which abilities you need to use with how many there are. That is a minor gripe however because outside of that, the game is phenomenal and well worth the price. If you can get it on sale it is an absolute steal.

The only caveat I will make is that the game is short in game time compared to some titles. I logged 12 hours in grabbing the majority of the collectibles in the game and completing the story. Even if that makes you hesitant I would still suggest you give it a try as it truly is an incredible game that 100% worth it for me.",1689399631,1689399631,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Problems
1. Lack of Tutorial. It seems to assume everyone has played the prequel or similar platformer, which is not friendly considering its fame.
2. Checkpoints. The autosave works at fixed location rather than events. If we die after obtaining a side-quest item or collectible before reaching next checkpoint, have to redo all the process.

And when I did finish, it was probably the moment where I cried the most in my life by far. Since blind forest, you start relating with Ori, you could feel his pain, his joy, what he was feeling just by one micro event, absolutely everything. I couldn't process nothing after that, and everytime I saw Ori or heard the ost for 1 second, I start crying again.
I don't wanna talk much about the game itself on this review because I'm afraid even one person who didn't buy the game is reading it, and if you are this person, buy both games. I wasn't expecting much from both games when I started, but in 3 days, it suddenly became my favorite game of all time BY FAR.
The artstyle, the story, the music, everything is perfect.

Thank you Moon Studios for this masterpiece. You can really tell by yourself playing on how much they put their heart into it.

The controls are as responsive as the first game and the movement abilities also expanded from the first game, which makes the levels more fun and challenging at the same time. The story is also straightforward and contains more cutscenes compared to the previous game or Hollow Knight. It is immersive and ends the series with a bittersweet and heartfelt ending.

As a 37y old guy, playing video games since i was 6. It's get harder and harder for me to get really touched emotionally by a game. But man... this one (and the first one) got me some tears.
The art, the music, the puzzles, the (simple but so efficient) story, sometimes contemplating, sometimes challenging, the fluidity in the movement.... it's a real pleasure to control Ori and jump/dash everywhere and i was sad when i ended the game because i knew i wouldn't recover this discovery feeling again.

The game maintains the beautiful art style only getting more pretty by focusing more on bioluminescence and adding a more vivid depth to the world's environments that wobble and bounce in response to your movement. The music is also just as strong maintaining the emotive orchestral world-music score that compliments the game's primal tones.

Having already mastered movement the team decided to add more combat in this title. WotW does away with the ranged wisp attack and now introduces a small variety of weapons and a new cast of monsters to use them against. It lacks the mechanical precision of it's contemporaries and while the combat is there it isn't innovated on at all. The enemies are nothing special in terms of gameplay and you'll encounter the same few types throughout the entire game. There are a few different weapons but they feel like toys to play with, not tools to be applied to enemies. If anything they see more creative uses as solutions to puzzles and platforming sections than they do as ways to dispatch foes.

Movement meanwhile is still very strong and WotW introduces a handful of new movement abilities which compliment everything that came before. The cinematic boss platforming sections make a return but are accompanied by lacklustre boss fights that provide more excuses to use the attack button and don't add much else. You also get to play as Ku for a section of the game which makes for a nice change of pace, and offers a bit of unique movement and platforming.

As for story, if the first Ori game was about the cycles of life and death WotW is about growing up and playing your part in those cycles. The new characters and critters you befriend all seemed unnecessary seeing how the first game conjured so much emotion with zero dialogue, and the new quests they bring with them feel like blatant padding. I imagine the studio wanted to capitalise on making you run around and fight things, but it's a shame they resorted to some of the more phoned in game design to accomplish that.

In conclusion WotW does less with more but given the first game's strength was its minimalism there's no wonder they had trouble making all the new features fit. If the combat focus was treated with the same creativity as the first game's movement it could have really been something special rather than a middling sequel with lots of padding.",1688903839,1688903839,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

What a fantastic game! I have played it through to it's conclusion and enjoyed every minute of it.

The cuts scenes are great and tell the story very well. The game is nicely paced, split into different missions, each with their own story and boss fights at the end. In between those you explore the maze-like worlds avoiding various dangers and fighting off all sorts of creatures searching for various items which you need to upgrade your abilities and progress the story.

Plenty of action and some of the boss fights were a genuine challenge.

I came across this game after looking for something similar to Rayman Legends so if you enjoyed that, you will likely enjoy ""Ori and the Will of the Wisps"".

I would highly recommend this game.

If I had to chose a ""benchmark"" for platformer games, then without any doubt i'd say that the Ori games are by a landslide the best games to perform this task flawlessly.

The only regret i have is that I waited such a long time before picking up the second game... But that's what you get with a Steam backlog that's literally thousands of games big!

Great music and visuals, as expected, and very fluid game-play. More of a combat focus on boss battles than the Blind Forest, which I didn't always enjoy, but I guess it's a change of pace. Some people praise the story, and there were some lore-drops near the end that revealed some stuff about the world, but despite it trying to be emotional it never really was for me. 

Overall very enjoyable. There's just something about slowly gathering those movement abilities until you're flying through areas you slowly struggled through in the early game.

Ori and the Will of the Wisps is a sequel that changes the game completely. Real quickly, with out getting to much into spoilers, here is a quick change/add list. 

[spoiler]
- A lot more weapons, which feel unique and varied
-Side Quest
-Talk able NPCs
-Combat Gauntlets
-Builds that you can customize your play style
-Bosses and Minibosses
[/spoiler]

Here are the Pros and Cons of the game 

[h1] Pros [/h1]

Music - Just as the first game, the music is fantastic, always masterfully made to fit the current environment. 

Combat - Combat was one of the biggest negatives from the first game, but now it is one of the biggest positives. There is no way to express it in words, it feels so fluid, and feels amazing

Enemy Types- There are now a lot more enemies to fight, which is a good thing when the combat feels good. If the previous game had around 7 types of enemies. This game has around 15, which is a big improvement. 

The World - Just as the first game, the new world is great. Each place feel even more varied, and has its unique twist to it. 

Bosses - The Bosses in the game are all very good. Some times, when you are fighting, its feels like an anime, the way you are dashing around. 

Story - A simple yet effective story that can make a grown man cry

[h1] Cons [/h1]

Certain Side Quests - There are some side quests, that are pretty boring. Whether its just a fetch quest to an NPC, or  grabbing an item for an NPC

Health/Energy System - To be clear, the health and mana [b] BARS [/b] themselves have not changed, just the way that you use them. 
        -To gain back your health, you are given a ability very early in the game, that gives you 3 health per 1 cell of energy use, which is very overpowered. In my opinion that caused me to not be careful because I can always just heal myself so quickly.  

        -To Get More maxed Health/Energy, its the same, however, instead of in the first game, if you only need one collectible to increase the respective bar, you need to find two items, because they are in halves this time. Not the biggest thing in the world but just a pet peeve. 

[h1] Ending Thoughts [/h1]

This game in my opinion is a lot better for the first game. If you liked the first game, or consider buying the games, I would highly recommend it.

I'd agree with most people that it is almost as good as Hollow Knight.  The graphics are extremely impressive.  The different environments are all colorful and easy on the eyes.  The game feels like it's breathing with life, the background and characters and enemies all have a fluidity in the animation.  The game is fun to play and gets you pretty addicted once you start.  I like how you can choose what weapons you'd like to play the game with.  You get a sword to use at the beginning, but you can choose to unequip it for any of the others (which you have to purchase from this monkey character).  I used the sword and hammer at the beginning without knowing much about which weapons would be good to purchase.  I found that fighting the bosses with melee was sorta difficult though.  A fully upgraded bow turned out to be my favorite in the end.  You can shoot up to five arrows and use a shard to increase fire speed and decimate pretty much anyone without much of an energy cost.  You'll spend most of the game jumping, double jumping dashing grappling in different ways over spiky pits or spiky walls.  None of the regular enemies proved too challenging, but they can be sorta an annoying distraction.  If you die in this game you have endless lives and they restart you close to where you died which is nice because if they took the dark souls approach this game would be brutal.  I think the main thing that sorta bothered me about this game is I found certain bosses to be extremely annoying.  It felt less predictable to fight them than other games.  The bosses give little clues to what attack is coming, but sometimes even when you know what they'll do you still can't avoid getting hit.  The last boss has an ending phase that's absolutely nuts and I couldn't imagine how anyone could make it through without dying at least once.  The first two phases aren't bad at all, but then it just goes crazy and you're grappling desperately while getting hit rapidly from different directions where if you're in one large area of the screen you can't possibly dodge.  Then you have to continue grappling and somehow get hits in and then go back to grappling and getting hit some more.  I found the best weapon for this last phase is the exploding spike because you can shoot from far away and deal great damage.  But you have to conserve your energy up to that point if you want to use it, otherwise you'll end up having to use melee in this phase.",1687709729,1687709729,True,1,0,0.518518567085266113,0,True,False,False

Just beat the game, 100% of all items collected. This one is a masterclass of production, though it's not without occasional flaws.

Combat is a HUGE upgrade from the original, and is satisfying on so many levels. From silvery slashes to thundering hammer blows that knock enemies flying, every aspect of combat is delightful. There is an abundance of ways to attack that suit a variety of playstyles, but I'll be blunt when I say that not all available forms of attack are particularly useful to me. To each his/her own, there's lots of stuff for people to enjoy here. 

Graphics and environments are hugely updated and well developed. Gorgeous coloring and lighting are abundant. Periodically, there will be something that looks a little lazy, such as the splash animation that happens when pink blobs shoot out of a slimy pit, but those moments are few and far between. 

The level design is GORGEOUS. There are many places that are easy to ""ooo"" and ""ahhh"" at. Nothing I've ever played looks like this game. Truly unique. 

Story is much more developed than the first. Though stereotypical and not perfect in its writing or execution (e.g. ""you're the hero that will save us""), it contains some beautiful cinematics and heartfelt scenes filled with deep emotion. The cinematics, like the graphics, are very unique in execution. 

The music, like the first, is SOOOOO GOOOD. Blind Forest moved me deeply with the music at the opening screen, and this game continues that motif. I bought the OST of the first one, and I'm planning on buying this one, too. There is a fair amount of ""recycled"" themes, as is pretty normal for sequels, but the composer came back with some new ideas on how to freshen up the themes while adding entirely new songs that fit the field and atmosphere perfectly. Ori wouldn't be Ori without the music. 

Like the first, much of the fun comes from traversal of the environment. You'll unlock lots of abilities that will allow you to move around your environment with ease. What starts out as highly cumbersome to get through becomes a breeze. Though you'll backtrack a lot to get the items you missed the first time, it is genuinely a delight to get around the environment, especially once you unlock the final ability that makes all the hard to get places so much more fun to get to. Ori's got some hardcore parkour skills. 

This game is a massive improvement over Blind Forest, with the devs taking a hard look at many of the things that made the first a bit of a chore on occasion and fleshing them out to the point of approaching perfection. The game is short, though a fair bit longer than the first - getting all items and unlockables takes around 15 hours. Despite this, the game ends right on time where the various mechanics would otherwise start to get really boring without some really intense changes. 


All in all, I cannot recommend this game enough. It's very close to being a masterpiece. Flaws and all, there is nothing in this game that is not worth the time and enjoyment.",1685851846,1687235147,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Ori and the Blind Forest was already a master piece. Nevertheless, the sequel really surpassed its predecessor.
Everything about this game is right.
The music might be one of the biggest accomplishments of Moon Studios.
The story is superb, although very sad. 
The levels and environments are gorgeous.
The playability is very smooth and responsive.
The way the developers expanded the Ori's abilities is very well done.

In summary, if you are thinking if you should buy this game or not, I believe that if you liked the first, you are going to love the second, so just get it, enjoy it, and, maybe, cry a little.

Ori and the will of the wisps is a master piece.

The only thing that might have caused me a little conflict, is the localisation part in LATAM.
Now, I have to admit that I did not play the game in Spanish, I was just curious about the localisation part, so I set the game to Spanish after I finished it. I just wanted to check a few strings here and there.
In my opinion, some words, or even sentences were not translated to reflect the real or full potential of the story, therefore, sometimes these little issues watered down an already extremely good story.
Nevertheless, these issues, if they are indeed issues, are/ could be easily fixed.

- More platforming mechanics, all of them engaging and well executed
- More developed combat system with several different weapons and proper boss fights.
- Character progression with swappable perks, so that you can adapt to different situations.
- The world is populated with NPCs and a good number of side activities so it is more dense with content than the predecessor.

So yeah, what was already a great game here is bigger and tastier. But not without drawbacks. Combat and progression of course are now a bit deeper and give more agenda to the player, but there is rarely an incentive to try a different weapon or a perk set.

The story is perfectly written with the right amount of drive to keep you playing the game trying to discover how it will end. The ending is beautiful and the journey along the game is very interesting with a lot of npc characters that are unique and entertaining. 
The game play is highly entertaining with your power scaling pretty significantly along the game. You will unlock a shit load of new skills and they are all useful and fun to use. Some skills are part of the main story and some skills are upgradable skills that are not necessary to complete the game but they are fun still. *the last skill you upgrade as a part of the main story is incredible fun*
The platforming is one of the best out there, you can't get a lot better than that. I love how the platforming feels as it keeps you entertained and engaged. The gameplay and the movements are very smooth and satisfying.
The combat is not necessarily the most important part of the game, yet the boss fights are really fun with different bosses.
The art style is very artistic, this stylized art is visually appealing and the music will give you eargasm and induce all kinds of emotions within you as you play the different parts of the game.
The map is great with a metroidvania that includes a lot of hidden places for completionists who like to collect every possible nugget in the game. you can always comeback to access hidden places that will be inaccessible for you on your first encounter.
It took me more than it should to complete the game because I've gotten stuck and went running around looking for solution more than I would like to admit. Yet the solutions were pretty easy when I have finally figured them out.

Presentation isn't one of those faults. The game is a treat for the eyes in every sense, & if you're fortunate enough to own an OLED screen, this is absolutely the game you need to play to show it off. The incredibly detailed yet clean presentation allows for visuals that pop beautifully while sitting in the overall scene well. The OST also hits the mark, as does the story, which ties in beautifully to the Blind Forest.

The gameplay is brilliant, though there's definitely some inconsistency when it comes to difficulty. There's nothing here that'll cause much of a headache if you're a regular player of such games, but the increase in gameplay complexity compared to BF paired with a few oddly tuned boss fights make for an experience which can be a bit inconsistent at times.

Overall though, it's a spectacular sequel to a stunning game. A treat for your senses with wonderfully tight gameplay & a charming story that compliments Blind Forest perfectly.",1686673672,1686673672,True,11,0,0.631059050559997559,0,True,False,False

The Soundtrack is phenomenal. I never get annoyed of hearing it. Will likely listen to the soundtrack while I work.
The world is beautiful. The art style no different than the first game, but wildly expanded upon.
The combat is... well its intentionally a little lackluster here and there. More on that below.
The movement is super nice. It feels really good and crisp. You have so many ways to traverse and I love it.
The story compelling if you're willing to listen. Even then, it's pretty visual so it's hard to miss whats going on unless you skip the cutscenes. I almost teared up at the end.

On combat:
The Ori Franchise is part of the metroidvania genre, but it takes a scenic route approach. It's beautiful and easy. Even when made hard, it's significantly easier than other games. Because of this, the combat is not as moment to moment intense and sharp. If you're expecting fluid and amazing combat from Hollow Knight, you will most definitely not get it here. It is however smooth. The movement is great and makes up for the lacking combat. Befitting of the story and atmosphere, you don't have to fight everything, you can smoothly move (schmove) around them. And it feels really good.

I really love how mechanics gradually adds up and makes controlling gradually more tricky. I felt fiddling with controls and abilities mid-fight was quite healthily challenging and well-designed.

The spirit shard system is good too, even though I normally end up using the same ones. The bosses are fun and challenging and so are the escape sequences. I also really like how partway through the game you have four areas to go to at the same time, non-linearity is great imo. The music is incredible as well.

The only thing that could've been better is the map layout.

You play as Ori, a spirit of the forest and start out trying to rescue one of your friends. You meet a variety of denizens of the forest while learning new combat and travel abilities. This is the sequel to Ori and the Blind Forest.

Gameplay - 4/5. The platforming is good, but I'm docking a point for some of the sand burrowing as tight turns I found incredibly difficult to pull off with the controls. If you like fast paced platforming, this game is for you. Normal adventure have you hopping from place to place, unlocking secrets and removing obstacles to get further and further, all while gathering new abilities and resources. Boss battles are a combination of avoidance where you have a 'run the gauntlet' type of chase either from the boss or from a natural disaster (or both) and then another part where you are battling the bosses with your combat abilities. 
Graphics - I've found Ori's art style to be enchanting and the designers are able to tell a story and make you feel emotions with just the graphics and the creatures that inhabit the world. While this isn't a graphically intense game for your rig, I enjoyed all the spectacle. 5/5.
Music - haunting light melodies run throughout the game offset by oppressive chase music when called for. they're appropriate for the situations and pleasant on the ears but I didn't find any of them sticking out to me and eventually listened to iTunes instead. 3/5.
Story - This is a very light 'story' to the game but what they do deliver did have me get emotional and root for the characters. My only issue with the story was the very ending, [spoiler] with one character, the main boss, really having a disservice in its ending. They gave the boss' backstory and then just left them in their poor existence. I would have liked some redemption and acceptance after the life they lived, but I just like happy endings. [/spoiler] A 4/5 from me.
Fun factor - I did find a few frustrations in the game, there were a few points that the solution to opening the next area eluded me and I had to look up the solutions but I'm not the best at puzzles. The actual gameplay is fun and I enjoyed the game but won't be replaying it any time soon. 4/5.

The next day I tried to play again and all of my buttons are randomly assigned to the point that the game is unplayable. It only affects this game. Tried to use the steam controller override thing and the game literally won't launch now. Microsoft is scum. Edit- so the game will launch about one out of three times when using the steam controller override. Makes the game playable, but proves that Microsoft is an evil anti-consumer cesspool. 

Besides the inexcusable technical issues, the game is garbage compared to the first. They have saturated the game with a poor-man's version of Hollow Knight's combat and it ruins the game for me. Ori and the blind forest is one of my all time favorite games. I would give it a 10/10. Hollow Knight was good, I would give it an 8/10. This bastardized version of the two is utter crap. 2/10. Great Music. Pretty graphics that are extremely distracting during the constant combat. Awful combat that ruins the pace and flow of the excellent platforming mechanics. The platforming level design is an obvious step down from the first game, but they also obviously didn't care about that anymore, because ""hey Hollow Knight got more attention than Ori 1 so let's just completely copy that.""

The most enjoyable parts of the game were the chase scenes, which were full-engagement run & react nail biters.

For me, the least enjoyable were the actual race challenges, because without the drama of the chase, the repeated attempts to perfectly execute the skills/movements became repetitive and frustrating. But then you finally get it and feel amazing sense of accomplishment. I only retried a race once and /shudder/.

The combat with the minor mobs was generally pretty fun, and the environmental gameplay was interestingly challenging (pre- and post-""the getting of the skill that makes this part easy"").

When the combat was physics-intensive, especially the very last battle, it really shines, but is unforgiving.

It made for a frustrating experience in those situations.

Otherwise I've seen this game compared to Hollow Knight and while they are very similar on the surface I would not say if you loved one you'll love the other. HK is a one difficulty game that is filled to the brim with varying bosses you learn to overcome with some complicated platforming while Ori is really giving you a great and beautiful looking story with some bosses. The platforming is more extreme in Ori, but the way the game is set up is not anywhere near as punishing as HK is. Granted you can play Ori at a higher difficulty to get a true souls-like experience, but just playing through on Normal is nothing excessively difficult.

Both are great games in their own right; if you want a very difficult and unforgiving game that forces you to adapt or die play HK; if you want a game that is pretty with a straightforward story and a stellar soundtrack play Ori, and kick up the difficulty if you are into that.",1684544118,1684544118,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It also doesn't suffer from escape scenes that require almost exact movements. They are still hard, but not as bad as the first game. Still I feel more relief when they are over than accomplishment. Like the first game you still pretty much need a good youtube walkthru FightinCowboy has to get thru some stuff. And it can be hard to know where to go next. You can travel yourself into a dead end that can't get thru until get some more abilities later and have to get back out. Luckily after a bit you can at least warp out. Plus just like the other game after I have gotten most of the abilities and can do so much more, you feel different about the game then when traversing thru it at first. But then it can be a let down cause you have all this power and nothing left to do but collect stuff you couldn't earlier. To bad after beat the game can't start a new game with all the abilities you have.  So while it is lots of fun, it doesn't have repeatability.

From the platforming, they added more movement, and make it a bit forgiving. 
The combat is even more complex with more abilities. They added like slots which we can choose 3 ability to use and we can change it anytime we want without worry the enemy will interrupt us.  
The soundtrack is even better.
The graphic and the world is absolutely gorgeous, beatiful, and many times i stopped for a moment and appreciate how beatiful the world is.
The story is kinda similar to the first game, only with different enemies and twist.
They also added boss fight and side quest. The sidequest is just okay, not really exciting, but also not that bad.
For the boss fight i may have some mixed feeling, sometimes its not clear where you have to hit, and where you get hit from the bosses. This also make zero death achievement even harder. 

In the end, I love everything about this game and i'm so proud to experience one of the greatest game i've ever play. Highly recommended, and its so much better comparing to some of new platforming games.

Didn't think much of it at the time, but I thought it would be a nice gift for her. I remember seeing her playing it from time to time, the message indicating that she'd started playing it popping up on the corner of my screen. There was always a certain small pride in seeing that, because to me it meant that she was enjoying my gift.
Last September she committed suicide.

After everything had more or less settled down from that, I sat down and booted up her computer. All that was on there was Chrome, Steam, Word, and a few games. One of them, of course, was Core keeper.
She had played this game to pieces, clocking over 170 hours and owning practically everything the game had to offer. She had used every square inch to its maximum potential, and was making ridiculous amounts of loot. It was only then did I see just how much she loved my present. No other game she played quite captured her affection as much as this one. None of her friends really knew about it, however; it seems like she preferred to keep it to herself. Like it was her own little bit of heaven she could turn to whenever she wanted.

And because of that, I can't help but smile whenever I play this game.

I cannot recommend it enough; every bit of hard work the developer put into this masterpiece shows in every single aspect. The music is catchy and memorable (I'll often find myself humming certain tunes from it), the world feels lived-in and natural, and the gameplay is incredibly laid back and enjoyable.

[b]Ori and the Will of the Wisps is one of the greatest platformers of all time![/b]

There are no shortage of fantastic 2D metroidvania platformers on Steam, such as Hollow Knight, Shovel Knight, Dead Cells, Guacamelee and The Messenger and despite this great pantheon of champions, I would dare say that Ori and the Will of the Wisps belongs at the very top! 

It is the only game out of all the aformentioned games that I have 100%'ed. It is a drastic improvement from the first game (Ori and the Blind Forrest) and improves on literally every single aspect, except for the music, which is just as good in the first game. The music in this game is astounding and you owe it to yourself and to Gareth Coker to purchase the soundtrack! The gameplay is wildly improved. I was not a big fan of the combat in the first game, and thankfully it has been completely overhauled, with a greater variety of abilities that all feel truly transformative and impactful, along with shards you can equip to boost your abilities even further. They have also made it so you can heal by holding down ""B"" if you're on controller, much like Hollow Knight which is a great feature that I am happy is in this game! Boss fights are exhilarating and intense, with once again, an incredible musical accompaniment by Gareth Coker. 

Visually the game is sharper, more colorful, more fluent in animation and just a resplendent treat for the eyes all the way through. With a big map to explore, there is plenty of beauty to be found. Speaking of beauty, the story is surprisingly powerful and sweet, with a great ending and tradeoff, and with a beautiful and heartwrenching musical score by Gareth Coker! (Yes, I am mentioning his name ad libitum in this review, because the man's name deserves to be spoken for his incredbible work!). 

[h1][b]Final Verdict 10/10[/b][/h1]

[b]The game borrows ideas from other great games of the same genre, and despite this, Ori holds its own identity and heart just as those that came before it. It is the pinacle of 2D metroidvania platformers right now, with every aspect being done meticulously and passionately! Well polished and an unforgetable time guaranteed![/b]",1684059595,1684059811,True,9,0,0.57961195707321167,0,True,False,False

Will of the Wisps fixes every minor grievance I had with the first game and improved in nearly every area where it was already good. The only consistent thing I could complain about is a lack of buttons and fingers to hit them on keyboard, but I have a feeling the controller experience is better (though the game is plenty doable on keyboard and mouse, but you might struggle at points without those special extra mouse buttons on the side)

Excellent game. Excellent ending.

As I stated in my review to ""Ori and the Blind Forest"", the game roughly resembles ""Hollow Knight"" while being way easier. The sequel, ""Ori and the Will of the Wisps"", has even more similarities to the ""Hollow Knight"" - the way one unlocks abilities, the way one can buy maps for different locations, etc. And yet, it's less challenging while still being not too easy - which, in my case, is a huge plus.

The story is nice and touching, the graphics are beautiful, and the whole feeling of exploring the vast world and fighting off enemies keeps one engaged till the end. Different zones require different mechanics to pass, some parts are quite frustrating the first time around, but in the end everything is manageable. Even the few boss fights hardly require more than a few tries - again, a huge plus for someone who isn't a masochistic Dark Souls fan.

As you navigate through the lush environments, you'll encounter challenging obstacles and epic boss battles. But fear not, Ori has a range of abilities at their disposal, from double jumps to spirit blasts, to help you on your quest.

What really sets Ori and the Will of the Wisps apart is its heartwarming story and unforgettable characters. You'll meet a cast of creatures, each with their own unique personality, and follow their struggles and triumphs.

And let's not forget about the game's stunning art and music, which work together to create a truly immersive experience.

Location design: All location are unique
Plot: It looks simple, but it doesn't get worse for a moment, it can make you worry and maybe even cry 
Gameplay: Much better, there are old and new mechanics and that's awesome. I guess the idea for map and amulets was taken from another great game (Hollow Knight) and it suits well
Music: A masterpiece, every stage you pass is accompanied by music, battles and escapes - heroic music, each location contains its own soothing mood, sad moments from the plot mixed with music, give a storm of emotions

The game demonstrates that evil is not born, but comes at the moment when someone tries to do justice due to a loss, as a result of which everyone suffers. Also it shows that: you can't always help everyone, there won't always be a happy ending, and concessions can always change everything. PS: Poor Shriek, she doesn't deserve her fate..

Platforming is smooth but some platforming stages are too unforgiving. It's like wanting to throw your controller kind of frustrating.

Bosses are there but not that memorable. Chase sequences are also unforgiving and lacks checkpoints. One in particular is too lengthy that I'm relieved that it's finally over.

The story is serviceable as long as it gives you the excuse to chase some McGuffin.

I'm glad that I bought this on a deep deep sale otherwise the game length and my mixed feelings about this game will make me regret my purchase. I just had to finish the game so that I can finally uninstall this game with no regrets and is most likely not going to replay.

From the moment I started playing, I was completely swept away by the beauty and wonder of the game's art and music.
The story of Ori and his quest to save his loved ones is both heart-wrenching and inspiring. The game takes you on a rollercoaster ride of emotions, from joy and wonder to heartache and sadness.
But despite the emotional weight of the story, the game is also incredibly fun to play. While many platformer games rely solely on combat, making the game hard by throwing overpowered bosses, Ori games has always focused on the movement mechanics being challenging as well while also not being completely unfair. And the game's many side-quests, hidden areas, spirit trials, etc. kept me exploring every nook and cranny of the world well past the actual story. 
But what really sets ""Ori and the Will of the Wisps"" apart is the way it makes you feel. The game's themes of love, loss, and perseverance are woven into every aspect of the game, its ""painting coming to life"" like visuals and gorgeous music, to the characters and their struggles.
Overall, a truly remarkable game that touched me in ways that few games ever have. It is a testament to the power of video games to tell deeply emotional and impactful stories, and it is an experience that I will never forget. If you're a fan of platformers, or just looking for a game that will move you to tears, I cannot recommend it highly enough.

The first game stunned me with its beautiful art and soundtrack, this game stunned me with its game mechanics. I noticed that the first game had excellent movement, but combat was really lacking - mostly just spamming X and jump-down-smash. Moon Studios looked at the first game and went ""but what if we made Ori have a sword made of light"" and holy crap does it feel satisfying. The boss fights take full advantage of Ori's dexterity. If you just learned a new move, you best know you're going to be using it in the next fight.

Also, the first game's story rips your heart out, and then pieces it back together and gives it back to you all happy and glowing.

This game was alright but I think I have had my fill in the 14 or so hours I actually played this for and I have no desire to play the first one right now. The story is not good and will not make you cry despite what you might have heard. It is very shallow and takes itself way too seriously. Unlike Hollow Knight, the world lacks depth and cohesion and feels designed solely for the player to mess around in. The game is beautiful but the visuals are so overwhelming and Ori is so tiny sometimes you cannot see your character and they die. I died during an escape sequence and a boss fight because the particle effects and cinematic camera turned my character into a literal dot - a white dot on a snowy incline. 

The core gameplay is pretty fun. The combat with the sword is satisfying but the combat abilities are all pretty useless. Why set an enemy on fire when just spamming attack with the sword does the trick? Even the combat shrines where you do combat trials for ability slots never has more than 4 enemies on screen. Ori's sword can easily stagger every enemy except the ones with shields who make you switch to your hammer for 3 seconds. The bow does no damage and fire, shuriken etc are just not as satisfying as the basic sword. All these abilities feel like they were added in because a committee forced the developers to.

 Ori is not a challenging or frustrating game. The game autosaves every minute and so there is no tension at all. You literally cannot lose progress but you might die a lot during some of the platforming sections because the controls and Ori are both very floaty. 

The Moki are adorable though. Easily the most likeable characters in the game. A lot of the side quests are engaging and well thought out and I actually wanted to complete them, which is rare. Overall, this is a solid 7/10.

I've been playing a lot of platformers recently and none of them have been as perfect as this one. It could be a little longer but there's so many collectibles it doesn't matter. I'm not kidding when I say this is the perfect game. I won't have as many hours in it as some of my others because it isn't very long but I'll 100% it which I don't do for most games and it has good replayability. I really don't think I'll play a game better than it for a long while. I got it on sale for $6 but it's worth the $30. I try to only buy games that will have long play times but this game is so good that you don't need that. I played the blind forest and it was good but wow, this is perfect.

This has to be one of my favourite games of all time. An incredibly beautiful, emotional story that had me in tears a couple of times. From a great soundtrack to some seriously interesting levels, I couldn't have asked for a better game to play. If you're looking for something with great story, I highly recommend.

The game itself feels great to play, with plenty of challenges available for someone to go through. I'll admit that there were two occasions I used a short walkthrough due to the fact I didn't find something clear enough or I was completely clueless as to what to do, but it could've possibly been my own fault and the instructions were something I'd missed. It's taken me 16 hours in total to complete the game, however you can easily get double that game time if you want to 100% every area.

PLEASE play this game if you get the chance, and I'm positive you won't regret it

The combat is miles better than in the original. Now it takes some actual strategy; you can't just mash the attack button and call it a day. There are a lot of different attacks to try out and the addition of shards makes it possible to customise your playstyle. A few of the bosses need a bit of tweaking though - the hitboxes can be a bit unreliable.
There's NPCs now! And quests, too! That was the part of this game that surprised me the most, to be honest. I love each and every one of these new characters - they make the world of this game feel that much more alive.
The graphics and music got even better than they were in the first Ori - if that's even possible. If playing the Blind Forest felt like running through a painting, playing Will of the Wisps makes you feel truly submerged in it.
The difficulty system got improved as well. Now you can actually feel the difference between Easy and Hard, unlike in the first game.

TLDR: Overall, it feels like the devs really listened to the criticism they got on the first Ori and improved pretty much every aspect of it. It's like the first game, but even better!",1682553840,1682553840,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

You practically never get to use the tools at your disposal, which, may I remind you are EXTREMELY fun and satisfying, because the camera is just off doing its own thing.

Perfectly balanced game design, and I do not use the terms lightly. First game in quite a while where I actually got all the side quests done. They make sense, aren't a boring grind, can be mostly completed naturally over the course of the game, and what little secrets there are, they can be uncovered with just enough healthy reasoning and without having to go through a slough in order to try different things out.

There are NPCs that make the world feel more alive and grounded. Ori can talk to them and they will make Ori feel relevant, which eliminates a pet peeve of mine with these sorts of games: the main character often feels like they barely exist to what few other characters are encountered along the way, and their accomplishments don't really affect dialogue or NPC stance towards the player character.

They took all aspects from Blind Forest and made them 2x better plus added much more. There are a lot of elements borrowed from Hollow Knight in this one but made to work better for Ori
Combat in Will of the Wisps is much better with Ori having access to a variety of weaponry that can be used for addicting combo set ups. New and returning passive abilities remain in the game allowing different paths of non linear exploration. Map scale has also tremendously increased in size with all area having its own unique thematic/palette to it which makes Blind Forest look bland in comparison. The art direction in these level designs are almost too good you'll end up staying in an area much longer than you should just to admire it. All the music flows incredibly well with the pacing and scenes throughout the game Gareth Coker managed to create some of the most beautiful symphonies you will hear in a game. The story :cri
This is a must play if you've beaten the first one or just a fan of metroidvanias in general. Blind forest was a near perfect game but Will of the Wisps is a masterpiece in its genre and deserves all the praise it has received.

I played Ori and the blind forest years ago and was surprised by the game! It was touching, had great visuals and a love for detail! Just started playing Will of the Wisps now and finished the first section with the windmill! Absolutely brilliant gameplay ideas!

It feels like an Ori game, the changes for combat are smooth and allow for different styles of fighting. The 3D elements of the game are well made! The story is touching again! 

The first 15 minutes have a lot of story to tell, which might deter new players, so I suggest you play the first 30 mins/1h in one go. You wont regret it!

Wow, what a beautiful game..! Stunning visuals, beautiful music....
And the game itself is incredibly fun, as with the first, I am addicted to it and want to play it every day (every hour preferable ha ha). that said, I personally think I liked the first one a tiny bit better. Yes the visuals are even more beautiful here, and they added extra even more interesting gameplay and boss battles. But they made the upgrade system more complex and they limited it as well, where you can only carry a few upgrades at the time, and even that number you have to upgrade at a slow pace. On top of that; you cannot change the difficulty once you have started playing.
This poses a bit of an issues because, as with the first game, in the beginning, without having any upgrades, the game is hard, and can be very frustrating.

[h3]Story[/h3]

The game is a sequel to Ori and the Blind Forest, and follows the story of the titular character, a guardian spirit named Ori, and their journey to save their friend Ku, a young owl, and the forest of Niwen.

The game takes place shortly after the events of the first game, and begins with Ori and their adoptive family, Naru and Gumo, raising a baby owl named Ku. During a flight,  become separated, and Ori embarks on a quest to locate their friend. Along the way, Ori meets new friends and allies, and discovers that there is a dark force threatening the forest of Niwen, which must be stopped at all costs.

The story of Ori and the Will of the Wisps is one of friendship, loss, and sacrifice, and is filled with emotional moments and impactful storytelling. The game's narrative is masterfully crafted, and is brought to life through stunning visuals and a beautiful soundtrack.

[h3]Gameplay[/h3]

The game offers an exceptional gameplay experience that is both challenging and satisfying. The platforming mechanics are smooth and precise, allowing for precise movements and acrobatics. The game's combat is equally impressive, with a variety of abilities and upgrades that keep the gameplay fresh and engaging.

Moreover, the game's level design is worth commending. Each area of the game feels unique and distinct, with its own set of challenges and obstacles to overcome. The game's bosses are also well-designed and offer a satisfying challenge to players.

For more information, please refer to the list of my in-game and Steam Deck settings provided below. With a single charge, I was able to play for around 6 hours. It is worth noting that I did not encounter any stuttering or audio synchronization problems, and the game maintained a stable 40 frames per second, with the CPU and GPU temperatures remaining below 60 degrees Celsius.

[h1]Final Thoughts[/h1]

Ori and the Will of the Wisps is an exceptional game that offers an unforgettable gaming experience. I was able to complete the game without any issues on the normal difficulty level in roughly 17 hours. As someone who played the first game, Ori and the Blind Forest, I can truly appreciate the effort put into the sequel, Ori and the Will of the Wisps. I would suggest playing the first game before moving on to this one.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2962728737

In terms of pricing, the game's cost of ‚Ç¨29.99 is more than justified. However, if you're willing to wait, you can purchase the game at a discounted price of up to 75% off during one of Steam's major sales.

Ori 2 seems to have been concocted entirely by going the complete opposite way of it's debut title trying to be the worst it can and succeeding at it. 
This feels like it was made by taking out all the discarded and rejected ideas that must've come up during the first game, and then taken out of the garbage bin just for milking's sake - and honoring the game's equivalent of a unbelievably bad, unwanted movie sequel.

I never understood this generation's fetichism for astoundingly, ridiculously difficult games, and admittedly, they're not my style. Have not been for long. Permadeaths, timed runs.. what's the point? Prove what? To who? Maybe it's just my reflexes slowing down. Maybe I'm just at that age where such things are just not enticing and of importance anymore.
The game is - unsurprisingly and again - absolutely gorgeous (albeit I can point a few places in the map where the information on screen is just a lot to take in). The music is, to say the least - incredibly moving and even meditative at certain places.
The thing is, contrarily to The Blind Forest, wich had a fair design, everything in TWotW is completely fabricated to screw you over in the hardest way possible. Now, this may sound obvious, but in The Blind Forest, as tough as it could get, there were 'rules' in place, wich the game never broke, and patterns, wich once figured out, felt absolutely logical, and rewarding while achieving progress.
From a certain point on, TWotW just feels like it's overwhelmingly winging everything it can at you. Claustrophobically so. It becomes a big game of trial and error, without any intuitive trait to it. While the game is winging everything at you, then again you're having to be winging it right back to figure out what the game wants from you, wich becomes tremendously tiresome and confusing. I had a blast the first few hours. The further you go, the poorer the level design , and how much it becomes an unintuitive mess. A big game of guessing, horrible mechanics, trial and error. 
An absolute chore, which made me keep thinking it couldn't finish and be over fast enough, to uninstall, and never touch again.

the spells/skills were really fun, i really personally like the spear and the hammer and having a bash skill. its really a step up from Ori 1. Not much more to say, just wish they would tell which skills would use energy initially but not really a problem.

It's a perfect sequel! Does everything equally good or better then the first one with some additional fun things to do on the side ( few ""races"" and side quests, enough to keep u busy not 2 much to make u bored!)

+ Still super fun
+ Nice story
- Obv predictable story part
+ Nice/interesting ending (won't say more to avoid spoilers)
+ Greatly improved combat vs the previous game
+ Old and new power ups/skills
+ Secrets
+ Really nice map
+ Great boss fights
- I expected to have 1 more great boss fight as I had a feeling that I never full ""beat"" that boss
+ Game length is nice, would have liked it if it was longer as it does leave u wanting more, but its not short (been a while since I played the blind forest but I would say more or less the same length)
- In order to get the achiv to get all shards/full upgrade them you need to farm the ""light"" which can be kinda boring after u beat the game (I had my fun with the game, explored all areas and had almost everything collected before the final boss and still had 2 go back and farm after beating the game to get those upgrades for the achiv)

Ps: Achivs are not bugged, for those that don't pop just save, exit and load/continue on the same save file (as soon as you start loading the achiv will pop) -> happened to me for multiple ""collectibles"" achivs (get all energy shards, 100% all maps and get all shards and upgrades)

Now, being serious, this game is awesome, I love it. I'll tell u my experience. When I was on december, it was my birthday, and I said ""Ugh, what a boring day, I should play some game"" and I saw Ori and the Blind Forest on Steam. But I didn't hace money(I still don't have money, help, I hate Argentina wtf"", and instead I downloaded it and played it thanks to google. It was one of the most beautiful games that I've ver seen artistically, and I played the game some good hours. In my birthday, there was a party(Even with the Covid-19 thing) with my school friends, but I hate parties, so I was at home that day. And while everyone was drunk and there were some people fighting in the party, I was having my best time in my life, in the house, trying to escape from the water in the Ginso Tree, I died more than 100 times right there, but I didn't give up, I loved that moment so much, every time I hear that music, I feel very happy. And best of all, with that party that I didn't go, absolutely every school friend that I have in that time had the Covid-19, bc someone went to the party with Covid. And my school was in the news for some weeks, and thanks to that, my friends that had to study to pass the exams for the people who didn't study, they couldn't do it bc everyone was having Covid-19, except me, thanks to Ori and the Blind Forest, I didn't have Covid lmao(I will pay for the game as Soon as I have money, I promise). Best of all, is that I bought my first game on Steam with money, and guess what? This game was my first game I have bought on this plataform, and I don't regret it. So, remember y'all. Do not download games by the internet, just buy the game. And, if you see a game that looks different from what you usually play, give it an opportunity, it will always give u another experience.

The only weird thing is that I am furry now thanks to this game... I think so. So... You know, everything has it's good and bad things, I guess.",1680813687,1680813687,True,1,1,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

Gameplay is magnificent, the visuals are stunning, the story is emotional and heartfelt; it literally has it all! In my opinion, it is the most complete gameplay experience that I've ever had. 

This all may sound hyperbolic to most people, and I'll admit, these claims are very extreme. But I would not state my opinions this way if I didn't believe them. Let me break down the reasons why I love this game so much a bit further. I will note that this review is mostly spoiler free, so if you want to experience the game yourself--which I obviously highly recommend--you should still be able to read this review to get a good picture for what you would be getting into. 

Gameplay Design: The gameplay is that of any typical 2D metroidvania title. You explore a large world and come across upgrades and discover secrets along the way to make traversal easier throughout the game. It also encourages you to backtrack to old areas by sprinkling in hints of knowledge of where certain items are so you can return later with the appropriate upgrade. This also allows more skilled players a chance to test their skills and try and get certain items faster if they are creative enough with their current repertoire. The way you upgrade Ori is also wildly fun and flexible. In a respectful nod to the medtroidvania juggernaut ""Hollow Knight,"" ""Ori and the Will of the Wisps"" adopts a similar upgrade system to the ""charms"" in Hollow Knight with the ""shard"" system. Hidden throughout the map are different shards you can equip to made your gameplay experience more dynamic, and you can equip or unequip shards at any time you want. It is a system that is extremely fun to play with to fit whatever situation you find yourself in, and the shards are fun to find too!

Combat System: One of the major criticisms of this games predecessor, ""Ori and the Blind Forest,"" was that the combat was very limited, and that there were no boss fights. This aspect of the game has been markedly improved. There are a variety of combat options for Ori to choose from in this game, and they all have their own unique advantages and disadvantages in certain situations. You can choose up to three at a time to have on your face buttons, and this gives combat a much larger part of the experience this time around. Plus, the game also has multiple dynamic boss fights that will put your skills to the test! 

Platforming: On the other hand, one of the aspects of gameplay that the predecessor was most famous for was the platforming sections, as well as some unique movement abilities. I am pleased to say that this game has all of these elements as well! The platforming is probably even better than in its predecessor, with more variety of ways to move Ori around throughout the map. Needless to say, it is even more fun to move around as Ori in this game.

Map Design: The game flows seamlessly, and the reason that is the case is because of the masterful map design. The way the map is laid out makes going from one area to the next intuitive. Sometimes the game feels linear, only for you to realize that its just because the map is designed in a way that gently pushes you in a specific direction using visual cues. Its actually quite clever. The areas all fit together in a way that makes sense, and this game actually does something that is very difficult; it fits a wide range of different environments in relative proximity to each other with it actually making sense in the world!

Story: No story spoilers here, but just know that the if you played the first Ori game, that the story will probably move you just as much, if not even more than that game. It is definitely something that should be experiences at least once. 

Art Direction: The Ori series has always been well known for its gorgeous visuals. This game uses a combination of hand painted backgrounds with 3D character models that works immaculately. The game is masterful at using both the foreground and background to its advantage, with both characters and enemies jumping out of the foreground into the playable plane, which makes the game more immersive. The animations for the characters are fluid, with Ori in particular being a joy to watch; the way he jumps, the way he runs, the way he climbs, all the say down to the small details like Ori doing a handstand on top of a pole. This all makes the game that much more endearing to experience.

Sound: I will say this right now; this OST is my favorite of any video game I've played. I have a moderate music background, so I'm particular about my music. This OST makes fantastic uses of leitmotifs to let you musically understand what's going on in the game at that moment. At the same time, it uses a vareity of melody modulation and mode mixture to give a bit of spice to certain tracks. Not to mention that every area does have a unique sound of its own, and every cinematic moment in the story is enhanced by the OST to an insane degree. The sound design is also superb, with certain actions feeling extremely powerful and satisfying. There are also the little details like the little grunts Ori makes while swinging weapons, to gasps when he emerges from water.  

Technical Performance: Heavy criticism was given to this game upon launch for its many technical hiccups, and rightfully so. People have complained of stuttering, screen tearing, frame rate drops glitches where characters disappear, music glitches, to not even saving achievements. That being said, I want to emphasize that if that is your main reason for not getting this game, that these issues are (for the most part) resolved. There have been multiple patches to the game, and the developers have ironed out ALL of these issues. In my experience playing the game, I haven't experienced a SINGLE ONE of these issues. The game flowed seamlessly, no stuttering, minimal load times, and runs at a butter smooth FPS (mine was not capped so ran at 200+ FPS), all in 4K resolution. As far as technical performance, this game really doesn't have any issues, at least with my experience.  

Conclusions: Overall, this game as a lot of love put into it. You can tell the developers took their time with this game and came out with the best product that they could produce! This game is an absolute masterpiece, and is the new gold standard in which future metroidvania titles should be compared to.",1680622648,1680630194,True,41,0,0.814596831798553467,0,True,False,False

The visuals, while already great in the previous game, were improved even more and again offer a stunning experience from start to finish. One of my gripes with Ori and the Blind Forest was the stale combat system which has been completely revamped and greatly improved in this game. Combat in general has subsequently become a more important aspect, which some people may like or dislike. 

The quality of the story and soundtrack rivals the levels of the first game, which is an impressive feat in itself. It also brought some QoL changes that I greatly missed in the first game like quicktravel. From a gameplay perspective, a lot of new and fun mechanics were added to the different level designs. The shard system, which enables you to change your skillset on the fly, brought some great variety on how you wanted to play Ori throughout the game.

That being said, the escape sequences weren't as good as in the prequel and I thought that some of the boss fights weren't designed that well from a boss mechanic standpoint. Most of the bosses had very obvious and repeating attack patterns, which were easily abusable and made some of the fights a bit too simple for my personal liking.

All in all, I still think Will of the Wisps is the better game overall, which ‚Äî considering what I thought of the first game ‚Äî is praise of the highest magnitude.",1680604288,1680619764,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Ingredients:
1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:
1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes.

""Ori and the Blind Forest is an interesting case. In a vacuum, the game is very entertaining. Great art style, beautiful music, fun level-design. 
But Ori and the Will of the Wisps exists. Because of how much better Ori 2 is, I find it hard to recommend Ori 1. Ori 1 has some great features, but also some annoying parts of gameplay and an overall quick story makes the game forgettable in comparison. 
If you want about 5-10 hours of entertainment, Ori and the Blind Forest ain't bad at all, but if you want to spend more time (and have higher replay value), just go for Ori and the Will of the Wisps; it does everything Ori 1 does but better, fixes major issues, and adds a lot more interesting mechanics and gameplay.""

Gameplay feels great, both platforming and combat, but between the two the platforming has a better gameplay feel.  I could sit back and just go from screen to screen over and over again flinging myself around like a monkey in a jungle and have a blast.   

Here are a few nitpicks I need to get off my chest though because this is not a perfect game, although still very good and recommended.  

The plot was mediocre and I simply did not care about the NPC they wanted me to care about.  All the characters talking like trombones didn't help any and the writing (sense there's no dialogue) is formulaic to the core.  

Having obviously Hollow Knight inspired charms is nice, but they are not balanced against each other very well.  For example I never saw the need to take off my triple jump because it made things so much easier then using any other charm would.  Some you will never use, some you will always use, that's probably not good design.  

The downside to the beautiful art is there is very little consistency in the designs of the environmental hazards so you hit spikes all the time because they don't always look like spikes, you will also get hit by enemies and hazards a lot because the beautiful artwork is sometimes in the foreground which blocks your view of what is going on.  

There is not enough buttons for all the things you'll need/want to do or to have assigned.  There is a pool of 16 (I think) abilities and movement skills and your controller has 6 buttons to use them with so you will just forget about a lot of skills or constantly need to shift them around.

+ you can play around with a lot of passives and active skills, which makes the game and the combat even more fun!

tho i have 2 slight negative things about the game:
- the story is really short, an amazing experience but very short as i write this review right after playing through this game
- there are too many mechanic combos sometimes so you could break your fingers very easily, atleast that was my  
  impression xD

Result:
If you liked the first game and metroidvenia, if you like Hollow knight but as a glowing Stitch and more colorful, then this is your game, i can absolutely recommend it!

This sequel throws you right in with new movement capabilities and weaponry, the combat is incredibly cool with many different ways to defeat an enemy. When you get good it feels amazing to effortlessly chain different attacks together and see how an enemy reacts.

The movement is very free flowing, it's the opposite of Hollow Knight where it feels like you are moving around as a robot.

The visuals are somehow even better than the first, each frame in the game looks like it could be a wallpaper.

Gareth Coker somehow arranged over 3 hours of music for an orchestra to play, each sounding unique and beautiful. I'm super impressed by all the individual themes he uses to portray the mood perfectly.

It's gameplay, visuals, and music all come together perfectly to create one of my favourite games of all time. The game goes on sale for 80% off, if you like Metroidvanias or platformers it's easily worth the price.",1679519341,1679519341,True,3,0,0.519841313362121582,0,True,False,False

Overall it's a pleasant experience and quite relaxing to play. Note that the skill bash allows a few seconds to adjust its direction. I didn't realise that in the 1st run and suffered many unnecessary deaths.

Achievement difficulty overall is not too bad. Three areas in the game will be locked when completed, which may cause some issues for collection achievements. No death, no skill and speed run achievements can be completed in the same run. I did it on the 3rd run with less than 2 hours, with the help of the duplicate saves function in game.

I played 80% of the time on steam deck and 20% of the time on PC. The switching between deck and PC is hassle-free. However, there seems to be some glitches in achievements when playing on deck. I got two achievements (50% and 100% map stones) unlocked in early part of the 1st run when the criteria is not met.

- Super stable game at this point in time. Barely had a bug let alone a crash. With a single exception... 2-3 collectibles didn't register as being collected despite them disappearing on the map. A quit+re start fixed it.
- The No-death achievement can be cheesed by simply loading an earlier save when dying instead of allowing the game to respawn.
-""High and dry"" unlocks once you clear the mill. You don't need to finish that playthrough.
- On hard mode, buying everything costs extra Light (game's money). Even tho I collected literally every bit of it from the map I was still short about 10k. Luckily grinding it in AFK farms is possible (check youtube, there are many ways).

In conclusion this is a clear recommend from me. Achievement wise it has a little bit of everything, and it's really well done.

Strong Recommend (especially if you can get it discounted).",1679327144,1679327144,True,16,0,0.668937921524047852,0,True,False,False

""I am a 50 year old father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game.
I am a single father for my son who is now 14 years old. My son has recently started playing Counter-Strike: Global Offensive.
In less than a week, he has already played more than 20 hours.
It was terrible for me, because it was already hard enough for me to spend time with my son.
because he was always with his friends or watching YouTube videos.
So I decided to create a Steam account to play with my son. I started playing but it was my first time playing a video game since the 90s so I was pretty lost. I asked my son for help and we spent several hours together playing this game.
I liked it as it was the best time I have had with my son since my wife died. Playing video games reminded me that there is fun in everything and it brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside of the house.""",1679212444,1679212444,True,1,0,0.520958065986633301,0,True,False,False

Play it. It's phenomenal. 
The controls are immaculate, the music's amazing, and the combat can give you a good (but not unfair) challenge. Between the beauty of the game, the fun of the traversal, and the slow increase of enemy battles, exploration never gets tired. There does become a fair amount of back tracking, and the world's too large for my old brain to keep good track of, but the world's so inviting and fun that I don't mind the constant traversals--whether I'm on the right track or took a wrong turn.
Plus, the rather steady stream of upgrades, new movements/weapons and basket of optional ""tasks"" keeps all the action pretty fresh.",1679168307,1679168307,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The combat is still very lacklustre with an emphasis on other things. I think this is because the game's movement is very centred on platforming rather than fighting. Giving an example of how unbalanced the combat is there is an achievement for killing a boss under 2 minutes and I've got it first try. But aside from that the game succeeds pretty well in other things it's trying to do. Personally the songs feel very forgettable as the game is a literal forest, So you have normal forest, ice forest, purple forest, spooky forest etc. I believe it's hard for them to make a song that's distinct from each other and that's why they feel sort of weird. The game is absolutely beautiful, with satisfying platforming and improvements to the upgrades you can buy throughout the game. The game is a minor improvement from the first and is definitely worth playing 7/10. I bought both for 10$",1679165983,1679165983,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

They reused some of the annoying gameplay of the first one. But it's only at the end, it breaks the flow that you had in the game, and makes it a little bit too much of a visual clutter.

While the game is still visually stunning and offers a captivating soundtrack, some players may find that it falls short of the expectations set by its predecessor.

One of the main criticisms of the game is its relatively short length. Some players may feel that the game's storyline is rushed and not as fully developed as they would have liked. Additionally, while the game's platforming mechanics are still solid, they may not feel as fresh or innovative as they did in the first game.

That being said, Ori and the Will of the Wisps is still a beautiful and emotionally engaging game that is sure to captivate fans of the first game. The game's unique art style, intricate level design, and poignant story make it a worthwhile experience for anyone who enjoyed the original.

Overall, while some players may be disappointed by the game's length and lack of innovation, Ori and the Will of the Wisps is still a beautiful and engaging platformer that is well worth playing. Fans of the first game should definitely give it a try, but may need to adjust their expectations accordingly.",1679015937,1679015937,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The end was amazing, the cycle of Ori's life, how it started, how it ended, and how it started again.

The list of grievances i have with the game is pretty big, so i'll summarize : 
Negatives
- more a movie than a game
- loves to remove control from you for the tiniest things
- doesn't do environmental storytelling well at all. A picture says a thousand words, no need to shove my face into the picture and say ""hey this is what the picture is saying!!!""
- story is once again lackluster
- combat is middling
- gives you tutorials for basic things that don't really need it, but some things are pretty obscure (pole rotation to get height, waking up Baur...)

Positives : 
- graphics are amazing

Neutral
- mechanics are alright (sometimes bugged, they are *not* made for keyboard but still better than ori1 on that regard - notable example of not thinking about kb/mouse is the fact that bash/grapple/burrow in midair are based off direction pressed, not mouse position??)

All in all it's ok to play and finish but def not an experience i'd recommend unless you're just looking to occupy hours.",1678963326,1678963326,False,2,3,0.433759510517120361,0,True,False,False

Great gaming experience. Without doubt, Ori is a successful game. It even deeply impact the game industry.

It's one of the very few games that can make me cry. [spoiler] The very cute owl, Ku, was killed by Shriek? Fine, I can stand this. The flexible and kind spirit, Ori, finally embraced the light and gone? Well, that's a miserable ending, but I can still hold it. BUT when Shriek finally defeated by Ori, severely injured, and used his last bit of strength, lain under his parents' wings, tears slid from my eye... Even after Ku's death, I've browsed this game's story and already known what will happen to Shriek... [/spoiler]

And also, compare with Ori1 (Ori and the Blind Forest), this game's graphic quality is even much better. That's unbelievable and amazing because Ori1 already has the top-class graphic quality.

BUT WHY I LEAVE A NEGATIVE COMMENT HERE? You need to know, when I first posted this review one and half a month ago, I gave it a negative comment. At that time I just completed this game under normal difficulty. Although it took me about 19 hours, I still missed some major story of Ori. So the previous comment may be a little subjective. But now, I played an additional 18 hours, completed the full collection under hard difficulty, fully experienced Ori's story. Unfortunately, I still think this game has some minor (OK, maybe major?) flaws, which makes me feel disappointed and uncomfortable. That is:

1. In the poster, Ori and Ku, stand side by side, beautiful. Originally I imagined in this game Ori and Ku will fight together, and that must be interesting and thrilling. [spoiler] In this game, Ori made lots of effort,and eventually found Ku. I was happy because I think a new era that Ori and Ku fight together to protect this forest was coming. But when I found Ori couldn't dismount from Ku, and couldn't change his weapon, I realized something was wrong. Just about ten minutes after Ori met Ku, Ku was killed by Shriek, and this cute owl was gone, till the end of the game Ori embraced the light that revived Ku. So, what's the meaning of Ku in this game? Just show players how Ku died and make us feel sad? [/spoiler]

2. [spoiler] That's too abrupt that Ori finally sacrificed himself, embracing the light and becoming a spirit tree, even without meeting Naru, Gumo and Nibel once more. I know on the way to Willow Tree, the wall painting drops a hint that Ori will become a spirit tree finally. But, I still think that's really really abrupt, only make me feel sad and disappointed. It brings me nothing positive. If add this: ""During the last fight between Ori and Shriek, the spirit tree is severely damaged, if Ori doesn't embrace the light imminent, Niwen will be dark and hopeless again. Ori has no choice but sacrifice himself to save the light immediately."", I believe Ori's story will be more moving and complete, and players will be more willing to accept Ori's sacrifice. [/spoiler]

That's all. I love this game, love Ori. Playing this game is just like an amazing journey, makes you happy, makes you cry, and after that you'll miss it. Ori1 & Ori2 are the only two games that get full marks from me till now. More important, it inspires me a lot in my personal game development. When I'm tired of coding or learning Computer Graphics, this little spirit will always come to my mind and push me go further. So, I want and I have to use the most strict standard to judge this game. I'm so sorry I leave a negative comment here.",1675616469,1678946269,False,8,1,0.538113236427307129,0,True,False,False

But, this title has a beautiful story that is told very well through more than words. Gareth Coker's beautiful score assists the artwork and characters to set the mood perfectly and tells the story through your ears as well. Not only does it improve on the first experience for fans of the first game, but fans of Hollow Knight will appreciate the challenge this title offers and how fluid Ori's movement is. Even so, just remember this is not an easy game and takes some skill to play, but it's worth it and you will feel accomplished that you got through a tough spot. Boss fights in this game are incredibly enjoyable and really memorable. Trust me when I say that even if you get frustrated by dying, don't give up!

TBH, I wish it would be more like Hades (I love that game) a good balance between challenging and fun.

I accumulated 25+ hours in less than 48 hours because I was glued to it. If it wasn't to sleep, eat, bathroom, or some IRL necessity, I was completely lost in the game. When I started the game, I played for what seemed to be an hour or so, but then I looked at the time and 6 hours had passed? It was that kind of game for me, simply AMAZING!

Visual: Every part of this game looked stunning. The art is beautifully done and the colors are so vibrant. All throughout the game, I couldn't help but admire the different areas in astonishment. Each area has its own feel and theme but no one area felt disconnected from the rest. The same goes for the characters. The art style is a bit cartoonish though (not that this is a bad thing).

Gameplay: Plays like your typical metroidvania type of game. Find power-ups to get stronger. The more power-ups you find, the more areas you'll be able to explore, etc.  However, there is no gear in this game. Instead, you find abilities that let you explore combat in different ways, and you can upgrade these abilities to change how they behave. Your base attack is a sword and that's pretty much it. Controlling the character felt smooth and nothing ever felt wonky so combat felt nice too. I played using a controller and the button configuration/placement felt really good (though I have no idea what it feels like to play with keyboard/mouse).

Level/Map Design: Overall, it feels similar to games like Hollow Knight or Bloodstained. Personally, I felt like the location of the save points were not optimal and there weren't enough of them so teleporting still felt like a chore because I'd have to walk a long way to where I wanted to go even after teleporting. Also, the games I mentioned have a very boxy/rectangular looking map so one can easily count the distance by looking at the map once and get to where one needs to go in one take. This game's map isn't so easily read. Yes, it gives a general sense of where you are in that area, but I found myself looking at the map way more often to make sure I was going in the right direction. Another difference I felt was the game didn't feel too linear. For instance, most of these types of games push you go in the direction you're supposed to and even if you veer off it will push you in the right direction. This game felt like if you veered, you'd really be lost. Yes, you do have quests that guide you to the next objective, but you can explore a lot on your own and go to places you aren't supposed to at the current time. Therefore, there's a lot of tracking back and forth. This part frustrated me a little bit as I felt I wasted a lot of time going to areas over and over again just to know I can't go further. If you're an explorer type of player like me who doesn't just go straight for the next objective, then this might frustrate you as well. Still, this wasn't bad enough for me to dislike the game.

Grinding: Thankfully you don't have to farm the same monsters over and over again to get all the upgrades. Most games like to have a ridiculous 5000000000 shard upgrade or something like that just for you to get an achievement for ""get all upgrades"", but all the upgrades in this game are reasonably priced and you can get almost all of them just by getting to the end area and collecting all the secret hidden goodies. That doesn't mean you won't have to grind at all because you will still need extra resources, but you won't be doing it for hours and days just to get an upgrade. 

Music: Beautiful! Simple yet stunning. It had a calm minor feel with some rhythmic variations. It matches the forest/nature environment perfectly.

Story: Some parts made me sad; some parts made me mad, and some parts made me laugh. It's a simple tale and nothing crazy happens but it's a journey that kept me entertained.

There's still more to say about the game but I feel like this covers the gist of it.  Overall, it's a great game especially if you pick it up on sale. No, you may not binge it like I did, but I'm sure you'll still enjoy every moment of playing it from start to finish whenever you do turn it on to play.

Here's my reasoning, the first game has a really unforgettable score but this one has a bunch of scores and it felt more difficult to nail them down. The first game had much greater mystery, in this game there are a bunch of NPCs to talk to but the first game kept it to, I believe only two. The NPCs help the world feel more alive but takes away from a lot of the mystery and lonesomeness. This game also focuses more on combat then the first which I though I would like as there wasn't much of a combat system to speak of in the first game, but it felt very odd and hard to learn. I imagine that this isn't a problem for those using controllers but if you play on keyboard, it always feels like you need another button that you can hit comfortably which can make some movement a bit awkward.

Some positives. The antagonist of this game is miles better than in Blind Forest, and I say that with love for both, but the antagonist of this game is pretty much flawless. The design, the theme, the story, the fear factor, and the threat are all real and incredible. The art is a pretty clear step up from the first game, each area feels unique and vibrant.

There are several options for attacks but none of them are unique and very little upgrading, leading to a static playstyle once you pick out your favorite skills. Hit sparks on some moves can obscure ability to react to enemies attacks. Game also has an unhealthy reliance on enemy contact damage->player stagger,which makes it very frustrating to play from time to time. Bosses are egregious to play against, with many enemies stagger animations overlapping with player melee range. This typically always results in contact damage if not playing a 1 hit then run playstyle. They also have varying hit boxes and several invulnerable phases which worsens the experience.

That said, everything else about the game is phenomenal. Simple, yet sincere and heartfelt story. Some of the best stylized visuals and animations across any game. As a metroidvania and platformer, is near perfect. Controls are tight and movement tools come together to create an incredibly satisfying rhythm especially during escape sequences. Map design is satisfying and rarely causes disorientation. Areas are visually distinct and interesting to discover, coming with their own unique skill to master. Only issue is that occasionally some puzzles will grind gameplay to a halt.No performance issues or bugs that I encountered. Soundtrack is quite good and elevates important story beats. Aside from combat, mostly respects the players time such as very few instant kills, frequent autosaving, difficulty options, fast travel, fast movement, etc. Achievements are fairly forgiving to accomplish, particularly with the built in backup saving feature which is especially useful for the untouchable achievement (had to use it twice which saved me at least 4 hours of play).

Everything is emotionally inspiring and captivating like a true work of art. It does everything it can to make you feel, and it works (though this one is a little soppier) lol Truth be told, I prefer the 1st to the 2nd because I feel there is a lot more going on and things seem slightly less impactful. Everything about the first had more oomph, the 2nd is more battle-focussed but it does instil a sort of 'feeling of sacrament' to the environments.

The game is very different depending on difficulty. Easy is a joy to breeze through and focus on the story; Normal is good if you know what you need to do; and Hard is certainly challenging and requires you strengthen yourself up before you progress.

What I mean is - even the VERY FIRST BOSS a few minutes into the game can either be a frustrating ""what do I do?!"" or a cakewalk depending on your difficulty - it makes a huge difference.

I still maintain that the game is not the kind of game you should speedrun - it's an artistic experience with beautiful visuals and soundtrack that should be savoured slowly and carefully. I feel like it's at odds with the intent of the game and I thought the devs realised that when they took out certain achievements from the revamped edition of the 1st game? ""Caveat completionists"" is all I can say too because there's certainly a challenge here if you want one! lol

Would I recommend it? Absolutely, but take your time and try not to lose your cool if you die to the same thing again and again or can't figure out where to go next.
Progressing in the Luma Pools can take some thinking (hint: feather + bubble) and I found when hiding from Shriek I forget one or 2 of the safe spots (and having to go back to the last checkpoint can get tedious), but everything else makes up for it and it's very enjoyable if you're on the most appropriate difficulty.",1584492937,1678303230,True,2,0,0.530201315879821777,0,True,False,False

Those tags are REALLY overused on Steam.  It's nowhere near the difficulty of a game like Hollow Knight, for example.  I'm pushing 50 and I have the hand/eye coordination of an old man, and I beat it with no great difficulty.  I just thought that was important to say since I'm sure there are others out there like me who avoid difficult games.",1678227367,1678227367,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The gameplay took a bit of a turn in this one to feel more like Hollow Knight and I'm not the biggest fan especially on hard mode (dying in like 2 hits isn't fun) but it's manageable if you have to correct resources and can catch a pattern fairly quick. The combat is quick and very unforgiving, if you don't catch your time to take a couple swings at that boss, retry until you get it right cos it's not gonna be easy from there on in I can tell you. Play on easy if the combats too challenging cos it's like a simple breeze in comparison.

Soundtrack
Presentation
Illustration, Lighting and coloring
Story
Meticulous platforming

Least favorite things:
Sometimes it feels that there is too many abilities and they lack familiarity of use, some act as equipment and others are command based.
Some shifts in the platforming throws many elements at you, often impossible to see ori in the scene on your first try, little bit tough to navigate these sections.

Both it and its predecessor, Ori and the Blind Forest, are absolute masterpieces in gaming and in art.  Ori and the Blind Forest already set the bar insanely high, yet somehow, the developers managed to improve upon it in almost every way possible in this sequel.  Every aspect of this game is beyond phenomenal in their quality; from the art style, graphics, world/level design, gameplay mechanics, sound design and music, story, lore, characters and more.  It is all near perfection.
I simply cannot praise this game enough and in my humble opinion, I firmly believe that Ori and the Will of the Wisps and Ori and the Blind Forest are two of the best games ever made of any genre, bar none.

If you like action/adventure puzzle platformers, great stories, music, beautiful art, or just gaming in general, Ori and the Will of the Wisps and Ori and the Blind Forest are must haves.

Not too difficult puzzles either. I really enjoyed the game to the fullest, and got most of the stuff done as well in the game. But I find normal difficulty good enough for me. Especially against later bosses.

Will be interesting to see what next kind of game these people will make. I highly recommend this game, if you're into high paced and a good story line of characters. You should be able to play this game without the first one, However there is a character in this one that came from the first one. So would advise to play the first game to see the backstory all of the characters. Otherwise you wouldn't understand much at all.

This game is significantly more developed when compared to the first game. The first game, to me, is just a platformer but this game fully embraces the metroidvania style and has side quests and optional abilities and power ups that really make you have different ways of using combat to progress the story.

The visuals here are CRAZY good, way more than the first game. The use of 3D elements to make this 2D platformer experience truly dynamic, is some of the best I have ever seen.

I love the addition of boss fights as well and they feel nice. They are not terribly difficult but they are visually stunning and fun to complete as you frantically run around the area.

The Will of the Wisps has much more fluid combat, and it sports a vibrant world brought to life by uniquely interesting characters, which make the first game seem almost lonely by comparison. You've got to love the Moki's innocent lines.

Some new abilities open up more movement options (though nothing can compare to Bash) and the boss fights + combat shrines are a load of fun. My integrated GPU doesn't meet the minimum system requirements, but I still throughly enjoyed the game on its lowest settings with occasional stutters.

One criticism though is that the energy-consuming combat abilities can make the boss fights too [i]easy[/i], like Spirit Arc + relevant shards letting me quickly mow down one of the later bosses on my first try. Most purchasable combat abilities seem irrelevant and I still end up favoring the basic combat (which is very satisfying) the most. This game definitely has a very different feel from OBF's heavier focus on platforming, not that it's lacking for it in any case.

Edit: After having played through the game on Hard, I will say that I felt as though Ori shouldn't have become a combat-focused game. Although the combat isn't bad, the game's beauty becomes incredibly distracting when you're trying to search for the location of your character, your white mouse cursor, or warnings before attacks like Shriek's directional dives. When you're playing on a difficulty where getting hit three times takes you from full health to none, the glowing, multicolored objects on screen make it very hard to keep track of important game elements. This also applies to the often blurry line between background scenery and solid platform elements - it's all a little too much sometimes.",1617138467,1676751586,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,5,True,False,False

Will of the Wisps makes Blind Forest look like a prototype - an amazing and beautiful one, but a prototype still. This game manages to turn its predecessor, which was essentially just an adventure-platformer with some combat, into a fully fledged action RPG with quests, NPCs, boss fights, challenges and an in-depth abilities and upgrades system. WotW is a gigantic step-up from BF's basic skill tree, adding a lot more complexity and diversity to the gameplay, while also making important changes for balancing.

Since this is an Ori game, it goes without saying that the visuals are on another level of beautiful, and the music perfectly hits the tone in any situation.

Setting off where the first part started, Ori and the will of the wisps features: Great art, excellent story and character development, astounding music, amazing effects and smooth and nice gameplay with many abilities. Ori is one of the few, if not only, game that can make me cry, even on successive playtroughs. 

The only thing I can critique for this game is that the last fight is... well... hard. But not for the right reasons. I really like challenges and play almost all games I can on the hardest difficulty. Fights should be hard due to mechanics. Not RNG, which was the entirety of this fights challenges. [spoiler] Particularily the last part of the fight, where you have to keep yourself in the air by dashing through the comets/stars and also dodge Shrieks diagonal attacks is utter madness. Sometimes the comets would exclusively fall on one side and if you're unlucky you'd just fall. Also, Shrieks diagonal attacks are really stupidly programmed as far as I could tell. Sometimes they would hit you, despite you being at the very corners of the screen, then they won't hit you even if you're right in there and without the launch's invincibility frames. Also, sometimes the diagonal attack would follow you, because the camera keeps centering on Ori, essentially making it impossible to even dodge. And this attack does more than half of my life as dmg and I am only missing one life container. Even though Shriek does not have much HP left, I often would die without chance after having the chance to damage her once. [/spoiler] Unfortunately, this totally killed my enjoyment at this point. RNG is one of the most unfun mechanics, if implemented the wrong way. And here it definitely is. This is a very poor point in the game to rely on RNG, as it also caused me to totally be angry at the game or the devs, resulting in me not being able to enjoy the successive cinematics I would've surely cried at because it was just so frustrating one moment ago.

Please, dev team, keep up the good work with doing your games. I mean it. I really love them. But... just stay away from stupid RNG. At least in crucial moments like these. Okay? Thank you for your effort!",1676144152,1676144152,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

For example, when Ori receives quest details, you get them once, and then all you get is some vague description on the map. No way to trace what others have said. Also, some of the key moments that let you advance in the game, have no foretelling or hint of any sort.

From soundtrack to story to game design , everything is just perfectly executed. I didn't mention art design because that is just in another level. I doubt there are much games in the level of artwork that is in this game.
And it's just not only the art, the gameplay especially improved by a TON. there is some Hollow knight Vibes to it (and lets be real, hollow knight is probably the biggest platformer there is , so it's no surprise) , But it totally nails it and stands up on it's own.

Ori and the Will of the Wisps takes what worked with the original, and turned it up.

The visuals and music were already a staple of what made the first game so popular, and nothing has changed. Again it looks and sounds amazing, and I would be hard pressed to imagine something being more aesthetically pleasing than the original, but it tops it with its own sequel.

In terms of story, it is just as heartfelt and emotional as the first game, if not more so. The visual storytelling with these games has always exceeded anything they have tried to do with dialogue. While, yet again, the story isn't anything complex, it is moving. The world building is even better than before, with a multitude of characters you can meet and perform tasks for with the new quest/side quest system. This aids in helping you care about Niwen as you are saving it. The world feels more lived in this time around.

One of the most clear improvements with the Will of the Wisps is its combat system. Something TBF lacked was engaging combat. The combat in WOTW is so much more satisfying and engaging. It isn't a click and dodge as it was. Now you have a variety of weapons you can choose from and upgrade. With different aerial combos, and actually being required to aim now, combat feels more earned.

The platforming is also another change that saw pretty massive improvement. Going back to TBF after playing this one feels so slow. There are a variety of new ways to get around, and it flows really well. Because the skill ceiling is higher, you can really feel this sense of mastery by the end.

Ori and the WIll of the Wisps loses nothing of what made Ori great in the first place, and only improves upon itself. If you like a story that is told rather than felt, it might not be for you. If you like platformers, you shouldn't miss it. I'd gladly recommend it.",1675625892,1675627232,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[b]TL;DR I definitely enjoyed this game and I think that anybody with a hint of enjoyment for platformers and/or metroidvanias should give this and ""Ori and the Blind Forest"" a go. Both these games are excellent, and you'll especially enjoy them if you like games like Hollow Knight.[/b]

It's one of those few cases where you just gotta play the game because it's special like that.
There are very few games that hit this list for me, and I'm proud to say Will of the Wisps stands tall not only as a great successor to Blind Forest, but as a great game in its own right that manages to compare even to the likes of Hollow Knight.

Like the aforementioned, Ori and the Will of the Wisps is a metroidvania, with a heavy emphasis on exploration, discovery and multiple sidequests thare are literally intertwined with eachother. Aside from all the side content is a pretty simple story; you are a spirit in a dying land where the Light (all-feeding source of life) has been separated into several weaker Wisps, forcing you to go and acquire these Wisps and bring them back all together to save the lands and everything in it.

The artstyle is definitely the main draw for Ori as a franchise, where both games display an enormously high standard of quality for their graphical design. For the most part, a lot of the environments are hand drawn and cleverly overlapped with lightly cell-shaded 3D models. Essentially, this gives a lot of environments and characters in this game a sort of depth you'll often struggle to find in other similar games. There is a level of detail unheard of in every place you go, every area you visit, and, for lack of a better way of putting it, it all looks beautiful.

To top it all off, Will of the Wisps introduces a much more refined version of the combat system from the first game. In the first game, you had a wisp that did pretty much everything for you; attack, use abilities, etc. while you were left with almost exclusively mobility tools and cool gimmicks.
This game brings back a lot of those cool gimmicks and mobility tools, but Ori himself is actually able to fight as well. You have access to a surprisingly large variety of attacks and abilities that all change the way you can play the game, having access to 3 of them at a time and allowing you to swap between them on the spot if you need to.

Enemy design is mostly limited. You'll encounter a lot of the same enemies or more powerful variants of the same enemies, which may ruin the fun for some people in regards to the otherwise greatly improved combat. 

Platforming is also at its best. On top of having access to a lot of great options from the first game, Will of the Wisps introduces brand new abilities for Ori to unlock and provide greater challenges like you've never seen before that are extremely fun and satisfying to use. 

In terms of difficulty, there are a few difficulty spikes in some areas, especially bosses. Some platforming puzzles are notoriously more difficult than others and don't offer rewards that, personally, feel like they reward you enough. 
Most bosses in the game follow a pretty simple likewise design, having multiple phases where the surrounding level changes and demands more and more attention from you as you try to fight the boss itself, or sometimes transitioning you into a quick parkour segment where you're forced to run for your life across a series of obstacles. It can definitely be hard at times, but I wouldn't call them the hardest bosses in any game as I personally have only died once or twice to some of them. 

[h1]Overall,[/h1]
I think Ori and the Will of the Wisps is an amazing game worth experiencing at least one, especially if you're already into the Metroidvania genre and have thoroughly enjoyed games like Hollow Knight. This game offers plenty to explore and plenty to see, making 100%ing the game more satisfying than anything I've played before.",1675496068,1675496210,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

In short: Stupid owl child, [spoiler] I wish he stayed dead, [/spoiler] it's his fault we got this game because he didn't turn around or land in that goddamn storm
Best gotten when it's on a good sale.

It's perfectly serviceable, though I wouldn't exactly recommend getting it outside a sale.
A lot of the uniqueness with the original (om)Ori game has been lost in favour of more conventional game design.
Ori now gets to wield a big hammer (as well as the standard blade and some other things I neglected to use), several movement abilities have been moved around (the wall climbing ability has been turned into an equippable thing instead of holding a trigger, the bash letting you jump off enemies has been re-mapped and now shares it with a new grapple ability, etc.), instead of the shrine-to-shrine travel you can teleport to any visited shrine anywhere should you buy that ability.

Oh yeah, there's shops. You can buy stuff with funny light you pick up.

The original platforming stuff is there, however Ori now fights by him-(her? idk, I'll write him)-self, instead of having the little wispy spirit thing (which is basically gone here) attack for him as he avoids the dangers. This turns Ori to less of a small spirit trying to restore order to more of a fighter, which doesn't really fit Ori, that seemed like more of a pacifist in the first game. This means that there's more combat in the game, making this less of a pure platforming challenge.

Perfomance was fine, but I highly recommend going into the options as soon as you can so you can turn on the framerate limiter, so that the game doesn't stress your machine trying to bang out as many frames as possible. My machine survived because it's a full gaming machine with recent enough components.

The fighting was fine, if not easily exploitable once you get the Bash and the hammer, however I normally tended to just avoid fighting and just zoom through to the next objective as fast as I could.
I beat this in about three days? 8.8 hours.

The story is even more generic this time, so Ori almost entirely carries itself on the visuals and its gameplay this time. Story was fine, but nothing I haven't heard of before. [spoiler] Two pals get lost in a storm, decay bird gets bullied, stupid owl child dies, adventure happens to revive the stupid owl, Ori turns into a tree, etc. [/spoiler]

Miscellaneous things:
The hammers up-air lifts you up a bit. I used that a lot to get to places in ways maybe I weren't supposed to.
The dash is now more a roll, even in the air, and the sound is different, so it's not nearly as fun to spam.
Quests exist now.
The old save system is gone, now it saves whenever you quit, go on one of those healing/fast travel point altars, and there's checkpoints if you die.
Some abilities you unlocked by finding some points are now relegated to some kind of shard system where you have a limited amount of slots to equip them to.
Couple extra bugs, I ended up behind some thorns and also I got teleported far back one time, and some things dissapear then re-appear, noticed one instance of that.
Can't really think of anything else other than [spoiler] I wished the owl STAYED DEAD. [/spoiler]

To re-cap:
If you enjoyed the first (om)Ori, don't expect more of the same (om)Ori. This time, it stays closer to generic game convention.
I played on an xbox controller, like in the first game. Due to things being changed around, it took time to re-adjust my muscle memory from the first game. Wish I could rebind it.
Ori gets to wield a bigass hammer.
The story isn't anything special.
The environments and the visuals stay looking good.
Giant toad-frog-thingy.
Some extra platforming gimmicks.

If it's on like 50% sale, or close to the price of the original Ori, then I recommend it, if you don't mind something a bit more mundane this time around gameplay and story-wise.
If your skill is around mine, you could beat it in a single day.",1675452691,1675453123,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Gameplay is more of the same with some bells and whistles, but everything that made the first game exceptional is just gone. If you liked the first game, save your money and your time. There's nothing here except a soulless glowy-cat killing everything on screen. Oh except there's merchants now.

Wow. I have never played a worse and more mishandled sequel in my life. And I played Duke Nukem Forever. I am utterly shocked and overwhelmed by how much of a disappointment this game is after the first one.

So petty stuff first. The graphics optimization is HORRENDOUS. The graphics are identical to the first game, but this one runs considerably worse. Tons of clipping, stuttering, and major sound glitches. My computer is pretty old, but the first one runs flawlessly and there's no apparent reason this game should run any different than the first one, so if they have updated it only shows in the issues, not the product.

The real issue though is the game itself. The first game was a powerful, emotional story with deep messaging about loss, forgiveness, healing trauma both personal and generational and hopefulness in the face of adversity. I cried multiple times. It also had thoughtful gameplay that reinforced the message. This game has a throwaway sappy plot comparable to a Hallmark commercial, and right off the bat, it's just senseless violence against random woodland creatures. Last time they had me healing the forest. Now in the first moments of gameplay I'm burning it down. Before I fought corruption and disease. Now I'm fighting animals in a forest where I don't belong.

It's a shame, because some of the new gameplay elements are really fun, but they're tied to a game that has ZERO respect for itself or the player. Ori and the Blind Forest is a MASTERPIECE. Ori and the Will of the Wisps is just another game in an endless sea of Metroidvanias.

There is absolutely nothing special about this game. It just exists to cash in on a predecessor it's not worthy of. Oh also, there's no more making your own save points, and the wells are WAY further apart than the first game.

The gameplay is based on smooth series of jumps and skills in a way that makes it so satisfying to play. Now to compare with the first game of the series: 
- for the negative point: the escape sequences are slightly easier than those in The Blind Forest, so they're less thrilling. Instead there are now ""spirit trials"" (time trials) which are nightmarish, but they're challenging and not compulsory to progress in the game. 
- the map is much bigger. There are so many things to explore, and because of this, new gameplay mechanics such as burrowing in the sand, surviving in the dark etc. 
- there are secondary quests, and this makes the exploring aspect of the game more fulfilling. 
Aside from the gameplay, the game is just gorgeous in its very unique way, a one of a kind artistic direction. The story is beautiful and bittersweet, and the ending really ties up in a way which makes the player feels that they earned it. And of course the score by Gareth Coker is once again absolutely incredible from beginning to end.

Ori and the Will of the Wisps is a game developed by Moon Studios GmbH and published by Xbox Game Studios and is the sequel to Ori and the Blind Forest and follows the same metroidvania style of the first game

I almost guarantee that your first playthrough will be very emotional... that's basically all I can say

The game is challenging as if you were playing Dark Souls... the game is not just for admiring the beautiful sights. It is going to test you

Precision is key, especially near the end, where you rarely even have ground to step on before something is going to shoot you

As in every metroidvania you are rewarded for exploring the forest

Ori and the Will of the Wisps, just like the first game, is just gorgeous. The graphics, art style, animations, effects and the music makes you feel just like what the developers intended

It will make you cry during a cutscene, and make you excited and full of adrenaline throughout the game

Ori and the Will of the Wisps is worth every cent, that is if you enjoy metroidvania games

If you do why not give it a try!

[h1] RECOMMENDED :) [/h1]

The controls just felt bad somehow (especially the wall jump) and it wasn't easy to decipher what was background scenery and what was part of the level.

In fact, I quite like it, this game is just better in every way and more fun than the first one. It is formulaic, but it did it well.

Better exploration with varied rewards to look for and more options for your build. Different combat abilities and play styles to choose from are good.
There's even some great new technical design choices, the map reveal reward is amazing to not need a guide if you miss something. And the built-in autosave slots system is a godsend, especially when there can be some unfair instadeath for harder achievements.

The story is nice, although simple and cliche, which doe snot matter as the game play is really fun and entertaining, Took me around 20hrs on normal to beat the game, thoroughly 85% completion. You can keep playing after beating the game to get every single thing.

It reminds Hollow Knight in a refreshing way. You constantly unlock new abilities in line with story progress, which felt very natural and kept me coming for it. In regards to replay value, game is on my library and there is a hard mode to go through, maybe some day.....

In 1 word, enjoyable.

Beyond the looks, this is also a phenomenal metroidvania. The platforming is fast-paced, well animated, and precise. There's also a really fun combat system that actually takes some skill to master. These two systems also have really fun progression curves. That doesn't leave you too under-or-overpowered at any point. Of course the platforming and combat systems are heavily intertwined and synergistic, and so are their upgrades. 

The music is also very beautiful and compliments the story and visuals very well. Oh also, the story is great. Without barely any spoken words. The story manages to convey feeling that many stories can only dream of (just like the first one).

[b]GRAPHICS[/b]
This was already great in the original but the sequel steps up the quality of the visuals even more- it's honestly absurd how pretty the game looks. The foreground is also well seperated from the background this time so i had no issues understanding the layout of the levels (an issue i had with the previous game)

[b]COMBAT[/b]
Will of the wisps has a more involved combat system than it's predecessor, although it's not something incredibly complex, it's strength lies in how you can use the movement abilities at your disposal to swiftly defeat your foes. It was incredibly enjoyable juggling myself in the air and defeating enemies and bosses this way. 

[b]PLATFORMING[/b]
As you can probably imagine from the points above, this was my favorite part of the game- it's great because things don't take long to get very interesting as you end up getting most of the movement options from the original game relatively early on, so as the game progresses you end up getting loads of great movement abilities to progress through the world

[b]STORY/SOUNDTRACK[/b]
I wasn't really expecting much of a story in this game considering the one in the original was very barebones, but there's a great narrative that ties everything together- I personally prefer the way Hollow Knight does it instead but that doesn't mean i didn't enjoy the story here.

As for the soundtrack, it's really good! Everything fits the moods and tone of the areas you explore and I ended up liking it a lot more than I expected. 

[/b]MISCELLANEOUS STUFF[/b]
The game also has a bunch of other things which I thought were fairly interesting- combat and platforming trials which test your mastery of the game's movement abilities which were pretty enjoyable, a spirit shard system similar to hollow knight's charms which had some great optional abilities in it (although a good chunk of them I didn't care for) and quests for npc's which generally had great dialogue and were very charming. 


Overall, I feel like Will of the Wisps is an incredible metroidvania which takes what people love about the genre but mixes in a lot of fantastic platforming to create something truly wonderful- I'll be thinking about this game for quite some time.",1674510357,1674510357,True,4,0,0.59334564208984375,0,True,False,False

It is a game that you should definitely experience, especially if you are good with story games. It has a rich story that is not heavy and never gives you a headache. I never got bored while doing the side missions and in-game dialogues, even when I came to the end of the game, I gladly completed the side missions I left unfinished and finished the game like that.

The only annoying aspect of this game, which has many praiseworthy aspects, is that some of the controls (moving in the sand) are not very comfortable.

This game takes everything that made the first Ori game absolutely wonderful and improves it. The graphics are just as pretty, and environments you explore throughout your adventure are even prettier, the story is very moving, and the gameplay is fun and rewarding.

It isn't just a remake of the first Ori, though. I found the puzzles harder, which is, of course, a good thing. The skill tree has been overhauled, and there are new mechanics in place.

Not EVERYTHING is better in the sequel. I did like the original's skill tree better, and I miss the hectic chases through sweeping landscapes like at the end of the Ginso Tree, which have been replaced here with boss battles. They're interesting, and many of the characters have three-dimensional personalities rather than being all good or all bad; that was just something I really enjoyed in the first game and missed in the second one.

Oh, and the music! If the music in Ori And The Blind Forest was gorgeous, then the music here defies description. Gareth Coker has outdone himself and produced my favourite soundtrack ever.

This sublime experience combines the best of storytelling with delightful action-platforming to create my [b]favorite gaming experience of 2020.[/b]

[u][b]Played with PlayStation 4 controller[/b][/u]

[h1]‚úîÔ∏è[u]Positive:[/u][/h1]
[b][+] Versatile movement in a beautiful metroidvania.[/b] 
As you progress and obtain more abilities (even more than the first game), Ori gradually becomes more monkey-like in their movements, opening up the world for more exploration.  The whole map essentially becomes a delightful playground with hidden nuggets/collectibles in every nook and cranny. Thanks to the responsive controls, the different mechanics can easily be combined with one another to result in fast, agile, and fluid movement - which happens to be the perfect accompaniment for the exciting escape sequences and the thrilling boss fights.

[b][+] Emotional and thrilling storytelling.[/b] 
The incredible writing and direction, supported by the beautiful art and the divine OST makes the whole experience feel like a fairytale brought to life. I wouldn‚Äôt dare to deprive you from such a wonderful story by spoiling it here, so do yourself a favor and get the game. I will openly admit that I cried like a baby multiple times.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2169324939
[b][+] This sequel makes several notable improvements compared to the first game:[/b]
[olist]
[*][b]Auto-save.[/b]
Thank God they removed the manual save system introduced in the first game.

[*][b]New combat system![/b] 
Ori no longer has only the auto-lock on spirit fire attack, which I personally didn‚Äôt care for. Instead you can unlock and upgrade multiple abilities (including melee and ranged attacks), which can be assigned to the X, Y, B (Square, Triangle and Circle for PlayStation) buttons at your leisure. Combat options were lacking in the original so really appreciate this customization upgrade. Personally, I couldn‚Äôt get enough of the giant hammer and Shock Smash upgrade. 

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2177313275
[*][b]Addition of equipables![/b] 
Similar to the charms in Hollow Knight, Ori can now equip Spirit Shards (equippable items that provide upgrades to you or your abilities). Again, I find that the customization options allow for a more self-tailored experience. I basically had two sets of Spirit Shards that suited my playstyle: one for exploration and one for combat.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2177313407
[*][b]Improvements to the map and teleportation.[/b] 
The map immediately displays any warpstone and collectable you come across without requiring a map upgrade first (as was the case in the original). The map also makes it abundantly clear where the objective is, which areas you have and haven‚Äôt explored yet, and it even shows your latest movement in the form of a dotted line, making it incredibly difficult to get lost or disoriented. Furthermore, you can now teleport to any warpstone from any location, which greatly reduces the necessity for backtracking and helps to keep the pace of the game up. 

[*][b]Addition of side quests is always a blessing.[/b] 
Several great side quests were included in this title but there was one in particular that I really enjoyed: [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2177313569]‚Äúhand to hand‚Äù.[/url] It is essentially a trade sequence quest where you aid the next NPC by providing them with the item the previous NPC gave you. Helping the many creatures felt like I was contributing to the livelihood of the forest.

[*][b]Addition of a main hub.[/b] 
Important NPCs, such as vendors, relocate to the main hub in Wellspring Glades, after you meet them in the wild. Since the land is plagued by corruption and is tyrannized by the evil Shriek, NPCs will immigrate to this safe haven, inadvertently creating a diverse community. By offering resources, such as Gorlek ore and mysterious seeds, found during your journey to Grom (builder) and Tuley (gardener), you are also able to upgrade the main hub until it turns into a lively village. Investing in the community felt rewarding, and encouraged me to search for all the collectable items and help all NPCs.
[/olist]

[b][+] The game provides the necessary tools to unlock everything without relying on external help/guides.[/b]
If collecting everything is your cup of tea (it certainly is mine), then you will probably appreciate this point. There are map upgrades you can either buy or obtain which mark the location of all missing collectables, making them much easier to obtain. Furthermore, if you need to farm for more currency, Spirit Shards can be used to speed up the process; for example, by combining Consume (Enemies have 70% more Life and deal 70% more damage, but drop double currency) with Turmoil (Enemies respawn faster).

[b][+] Perhaps a minor detail but the game automatically pauses if your controller disconnects[/b]. 
Kudos, Moon Studios.

[h1]‚ûñ[u]Neutral:[/u][/h1]
[b][-] I enjoyed playing it so much that finishing it felt bitter-sweet.[/b]
As much as I loved the game, I felt sad knowing that it would be a while before another game would blow me away like this again. I‚Äôm sure most of us have at least one game that we wish we would wipe from our memories and replay again - Ori and the Will of the Wisps falls under this category. [u]Can‚Äôt wait for the next installment![/u]

[h1]üèÖ[u]Verdict:[/u][/h1]
[h1]‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ Marvellous[/h1]
A practically-flawless sequel and a must-have if you enjoyed Ori and the Blind Forest. Highly recommended to everyone else.

I'm starting to think it's unfair to compare it to Metroid Prime, but Will of the Wisps has a bigger problem with how easy some of the acquisitions are. It's also more trial-and-error without something equivalent to the Scan Visor, but I guess 2D Metroid games haven't really done that either.

I do still recommend it, because its controls and progression are pretty smooth. It rewards players who take their time to explore, but also if you learn each room's fastest moves/routes.

On the topic of its gameplay, it‚Äôs very easy to compare it to a game like Hollow Knight. Mainly because it very obviously [strike]ripped[/strike] took inspiration from it. Both in its upgrade system and its core gameplay, as well as some enemies and even the bloody map maker. Now I quite liked the orb from the first game, it was unique and gave the games gameplay a nice identity. It also made the game more immersive to some extent. The hit and kite tactics of Hollow Knight work great in Hollow Knight, but they give this game a sort of gamey feel that constantly breaks immersion by reminding you that you‚Äôre exploiting AI as a vital game mechanic, dus reminding you that you are playing a game. That is however my opinion, I am aware that a lot of people like it, and it‚Äôs done well enough to not be eligible for significant criticism.
What is eligible for criticism is that this game was very obviously scraping the bottom of the barrel in terms of its structure. As far as its story goes, it is identical to the first game. From the progression to the locations, even its main antagonists are identical. This games quest system is perhaps the only unique part about it. That and the boss fights. A large problem it has is that a lot of its mechanics are not properly implemented. The most notable being a particular grappling hook ability you get early on in the game. The grappling hook has you latch on to specific surfaces and objects, but the control over it is rather lacking. Grapples are generally proximity based, and not in a good way. The button for this ability also overlaps with another ability, so it is very easy to accidently grapple to something, or to not grapple at all if the proximity reader has a brain fart. Very often, I would try to jump off of an enemy, and because the binding is the same, I would go flying through that enemy to a grappalable area at the edge of the screen. The primary problem here is the fact that this was very obviously intended for a controller, despite having a cursor, you can‚Äôt control what you‚Äôre grappling on to most of the time. And what‚Äôs ironic is that this works very badly on controller as well. I did discover that you can rebind the thing, though be it when it was too late. But even then, the proximity-based hook is still quite horrible. Theres also an upgrade that lets you grapple to enemies, that stops working whenever theres a grappalable surface nearby.
The grappling hook is the most obvious case, but there are other problems like it. Like projectiles automatically locking on to things instead of going where you‚Äôre aiming. That‚Äôs sort of the main problem, this game lacks a degree of polish. It very often feels like it is just the first game with a new combat system slapped on top.
In fact, as outlandish as this might sound, this game gives the impression that the dev team here played Hollow Knight and got so into it that they just decided to make a follow-up to the first Ori game while they were riding the high of the Hollow Knight hype. It certainly is the best reason I have for why the story is basically a Copy/Paste job and the combat is unpolished and lifted from another game.
Now, on the topic of the actual quality of the gameplay, it‚Äôs generally good. The Hollow Knight combat is implemented well enough, though I often wander why the hammer doesn‚Äôt have a backswing when it clearly swings backwards. The platforming is straight out of the first game, and ignoring that atrocious grappling hook, it‚Äôs still as good as it was originally. All the new abilities combined with the new upgrade system also leave room for some fun experimentation and customization.
This is also, ironically, the only game I‚Äôve played that actually shows the one and only advantage of a controller. That being the maneuverability of a thumb stick versus the eight directions you can go in with arrow keys.

As far as functionality goes, I recall this game being bugged as hell on release, glad they fixed it now. Though, since they bothered to reskin the cursor, it would have been nice if they also made it so it didn‚Äôt fly off the screen on dual monitors.

On the topic of the story, without spoiling much, I greatly prefer the near perfect story of the first game. The first games story was simple, but feel-good, the ideal escapism. The ending of this one, to me just felt‚Ä¶ sour‚Ä¶

Aesthetically, the games lovely. In case it wasn‚Äôt obvious.

Lastly, there are the Spirit Races. Their alright, however, personally, they are a #1 on my dislike list, even more than the grappling hook. It‚Äôs not even the fact that their really tight, it‚Äôs mainly the fact that they introduce a rather competitive air to a distinctly uncompetitive game.

[hr][/hr]
Overall, this games only significant problem is its many new mechanics which are half-baked and overlap. Everything else can be chalked up to preference. In my personal preference, I greatly dislike this one. I prefer the first game in every way. That said, my personal opinion does not matter. From an objective standpoint, this game is just fine.
So, for anyone who likes Metroidvania style games, go play Hollow Knight. For anyone who likes top tier platformers with a simple, yet endearing story, try Ori and the Blind Forest. If you like both of those, then you‚Äôll probably like this game too.

This game doesn't really feel like a ""sequel"" to Ori and the Blind forest, it feels more like a *very* heavy remaster. This is due to the fact that its the same character but you remove all the abilities from the first game, and then it uses all the same abilities and ideas from the first game, and reworks them and also add a TON of new stuff. The main factor in my disappointment for the game laid in the fact that it just didn't feel very ""original"" compared to the first one, but looking at it as more of a remaster I can appreciate this game a lot more, because it improves upon the first a FUCK TON.
The combat is 1000x times better, the already pretty visuals became the most stunning 2D visuals I've ever seen in a game, the movement abilities are so fluid and and overall just awesome! The cut scenes are fucking beautiful, the music is great, the level design is way more fun and ineractable. I really liked the funny blue moss and this has the best was area in a video game by FAR.
I believe my main complaint lays in the world building/story of this game. It does have some neat side quests and some lively NPCs and that's cool, but I think where this game really really fails as a metroidvania, is weaving its abilities into the world. Every single ability is just... an ability. They aren't items, they have no story, you just progress through an area and find your next tree and it gives you a movement ability, or you just go up to the charm NPC and buy ""Double jump"". A lot of the NPCs just felt like they were there to serve their functional purpose rather then feel like their own characters that also have a purpose. It made the whole game just feel like it was made to be as much of a video game as possible without actually feeling like an immersive world, which I think for a metroidvania is very important. That on top of the fact the main story of the game just lacks any sort of depth at. But in the end game-play is what's important, and they did do a pretty good job with that.
There's only a few bosses in this game, and they look really cool, and they're fun but they're nothing super enticing, I never felt the want to go back and do the bosses again, they weren't very hard, I prefer more patternistic type bosses that force you have to learn attacks and how to dodge them so that the fights feel more like a dance (Exactly what the main dev said he was going for but clearly that didn't happen) but these were decent enough.
Another thing I felt, and this isn't necessarily a bad thing, never did I think I'd be complaining about this for a metroidvania, but the amount of movement abilities was a little overwhelming to a point where I think it was a little overboard. Having a whole wheel of movement abilities that you had to equip a few a time of just felt like too much. Maybe I wouldn't feel this way if the map was a lot bigger to actually feel like it was more suited for more different movement combinations and experimentation, with the movement abilities more spaced out and more progression locks.
There was also a ton of people saying this game copied hollow knight, but if you look more into it all of its systems were inspired by many other older games, and even if it did take inspiration from hollow knight it plays FAR differently, has many different abilities, and there was clearly a ton of work put into this game.
Overall a really fun game, amazing improvement from the first game, still $30 for a 20 hour game felt a bit steep. I really hope Moon studios makes another game! (Hopefully a bigger one next time, its really sad to see such awesome mechanics and gameplay go bye so fast)",1620108282,1673348210,True,0,0,0.47999998927116394,0,True,False,False

That's still the case for Ori and the will of the wisps but it's definitely in my top 5 and is an incredible game worthy of your time and a better game than it's predecessor. 

Positives 

I thought Ori and the blind forest was a god looking game but they have managed to top that, this is an incredible looking game with a fantastic artstyle and really good biome diversity, it's insane how good this looks and it will age like wine. 

Again with the OST, they've managed to make something better than before and it's incredible. 

I was worried this game would just be more of the same as the first game when it came to the story and to be fair the start of the game does feel like a retread but I'm thankful this game really comes into it's own. We have a similar but not less impactful plot, many new npcs with side quests and personal stories and a hub that's can be explored for secrets and upgraded. 

It's a much longer game but still doesn't outstay it's welcome. I've played both for roughly the same amount of time but will of the wisps definitely felt a little longer but again didn't outstay it's welcome. 

Combat is better and feels more satisfying, in blind forest it was merely passable but here it is a lot more fun engaging with enemies.
Save system is better this time around, requires less micro management. 

Negatives 

It can feel a but samey with the plot but really for me that's not really an issue especially considering the ending 

Ummm I can't think of anything else, it's that good. 

Conclusion 

This really is a masterpiece and a rare example of a sequel being a massive improvement on the first, this isn't just a gateway game for metroidvanias, this is a gateway game into computer games in general. Whilst it's not my favourite this is an important game of the genre and will be held forever as a timeless classic, just remember to grab the tissues again.",1673340852,1673340852,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Keep in mind that this review is coming from a KBM perspective, and while my overall opinion of this game is positive, I have highlighted (or 'nitpicked' if you would like to consider it that way) several major issues that I take with this game that greatly contributed to my frustration and detracted from my enjoyment of Ori 2.

Don't get me wrong - Ori and the Will of the Wisps is an absolutely beautifully crafted game, with extraordinary soundtracks, breathtaking graphics, an stunning visuals. The introduction of the weapon system is a breath of fresh air, and the animation in-game is just as captivating. Nevertheless, I cannot help but be disappointed by how much this Hollow Knight-esque combat system detracted from its original format, and that is the platforming aspect with Ori's signature ""Bash"" at its core.

While working just like it did in the first game, the Bash's charm has lost its entire purpose other than serving the sole goal of solving platforming challenges. In the first game, we had to redirect projectiles as our way to deal with hostile mobs, and and juggle between many projectiles (or one multiple times) in order to solve the platform puzzles. Here, the weapons take up much of the combat, and while it is masterfully animated, there are major issues which detracts from my enjoyment.

Firstly, while the main weapon can lock onto a target and executes the full combo when connecting the first hit, the direction of your attack is determined by the direction you are facing, and not the direction of your mouse. Of course, this is coming from a KBM player, and thus I am sure the system works well for controller players. However, as Ori is, at its core, a platformer, players should be granted some form of combat forgiveness that would make the combat system more fun rather than frustrating to be hit because you are locked into an animation when the attack goes the wrong way.

This auto-target (or lack of) system brings me to my second point, and that is how the game treats your movements - in a game that is overly encumbered by it. There are way too many different movement commands in Ori, and not only does the game not tell you the extent to which you are execute these moves (namely, dashing through dirt platforms - which ultimately is a minor discomfort once learnt, but still), it tries to predict your move by auto selecting objects within range to facilitate the flow of actions. Now, when it works, it works great, however, when it doesn't, it creates major frustrations where the game will pull you in one direction or force you to dash in mid-air when you are trying to dash through a platform or grapple to a different object that your cursor is covering over.

Lastly but not least, the story is decent, but not outstanding, and the game-play pales in comparison to the first game. The section with the bird-riding is short and could have been explored a lot more if not for story purposes, while the platforming difficulty is significantly lacking in creativity as more attention is given to mob-fighting and not solving puzzles. In the end, this creates a shallow Hollow Knight feel with a shadow of Ori's former platforming greatness, as Ori 2 tries to accomplish both but fails to do either one great.

In the end, Ori and the Will of the Wisps is still a great game that I would recommend picking up for anybody who enjoyed the first game. The nostalgia factor is strong, and I applaud its attempt at integrating something new, even though the execution of said system could have been done a lot better in favor of player satisfaction rather than artificial difficulty over poor combat optimization.",1673214397,1673214397,True,4,0,0.583377599716186523,0,True,False,False

There was no disappointment either.  Ori and the Will of the Wisps is everything a sequel should be: the same foundational gameplay mechanics but expanded and improved upon.

To start, the gameplay was essentially only made better.  While the first game seemed to have a pretty weak combat system only there because it had to be, Will of the Wisps seemed to revamp the entire system and make it actually engaging versus mashing the same attack button over and over again.  The addition of shards made combat a bit more strategic as well, as the player could actually select power-ups to complement their strategy.  The introduction of boss fights and gauntlets further legitimized this new facet.  Overall, this was a huge improvement that added a lot to the game.  What I personally adored about the first game was the creativity that came with movement, and this game certainly improved on that.  It was not just more movement that I liked, but rather each new mechanic immediately tested the player's ability to combine multiple movements to reach the objective.  Boss fights often consisted of ""escape platforming"" which was great in this game as it was in the first.  Other miscellaneous aspects like quests and optional areas made the game more interesting to explore as well.

There were some minor objections to certain aspects of gameplay...notably just Spirit Trials.  The concept itself is actually really fun and challenges the quick platforming skills players are required to have, but the spike of difficultly between this and the rest of the game is absurd.  I would rather fight the final boss ten times before doing the hardest Spirit Trials.  I am so glad I completed the one in Baur's Reach when I did because I was about two retries from losing my damn mind.  Yes, it gets easier with more practice using movement mechanics, but the spike of difficulty is more what I take issue with.

As with the first game, I did not really care for the story.  It is a bit trite and not really the most compelling, but it does not need to be for me to enjoy the game.  I will compliment the level design this time around.  The distinct areas were beautiful and fun to explore.  The unique gimmicks of each area rarely became tedious.  Finding the NPCs for certain quests gave players a reason to come back.

I have very few complaints about this game.  This is a solid Metroidvania game with enjoyable platforming.  Ori games have definitely been some of my favorite to complete in the past few years.",1673127998,1673128098,True,0,0,0,2,True,False,False

Quests didnt catch my interest and felt a little like shallow side stories. I get to think that taking what was taken away to make space for this new features was not worth taking.

It may be a detail, but it still bugs me that Shriek is born with the bones when her fathers are regular Owls. Felt like the symbolism was a little forced there.

This game takes everything that made Blind Forest great, and dials it up to 11. The visuals are absolutely breathtaking, this is by far the most beautiful game I've ever played, and probably ever will. Unless they make another one. The music is on par with the art. I would buy this game just as an art book. Luckily, it also comes with a fantastic game.

The main improvements this game made over Blind Forest were definitely to the combat, though. The addition of a dodge, as well as much more refined and responsive melee combat instead of spamming a ranged attack all game, is absolutely glorious. Adds so much depth to the gameplay it's silly. 

There is also an added perk system, where you can mix and match different passive abilities you obtain to suit your desired playstyle. 

Just like the first game, the platforming is really tight, and the world is very fun to explore. Only this time, it's significantly bigger, with side quest objectives to give you extra incentive to explore everything. 

100% a must-play video game. This one is getting recommended to everybody I know. Thank you Moon Studios, for releasing this masterpiece. We are undeserving of the effort that went into this title, but I am so glad it happened regardless.

I was greatly pleased to find ""Ori and the Will of the Wisps"" fixed all of my criticisms of the original; this sequel is pretty much perfect. Some ways this improves on the original:

* Much longer. The original took about 12 hours to 100%, yet I'm at 18 hours on this one and am not quite 100%. The speed-running achievement has been bumped up to 4 hours, although I imagine it will be harder to get than the 3 hour achievement from the original. The map is much larger with more areas and variety of environments.

* Legitimately a metroidvania. The original played like a platformer with metroidvania elements, whereas the sequel can honestly be called a metroidvania. The level design is much improved and Ori gains a greater selection of powers for fighting enemies and getting around, on par with Super Metroid's great design.

* More emphasis on combat. Whereas the original didn't have any real boss battles, the sequel has legitimate boss encounters. The run-or-die escape sequences are still there (typically right before the battle), but they're not nearly as painful. The level designers have seriously toned down the instant death traps, with many things that were lethal in the original just causing damage in the sequel.

* The quicksave mechanic has been discarded. In the original you had to manually quicksave constantly to prevent an instant death trap from erasing all of the powerups you had collected since the last save. The sequel automatically saves every screen, which is a serious quality-of-life upgrade. Likewise, the linear upgrade tree has been replaced with shops, providing better customization.

* Better cast, better plot. You interact with an extended cast of characters, most of whom talk and have unique personalities. The race of lemur-like critters are absolutely adorable. Rather than just one god tree, this forest is home to half a dozen giant, wise beast gods. The plot is more bittersweet than the original ‚Äî irreversibly bad things happen frequently and things don't work out perfectly for everyone. The story still isn't all that deep, but it's a suitable fairy tale.

Overall, this is the best metroidvania I have played in a long time. It eclipses ""Ori and the Blind Forest"" in scope and is well worth the time and money. I absolutely recommend it.",1672916624,1672917421,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game features improved graphics that are even more breathtaking than the first, with detailed environments and character designs that are a joy to behold.

One of the standout features of Ori and the Will of the Wisps is its outstanding boss fights, which are challenging and varied, and require a combination of quick reflexes and strategic thinking to defeat. The game's story is also emotional and impactful, delving deeper into the lore of the world of Nibel and the relationships between its characters.

In terms of gameplay, Ori and the Will of the Wisps builds upon the already incredibly fluid platforming of the first game, with new abilities and power-ups to unlock and a greater emphasis on combat.

I much preferred the first, because it was much more focused in its direction, but I could not help but notice the ideas picked up from Hollow Knight and similar games. It did round out Ori and the Will of the Wisps to be a better overall journey, and the complexity and timing of some of the stunts you have to pull to loot everything didn't lose out because of it. 

[b]Exploration[/b]: In terms of general traversal and puzzle-solving I think Ori and the Will of the Wisps is fairly challenging. [spoiler]The speed trials are not difficult but some direction (other than an initial cinematic) might have helped, instead of practising till perfect every time, showing just how trial-and-error the whole design philosophy seems to be.[/spoiler] Quest icons being where the player picked them up, instead of showing where to go, is a really strange decision; it threw me off quite a bit sometimes, especially for the [spoiler]Hand to Hand[/spoiler] quest. Honestly some quests would do better to just stay in the text form on the Map screen, without showing a 'false' location. I'm sure I did some puzzles a little more easily than others, and I may have over-complicated others with precision that wasn't necessary, if I'd just looked for the more obvious solution. There was one map bug where I was stuck on 97% in Kwolok's Hollow due to a light orb not showing on the map, once all secrets were revealed. This was solved by simply relaunching the game. Monsters aren't challenging though some can be annoying if you don't have the right abilities and shards chosen (especially those goddamn [spoiler]Hopping Mantises[/spoiler]. 

[b]Boss Fights[/b]: There's value in saying that stepping away from a fight and letting muscle memory and hindsight is a good stance to take, but a really good fight shouldn't require too much guesswork and trial-and-error. In fact, a lot of the bosses felt like that. The checkpoints in a boss fight are generous, and the game doesn't put you far back, but I feel like that's a band aid over a bigger problem. Every chase, every fight, is a huge rush to figure out what you're dealing with and how to deal with it. Overall the boss designs look gorgeous and a well-choreographed one can look cinematic and appealing, but as the player constantly struggling to figure out exactly what the right strategy is, it gets frustrating. A huge part of this is because the visual clues are [b]too[/b] stylised. It's actually the visual design of the final boss fight that completely ruined the entire experience for me. [spoiler]Specifically, in the third phase with Shriek, there's very little to clue you in on what exactly is going on. You have to figure out that Shriek is swooping in on you, that you need to stay airborne, and the billowing smoke on all sides of the screen makes it tough to really keep an eye out on where Ori is and what his position is in relation to the edges of the screen. I could never tell how much space I had to work with. Maybe zooming out and keeping a fixed camera for this fight would be good? Nothing else would need to be changed. The mechanics of the fight certainly are good on paper, in my opinion, but they clash severely with the graphical design, again too stylised for its own good.[/spoiler] 

[b]Story[/b]: No spoilers here, the ending is worth it. Even though every fibre in my body was tingling with rage and anger and my controller was half broken (I'm only that kind of gamer [i]sometimes[/i]...), I actually think they closed out the game really nicely. It's an unexpected twist that's rather gut-wrenching and heart-warming at the same time.",1672780988,1672781066,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

An even then the environments these graphics depict are just kinda 'generic places in real life but in weird colors'. There's not location in this game that I remember just for it's beauty.

I like hard games that challenge my skills and make me feel accomplished when I overcome said challenges, while Ori's challenges are frustrating and I only feel relieved when I 'overcome' them instead of fulfilled. And I feel as if this game is trying way too hard to look beautiful and feel grandiose with it's orchestral score, you can't force greatness and Ori does just that. And in terms of gameplay it feels too floaty, I don't zip from one place to the next while calculating where I need to land. I jump and have to coast and fidget so I land where I need to. And this floatiness becomes most egregious during the game's bosses. The boss between Kwolok especially. This is a very specific comparison but it feels like a boss fight I'd try to make in Mario Maker when I was 10, feels cool and fun to play in my head but when I get around to making it the boss is clunky boring and kills you too much for no fault of your own. It feels like the game as a whole is trying to be like Hollow Knight but it fails in every single way. I don't connect to characters or the game's story.

I had this game on my list since they announced it; I wanted to play it, but it was not my priority, so I procrastinated for almost three years.
When I came home for the holidays, I was so bored that I had to play anything, and I chose this.
The art style, the music and the environment are just outstanding, but everyone knows that. Like the first game, ""Ori and the Will of the Wisps"" can be played just for these factors, and it would not disappoint.
There is a learning curve, but I recommend it to people new to gaming or who want a break from life or work. This title flows very well, even on other platforms.
The story is simple, not perfect, but good enough to enjoy, even if it didn't drive me much. I preferred playing to experience the world instead of living the story.
Exploration was the best aspect of the game for me. The world kept getting bigger and bigger the more I explored it. I got frustrated at some point because I was only concentrating on finishing it, and I almost searched for a guide. Still, it hit me: you must immerse yourself in it. I couldn't find the right way, but it didn't matter; I had other places to explore and discover. Eventually, I found the right way, and it was very satisfying.
Another big satisfying thing is escaping from the bosses/predators. Moving gets smoother and smoother, and being fast is another joy in this awesome game.

That's It; give this game an opportunity you'll not regret.

Let's conclude first: it's a great value for money work of art, and yes, I say this game is a work of art

When you enter the game, you will first be attracted by the beautiful scene, each screenshot can be made into high-quality wallpaper, whether it is the background or interactive items are very exquisite, our ori elves are also very cute, and the background music is also outstanding.

In terms of plot, the description is also very clear, the plot is not procrastinating, and there are even scenes that make you can't help but cry, and the two-sided nature of the characters is also reflected, especially the villain will also make you hate but also feel sorry for its experience (further down will be a spoiler haha)

I play the normal mode, and I personally think that the game is moderately difficult and easy to master for novice players. The difficulty of exploration, puzzle solving, parkour, and combat is also well controlled, and if you fail the first attempt and don't finish it, you can pass it with a few practice. The game's save points are designed to be user-friendly, so you won't be forced to start from scratch if you fail at the end. The game's platform jump is also a major feature, and some places may be a little difficult, but you can easily pass it with more practice. The combat system is also very interesting, and by combining different skills and abilities, you can increase the damage effect with less effort.

It is worth mentioning that the cute art style of the game makes it relatively easy to accept insects such as spiders that are usually scary, and will not make people get goosebumps after seeing it haha:)

Anyway, this is my favorite game of all time.

I honestly don‚Äôt even know where to start. The story? The gameplay? The godtier music?

I suppose I‚Äôll start with the story. Spoilers for Blind Forest and the start of Will of the Wisps, obviously.

Continuing from the events of the first game, Ori‚Äôs family has adopted the owl chick Ku into the family. Ku was hatched mostly healthy, but she has one lame wing that prevents her from flying. Ori and Ku are incredibly close, and one day Ori finds one of Kuro‚Äôs feathers. They tie it to Ku‚Äôs lame wing, giving Ku the ability to finally fly. The two go flying out over the ocean, but they get caught in a storm. Ku‚Äôs new feather comes loose, and Ori and Ku get separated, crash-landing in the forest of Niwen. As Ori, you must find a way to reunite with Ku while redtoring balance to the forest of Niwen. Along the way, you‚Äôll meet a colorful cast of characters and take down a variety of threats that have been corrupted by Niwen‚Äôs destabilization.

I‚Äôll grant you that it‚Äôs a pretty basic story, all things considered, but it is no less emotional for it. The first time I played through the game, the ending genuinely made me cry, which is saying a lot, since I was at a point in my life where I didn‚Äôt let myself feel much emotion, positive or negative.

Between story beats, you‚Äôll be exploring the forest of Niwen and its many varied locales. You‚Äôll explore the architecture of the Wellspring, the gorgeous Luma Pools, the panic-inducing Mouldwood Depths, the unsettling Silent Woods, the beautifully glacial Baur‚Äôs Reach, and the scorching Windswept Wastes. Niwen is gorgeous to look at and exhilarating to explore.

While exploring, you‚Äôll get to experience movement and combat that have been completely revamped since the first game. While their basic movement still feels largely the same, floaty but responsive, Ori‚Äôs kit is otherwise largely unrecognizable from before, especially combat. You‚Äôll still be Bashing off of enemies and projectiles, but now you‚Äôve got things like a short Dash, burrowing, and more to aid traversal. And in terms of combat, Sein is gone, replaced by a variety of Spirit weapons, including a sword, hammer, shuriken, javelin, and more. As such, combat is now much snappier and more involved than before, requiring careful spacing and timing while dodging enemy attacks. It‚Äôs a massive improvement, enough that I don‚Äôt think I could ever go back to Blind Forest‚Äôs combat.

All of the above is worthy enough of a purchase on its own, but where Ori and the Will of the Wisps truly shines is in its incredible soundtrack. I‚Äôve never experienced such a masterful soundtrack before or since, even including Blind Forest. The game‚Äôs primary theme has a few key phrases that are woven into every. Single. Song. From start to finish, you‚Äôll be hearing those heavenly chords and vocals incorporated into every theme and boss fight in the most pleasing ways possible. There‚Äôs nothing else quite like it. Even if you don‚Äôt decide to play the game, please, *please* listen to the soundtrack.

I have nothing but praise for this game. If I had the time and wasn‚Äôt worried about spoilers, I could write about Will of the Wisps for hours.",1672182707,1672182707,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

On a serious note, this game was so unbelievably good, just like the first but in my humble opinion, a bit better. The story was very well done and the ending was such a perfect fit for it. I loved the world design and the darker feel that the game had. The best mechanics from the first game were present, along with a variety of new skills and abilities, some of which I loved and some which I struggled with, but I made it through, so it was all fine. The combat system is entirely different from the first game, and while it took some getting used to, I have come to love it, as it gives the game as a whole a much better feel. Another new addition was npcs and side quests, as well as little time trial and combat challenges that allow for upgrades. The variety in skills and upgrades to equip was very refreshing and allowed lots of customization for the experience of the game. The boss fights were spectacular, and the music and art were perfect as always.

I was(and still am) invested in Ori and its journey throughout the two games and the cause it fights for, if you like nature you owe it to yourself to experience both Ori games, but enough about emotion how does it play.

Will of the Wisps is a step up in just about every way to the original, improving combat greatly while adding and refining the already genre defining movement and traversal mechanics, Ori feels better than ever to control and just traversing the world is a joy, subsequently makes backtracking and 100% completion a lot less of a chore than most metroidvanias.

Ori and the Will of the Wisps is still a pale shadow in comparison with a number of rough edges to the gameplay, but it improves sufficiently compared to Ori and the Blind Forest - primarily in how it has learned from Hollow Knight to inform its own game design - that I feel comfortable recommending it as a fine introduction for less experienced players.

It's also important to make clear that I didn't care for the story. It's just not for me and I was here for the game. The recommendation is in part assuming that if you're looking into the game you like the look of the aesthetics and the narrative.

As a somewhat more experienced player (I wouldn't even say I'm particularly good), I still found it a little too easy to be really satisfying, with my first time playthrough being on hard mode and using spirits to make it harder still (reckless and bounty) and still found my way to 100% without breaking much of a sweat outside of the occasional frustrating platforming section where the mechanics didn't feel right or I couldn't work out where to go next in a rush, which made the bumper number of escape sequences incredibly unwelcome and an easy low light of the game. I'm welcome to believe this is more a skill issue than it being unintuitive, but it made the game less fun either way.

Combat, while still too simplistic, is much better than Blind Forest, and the game even has some honest to god boss fights where you need to pay meaningful attention to attack patterns. The autosaving function could use a little more polish, but it's head and shoulders better than the original. The use of spirits this game has really helped with flexibility over playstyle.

That said, it went a stage too far with abilities, where you can flexibly set a number of powers to three action buttons, but with Attack and Heal being two of those it feels like for the average player most of the game is spent reassigning the third button to whatever action is relevant to the current area, and it feels even more restrictive later as more useful movement actions become available but you can't always keep equipped due to needing to use something else. Given that some controller buttons went unused and one was used solely to change abilities (instead of being in a menu), there are far neater ways this could have been handled.",1671467654,1671467654,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I don't care if you do or don't like platforming, there is so much to this game and its simply majestic. I never did play the first Ori game, but from what I understand this game is that, but more (especially combat). There is so much progression and very little grinding. You always feel like you're getting new abilities which allow you to explore more areas and finish more puzzles. The puzzles are satisfying and not too hard. You will need some level of basic platforming skills, but take it from me (a non-platformer) when I say that it wasn't too hard. The difficulties in the game mainly adjust the combat aspect of the game, giving enemies and bosses more health and damage. I played on normal, which I suspect is what most people should play on unless they want tougher combat. But the real satisfaction from the game isn't rooted in the combat. Its rooted in constant upgrades, new platforming abilities, beautiful music and the most eye-candy graphics with such a dreamy art style that I have ever seen. I don't think there is very many people who wouldn't enjoy this game, and the reviews for this tell that story. The only thing negative I could say about the game is that I never wanted it to end.

For one, in this game you don't actually NEED to buy a map, you can construct it yourself no problem. Just explore.

As for the combat mechanics... They are awesome. Slashing away at enemies and hammering those damn purple slime things into oblivion as the cutest damn marshmallow ever just feels... Therapeutic. 

Puzzle-wise, some parts will have you thinking for a while, while others will just be timing-based, some easy and some harder to pull off. The puzzles i think are satisfying in their own way.

As for the story... Oh damn. i still refuse to own the damn end achievement. Call me extreme, whatever. The ending came at me like a cannonball, and i do not appreciate it. I still refuse to consider it canon (Yes i'm overly sensitive at this point, but this is the only game that had me so attached to a character ever... :') )

Conclusion: Awesome game. in (almost) every aspect. well worth the price.

(Previous Review: ""For the sake of my own mental health after falling in love with these games and their characters, I will never in a million years consider this game to have happened or be canon in any way. Or at least, not the ending. I have my own headcanon and nothing will change that ever.

The new Fight mechanics and the puzzles are awesome (for me), but... That story, That ending. No.

This game never happened. 

I refuse to bear the ""Achievement"" of finishing the game.

Ori and the will of the whisps does what Ori and the blind forest did only more and better.  
More zones, more skills more stuff to do.

It however suffers the sequel syndrome where it's afraid to innovate rather than just enhance. 
Little owlet was perfectly fit to be a playable character with it's own skill set and challenges, keeping game fresh for players  of the first instalment who already saw majority of Ori's moveset there. But nope, she gets relegated to plot device and once again it's Ori-only experience. 

Another small irk is how the game rewards exploration and completion with currency and upgrades to Ori, but nothing in terms of lore. There are not small tidbits of information to be discovered on your own, let alone ground shaking truths that completely change perspective on your endevour and role in the world once learned, not to mention any hidden endings based on your performance. Story wise Ori is a very linear experience.

These do not detract from it being an amazing experience in gameplay and even more so for the eyes, well worth the buy. But greatness could be achieved while it was partially shunned in name of safety.",1671321137,1671321137,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

First thing English isn't my first language so sorry for the butchering!

I am a big fan of the first Ori, it's the only game I ever wrote a review on steam and this one deserves the same! This game took everything that made the first one special, the graphics, the music, the story and the gameplay and made it bigger and better. I recommend this game to everyone, it's not just another generic platformer, It's a unique experience that as amazing combat, music and a very touching story! Experience that as amazing combat, music and a very touching story!

- The visuals are as beautiful and colorful as ever, I caught myself stopping often just to look around and take in the world that studio Moon created. Every different biome of this game is breathtaking and made me want to explore more.

-The music is one of my favorite in gaming, its beautiful, its powerful and its dramatic. Every big moment in this game is made even better by the music that accompanies it. I ain't the type of person who usually puts a lot of attention in music, in games, but these games have such beautiful and impactful songs that have made these games unforgetable ones.

- For the gameplay, I really love that they tried something new, the first game's combat was really good, but this one is even better, more weapons/skills to fight. The combat is fast and impactful, every hit is felt by the player and it as so many way's to fight different foes that I didn't use certain types of skills in my first playthrough. Fair warning I did feel like this game was way harder than the first one, I felt like the boss fights we're rough if you didn't take the time to grind for upgrades.

Ori gets an arsenal of weapons. The game just keeps feeding you with new abilities. Sounds nice yet you get no chance to explore---not even a single weapon's limit---before the game gives you something new or before all of a sudden the story just ends. On the other hand, the bow thing just happen to get powerful upgrades yet many other weapons just happen to be neglected and remain what it is the time you bought it. Yeah, weapons you bought are less likely to play a main role in combats. They are the representation of shallowness. They need more reasons to exist in this game. Not to mention the chaotic boss fights. Bosses' moves are not that indicative, and the hitboxes are not that clear. Plus that ori usually stands still to do damage, it's just not a good experience to do a boss like a pro, avoiding attacks and then fight back. Players rather feel, ""that hit on me was not fair"", ""I'm not doing it fairly either. I can beat it by just spamming attack."" In the end, it's ambitious to design a combat system like this, but sadly everything feels cheap and shallow.

About gameplay, it's totally disintegrated from the story. Game feels like saving the world, yet the story is about reviving an owl. The game assumes that players will develop a sense of mercy after watching their nicely made intro animation, depicting how ori plays well with the owl. Then will be okay for the game to be entirely not focused on the owl anymore. Most players coming out of a fascinating adventure from luma pools wont remember a bit about their mission of saving an owl. Not only because the game is negligent of this, but also because the player spent too little time with the owl. There is no feelings, no attachment, no pity for the owl just dies.",1641936481,1671135719,False,2,1,0.425806432962417603,0,True,False,False

Not just because it can be frustratingly difficult to get past some levels without the right abilities without dying multiple times, but the story itself and the atmosphere that accompanies it! Gerard Khalil (aka The Completionist) was right! Much of the story is what you feel when watching the introduction to Pixar's ""Up""! Even the antagonist is someone who is relatable! Hell, I cried harder for the final boss than I did for Ku, and that's saying something because Ku is a bright-eyed little owl who is not only Ori's little sister, but also his best friend who went on this journey together!

Does the money-to-time-spent ratio make the game worth it? If you have that mentality, then no. Although I would recommend that the mentality of Trade Prince Gallywix get dropped because as Jynzee from Proper Bird put it: ""The length of a game is, on the whole, irrelevant.

If you enjoyed the first game, you will LOVE this game. 

As for a Metroidvania game, this game really brings the spirit of the journey, and the trials and tribulations that naturally follow the genre, to life. The adventure is there, you will not find all the collectables easily on a first playthrough although there are elements to help you find said collectables. The combat is fun due to a mix of different abilities (using varying amounts of energy depending on the strength of the ability) and, although the melee combat isn't as naturally platformer-based as Hollow Knight, the combat is unique in its own regard and provides extreme satisfaction when combined with the movement. The movement is much more free flowing than the likes of HK, allowing a significantly higher range of motion during and outside of combat -  I even refrained from unlocking a fast travel option for quite some time, due to enjoying the movement so much.

I played on Hard mode and I will attest that the difficulty was pretty challenging at times, but not hard enough to where it became overly frustrating. There ARE boss battles and as long as you have the patience to learn the move-set, it will be extremely rewarding when you finally succeed (I did all boss fights in approximately 15 mins, on average).
(I also suggest playing on Hard mode if you enjoy challenging platformers - the difficulty is worth it, in my opinion)

I appreciated this game so much that I used all of the abilities at my disposal to zoom around the map for that satisfying 100% profile (which I rarely have the energy to do) as soon as I completed the story. Unlocking an ability and instantly going to certain areas previously unreachable felt extremely fun, truly living up to the excitement the genre can hold.

Highly recommend this game to anybody who loves Metroidvania titles, especially so if you favour them for exploration and movement - the combat is an extremely sweet cherry on top, more fun than competitive.",1670985113,1670985910,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Will of the Wisps for me was well, story wise stuff was going by WAY too fast, didn't let things stick to the wall for a little bit. It's still GOOD in a sense, but it needs improvements to make it really shine for me personally.

Otherwise everything else, honestly amazing, solid. Still a must play.

The challenges were difficult enough to be interesting but the game is forgiving enough that a beginner would not get overly frustrated either. The first Ori game was my first video game experience ever and viewing this one through my newbie eyes I would definitely still have enjoyed this game if I were a complete gaming beginner. There's also enough differences between this and the first Ori game in terms of enemies and game mechanics that it's pretty much guaranteed to hold a returning player's interest.

Absolutely brilliant once it's running, and a stellar sequel to the original Ori. But I will strongly advise that if you purchase it you download and install immediately and check your computer will run it so you can get a refund immediately if it doesn't.

Completely unplayable. Runs as a jagged, awful mess.

I loved The Blind Forest, and it was absolutely amazing, but this sequel is a complete shambles. I have 13 minutes of ""play"" time. Yet my actual gameplay consisted of pressing left once. The rest of that 13 minutes was waiting for the game to load, hearing it struggle just with the audio, and then attempting to fix it with the settings (which did not fix it in the slightest).

Do not buy at all. I would have a refund, but Steam's refund policy doesn't care about UK law either.",1614559925,1670236049,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

You can expect the same fantastically creative area and puzzle design.

Playing the game with a completionist mindset will grant you a very easy time getting through the final challenge on normal mode.

Like its predecessor, this title introduces a healthy set of multi-dimensional characters (both protagonistic and antagonistic) with very distinct and relatable motivations. The story never feels like an interruption from the game-play and visa versa. It's easy to get sucked in, so be prepared for an emotional conclusion.

Ori is undoubtedly my most favorite title of all time. I am sad that we will likely not see another one, but I am extremely glad that Moon Studios was able to offer this story to us.",1670110218,1670110218,True,1,0,0.507692337036132813,0,True,False,False

Also many action elements are added, many skills and abilities are available in this title. We can pick our favorite skill to build our own favorite fighting style. Some skills are outstandingly useful and maybe that's why I felt this one is much easier than the former title.

The soundtrack alone is amazing, but the game play itself is both vibrant and beautiful. The story is very emotional and keeps you engaged with each passing minute. While you can dive right into Will of the Wisps and get caught up pretty easily, If you're like me and like to understand the whole story then I would HIGHLY recommend playing Part 1 (Ori and the Blind Forest: Definitive Edition). The main story has multiple hours of gameplay involved, and when you add in all of the side-quests and obtainable items, there is so much to do!

As you progress through the story you get new abilities you need to master to continue on, and for every ability the levels change to accommodate your new skills.

There is some back tracking if you want more upgrades, but it always feel rewarding. One minor gripe is the way forward is not always so clear, as some quests needs to be done in a certain order.

Everything that made the former great is still here: Bash is back, as satisfying as ever, and the game thankfully knows to return it to you much sooner than the first game did; it comes alongside a host of well-executed improvements to the combat system, and a host of new abilities to complement Bash, with Grapple and Burrow being, for me, the standout additions. 

    The game is also bigger than its predecessor, with more areas, a grander and more expansive soundtrack, and a larger cast of characters; Ori can hardly turn a corner without bumping into some new NPC to bestow a quest upon him. Usually these quests require Ori to travel to some designated location to pick up or deliver a trinket, and some minor reward accompanies it.

    This, for me, is the first sign of cracks in Will of the Wisps‚Äô armor. If I could describe Blind Forest in a single word, I would use ‚Äúelegant‚Äù. It is focused, streamlined, and tightly designed. Will of the Wisps, for all of its mechanical enhancements and improvements, sacrifices this elegance for scope, and in my opinion not usually to any real benefit. The quests are mostly busywork; they provide you with currency, which you might use to buy a shard or a new weapon technique or an upgrade, but you can complete the game while disregarding almost all of these. What do they add to the experience?

    Much is said in the world of game design these days about so-called player expression. ‚ÄúPlay your way!‚Äù the marketing engines howl, but the problem with accommodating multiple styles of play is that each style is diluted as a result. The game cannot run the risk that I haven‚Äôt bought the spirit hammer, or whatever, and so it can never require me to use it. I have a giant palette of paints to choose from and many styles of brushes, but no real painting is demanded of me; what, then, is the paint for?

    Sadly, this same dilution occurs in the structure itself at the midpoint of the game, where Will of the Wisps seems to take a cue from Breath of the Wild and tells you to complete four areas in any order you like. Again, play your way: nice for marketing perhaps, but this means that the previous game‚Äôs elegant progression of Ori‚Äôs abilities cannot be replicated. The game cannot risk that I haven‚Äôt acquired the Burrow move, so I can never be required to use Burrow in any of the other three areas. Gone is the buildup of powers, gone is the designers‚Äô ability to weave them together in increasingly complex and interesting ways; you get a flashlight here, a burrow or a fireball there, and none of it meshes, synergizes, or works together. This, to me, is a colossal missed opportunity, and cuts against what made the first so satisfying from start to finish. The final area of the game provides a token nod to the kind of cumulative design that might have been - but too little, too late.

    The platforming is still pristine, arguably improved from the first game. The combat is undoubtedly more engaging, challenging, and fun, if bloated with excessive options and unnecessary fat. Once again, I think it would be fair to say Will of the Wisps is the better of the two games, and will find a wider audience than the first. But the elegance has been lost in the process, and the focus. It seems a shame.

This game is just, messy. You get lost easily, it doesn't feel cohesive, the new focus on combat is a questionable decision at best, and a frustrating, unnecessary, awkwardly cobbled-together addition at worst. The visual design is still gorgeous, but it's undermined by the metroidvania nature of the world causing you to have your eyes stuck to the map more often than the world itself. The music is still good, maybe. I say maybe because, again, I can't even take my time soak it in because I'm too busy wracking my brain trying to figure out where the game wants me to go next, what ability it wants me to find and in what order, and also getting used to a constant onslaught on new abilities that each make the previous one basically obsolete.

It really feels weird leaving a negative review on this franchise, but, I suppose with The Blind Forest they caught lightning in a bottle, and couldn't quite replicate it with the sequel as they bloated out the game with a bunch new unnecessary features taken from other popular games (mostly Hollow Knight, really).",1669238611,1669238678,False,0,0,0.454545468091964722,0,True,False,False

This game has totally flied under the radar for me. Had no idea this was on the making, or even planned. I've had Ori and the blind forest on my wishlist for few years, until last year my dear friend gifted it to me. I started playing, and instantly something happened, that has never happened before. I cried at the beginning cutscene. I do not remember crying at a game EVER prior to that.

Obviously when steam recommended this game to me as it is releasing soon, and since i played the previous game i had to get this game. Me loving owls is a huge +++ So of course i had to buy it.  I recently beat ori and the blind forest, and from there jumped straight into this one when it released on wednesday 11.3.2020.

Ever since i first launched the game the story and happenings in the game have been dwelling in my mind nonstop. The story writers definitely knew how to make a touching story, that stays on your mind, even when you stop playing!

The beginning starts happy and got me crying my eyes out from happiness, I was thinking this will be a happier game than the blind forest, but don't let the happy beginning fool you. The happenings in the game are really heartrending and i cannot count how many times i have cried cause of this game. Big points for the story makers!

Lovely visual style! I found myself gazing on the scenery for multiple times throughout the game.
Really emotional! This game has been a huge rollercoaster of emotions!
I would recommend this game 1000000000000 times over if i could! Best money i have spent ever!

Thank you for reading my rant of a review and hopefully it got you consider buying the game, cause i definitely recommend it from the bottom of my broken heart!!

The Story is simple but sweet and effective. Early on, something big happens that leads to the major catalyst of the story and It's motivational and powerful. The gameplay has evolved since the original in a lot of ways and one of the biggest changes is a Zelda-esque ability system. You will unlock new combat abilities fairly often and each one feels fresh, unique, and powerful compared to others. Levels in this game feel unique compared to each other and it feels great to explore previous areas with new abilities.

This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you were supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he helped me. Loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well.

yeah the visuals are even better than the last game, a lot and i mean A LOT of new gameplay mechanics & abilities, more npcs, longer playtime, more epic boss fights & escape sequences, has autosaves now so it isn't annoying to play some place over and over again because you forgot to soul link, and good enough story with loads of new characters and a plot twist.

the bad:
all i can say is since there are too many abilities and a huge map full of collectibles it may be overwhelming to new players, and its a bit inconvenient to choose abilities from a wheel.

There was a good mixture of combat and platformer challenges, and I finally switched to a controller instead of a keyboard and that made it much easier.

The first time I played Ori and the Will of the Wisps I died 460 times. I am working towards completing all of the map, just because I don't really want to be done with this game just yet.

The story is very good, and while some may not like it, it is a cohesive story that tracks well from Ori and the Blind Forest. The devs added just enough new mechanics to the game to make it fun and interesting, however I don't believe it is too much of a change to alter the gameplay style from OBF. Yes, there are changes to how some abilities can be used (some have to be equipped in a charm-like fashion while others are permanent) but overall this did not negatively affect my gameplay with the exception of some early on confusion in Luma Pools. All of the other elements of the game however, quickly overshadow this minor inconvenience and made the experience of Ori and the Will of the Wisps a 10/10 for me.

The story is engaging and enjoyable, it had me invested in the characters within the first couple minutes of play. 
The music was phenomenal! A fantastic score by Gareth Coker and his team that captured the essence of each location and story points. It was stuck in my head for weeks on end, and I didn't even mind.
The escape sequences/boss fights were a bit harder than the rest of the game, but not to the level of Ori: Blind Forest. I wish there was a better way to record/save progress in some of the longer fights.
The collectibles and puzzles were highly enjoyable, the sense of accomplishment was great every time I figured out something.
All the characters were immediately personable and fun, despite little dialogue and limited sound effects. The moki in particular were adorable and funny, and provided some much-needed comic relief through dialogue.

Wish it had something to do after you did everything again other than explore and replay the whole game. In my opinion the game is super easy even in hard mode just how I like. Side quests are short if you know what you doing and as far as I remember, all of them are fetch quests but aren't tedious at all cause I'm so agile as Ori that those side missions would be done in 2 minutes or less. 

The game has a great saving system that I took full advantage of when getting some of these achievements otherwise it would be an unfair request us to do some of the things on the achievement list. This game actually needs is a bit of a better combat system however. I use a total of 5/12 of the tools earned through progression and purchasing in-game but the rest feel pointless to include. Useless end game tools include the light burst and feather (this only includes its ability to blow wind to increase the flames on a fire or blow a stack  of leaves away to see what is underneath that becomes like a used key in a resident evil game that you cant get rid of, not the gliding aspect). 
The most useless tools in the game are the butterflies and shuriken that I dont even want to waste my time talking about. Get rid of this or tweak it to be of any use in the game. The same goes for many of the shards.

Anyway to sum it up, great game, amazing graphics, system menu and saving system is outstanding (just a personal preference) but the game lacks much meaning and purpose after the main story is complete. 
Theres also a lot of dumb shards, abilities and weapon(s) that dont help in terms of gameplay. (I know people hate comparing the two but still hollow knight made better use of charms, abilities and their weapon(). Sorry but overall it still wins and yes, this game does feel like it copied those features too much without thinking of its impact on the gameplay. Straight up facts, dont hate me for it) 

Ranking: 8/10
PS this is also the first game I've given a proper ranking like how I rank my favourite anime. If the flaws mentioned above were to be fixed which idk if that will ever happen as that would mean changing too much about the game then I would give it a 9. The story is also a bit simplistic but that adds to its charm but still keeps it from a perfect 10 in my books.",1667048809,1667048809,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

I end up fighting the controls ori feels.... less responsive than the first, you're juggling many many abilities that you have to assign to buttons rather than them being all assessable from the controller or keyboard, and some of the boss fights are just too random with no balancing at all it feels... there's no way to block or negate 90 percent of them not to mention the fact that some of the bosses are not that easy to understand.

It's not all bad though it is very pretty some things are a bit jank like grass blowing in the wind but other than that I haven't noticed any sort of visual glitches.

pros:
MORE ORI!!!
pretty looking graphics
easy to pick back up after a while

cons:
I feel like I fight the controls every now and then
difficulty spikes are astronomical
the level design can be a little confusing as the layout is more complex and doesn't have the same instant recognizability as the first game
if you get stuck on a boss.... better get good because there are no accessibility options for difficulty that I have found

        [td]Gameplay Loop[/td]
        [td]7[/td]
	[td]Simply an incredible game, while also being one of the most ""AAA"" indie games I've played - in both good ways and bad. On one hand, the platforming and combat are both fun and polished, with some fun escape sequences and boss fights peppered in, which, while not being as challenging as the previous game, feel smoother and more cinematic because they get done in like a try or two. On the other hand, the ""adding MOAARR to Ori"" philosophy permeates other factors, as there's all kinds of NPC questlines where one gives you something you use in another then another and so on, a Hollow Knight-y map guy and charms/notches, ores you use to build the hub town, seeds you use to grow trees, spirit trials and all kinds of shit that def has that ""AAA"" bloaty feel. So while there's a lot of content, there's also a certain lack of direction,, and both the 'increments' def show how the team that worked on this was 4 times larger than the previous game. The sense of exploration sorta gets replaced by a checklist of quests when you open the map. But well, apart from those things and some stuff I'll mention later - it still is a solid AF zero-filler campaign, and the presentation is second to none. I usually take forever to finish games to avoid any fatigue, and this took me like 3 non-stop days, which def says something.[/td]

        [td]Narrative[/td]
        [td]5[/td]
	[td]Might be sort of a hot take, but I've not been too huge a fan of the stories in Ori games. While I love the Disney fairy-tale type beat - they do come across as a little surface-level-emotion-shortcut in a weird way - where everything is wholesome and everyone has cute googly eyes, but that's where the depth very much ends. The story of this part had pretty much the same structure as the previous, as you keep 'freeing the forest from corruption' by tacking different areas - and considering the ending, it def feels like a sound conclusion. What really makes me give it a 5 here doe is that, unlike the previous one which only had a respectable amount of breaks, 'Wisps' halts the gameplay one too many times for random exposition dumps, drawn-out NPC questlines, and ""you can only walk forward"" sections - in true AAA fashion.[/td]

        [td]10[/td]
	[td]If there's one aspect in which Wisps completely outdoes Blind Forest - it's gotta be the mechanics. The previous one already had the innovative bash mechanic. This time around we got dash, sand burrow, water dash, launch and a literal grappling hook - combining into one of the most satisfying traversal I've done in any video game. And hey, the combat's not too comprehensive or anything, but it def achieves that cinematic feeling it's going for.[/td]

        [td]Challenge[/td]
        [td]7[/td]
	[td]While I certainly found the game MUCH easier to play than the first Ori, with the escape sequences and boss fights all being 1-2 tries, hence it not feeling ""too"" challenging or deep - but it def results in flashy, epic, satisfying sequences that work in the game's favor. Just wish they'd at least pushed the boundaries of the platforming mechanics in this one as they did in the first game. It felt slightly underdeveloped despite being extremely fun for what we did get.[/td]

	[td]Literally no complaints here. While there's an argument to be made that there's ""too much"" in way of quests, redundant abilities, and collectibles - the variety in movement mechanics and crisp pacing with the set pieces and boss fights are incredible.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]Mapping[/td]
        [td]7[/td]
	[td]The level design is great and utilizes the abilities etc. really well. The ""world"" design feels kinda eh to me though. It all felt like video game levels with trees placed just because of game reasons alone, rather than making too much sense as a cohesive world that would exist outside of its purpose of serving me. The map you buy literally marks everything from the area's ability down to breakable floors - removing any residual sense of adventure IMO. Despite being a nonlinear go your way experience - it felt strangely ""on a track"" all the time. But I guess that's what this game needed, and works for its crisp length.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]Sound[/td]
        [td]8[/td]
	[td]There is a common bug I encountered where cutscenes/setpieces would cause an annoying ass buzzing noise. Tried many online solutions, finally worked when I disabled the spatial sound, until several hours in which lead to a pretty shoddy audio experience. The music is great, even doe I feel the most memorable track I heard was actually the same one from Ori 1 lol.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]Interface[/td]
        [td]6[/td]
	[td]While the UI etc. was clean and all - I do have a gripe. The control scheme was borderline atrocious. You are  responsible for assigning abilities to either X, Y or B from the wheel. Now, X will pretty much be the sword. Y will be the ability you need in the level possibly, or maybe the hammer - and heal on the B. So it pretty much cockblocks you out of almost any experimentation. And in certain area, I actually found myself having to go to the wheel, then assign an ability, then do it, then change it back when I needed something else. Extremely annoying, when they simply had the entire dpad just lying there unsused. Stuff like the heal, and other passive-y abilities could easily be put there.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]Pricing & Performance[/td]
        [td]8[/td]
	[td]I'd go an easy 5 on Pricing and 3 on Performance. There's def random frame freezes even when the FPS was 100+ during certain set pieces etc. and I've heard of others having the issue as well. And of course there's the audio issues I described.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]Replay Value [/td]
        [td]8[/td]
	[td]I can def see myself going back to the game for the sheer fun of the movement and mechanics alone.[/td]

[b] Pros [/b] :-
* Controls are great, offers a fluid gameplay
* Gorgeous art style/ graphics
* Great soundtrack
* Nice story

[b] Cons [/b] :-
* I observed around 20 crashes during my first 10 hours of playtime. There were no frame rate drops though. Later, I didn't observe much crashes, maybe because of an update? But the CPU utilisation  and temperature were pretty high for a 2D platformer, so not sure whether it is well optimized. 
* [i] Nitpick [/i]: If you want 100% achievements, you will start hating this game. There is an achievement for which you should not die in the entire game. I mean, this is a platformer, dying is pretty much unavoidable in some boss chase sequences and some parts. Due to bad luck, sometimes, ledge detection / object grab might not work as expected and you may die, then, you have to start a new game to again try for this achievement, just to die again and start a new game again. Steam says only 1% have this achievement, out of which most of them cheated using achievement cheat softwares or downloading completed save files. Achievements should provide a reasonable challenge rather than being frustrating and borderline impossible. 

  That being said, this is one of the best platformers out there. Even if you are a 100% achievement enthusiast, I would still recommend this game.",1631357091,1666776389,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

Actually its so addicting and satisfying to just move around the world, i ended up getting a 100% for collectibles. 

Doesnt feel very grindy, you'll eventually hav enough to get all the abilities by just exploring and completing quests. (only if u wanna max them all out, then maybe you'll need some grind)

Even the cheap and hackneyed ways the story tugs at heartstrings feels manipulative, disingenuous, *marketable*. In short, it's Pixaresque. It's funny (that's not quite the right word, is it?) that I felt this way before it was revealed that Moon Studios was oozing with workplace abuses. I am not trying to say everyone involved in making the Ori games was some kind of sleazebag, but it's not surprising that a studio piloted by certain sleazebags would produce the video game equivalent of a Radio Friendly Unit Shifter. It's a game that feels designed to sell copies and be awarded 9/10s by tasteless media presences. It's a bland game with boring ideas.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.

Truly a masterpiece in the video gaming industry. I would highly recommend purchasing this game and its predecessor as soon as you can. It's worth way more than what you pay for it, and it tells a wonderful tale of family, friendship, helping others, and, in the end, sacrifice. I would immediately buy another Ori project should Moon Studios come out with another one. I wholeheartedly believe that this game earns the right to be game of the year, and if not this, then the first game. Everything about it is so wonderful and rich and beautiful that words cannot express my feelings about it properly. I only hope that I may one day create a tale as compelling and story driven as Ori, characters so rich in lore and excellence that I could achieve even a fraction of what the Ori franchise has given to this world.

Thank you, Moon Studios, for all your hard work in this excellent game. I don't think I'll be forgetting it soon, if ever. You are one of the few people who can actually make me cry, and one of the few I can truly appraise without seeing any faults in your creations. I can only hope that one day, I may achieve something even slightly comparable to what you have made. Until then though, I'll be taking my leave.

And to you, Ori, who now lives on as the protector of Niwen and the giver of its life... I hope you're happy where you are. I'm sad your final adventure had to take place outside your home, but at least you've done something truly remarkable in your world. You are a wonderful spirit, and you truly deserve the title of a hero.",1666144615,1666144615,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

What I got: A phanominal and respectable metroidvania with the most polished platforming in it's genre.
Ori knows both it's strong points and it's weak points, and uses them both at the just right amounts to stitch together a simply impressive gameplay loop that would at first seem simple on the surface.
While Ori isn't hard, it's also not the walk in the park I anticipated and provides an adequete challenge for any player regardless of skill level.
The story is pretty uninspired however, and is simply there as an obligation to show off it's gameplay polish, artstyle, and soundtrack.

- Story was similar to the first game, corrupted land and you as a spirit are the chosen one cause everyone else are useless and the ending was neat.
- Same as the first game the movement and combat system feels very polished. They have added a lot of new stuff to Ori instead of that annoying flying orb which is great.
- The achievement system is very clear. I never was confused and knew what to do with each one, Thank you as some games think the player is a Dev and he needs to full stack every code line, I dont need to guess !
- The con I gave about the map from the previous game was actually fixed in this one, YOU CAN RESIZE THE MAP IMAGINE !

Cons:
- For some reason the devs think the player base is either too disabled to handle more than 3 skills binding or was this intentional ? never the less it made me rebind during fights which is annoying. Let me bind all my skills and I do as I wish.
- Some of the quests should have a little hint because ""Look for someone who wants a hat"" is not enough. My first guess was the sand realm which has a lot of sand and sun but imagine that the guy inside a house with a shade, great...

While it took a bit of a step towards expectations, with more combat elements and traditional boss fights, it still keeps a lot of what made it unique, including a chase scene at the end of each level and the return of the iconic Bash mechanic (this time much earlier in the game).

The graphics are gorgeous, especially the prevalent water effects. The music helps set the mood, ranging from quiet and melancholy to intense and predatory. The world you are exploring is large and the environments vary greatly. The story starts where the original left off, immediately leaves you crushed (as Ori is want to do), and continues taking you on a rollercoaster from start to finish.

Controlling Ori is a delight, with movement being highly animated, quick and fluid as you dodge and weave through your environment. The combat system is a lot more robust than the original, but not as strong as in some games of the same genre (it‚Äôs still not the focus). The platforming, the powers you obtain, exploration and collectibles, are all abundant and wonderful.

If you‚Äôre a fan of metroidvanias with more than crunchy combat, this is probably one of the best ones out there, and honestly one of the best games I have played.",1665691793,1665691793,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I'm nearly finished with my second playthrough, and it feels like I'm playing the game for the first time all over again. The environment and music never fail to make me feel calm. The puzzles are a great blend of being largely unclear with JUST enough of a hint that I rarely get stumped yet always feel like a genius every time I solve them. The story has kept me glued to my screen just as much as the first time I read it. Ori's diverse move set means that it NEVER gets boring to fend off enemies or find new ways to traverse the stages. I always feel good every time I complete a side quest that helps improve the lives of the people I meet.

This game was a true masterpiece and is now in my list of top ever games played. For a 2D platformer, I've never felt more immersed as if in a 3D world. The graphics are beautiful, smooth, and just gorgeous to look at - as well as the animations are absolutely fluid. With no words spoken, you 100% feel the words and emotions of each character.

The music feels like millions were spent on a Hollywood Blockbuster soundtrack, and they totally mirror the feeling and special moments in the game. The storytelling in the animations, the graphics, and the music are absolutely perfectly spot-on. 

As well as a huge number of achievements, and collectables, I spent about 20hrs on the game, and could easily start fresh and play it again. 

I will definitely be following this developer and music composer, as well as getting the other Ori games in the series.

It hurts me becouse I enjoyed a lot of things in game, probably if not for aticlimactic ending I wouldn't felt so negative towards it. I really don't want adventures of ori as a franchise to go in that direction, that would be huge waste. 
I do not advise against buying it, especialy on sale, since its still a good game. Good game but a bad sequel to something that to me felt unique and magical.
The graphics are beautiful, level design is great, I enjoyed the hell out of platforming through this charming world again. The story is alright, not great tho, feels like microwaved something from last week. There were moments in it that were just plain wrong like e.g. when badly placed controller shakes ruined immersion of game ending cutscenes. But the main offender for me is combat.

Oh I know that fighting feels better in this one, but its only as far as controlling ori is polished, so you can do a lot of cool stuff. On the other hand I don't vibe with the idea of this nimble forest spirit slashing bugs to pieces with a sword, or why is he even wielding arsenal of weapons invented by mankind in firs place. It still feels good to slash, smash and shoot, couse moves are responsive and well animated. But really, due to enemies being boring and sometimes a little spongy, I think I had fun only when doing environmental kills.
And then there are enemies... I cant stress this enough how hopeless they seemed against ori's new abilities. With them having only 2 or 3 moves at best, and not being particularly aggresive, I rarely felt in danger. A lot of times on my playthrough gorleks just stopped moving entirely, becoming passive punching bags. Overall, this combat system got stale pretty fast.
So here is one idea how to make it way better: if only devs focused on environmental kills. Ori was never defenseless, his platforming skills can be frickin deadly. I'm saying lets add more trickery like a feather that blows enemies away, maybe a different kind of lasso that would allow player to switch places with enemy etc. And then make fights as a combat puzzles, in which you have to think quick how to get rid of mobs using  only environment with fun (and not stupidly violent) mechanics. People who designed levels are so talented, I think they may create a masterpiece if core mechanics of the game will be more connected to their ideas. For now, I cant say what was the idea behind will of wisps, its eighter just a mess, or ripoff of mechanics trending in all modern metroidvanias...

Bosses... are awful. They are dissapoiinting, softly speaking. The thing with games that rely on combat experience like dark souls or hollow knight is that they are trying to make you feel like youre fighting for real. Enemies are aggresive, they have decent move pools (with moves that usualy make sense for what those enemies are), and their attacks are aimed at you (very fucking important). In will of wisps bosses are just patterns, with animations slapped on them like no one cares. Why the hell owl is shooting fucking laser from her mouth, and always doing so from left to right, no matter where player is. Why every time its about to hit the ground with claws, there is an air flowing from it to make sure you wont get hit.
Telegraphing attacks is fine if done properly (like e.g. in Furi) but oh god these bosses are like uncle playing with children, inventing some flashy epic punches that are aimed at air, so the kid will think hes agile or whatever. Only chases were cool, and maybe the last phase of final boss (but that also felt wrong how he went from cruelly boring to very challenging only for one or two minutes).

Another dissapointment was that little sister from boxart was barely itegrated into gameplay. Seing trailer and all I was really hoping that this will be the biggeest mixup - ori is not alone anymore, means new moves, completely different way of experiencing this world. Well no, you controll her in only one level if I remember correctly, and she is lame. She cant do nothing that ori can with feather, so this level is just being slightly slower and more limited.

Also, why did they drop one of the most interesting mechanics from blind forest - placing chekpoints as a skill, that costs mana? I was good, felt unique to me, I liked it a lot, it made me way more invested in game. It was also corresponding with worldbiulding. So they had something going for their first game, which was creative and absolutely working, I consider it amongst the best mechanics like showering in blood in ultrakill for example, .... and they dropped it.",1664482855,1664482855,False,1,0,0.458015263080596924,0,True,False,False

What I like in Ori is that it's more diverse and not battle-heavy like Hollow Knight (which I enjoy equally) - the escape sequences and Spirit Trials were a big fun! Being easier and shorter than Hollow Knight makes it a good choice too.
This year I played Ori and the Blind Forest, Hollow Knight, Axiom Verge, Guacamelee, and now Ori and the Will of the Wisps - I'm happy and at the same time sad that I already finished some of the best Metroidvania games.

A simple but emotional story complements the beautiful visuals and responsive controls for an overall wholesome experience.[/b]

A classic 2D-style platformer without 3D elements (other than foreground and background visual elements) provides an accessible experience that scales well for new and experienced metroidvania fans alike. Exploration and progression is naturally restricted via unlockable abilities, and backtracking is required should you wish to go for completion. This is good however, as you're able to traverse areas in increasingly novel ways and have a different experience the second of even fifth time around.

Collectibles are strewn throughout, and while seemingly impossible to find at first, follow a pattern and reveal themselves more readily throughout the game. Even for non-completionists, by the end of the game finding all such items and abilities is not a difficult task, as the developers allow you to choose if you need assistance in finding such things, or would rather seek them out without assistance.

Graphics are flat-out amazing, and load times are non-existent if you aren't utilizing fast travel. Fully equipped to make any HDR monitor look great, the diversity of color palettes and lighting intensity is something you'll stop to admire. Dynamic background and foreground elements sway and move with player movements and are deeply integrated with the player area. As wish most graphics this good, you may encounter micro-stutters when loading seams are brought into play, but the dynamic resolution setting built into the game can alleviate this to an extent where it is not a concern except in a few select areas.

I have played this entirely on steam desk after playing the Blind forest.
