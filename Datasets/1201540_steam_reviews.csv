TLDR If you loved StS, then get Hellcard on sale. Force friend to play with you.

Positive
- The gameplay is positively similar to Slay the Spire
- Clever use of a unique art style to simplify graphics 
- Decent replayability with unlockable cards and artefacts
- Plays best with 2-3 people

Negative
- Biggest strength = biggest weakness. After playing with a friend I never want to do single-player again. Managing all three characters alone just sucks,
- Balance issues similar to the *early-state* Slay the Spire: some cards and artefacts are vastly more powerful than others; end-of-level locations can be very helpful or actually detrimental. So, you ride the high highs and the low lows of the RNG.
- Tinker has cool mechanics and cool skins but is not fun to play. Hands-down the worst character.

This is true while you're learning the game and unlocking stuff.

For late game there are not so many viable strategies, due to one of the bosses mechanic that limit card usage per round. And you have no counterplay for it except to kill him, given that in deep endless levels hp count is ridiculous, you'll be forced to use cards that scale, otherwise you damage is dismal. And since you cannot do long combos(card limit, remember?) it further down limits you deck building choice.
Another nail in the coffin of deep endless runs are locations - virtually all of then except artifacts and hideouts(there you can lock in card to be in starting hand) become useless to you by level 20-22. Just no point in getting health if you're not being hit (iether all dead, or you have thousands of block). And if you're - damage is too big anyways. No point in new/remove cards or upgrade - you have perfect deck by that time that does not require any tweaking.

All that said, I still recommend the game since I've got decent 50 hours of fun from it, but if you expect it to last longer - beware.",1707992753,1707992753,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game is extremely fun. The RNG and strategy are well balanced. Not too RNG that you dont have control over the strategy you are doing and not too monotonous that every run is the same.

Characters have variety of ways to play, all seem viable with the right cards, some are harder to get, others are easier.

The co-op is the best way to play this game, different strategies often complement each other, the best strategy is having your team working together.

[h1] Great casual party game, frustrating game loop [/h1] 
I wouldn't recommend this for full price. It has a solid foundation that's bogged down with a lot of small faults that make the loop of this game irritating the more you get into it. Some classes are gated by having good pairings with other classes that make them un-viable without, or at the very least feel underwhelming otherwise. I'd honestly recommend playing solo at first to level up your classes otherwise a full party to do multiplayer.
     Another big qualm is reaching endless mode and realizing that it's just a more difficult standard run due to torments that don't feel all that rewarding other than to give yourself another obstacle.

* For the love of God, please disclose the hotkeys that work within the game (somewhere, if it is documented somewhere I haven't found it yet, or I am simply blind), I've just pushed some unknown hotkey combination, accidentally, which made my turn end (No it was not the mage with the ten card per turn limit boss). This is incredibly frustrating.
(edit) I figured it out, WHY DOES PRESSING 'E' END THE TURN (Yes, I'm pissed off, and yes I just did it again), IT IS NEXT TO 'W', a key which you can use, and frankly need to use (because the UI needs work and is unpolished), to move the camera around. This is just stupid.
* Sometimes it is difficult to see the damage inflicted upon a character, or the damage an enemy is dealing because UI elements overlap each other (for example when you hover over a hero to see who is attacking them, if there is an enemy next to them you cannot see how much damage they are dealing).
* The game has definitely got a memory leak: when I start playing I have no performance related issues, but run after the run my FPS goes down.
* There seem to be random indescribable affects on some of my companions, for example: they have what can only be described as a Torment, which says they take one extra damage per attack, but in reality it seems like they take two extra attacks per attack, because if the attack is for 3 damage, with the character taking 7, killing the mob doing 3 damage will reduce the companion's incoming damage by 7, which doesn't make sense. Either there is a bug, or I can't read, or there is missing information somewhere but the game mechanic is doing what it should.

All told, this game is good, for 12.23 GBP (at the time of writing) it is certainly worth it, but if you are a CCG fan you will find yourself frustrated at times.

The gameplay itself is solid, but I feel like the game has two big issues.

1. The game is way too easy. My group played multiple times with as much as Torment 5 on everyone. That being said, we never really came close to losing.

2. Their aren't really that many interesting builds. We all managed to fully unlock all the cards for our specific class so we'd have a good idea of what options there were. In the end, there aren't that many different styles you can take each class, and because the normal mode is only 12 floors, you don't have that many opportunities to make builds and actually use them.

This game continues what Thing Trunk excels at IMO: creating incredibly fun to play games, with an endearing art-style and gameplay that caters to both hardcore and more casual gamers.
You can play in both co-op and single-player. I'm usually more of a SP kind of guy but I must admit in this case I have way more fun playing with other people.
The three player characters from BoD (Warrior, Rogue and Mage) are back, and this time around they're accompanied by a fourth character class, the Tinkerer, with a fifth one possibly on the way. This time you can also unlock different costumes for your character.
You can play in endless mode, or go for the usual 12-floor dungeon with a boss fight on the last floor. Mind you that if you're playing MP all the characters have to be on the same floor to fight the final boss (which is a design decision that I absolutely understand, but which has also given me some problems when people leave a session half-way and you end up with a character on the 11th floor with no way of fighting the final boss alone...)
Insanely fun game to play and I must mention once again the endearing art style. It's beautiful and I love it.

Book of Demons: Hellcard is... Maybe the second chapter in Return 2 Games? It's not 100% clear as of right now if it's considered the second chapter or if it's considered a spinoff from BoD.

Cooperative card roguelikes are quite rare, and this one delivers! It has a bunch of different builds to go for for every class, cool combos and fun artifacts. The runs are also relatively fast, which allows for a quick game with mates without the long commitment that some other games require. You do also have an option of a long-form game in the endless mode, where you have the chance to power up well beyond what the regular mode allows - which is a big part of the fun for me. 

Simultaneous turns were a great design choice, and the game being designed specifically for co-op means that you have to coordinate the cards you play with the team if you want the best results.

I would revisit in future if development continues.

Problems:
- The ""segment"" mechanic is cool, but it only controls which enemies attack which character. There's no way to make your characters change places & I assumed from the store page that this would be a key part of the game. Making this a ""spend 1 mana, drag and rotate your characters"" would open so much depth and it's just not there.
- There are way too many enemies. I counted over 15 at one point in Room 4, most of which wasted their turns. The game wasn't interesting, it was ""chew through the horde, then fight the next horde"". Should be capped at 3x party size with interesting enemies.

Also the whole thing with the launcher is weird. I don't want your studios ""dream of seven titles"", I want this game to be good. Right now it's not.",1707076850,1707076850,False,1,0,0.494737505912780762,0,True,False,False

-The battlefield is visually very interesting, with each played getting their own wedge/slice in front of them. The only thing these wedges really do is determine who is attacked by enemies. To me it feels like this particular mechanic should influence the gameplay a lot more.
-The music is such a mood-killer. In a genre that is usually accompanied by fantasy-styled triumphant tunes, Hellcard just plays haunting dungeon sounds most of the time.
-My biggest concern is this Back2Games project the company is working on. When you launch Hellcard, you don't go straight to the game, instead you go to a display of the 7 games under the company's banner. At the time of this review, two are available, with the 3rd asking to be wishlisted. To me this gives off the feeling that the developers are speedrunning game development and that Hellcard along with the rest of the games in this series will not receive proper care during or after their launch.

Ultimately, I may go back to Hellcard, but only once it dips down to a ~$7.50 sale. There is just so much better gaming to be had from $15 (current sale price).",1707071415,1707071415,False,20,1,0.556593060493469238,2,True,False,False

This one breaks up the formula by having three distinct characters, of which you can directly control the progression of one, and have influence over the other three. So far, I have played both singleplayer and multiplayer. 

The Good:
* Card synergy feels nice
* Class based systems feel distinct, with clear archetypes
* The cards and relics are mostly cool / interesting
* The level of randomness feels about right. From a lot of other games in this genre, I felt like I was able to directly control the entire flow of the game in progression. Like choosing a build from the beginning. In Hellcard, I have to respond to the events that I get rather than planning ahead of time

My Wishlist:
- Tinkerer needs work: the class feels awful to play compared to the other 3. Having to manage mana, screws, and cores to play basic cards isn't very fun or effective. I like where it's going thematically, but the execution is poor. My first tinkerer run I had a bunch of card upgrades that required 2 cores to play, but I never found a card that allowed me to generate more than 1 (and only 1).

- Option to fully control the choices of all 3 characters in single player mode. Having the AI pick cards/upgrades for 2/3 characters puts a lot of RNG into a game that should be focused on strategy. One run my AI companions crushed everything with legendary cards, the next run they barely did anything useful the whole run due to bad card selection.

- Rotten enemies shouldn't automatically damage you if they get hit by an artifact's damage effect. There's no option to turn off artifacts so this type of damage feels unfair. Multiple perfect runs without taking any damage have been ruined by this. Makes these artifacts much less desirable.

- Some kind of indication that a reward choice is non-refundable. It's hard to tell which gem purchases can be cancelled after clicking the button and which can't.

- The game's start-up menu is very confusing. Would prefer the game go straight to Hellcard main menu by default. I had no clue what Book of Demons or Book of Aliens was. It felt like a DLC menu and the ""left click"" instructions don't work. This confused both of my friends and I when first trying to launch and play the game.

- Quite a few UI-related bugs, especially in the multiplayer menus. I counted maybe 4-5 issues without even really trying to look for them. Stuff like infinite ""searching...."" text when cancelling friend invites, weird default text when a player is joining a lobby, and we couldn't figure out how to see each other's card hands during the co-op session. In single player you just hit a button to toggle to the other player's hands, but this button doesn't work in multiplayer. As host, the other 2 players could see my right-click pings but I couldn't see their's. We also couldn't see where each other's attacks and AoEs were being aimed.

- Toning down the voice acting bits may be for the best. Especially on the game-end reward screen where the girl screams ""HOW DID YOU FIND THAT?"" like 10 times in a row.",1706931564,1706934602,False,35,1,0.581387698650360107,0,True,False,False

I have almost exclusively played the game in 2 or 3 player coop. I will update this if/when I do some solo play, but the shine of this game is truly the multiplayer aspect.

This game captures the core essence of the gameplay of Slay the Spire, and presents it in a new format begging to be played with friends. Similar to StS, decks and builds are fully emergent based off of what you find, and there are abundant opportunities to thin and upgrade your deck and artifacts to improve your performance. The catch here is that by playing with friends, your deck doesn't have to be self-synergistic. You can make a deck that just draws cards and you can be the engine that drives your friend's decks. You can abandon defense and go all in on attack, and let your allies cover your weak spots. While not perfectly balanced, card viability is high and you can make most things work if you work together.

In addition there is torments (modifiers to make your runs increasingly difficult), but you can pick and choose your modifiers for each run, allowing you to customize the difficulty to your exact preferences. Endless mode is available to revel in your most broken builds, with draftable modifiers that expire over time, allowing you to protect what makes your builds click against specific modifiers that might brick your combo.

The classes are all enjoyable, and the game is straightforward and easy to pick-up and learn. 

Again, I can't speak to how the game plays alone, but if you have some friends to play with, this will easily clear whatever cost-to-hours ratio you strive for.",1706817552,1706817552,True,19,0,0.697753548622131348,0,True,False,False

Though choices seem to matter, there's really very little risk. The enemies for the most part are uninteresting and if you're being attacked by a mob, you'd think more of them would actually be attacking instead of self-buffing or changing position. In addition, most of the cards you get usually end up debuffing your own deck, making you wonder if it's even worth improving and making the choices not that fun. By our second playsession, we knew what kind of cards we needed to win. We may come back to it some time down the road when there's just _more_.

Found this game by watching the famous VTuber Twilly. As i love deckbuilder game, especially ones that also has roguelike elements; i knew this would be great.

Pros:
-Good deckbuilding with unique cards for the genre
-Enough variations of characters to make you want to replay it and experiment
-Refreshing gameplay and twist for the combat
-Good coop gameplay

Cons:
-UI can sometimes be a bit clunky
-Cant really read history of actions, in combat
-Could do with a third gamemode

The most glaring issue is that the mage sucks... a lot, he is the worst character unless you get lucky enough to get multiple Swell, Mend Wounds, and/or Anamnesis so you can be a cray tank/healer. His damage options all are bad on their own and absolutely pale in comparison to the Warrior and Rogue, both of which are capable of more CC, Single-Target/Priority damage, AND AoE damage. Hell, even as far as tanking via block goes both the Warrior and Rogue are better at that. If you haven't tried it, you might be surprised how crazy the Rogue can get at being a block tank. All that to say, the Mage is a huge disappointment and needs a complete rework.
Edit: The make it clear, the Mage sucks in general. If you're a no lifer and build VERY specifically, he's kinda godlike. But a character being trash 95% of the time and insane 5% is also a problem. It should definitely be less extreme. The other characters can manage with sub-optimal luck more much more easily.

Now for the rest of the small issues...

There just isn't enough of anything
There aren't enough cards
There aren't enough artifacts
There aren't enough classes (which more classes would solve the first two issues, in itself admittedly)
There aren't enough monster types
Not enough Bosses with interesting challenges
There aren't enough mechanics or complex interactions, everything is very basic and nothing particularly interesting was attempted (all just very safe mechanics, the stuff most people would consider the 'basic groundwork' that you then branch out from to try less surefire additions)

Due to the lack of all of the above, there is a VERY limited assortment of viable builds you can go for with any character and those options slowly become less and less viable as you push the Torment higher.

The RNG is insane, you should expect RNG to screw you in these games occasionally, obviously, but this game gives you extremely limited ways to interact with that RNG and mitigate, avoid, subvert, or control it to any real degree. The biggest hallmark for a truly great Roguelite/Roguelike is how much agency one has over the RNG, where that agency comes from, how you earn it, ect... and this game just doesn't give you any.

When you're pushing Torments, you will just be doing run after run waiting for the RNG to give you exactly what you need. Hell, it is a better strategy starting at around 10 Torment to just roll a character and then do up to the first mini-boss and if you and your friend(s) haven't gotten what you need, restart until you do.

Now onto friends... play this game with friends, do your best to have a full lobby of friends in voice. The game is VERY clearly balanced for having a full party and every fewer person you have makes the game harder and harder in a way that hints at some scaling and balancing issues deep down.

Again, GREAT game, I just wish it was what it could be rather than what it is at current. Hopefully the new Tinkerer class will help. And I hope it gets additional updates and maybe even some sizeable paid DLC later.",1706383351,1706433758,True,15,1,0.616308152675628662,0,True,False,True

Solo doesn't feel less balanced, just a different mindset as opposed to having more enemies but also more help from friends. 
I disagree with those who say it's unbalanced or too steep of a difficulty curve, or too random - it's a roguelike, so you can't expect every run to be possible to win. You lose and you learn, that's the process. Kind of like life - try a lot, fail a lot, learn a lot. Next runs may punish you even with a good setup, or you may cruise through with your newfound skills. I personally love that about random chance events - anything is possible. Some turns feel impossible to survive, and then you somehow weasel through it. It's so much fun! My friends and I can't get enough. And I love playing it solo too.

Don't let a loss stop you from enjoying your time. Succumb to the dark side and stay hooked to ~just one more run~ :)

There's only one thing about this game that pisses me off: the stupid ass extra launcher. I don't know why developers insist on doing this. What makes it worse is that this developer has only two games in their own launcher. This is so unnecessary and just completely stupid. I get that they have a plan to add more games. That's great. Just add the launcher when there are more games. Steam itself is already a launcher. I already clicked the game that I want to play. Don't make me click the game again.

I have played my way through the first series of 12 floors and 3 bosses and wanted to get some comments up for anyone looking to purchase during the current sale.

As far as the co-op vs. single player mode, there is no difference except the player controls the hands of up to two other characters instead of having friends do it.  Also, it is supposedly possible to play through with a single character and solo the game ( I wouldn't recommend that as there are team aspects to the game).

The game was not overly difficult in my first run, although I made a lot of poor choices early on. The strategy of the game revolves around character selection for you and your team, deck building,  and obtaining artifacts which provide bonuses to your characters.

The 2D LEGO like characters used in the game are kind of retro but functional, so don't expect to be wowed by graphics.

The game authors just put out a major update and appear to be continuing to support the game.  Overall I would rate the game a 7.5 in its current early access state and I didn't encounter any glitches. if you enjoyed Slay the Spire and/or Darkest Dungeon then you should like this game.

THE BEST CO-OP CARD GAME I KNOW

This game is a lesson to other cardgame devs (I wish the guys of Beneath Oresa could learn from this). The reasons are:

- well-balanced game design that allows different successful builds per class (the devs are not nerfing but actually improving cards, encouraging people to try different strategies that now are more likely to work to win a match)
- beginner-friendly difficulty that allows customisation for harder runs as the player might want,
- deep strategic level with not only block as viable strategy, but where you can also teleport enemies, freeze enemies, stun enemies, or even generating the required amount of block with a single card. This game allows for a lot of different strategies to win,
- simple but pleasant and thematic paper-like characters and monsters, gives a vibe you are playing a moving board game,
- every run has different order of locations, with 3 different bosses that require different strategies to be dealt with, making no run similar to another.
- amazing co-op mode, which I recommend to play using discord with your friends, as communicating while playing can be a lot of fun! You can play alone and control all the characters in battle, but playing with a friend while discussing your strategy to win, walking the path and winning is an amazing experience!
- every relic, even the common ones, are relevant to your deck and build, and many rare ones can change the way you play your strategy.

There is only one problem with the game right now: it is a hassle to discover which cards evolve to the cards you want to have on your deck. You literally have to look all the cards from the lower rank to find out which are the ones that become what you want to get in your final deck strategy. 

Even if you never played a roguelike cardgame before, I strongly recommend you to get this one, as it can help to introduce you to this cardgame genre, and you even don't need to do that alone at all.

With polish, balance, and a little more time it could be a real gem but after a few months in between plays I struggle to think if they ever will make the changes.

I will note for those saying it's too short, you quickly unlock an 'endless' mode which is much longer and more difficult, so for the standard 12 level runs this is not a review for but for instead the 'endless' mode.

Pros
+ Fun gameplay loop
+ Interesting take on radius / proximity for card play
+ Interesting card dynamics when upgraded / coupled with artifacts
+ Some fun class synergies

Cons
- Needlessly insane mob density later on (Let's say level 15+).  There has got to be better ways to manage difficulty.
- ""You lose"" global statuses often brick really fun runs just because the effect literally negates how you were winning (and let's be real, you're not able to run 2-3 paths to victory).  Running lot's of stun? Immune to stun.  How about mass frost to get your engine running? Immune to frost.  How about lots of card draw?  Limited cards played or card cost increases en masse.  This is well done via bosses in StS but in a game like this it's just a random effect on random levels and it feels really really bad to have a long run just get bricked turn 2.
- Too much of a grind to unlock things.  StS will give you 3 artifacts every time you level but this one increases the exp needed AND does it 1 at a time;  Just needless tedium, you should be given more options more quickly to have more fun earlier.  Content is in higher difficulty settings and choices made, not missing half the games artifacts and cards to have an actual good time with.
- Too many cards have negative effects for being marginally better than others.  Some cards really need some balance TLC for sure.  I understand when a room wide AOE gives a curse or status of some sort but why do seemingly random ones with situational use do too, just seems just too heavy handed.
- Also devs, please don't let the rotten 1 damage return proc off of thorns, mama mia does it feel bad being a ping pong ball until your shields are gone.  Big yikes.

All in all the game is fun, definitely worth it on sale and one to keep an eye on as time goes on.

The roguelike aspect of increasing debuffs is also implemented well to a point where I don't feel any frustrations about it - only challenged.

So what can I say about it now? I still think it's a pain, but it's now more Dark Souls but paper mario is also there.

My only grievance with the game is that it needs a little bit of balance, specifically in endless mode and for 1 boss (The Cook).

In any mode, you can get cards and artifacts that balance the playing field if not give you a small advantage. Once you take on endless mode however, the game changes. In endless mod, you are given permanent debuffs from the beginning, when the difficulty should scale off your progress (how many floors you get through).

For the Cook, it is just unplayable and a instant loss. This boss has 150 hp and passives that limit the damage dealt each turn and a passive that summons a monster +1 for each turn that passes. Summoning monsters can already overwhelm you if unprepared. This boss fight takes that to the extreme.

No more stun for ranger 
No more freeze for mage

To that degree, it does its job with flying colors. Hellcard is a fantastic multiplayer game.

We slowly ran into issues where damage, armor, card drawing, healing, and other calculations would be queued from the amount of monsters we were killing all at one time.

Creators if you are reading this: This game NEEDSSS some form of permanent progress to aid replayability.
What do we get for completing a run now? Outfits, voice lines and/or new cards/artifacts to play with.
In my and my friends opinions, we should earn: skilltree points, card upgrades, card power scaling, pets, equipment (with build in level systems) anything to boost future progress and make future runs feel stronger vs stronger enemies. 
With that change, even more deck builds would be possible, even more content could be unlocked and more fun is to be had.

I love the feeling to reach the threshold where you can win.

Forcing people to have to account for the mana and card draw of their allies to account for the ""Round Robin"" trait of the boss (basically, each person can only play one card at a time, and you have to alternate) is one of the dumbest game design decisions I've ever seen in a game. So if one player decided to build a deck around high mana and high card draw, but the other player didn't build for any mana or card draw, then you're deck basically becomes entirely useless on the boss because you are limited by your partner's deck.

Most of the cards feel either useless or don't synergize well. Card upgrade paths make little sense. The variety in combat and enemies is limited and feels very ""samey"" after only a few hours.

Needs a bit more in terms of customization and unlocking it (starting out with a berserker deck vs normal warrior). UI needs a few tweaks to targeting spells and camera angle - hard to hit enemies at the edges of the room with a card blocking the enemy model. I would also like to see what's in my multiplayer team's hands and ghost curse description needs to say what effect you get when reading the intention pop-up. More balancing for mostly artifacts, locations, and money. More enemy variety/mechanics (too many rotting monsters) and new monsters like goblins, trolls, or hydras would add more to the fun. Cliche water temple levels with aquatic enemies would be interesting. I really enjoy the multiplayer/multi-unit aspect and hope new mechanics or spells are added for that aspect.

My wish-list for the game: arena sized bosses (giant lich king), torment system rework similar to Monster Train, dungeon traps and hidden loot, arena puzzles, and secret encounters/bosses. Multiple rooms to clear per floor with team votes to pick a door you can't backtrack could be fun, but I'm content with one room full of monsters per floor.",1682463426,1682463426,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

However combat is much less RNG dependant and there is a loooot of thinking turns involved especially later on. I'm 99% sure Wizard is way more powerful than the other classes.

My complaints/suggestions : 
1) Single Player feels weird/punishing. Not being able to see your companions full hand (you can only see 2 cards at a time) and them getting cards randomly makes strategizing borderline impossible, and the companions will never be as strong as an actual player because they dont receive gems/artifacts/card upgrades (that I know of).

2) The Communication UI is a great idea just needs a bit more polish.

3) I would love if you could get more classes or unlock subclasses/passives etc for a character in higher torments.

The game becomes very fast no longer a rougelike feel and more you have to build/progress with a broken carbon copy deck to succeed. The random nature doesn't feel fun because you can't fully make the best/most out of what you get because if your not hard building in one way you don't have the gemstones (in-run currency that 1 per stage with having 9 options to spend it on which most of those options are 1-3 gemstones to use very few free options ever).

This game is also a treat! There are not enough coop card based roguelikes and this one definitely scratches that itch, it's really great all the way through.

HOWEVER, it has one glaring issue that really bothers the hell out of me. 
As we all know, the joy of roguelikes is slowly working a build up and (hopefully) becoming some crazy OP monster. The variety is what you want in a roguelike.

As an antithesis to this, the final boss has a passive that only allows 7 cards to be played.....shared amongst teammates...

This means that if you've gone for say, a rogue build with endless 0 cost cards as the focus, both you and your whole team are screwed, as every card you play is one less card your whole team can play. So you either stop your teammates from playing anything, or you sit there uselessly.

This mechanic actively punishes builds and hampers what options are truly viable.

I genuinely enjoy the game, but until this particular thing is changed, I can't really recommend it.
Honestly if it were a mechanic on an early/mid game boss, totally fine! But the final boss? Nyeaugh.

In other card games, there's often an obviously correct action that jumps out at you at the start of the turn, leaving few interesting decisions to make. Hellcard turns are much more complex: you usually are able to play 3 cards per turn, and choosing targets for each one gives you plenty of non-obvious choices, and it feels great when, after puzzling over a bad situation for 2 minutes, you figure out a way to avoid taking any damage.

Your deck works like in Dominion: you draw 5 cards every turn and discard the ones you haven't played at the end of the turn. When your deck runs out, you shuffle your discard pile and make it your new draw pile. Your deck normally has 10-15 cards in it, so you cycle through it a few times per battle. I've praised this approach to card game design before because it ensures you draw all your cards a similar number of times, which means less randomness than a game like Magic: The Gathering, where your best cards might have been shuffled to the bottom of your deck and never show up at all.

On the other hand, there are several instances of unnecessary randomness that MtG-style games don't usually have, but overall it feels more fair than those games.

The card balance is not great. There are lots of dreadfully underpowered cards, a few overpowered ones, and several ""infinite combos"" which make it possible to play unlimited cards in one turn, trivializing the battle. But it is far more balanced than MtG-style games, and since Hellcard is still in early access, some balance issues are to be expected.

It is easy to compare Hellcard to something like Darkest Dungeon, but when you add the top-down view layer to the mix, it really changes how you play the game and how you think about your next action. Knowing what the enemies will do next sometimes will not save you from trouble, while other times it will be just what you need to win the battle.

You start by selecting your character. Warrior with close quarter attacks and several block options. Rogue which is an expert at dealing damage to far-away enemies. And the Mage with a lot of Area of Effect attacks and crowd control. The game arena is divided by the number of heroes, called slices, and each slice has two areas, near and far ranges.

The main game consists of dealing damage, blocking damage, and using crowd control cards, with five cards dealt to you at each turn. Winning a battle takes all players to the reward screen, earning them gems and new cards. Having the right strategy and dealing with the near and far ranges of enemies, some of whom only do certain actions on the near or far range, makes this game an amazing puzzle.

Next, all players will have options for up to 3 locations, and each location will have 3 options to choose from. Here you can spend your gems to buy artifacts, usually passive buffs, new cards, upgrade your card into (almost always) a better card, heal, and other buffs that may aid you and your allies.

After everyone got their bonuses, it's time to select which group of enemies you will face, and each group has a location as a reward. So if you are playing alone or with a group of 3, each character will choose a group of enemies, from two choices, with a reward location; if you are playing with only two players, the third location seems to be random. During this phase, one or more characters can face a boss enemy with no choice of location, which is predetermined. And a new battle begins; you will be doing this until the 12th battle against a powerful boss.

After winning or losing the game, you will be taken to the XP screen, where you can earn new artifacts to show up in future games and other rewards, such as skins for your characters and a new starting artifact that will give you a head start in your next game.

On the technical side, I never had a coop or connection issue, and having the option to save mid-campaign after each battle and no time limit really helped those that had time constraints. The only negative feedback that I have is that sometimes, due to debuffs, you don't see that you cannot block yourself and forget to look at your debuffs. While attacking you can see how much damage you will deal to the enemy, the same is not applied to the block.

Really recommend this game if you have friends that like solving puzzles together.",1680737528,1680737528,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

All levels along the way are the same, this is the ultimate grind game, feels like a poorly designed mobile game in this form. The boss battle however STEEPLY increases in difficulty. I'll be doing the same exact, tedious, visually identical thing, slowly, painfully, just to unlock small boons that may not have any actual influence on your play-ability.  (Avatar pictures for instance, or cards that limit your already handicapped progress) 
Back to the boss battle; the little identical arenas you battle in get flooded with monsters, lending a constantly desperate feeling leading up to the boss battle. While not unmanageable in any way (maybe 15-20 monsters), the boss battle quickly becomes just that...unmanageable. You get handicapped on amount of cards you can play each turn artificially by the bosses special ability, negating any effort to the opposite you've tried to develop on your way. ALSO  the boss starts summoning up 6 monsters OFTEN (every other turn) and several other monsters summon monsters as well. I had a great crowd control warrior and other effects from my other party members, and still saw 45-60 monsters constantly. After trying to deal with the adds, I chose to focus on the boss, and was able to defeat it, but monsters continued to be summoned and I was quickly overwhelmed. I in no way experienced something that felt worth replaying for any type of Rougelike unlocks, and was awarded a pittance for my HOURS and effort. 

Ultimately, I was excited by the first installment and by the potential for other games from these folks. I am hopeful that sense of excitement returns, and will keep an eye out for meaningful changes that indicate it.",1680573397,1680575729,False,5,0,0.509139955043792725,0,True,False,True

I have played this game extensively and enjoy it quite a bit. If you want a multiplayer turnbased roguelike this game is a solid option.  However be warned that the game currently is an unbalanced mess.

There are two major problems with this game. 
First - The progression. Your character gets more powerful by unlocking an extra card each round and gaining 1 gem that they can spend on permanent improvements in between rounds.  However the vast majority of cards that are offered are noob-traps and so are most gem-spending options.  You are presented many cards that seem like they will lead into specific build paths, but most build paths are just bad (ESPECIALLY anything with a range of NEAR). Furthermore, because of how the game scales, any card that you select and do not pay gems to upgrade will become a dead card by the end of the game.  Often, the best strategy is to only ever take 3 or less of the 12 cards that are offered. That feels bad. 

The second problem is the difficulty. 
Difficulty in this game is not a gradient. It is a binary.  The outcome of 90% of fights is determined on the first round and the other 10% of fights are settled on round 2. Many fights go past this, but the remaining rounds a merely a formality of cleaning up whatevers left. Everything hinges on whether you can enable your team to setup a powerful turn 1.  Did you have time to play your powerful effect cards and take over the fight? If yes, the fight is a cakewalk. If not, the fight is devastating.  In general this makes the game incredibly easy.  One player either stalls or generates extra mana/cards for their allies and their allies pop off on turn 1.  If everything falls into place, every fight is mindlessly easy.  The enemies are disabled or killed before they can ever meaningfully act. This doesn't feel great, yet the alternative is even worse.  Every enemy exists on the map on the very first turn and it is common that those enemies WILL kill you on turn 1 (from full health) unless you can cc/kill them.  Instead of this all-at-once approach the enemies should be be made stronger but not all appear on the first turn.  This would give the player time to build themselves while not risking instant death if that's all they do on turn 1.

So there's a third problem with this game for more advanced players, and its infinite combos. This game, fundamentally, should NOT be perfectly balanced. It's fun to figure out the best builds and find ways to break yourself.  Finding specific builds and carefully building a deck to empower an unbeatable combo can feel incredible.  Problem is that warrior can do all of this with a single card.  No thought required. The warrior has TWO cards (and one isnt even legendary) that effectively give them infinite mana and infinite draw.  These combos only feel good if they are earned.  Mage and Archer have to do clever cheat/finesse setups to empower their infinite combos, and it feels great!  That's because their combo is actually a COMBINATION of cards.  Devs... there should not be any card in this entire game that gives more than 5 stamina.


Unless this game hits your niche exactly, I would skip for now. If you want a good slay-the-spire type game, then play Slay the Spire or Monster Train, or Peglin. If you require multiplayer, then play spell masons or gloomhaven (they're not exactly in the same category, but they hit the niche).",1678314250,1680545431,False,3,0,0.467914432287216187,1,True,False,True

Playing with 2+ people, the game mechanics and elements give you a pinch of MTG, a dash of Hearthstone, and a sprinkle of Wildermyth. The final product is a nicely baked start to what could be a great end-product.

TLDR;

[b]Pros[/b]
- Current game mechanics are relatively refined and smooth
- Little to no bugs. ( I have yet to run into a game breaking bug in the 15+ playthroughs  I have done with a friend.
- Card decks are well thought out and offer an array of different play styles.
- Ability to evolve cards adds a unique layer to building your deck.
- Multiplayer allows you to create powerful synergies with your teammates.

[b]Cons[/b]
- The 3 current classes (Warrior, Rogue, and Sorcerer) need to be more balanced. 
- Currently, The Rogue is the most powerful of the 3 classes. 
- The warrior seems to be the 2nd most balanced class, with the sorcerer being almost useless outside of very limited CC and Team Buffing. 
- The sorcerer's starting damage is extremely low with utility cards that don't scale to the average damage output from any combination of attacking monsters on any one level. By level 7-8, the monsters combined damage output exponentially increase from single digit outputs to well into the double digits (i..e Early round combined enemy damage output ranges from 1-7. Mid to late rounds, combined enemy damage output becomes anywhere from 15-40+.

At the end of the day, the cons are 100% tolerable and do not detract from the amount of enjoyment it has given me any my close friend. It is a toss up on whether or not it is worth the $20. At the rate I am playing this game with my friend, I can easily see us easily hitting the $1 / hour of gameplay  to break even on the purchase. Keep it up devs!

Cons:
I'll lend credit where it's due, most of the negative reviews consist of the game being unbalanced and not fun in its single player mode, and I think they are somewhat correct. As the game is currently, the single player mode is moderately unbalanced with some of the legendary cards being clearly stronger than others within each of the classes, and having to actually control the companions in single player is more arduous than just being able to play your character alone.

That being said, the game has never pretended to be anything more than it is, a deckbuilding roguelike dungeon crawler, and for that, I can say it is honestly phenomenal.

Pros:
This game is a fresh take on a saturated genre that really has a ton to offer as it can only become bigger and filled with more content. Single player is honestly fine, but nowhere near as fun as the multiplayer is. The online matchmaking is rather seamless, and playing with your own friends is even easier, and nothing short of a really really fun time.

The most recent game I played, (with a friend as a duo), fight starts, literally 9 skeleton archers spawn in, all ready to take potshots at me. I'm told I have 27 damage incoming on the monsters' next turn. I use my starter deck to plink a few down, but lose 27 of my 33 HPs. 

After that, the rest of the run was playing catch-up. I couldn't spend any of my gems to upgrade my deck or gain any relics because I had to keep dumping money into heals to keep going. We do make it to the final boss fight, but I get quaffed on turn 1, blasted for 45 damage and that's it, run over.

I think the only flaw is that the majority of lackluster decks or non-cohesive build combinations can still lead to victory even in high torment runs. You will likely win in this game a lot, if you have played any card games and have basic strategy skills. You should also have access to higher torment levels earlier on, and should not have to go level by level as most runs are typically around an hour.

There is plenty of content to enjoy solo or with friends. Each class has multiple styles of play which are viable. Varied and interesting targeting mechanics, a unique monster positioning mechanic and intents set Hellcard apart from other deck building games.

One note intended as developer feedback:
Playing solo you have to put up with your two npc companion slots adding and upgrading cards on their own, without the any ability to customize them yourself. While the current situation is tolerable, I've often been frustrated by seeing cards get added to their decks that were completely anti-synergistic to what had been working for the team dynamic. Additionally, I think that the full range of successful builds you can have as a solo player is limited by the lack of control over the companions decks. I feel there should be some customization options for companion decks available to the player, even if it's not as extensive as the gems and player character upgrades system. Perhaps an occasional card removal option or the option to remove or replace a companion artifact.  I think that this would increase the game's longevity for people who primarily want to play solo.",1679211692,1679211806,True,1,0,0.533898293972015381,0,True,False,True

Started to play with my gf, she is kinda new in gaming but she loves it, this is the first game what she started to playing alone too. Great learning curve, hard to ""master"" (as a roguelike its kinda hard), fun to play. 
I wish there'll be more update, like new classes (like the companions have), new cards, new bosses (2 at the moment).
The one thing i don't really like is the torment system. I know it's there to make the game harder but there is no reward for me (only the points in the end) and its hard to just put in the +50% dmg/hp to bosses torment, maybe if it give some benefit for me too it would be better.

1201540,134800395,76561197982227918,0,9,1204,0,411,1684765115,"Hellcard is an excellent deck-building card game, with a unique spin on the rogue-like genre, especially relating to combat and cooperation. This game is a must have for players who love deck-building card games & cooperation. The decisions that you make are crunchy and there is a lot of brain burning towards the end game as you frantically try to kill dozens of enemies to survive. 

I will note that I have only focus'd play on the 'Mage' in the 'Demon Book', so I can't speak too much to the other classes & future books, but the mage has an intriguing, but delicate balance of play. You are always tossing up choices between what you need over what you want; i.e. crowd control and utility are really powerful, strategic choices but sometimes you want to pull of some huge damage with Armageddon or Maelstrom or invest into future rounds with green exhaust cards.

The game has other interesting rogue-like elements, such as deciding what cards to add to your deck, what artefacts you will choose to gain the best boons for your build, what enemies you will fight versus the rewards you will get, and whether you should gamble that last gem with the hopes of get more! Oh, and do something boring like heal (do not ignore healing, seriously!).

The few criticisms I have for this game mainly come down to the UI. The major issue I have is that there isn't a log (at least, not that I found) of the actions that occur during a turn. This can make it a little tricky to figure certain things out ~ like why your character reacts in a certain way or remember what you just did. Fortunately, you can see what cards have been played (discard) and what cards are in your draw.

The second issue with the UI is the amount of enemies on the screen make it extremely (mentally) taxing to workout what enemies will be hit by an AOE and what the effects of that AOE will be. Specifically, it's difficult to understand which enemies will die, which enemies will get crowd controlled, how much damage on your character will be prevented, etc. I think a little drop down (or a hotkey to reveal it) with a summary of general information would be awesome; not only to improve play, but I think for general accessibility. 

Another issue I had was I never really knew how to properly prevent a card from being played; I hit escape, which did work, but it also brings up the menu - it feels a little dodgy to say the least. I'm sure there is a better way to do it (I.e. this issue might just be user error), but in really tense situations I felt more comfortable to just hit escape and ensure my action was cancelled, as misplays can cost you a run.

The last small issue is when deciding which floor to follow, it's not 100% clear what you are actually fighting versus what you are getting as a reward; this becomes clear when you've played a few rounds, but I think it would be nice if this had a summary with more information, as players can always just check a wiki anyway. 

While I have listed a few criticisms, excluding my issue with the missing log, these are all fairly minor and will likely get fixed once the game has had more time too cook. I am genuinely excited to see this game get more content, with more characters, enemies, bosses, cards, artifacts, etc, as well as more 'books' to unlock (Presumably DLC that will be developed in the future). I'd like to also see a little bit of focus on the floor system, perhaps taking inspiration from FTL to make those decisions a little more crunchy and interesting. 

The art-style and voice acting are surprisingly polished for an early access game; I found the pop-up story book theme quite charming and would love to see what they manage with future books! 

Overall, this is one of the best in the genre, easily dethroning 'Slay the Spire' & 'Monster Train' for me. I'm sure many will find that controversial, but those games did not hook me as much, perhaps because they lack the co-operative aspect. Other games that may be camparable include 'For the King', which I think it also quite a fun, crunchy game. I do feel that game feels a lot more unfair, as I feel like one bad rng can ruin a run. In this, at least from my play so far, I felt like a lot of the failures I had were due to hasty or poor decision making. 

tl;dr a strong recommendation for those who like games similar to Slay the Spire, Monster Train, For the King, & Darkest Dungeon (although this game isn't anywhere as difficult).",1679042544,1679042648,True,8,2,0.635454177856445313,0,True,False,True

-It is challenging, you'll lose a lot of runs, but it won't be unfun.
-Artstyle is charming, cards look nice.
-Coop seems to work well. This is a good game if you are struggling with laggy connections or trying to play with international friends.

Cons
-There isn't much in the way of story.
-Runs feel quite short, when your build comes together is usually when the game is concluding.
-I muted the audio immediately. Game blasts.. 'noise' the minute it's started. VA grates along my nerves, but that might just be my grumpy ass.

It looks like a lot is planned, as well as other games. I look forward to them and will be picking them up!",1678645760,1678645760,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

So far I like the game, it took me quite a while to get the hang of some mechanics and to use them properly.
Its a decent deckbuilder, however the deck progressing during a run feels limited due to the very limited resources
you get which has to be spend on either healing, buying artifacts, deleting, upgrading or getting new cards. 
Also, there is not a whole lot of variety in the game in general. There are only three playable chracters (as of yet - keep 
in mind its early access) and pretty much always the same enemies. 

Having said all of the above, I still find myself somehow enjoying the game and got my money worth of fun and playtime.

Solid deckbuilding rougelike with an unique design around the possibility of multiplayer, drop in, drop out play. My review with not encompass judging it on that mechanic as I either played solo or full stacked with teammates. My perspective is as someone who looks for an intense but balanced, high difficulty experience; think A20 runs in Slay the Spire. This game achieves that though its 'Torment' system where you individually choose differently weighted difficulty modifiers such as 'Monsters have +50% HP'.
 A pro-con table doesn't feel right for this game, its very good and achieves what it is going for so far. I look forward to more development.

+Core gameplay feels good with the far/near - per player sectioning of the battlefield.
+Card upgrade eco feels just right with the variety and frequency you can powerup.
+Can play with friends who also love deckbuilders.
~Can be pigeonholed into a selective few strategy's or mechanics(freeze, infinite combos).
~Unlocks are random and you may get only the hardest of torments unlocked first, making it even harder to earn more torments. I don't might the challenge but could softlock some players as some torments are MUCH harder than others of equal value.
-Enemy AI for both spawn and attack selection can have too much variance. Some loads will have you taking lethal damage turn 1, other times they mull about waiting.
-Infinite combos are too easy to pull off if you know how, even with restrictions to passing up card options. But to combat this they gave the final bosses all anti-infinite passive powers. The whole thing feels a bit binary and I hope in the future as things come together this can be resolved to be a healthier balance.

First run we got to the final boss - but ran afoul of 'limited cards per turn' mechanic, and two of us we were going for heavy card/mana support build.  Second run we had a different boss and beat the game.

The second run where we had 2 mages was a bit frustrating at the start - mages initial builds are based around 'kill monster with weak damage to get more cards and mana'.  That's fine if there is one mage, but with two it's frustrating - especially when you both cast a spell at the same weakened monster meaning one of you wasted the card (I was in a different room from my boys - yes, there are emotes we could have been using I suppose, but it's a little awkward).

The game mechanics are enjoyable - and I could see there are quite a few different build strategies that come up - and the way you get cards means you can't just decide on a strategy straight out the gate.  Well, perhaps you can if you memorise the upgrade paths of each card, although I would have preferred a little randomisation in how a card could be upgraded (perhaps 2 fixed and 1 somewhat random choice rather than 3 fixed choices).

Meta is currently looking very limited.  You unlock things with experience, but no mechanism to 'purchase' permanent upgrades.  This is a pity, because meta growth is half the fun of rouge games. 
I saw torment levels unlock after the second run.  However, there seems little 'benefit' to torment levels, apart from a bit faster XP unlock rate.  Again a lot opportunity here - because it simply isn't motivating.  There is no, ""Let's beat this torment level so we can earn/unlock XX""

For Meta, I understand that there is the issue of multiplayer to consider - and you don't want one person who is three times more powerful than others from heavy playtime.  My solution for that would be a system where you purchase upgrades, but you need to balance your improvements against selected debuffs every time you pass a power level.
Also - for beating torment levels you get to unlock some new parts of the upgrade tree - or perhaps torment levels give special materials used for unlocks/upgrades - with higher torment levels giving higher chances of getting rare materials.

Played right from the start with a friend. We are both avid fans of a wide variety of roguelite, deck building, and tactics games. This game definitely had us hooked right out of the gate. We spent about 4 hours in one sitting just jamming on deck possibilities and character combinations. 

[h1]What could have been better[/h1]
It has a lot of potential, but I do feel the difficulty ramp after about 7 or 8 dungeons is so high that luck started to drive our progress not our choices. Only on runs where we were able to get exactly the cards we wanted, in a lucky streak were we able to push past the 3rd boss or so. Initial control over our decks would help alot here, but we mostly unlocked new faces, voice packs and ping icons; proverbial ""sticker packs"", when what I need is additional tactical decisions to make.

[h1]Suggesions[/h1]
More control during character creation (deckbuilding), *or* a longer ramp-up time to allow good choices to start coming together before the difficulty jumps would be a welcome change. Even some A or B choices of Tier 1 cards at creation would be fantastic. After 4 hours and about 100ish levels completed we have not unlocked a single deckbuilding option. It does appear the design intent, but the actual rate of change is less than a trickle and too slow to even notice it exists, if it does.",1677953664,1677953664,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

The paper-craft artstyle honestly stuck out to me as being really charming and well done. Not to mention seeing it as a roguelike card battler was an obvious buy for me because I am just a sucker for the genre. 

This game is fairly light on content, but with enough variety to at least keep me engaged for as long as I have. I think I have kinda run through the motions for a bit, so while I might slow down the amount I am playing at this point, I am keeping a close eye on it for any major updates to the game.

I really hope to see more variety in future cards and classes, but honestly mod support would most likely just get that done in spades because the game itself is a really solid foundation. 

I personally think that the leveling goes quite slowly, and while I enjoy playing this as much as I do, I can think for a few newcomers, the gameplay can get a little stale with how slowly new cards and starter artifacts are given to you. So maybe add additional ways to bump your end score or rebalance the exp needed for new content.

Another gripe I have would have to be particular companions. I LOVE how you can work with semi limited options for other companions who join, where it allows you to have them supplement your adventure without having to keep many different decks and builds in mind in one playthrough. However, the AI companion named The Trickster (I think thats the name) whose entire kit revolves around bombs kinda shows the biggest limitation with the limited system. As they can very easily shower the field with bombs, but be left with no way to detonate any of them when we'll have multiple turns of the two options being only to set more bombs when the max amount has already been reached. Maybe the bomb cards can be set as unplayable when the max has been reached so that they don't show as one of the possible two options of playable cards from turn to turn. Same as if one of your mage companions has rune cards that dont show as able to be selected before Amnesia has been played from their hand?

-Fun Multiplayer

-Unbalanced Game Play

-Slow Progression

For the time being it is still much to early to give anywhere near a final verdict but as the game stands now, it is good but lacking. This is an EARLY ACCESS game that I am excited to watch grow. If you enjoy game like For the King and Slay the Spire, you will enjoy Hellcard.

First thing to mention is multiplayer game play is better then single player. During single player you are trapped with two ""Companions"" in which you're only able to see two cards at a time (not the full hand) and a card is replenish upon use. They could potential hold a card you want to use but cant see, having them makes winning harder. As well, you don't control how their decks are upgraded between rounds and need to spend extra gems to replace them completely instead of using them for your own deck, All in All, single player for me is a horrible experience all around.

Deck builds are not very flexible due to lack of card variety, even then it is hard to build towards a unified deck. You don't win enough gems throughout the 12 floor run to build an amazing deck unless you're blessed with extreme luck, or you've completed enough runs and unlocked better starting artifacts to make beginning of run smoother. This is somewhat rectified in the multiplayer side in which you can communicate and work out a strategy rather then fighting blindly. Either or, each of the three classes only have two style of decks you can build towards and you're forced into one of the builds from the first few random card drops you receive.

All and all, i enjoy playing the game with two friends or at the very least in coop multiple and avoid single player all together.",1677720866,1677720866,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,True

Problem 1. Attacking is terrible. The majority of spells/attacks deal 1-3 damage, and enemies typically have anywhere from 3-35 health. This means everything is very tanky, and takes a gigantic amount of total cards played to kill them. 
Problem 2. Defending is terrible. Enemies will hit you anywhere from 1-15 damage, and most shield cards block anywhere from 1-4 damage. This means you are extremely squishy, and it takes a gigantic amount of total cards played to stay alive.

Pattern 1 has emerged - You need to juggle A LOT of cards to make progress.

Problem 3. The enemies are comically numerous. They will spawn anywhere from 10-30 enemies on the screen at any given time, and many enemies will summon more nearly every single turn. 

Pattern 1 + problem 3 = SLOG. SLOG SLOG SLOG SLOG MISERY MISERY MISERY. Combat is excusiatingly slow and tedious, and you truely have to make every single point of damage be as precisely played as possible or you are royally screwed.

Problem 4. Most Relics are terrible. Some are good, but most are so weak you forget you even have them. Usually when I picked one up, I would see it and go ""oh. ok.""
Problem 5. Most cards are just terrible. Anything even somewhat good usually costs alot of mana and comes with some sort of curse or drawback, and anything not good requires you to play multiple of them to see any sort of noticable result out of them.
Problem 6. Healing is very difficult to do, and you CAN'T heal companions out of combat at all. If you lose a companion the run is as good as over. 

Pattern 2 has emerged - You need to play a ton of bad cards to progress, are constantly getting the shit kicked out of you, and you cant even recover.

Pattern 1 + Pattern 2 = fuck this game.

Now, I'm a stubborn person. I put in 10 hours of experimenting and managed to overcome these issues in one of the most commonly powerful ways to play card games - Extra draws + extra mana. Extra draws + extra mana will allow you to succeed in the vast majority of card games, and even when you are weak like in this game, you can usually ""get there"" by spamming enough stuff.

Then I reached the final boss.

The final boss limits how much you can do on a given turn.

Pattern 1 + Pattern 2 + run destroying boss mechanic = Uninstalling and never looking back.

Once you understand the general potential of the game's different aspects, it opens up to a very fun and unique Roguelike. 
Now, each game is exciting, and right from the beginning you're trying to figure out what sort of build you could make. And it's fun trying to figure out the most optimal way to tackle the multiple different strategical elements; deck building, enemy management and prioritisation, floor choice, and a handful of others I'm forgetting. 

And the games aren't too long either! We had a winning run that took about an hour and a half- and if you make a sh!t build, then you'll be looking at only 30 minutes, which lets you restart and tackle it again.

- Matchmaking, when it finds people, is easy because the balance of the game is suited to the level of your character, and you can bring a character that's any level to play with players at any other level.  A level 2 can help a level 9 or vice versa, and you can swap characters out freely

- The looting system is an upgrade to what I'm used to, and I love spending shards on various things instead of just having ""gold"" that buys items or relics.  There are a ton of effects based on the place you visit.

- You can drop in and drop out!  That's probably the best part.  You won't make or break a run for others, necessarily, if you drop out.",1677294984,1677294984,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

As far as the roguelite elements go, there are plenty.  There are lots of choices to be made that effect your run, between locations, enemies, items and cards, with an in-game resource that is  plentiful enough that you always feel like you're doing something, but limited enough that you cannot go spend-happy and overpower your character easily.

The combat itself has a unique element, flows well, and rewards tactics while still having enough randomness to be a rougelite.

It's highly polished with minimal bugs, challenging but also tons of potential for completely busted builds. It should be noted that as of right now, this game is HEAVILY geared towards multiplayer, which is most fun if you have friends to play with. I've enjoyed playing with randoms as well, though your mileage may vary. Single-player is possible but not the way to go yet.

I think there are a lot of reviewers that are being very harsh on the game thus far. It's an early access game. It's not perfect, there are some balance issues, there are still some quality of life things that need to be addressed, but the devs put a feedback button in the game, they're listening to people in the discussions page, they've already laid out plans they have for changes to single-player and bug fixes and updates to everything else I've already mentioned. Making a card game is hard, things aren't going to be balanced and fair right out the gate, which is why they are taking feedback.

My friends and I could easily pour 100+ hours into this game as it is right now. It is incredibly satisfying to play and build decks together, to work together as a team, and so many times we might find ourselves in seemingly dire situations, but then we somehow we beat the odds through communication and teamwork and playing our cards just right and it just feels [i]very[/i] good.

Anyhow, as a huge fan of Book of Demons, I bought HELLCARD to support the developer with good faith that they will make an awesome and innovative game. They have a good track record and I have high hope for this game. Single player to me is like a training ground, to get familiarize with the cards and mechanics and to experiment different approaches. Co-op multi-player is where the real fun is. There is no need to perform a light touch management of the two AI companions like the single player mode. I prefer to play with actual players and to learn from others. So far, finding group is easy. But you do have to put in 1.5+ hrs to stay with the group till the end. That is quite a bit of time commitment.

The current build works well and I enjoy playing this game, though it is not my favorite genre. I have live streamed this game on my YouTube. Feel free to check it out. I‚Äôll update this review as I play.

Only real gripe is I wish there was an easier way to share information with teammates.

Game needs to be about doubled or more, and I mean with everything. It's a 12 stage game and I play with two friends.

I don't see us losing ever again unless something gets patched in. Mage cycles everyones cards, rogue uses a single upgrade base card to 1 shot everything while our warrior just does whatever.

Needs a longer stage list, or a harder campaign for characters that have completed the 12 stage gauntlet. More characters, with their own decks, and please please add an in-game chat.

The cards feel great (although some mroe than others obviously) and i love that ""upgrading"" cards does not necessarely mean getting ""better"" versions, but rather different versions of cards, makes the progression of each dungeon very unique.

Having just 3 starter classes seems like very little at first, but with the right teams you can build about 3 or 4 subclasses for every class. You can also combine all classes with one another and make it work, which means you dont even have to play one of each.

All in all, this game is great and I would recommend it to everyone who likes Deckbuilders.

Single Player:
The main issue is not having complete control over how the companion decks are built, and a lot of card functionality is lost. Cards that read ""All heroes draw cards"" simply result in your main player character being the only one who draws a card. Something like this doesnt sound like a big deal but it really makes certain premade companion decks feel terrible at certain parts of the run.

Multiplayer:
Probably great with friends, but matchmaking games are kind of a nightmare. After a dozen attemps at of playing arun from start to finish, I rarely make it beyond wave 5 before someone up and leaves. Although the game will scale the difficulty back it sadly loses a lot of its charm as well when theres no longer a 3 person party. The game attempts to remedy this by simply letting over people join your run whenever, but it typically results in an endless attempt to find a third player. Should you find a third to fill theyre usually much earlier in a run and the power scaling doesnt take this into account if youre on wave 12, pretty much killing your run.

When they offered a (limited) demo I played through it and was intrigued yet sceptical and since that demo 4 months ago not much seemed to have changed. 

In Book of Demons you can configure how hard your run is supposed to be and how long. That is a feature missing here. Probably because you only do fixed length runs in Hellcard. 
But even with that I can't finish a single run because I get overrun constantly by unfair enemies around the second boss and you can't do anything against it because your starting cards are shit and usable healing opportunties are scarce. There is a significantly worse deck building system in this than Book of Demons and that is confusing. It worked just fine in BoD, why deviate so much?
While I get to choose my Deck in BoD before I start a run while unlocking new cards and improvements over time. In Hellcard the character I use decides what cards I get to work with and only after finishing runs I get new/better cards, it looks like? The base cards almost all suck, however. The only advantage you might have on a new run is that you can add up to 3 artifacts to start with, if you unlocked them.

Maybe I am just shit at this game but in BoD I knew I screwed up when I died. Hellcard is nothing more than another Slay the Spire type of game where the game decides for you when to end it no matter how good you played your part. That takes away a lot of fun that could be had in this. Perhaps add a difficulty setting for people like me who want to play games to enjoy and not to work and ragequit them.

Sure, it's early access but that is nothing but an excuse these days. Even for EA this is very barebones. 
Wait for a long time until you try this. The demo is basically all the game has to offer at this point except for a few other characters.
Rather play Book of Demons, that is actually really fun.

If I could, I'd return this game for now and try it in a year or two again when it is on sale for less than 10‚Ç¨.
Sorry, devs. This isn't anywhere near the level of BoD.

This one has (so far) some of the same enemies and playable characters/heroes from the so titled Book of Demons game that came before this. It differs immensely in that it's a turn based deckbuilder strategy game. And the most fun and tactical one I've played yet. Starting off with one character and going up to 3 with the battlefield splitting evenly with each new addition-on top of the simple near/far range mechanic for determining enemy position, this game has a ton of depth to it. I've obviously only played a couple hours so far, but I got to try out a few different character/party combos and got to see their different starting cards and how they work together with each other. I can already tell there's going to be an insane amount of replayability to this game. I only tried 4 different heroes. I kept the Protector and Berserker companions both times and swapped out my Mage for a Rogue. The classes of characters you pick will determine the types of cards and attacks/abilities they can use. The Rogue could kick an enemy from near to far range and potentially stop their attack, for example. But the Mage had magic missiles that would restore his Mana (used to play cards) if it was the killing blow on an enemy. The protector and Berserker both had some AoE cards that were useful for clearly out a cluster of enemies on top of plenty of cards to shield my main character/themselves or deal with the enemies in close range. I still want to play around with different party combos and cards/abilities, but from what I saw so far, there's a whole host of options to deal with the enemies in the game.

It's also got a lot of strategic depth when considering the enemies and whose section of the battlefield they're on in addition to simply whether they're near or far. Some enemies will try to summon in new ones or buff others. Some will try to reposition to flank you or get close enough to attack. Some have special effects like they'll automatically damage whoever attacked them if it wasn't a killing blow. I even saw a skeleton that would summon other skeletons every time he was attacked.

Most of these card based roguelike/lite games I've played are just you and the enemy or at best, there's a front and a back section on both sides of the field for you and the enemies. This is the first one that makes it look like a back to back to back surrounded on all sides kind of fight and then lets you freely position/aim most of your attacks against enemies that can themselves be freely positioned on the battlefield. There's only near/far and which of the characters' section of the field they're on. A couple of pixels could be all the difference between whether you can get that one additional enemy in your AoE attack or if you've gotta choose between it and another one or another cluster of enemies. I really enjoy that much freedom to fail so to speak. It makes each victory seem that much better when you can see the full battlefield like that and successfully manipulate it to survive each encounter.

I didn't even touch on the fact that you get to pick one of 2 options for each floor you descend and the choices determine the enemies that spawn on each character's side of the battlefield PLUS the reward you get after the battle. Maybe you chose to fight some skeletons to get the room to remove cards from your deck. Maybe you choose to fight some stinky cows to loot some corpses after the fight and get some new cards-whatever you choose, your 2 companions also get a choice and if you're playing solo, you can use up a limited number of times to force your companion to choose a different room. Either cause the enemies or the reward at the end will be better.

After the fights, you usually get a Gem you can use to engage with the rewards, a new card, and sometimes can swap out a companion for a different one. The Gems are used to pick one of the options from each of the 3 rooms you and your companions cleared out. I didn't usually have enough Gems to engage with most stuff and would end up going past. Usually cause I'd spend a Gem on a 50% gamble to get 3 Gems and fail. Blasted RNG haha.

Both my runs ended at the first real boss fights, but I was expecting that in a roguelike. When my run ended, I unlocked rewards based on my performance. I don't remember everything you can unlock there, but it's not just new artifacts to equip to your characters when they start new runs-although the artifacts are nice. They're a thing you can find on your runs that might upgrade one of your cards, or grant various special effects. If you've played any of these deckbuilder roguelites, I'm sure you're familiar with the little artifacts that can do stuff like heal you a bit after a battle, grant more of whatever you need to play the cards themselves in a turn, or deal damage to some enemies at the start of combat.

The game feels pretty feature complete so far. Aside from Steam achievements, I'm not sure what else they even really need to add to this game, but if they wanna put more content into it, I won't say no. I saw the roadmap includes another playable class, mod support, and more. If you're looking for a good new deckbuilder roguelike/lite (what is the difference in roguelike/lite? anything?) then definitely check this one out. 

I hope I'm not too bold in saying, this little game feels like it's close to if not on par with Larion's turn based strategy games, this one just has a smaller budget and revolves around cards to determine and cast your abilities. There's so much more to it than I can put into this review. I wish I could be playing both this and Book of Demons at the same time.",1676810614,1676810614,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

It is similar to Slay the Spire in some regard, but is also unique in its emphasis on unit location for some skills.  It adds a layer of complexity when a ""far range damage dealer"" is separate from a ""close range"" or ""AOE dealer"".

Only complaints so far is the desire for more options to pick from at the start of a run (such as more classes) because even though the same class can diverge into many possible builds they still feel pretty same during the early part of a run.  I also wish there was an additional form of upgrading abilities beyond just transforming them into something better.  It can be as simple as a normal one time upgrade to potency without changing the name, or a gem slot to allow an additional unique modifier such as ""cost reduction"" or ""retainability"".  Despite this the gameplay loop is incredibly well executed, and satisfying to play.  So even at its current state I give Hellcard a full recommendation.

There are solo, and matchmaking options if you ""don't have friends"" so don't feel like it is a multiplayer only title.  Although taking advantage of the co-op balancing this game is based around adds an extra layer of fun that you are unlikely to find on other games of the genre.

It takes 1-2 hours to clear a full run and there doesn't seem to be much of any motivation to keep playing more other than unlocking cosmetic costumes, cards, artifacts and companion classes, each of which basically just offers a slight potential change to the experience, which is still largely governed by RNG.

With the [b]huge[/b] reminder that at the time of this review- the game is [b][u]Early Access[/u][/b].

Meaning it is not complete, it is not finished, it is still in development, and not content complete.
Seeing too many negative reviews acting as if the reviewer did not read the huge blue Early Access disclaimer at the top of the game description on the store page.

The game is fun, and entirely playable right now, runs really well on a slightly older desktop running Windows 10 with an i9 9900K/2070 Super RTX, I have not had a chance t try running it on another older and lower-spec machine i have, or on my Linux machine using Proton to see if it will run on Linux at all right now. But so far I have had no bugs or issues with stuttering or hitching, it runs at a full 144 fps even during really busy screens, though it did take a minute of fiddling with setting to get the game to stop recommending 1920x1080 (16:9) and let me set it for 2560x1440 (16:9) in borderless windowed mode. (No launch code or script needed- just a little fiddling with the settings menu).

The game still needs balancing, especially for singleplayer mode- it's a tough game that requires strategy out the whazoo- but the way companions and their decks, gems and artifacts are handled- you can't strategize really well because you can't buy anything for companions when you win a battle and reach the ""shop"" where you can buy artifacts, healing and upgrades with the gems you get as reward for winning a battle.
I have not played any online MP/co-op yet, because i generally do not enjoy playing MP with randoms I don't know to understand their motivations and playstyles. I don;t add random people on Steam- my friends list is small for a reason, and none of my Steam friends own the game, so I can't join a game with them or invite them to a game I may host. Reading the forums, it seems that most MP players feel like the game is better in MP/co-op. So, I may join a random game at some point. Maybe.

The devs are very active on the Steam forums, and on their own Discord for their games, and seem to take feedback (positive and negative) very well, with a good sense of humor. I really enjoyed Book Of Demons, and it took a while for the game to grow and evolve into what it became in its final form. I expect this game will also continue to grow and evolve and become better with time.

The game, as of this review, feels a little bare-bones. So, if you aren't sure- I recommend waiting to see how things change as the small dev team works on the game and builds it out. And again- if you buy during Early Access- you are buying an unfinished game, with no guarantees that it will evolve into ""the perfect game"" for you. 
Also keep in mind  that the war in Ukraine could affect development schedules- the studio is based in Poland, not far from the front lines, and very much affected by what is happening next door to their country. If TSHTF over there, things could get delayed and affected before the game is fully developed. No politics- just the realities of life in that part of the world right now.

I am happy with what the game is like right now, and I am hopeful it will become better over time, the same way Book Of Demons did.",1676672734,1676672734,True,17,2,0.687462151050567627,2,True,False,True

Pros: 
- I love yelling at my friends and being greedy for their skills. 
- So many cards and artifact combos to consider, I feel like I've barely scratched the surface. 
- Torments are a great concept and work well, and add an extra level of challenge and long-term value. 
- Varied enemies makes each combat interesting. 
- Being able to choose what you're going to fight and what you might receive is an excellent way to implement risk / reward and put it in player hands. 
- Being able to pause a run and come back was something I didn't expect, but I'm very happy it's here. 
- Enemy design is fun, sometimes monochromatic - but every mob has a lot of personality. 
- Team work is crucial, and some of the enemy modifiers makes it a lot of fun to strategize and come out on top (sometimes) 
- Sharpening Bones

Cons: 
- The card text can be a little.... hard to understand (reads like it's translated sometimes?) 
- Artifacts are strong but there aren't very many of them (at least it feels that way) 
- Some mechanics aren't too fleshed out, Stamina for Warrior for example
- Playing the Rogue is kind of boring. I'd expect big damage or set-up, but you just become a bomb / stun bot by the end if you want to be useful. (Combos would be fun?)
- Torment balancing is 50/50, a level 1 torment that makes you take +1 damage from every attack is a lot harder to deal with than a level 2 torment that makes some shop options unavailable. 
- Personal preference, but I feel like there aren't enough floors / rooms. I would prefer a longer game.

!!! biggest complaint !!! 
- Please let me skip the annoying voice lines at the end of a run.  

All-In-All, it's a good experience. With some time and polish, it'll be a genre staple.

The near/far range circles create an interesting dilemma: You may kick an opponent out of the inner circle to stop them exploding and dealing damage to your heroes, and suddenly realize that you don't have enough long range DPS to finish them this turn and that they are about to buff themselves or another minion. 

It's surprisingly deep. The companions also have some unique synergies, such as the mage class being able to empty their own mana pool, but link with the other companions and duplicate their previous amount to both other heroes.

It is the best coop rpg I played so far with the perfect balance of establishing a cool combo between all characters or doing a full hand alone.

Pros
- A lot of variety in the builds.
- Many types of ennemies.
- THE BEST coop card game , you really need to communicate with your mates to win.

Cons
- Not THAT much content for the moment. Only 3 classes and few bosses. But the devs will probably add more later.
