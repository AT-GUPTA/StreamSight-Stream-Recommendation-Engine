Changed to positive after this and that updates. Though sadly I don't have time to play this again.


I did not play the original EA version so I'm basing this review on the newest release.
It's terrible.
Bad designs everywhere. Almost zero tutorial in a complex system with lots of hard-to-find function spots. You know, it's fine to allow players to take time and discover everything on their own. But this is not an excuse for not implementing any guidance at all.
The battle system is slow and intolerable unless your character can penetrate the opponent's defenses with ease. If you go into a slightly challenging fight, you will be doing no damage to the enemy at all. Or, it will take a VERY long time to fill their ""injury bar."" Why is it so hard to just use a regular HP bar?
The foundation of the game clearly lacked some important stuff before the game was released. For example, the story cannot even get a ""fixed plot death"" to run properly. Instead, you need to play normally and let a certain enemy defeat you at a certain spot to advance the story. While this fight is not that hard to manage. If you keep winning, you're stuck forever.
The game has potential. Or, it already achieved a lot for an indie game. But all of these incredible contents are based on a terribly-designed base that doesn't seem to be the work of a proper game developer.

The game has an amazing storyteller sitting at the top. But here's the problem: whoever's responsible for finishing up the book and deliver it to the world to read, did a poop job.",1663875745,1707747558,True,0,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

about game:
this game is a sandbox martial arts role play action adventure game with tons of details
hard to learn but very unique experience (steam guides and discord guides realy helpful)
game is long and hard for first couple hours i'm 100 hours in and at the year 51, i think im at the %35 of the story and %15 of the game completion
game has very basic base building and town management, companion system being friend or enemies, merchants, crafting equipment, poison stuff, tomb digging or treasure digging, cities and sects to visit, learning martial arts, managing which arts to learn use, tactical card minigame, cricket catching and battling minigame, tournaments and lots of stuff that i dont remember now

gameplay:
real game starts at the taiwu village and now you can go explore the world and visit sects get their support, learn their martial arts, upgrade village, get companion, marry, have children or fight the bosses to death(not recommended) basicly you start within the village and there is world before you so take your time and explore the world get powerfull and challange the boss when you have a family member with you

story:
you are a descendant of the taiwu (aka the sword holder) your quest is to get strong and beat the evil by the time you age marry and have children and at some point your main character dies and all his knowledge transfer to new heir this means new character but the world continues and every heir get stronger and stronger so you play a family of heroes to beat the evil and save the world",1700608477,1700608477,True,5,0,0.584987878799438477,0,True,False,True

The remastered version was out a couple days ago. Game has been overhauled, no English still.
UIs are very clunky just like the old version, but looked a little nicer. Tutorial is still missing but massive new stuffs are implemented. 
A solid NO for any English speaker to try the game at the current state. It looks good and needs a hell lot of polish to go smoothly. Everything it offers right now are not really shining in the way they should.

I think they will fix the game eventually. And, only after that eventually, English will come. So take your time and have your coffee. This dish is not ready yet.




*EA Oct 02 2021*
I wanna say this is a good game. But this game is unfinished. We still have no idea when it's gonna be finished but I would only recommend anyone to purchase when it is finished. Also English is not supported, yet.

If you are okay with a sandbox Chinese cultivation games, that has almost no story but huge world content, then, only then, you could try this out for a go. This game is just too damn hard to get your hands on. But once you are in, you're in for 100 hours minimum. Learning curve is super steep since there are too many things. It will only be interesting when you understand 75% of the game, and that's a lot.

And you will like it once you understand what you are doing.

给制作组一个建议，功法还有属性这种游戏基础机制别大改了，好不容易熟悉机制结果更新一来全得重学，就算是远行星号和CDDA这种更改非常频繁的游戏都没有大改基础机制和玩法，太吾这种机制复杂的游戏改底层玩法架构很容易劝退老玩家。现在追太吾的都是老玩家了，要明白你的目标客户定位啊。
还有建议再在玩家体验上下功夫，别整奇遇移动速度和坐骑质量相关了，直接整个奇遇快进键或者跳过键吧，奇遇里基本都是垃圾时间，真的不想浪费时间看走格子。
Edit：什么傻缺剧情，什么傻缺bug

I am looking forward to future updates that would complete the background stories and the main story as the developers promised. 

Still, there is a little bit of concern about general modding support. Ever since they released the pretty much useless event editor early 2023, the devs seldom mentioned their future plans for modding tools. As of now, I find modding extremely tedious, and I can hardly understand the decompiled code. In fact, the modding community barely submitted any 'constructive' mods that, IMO, extend game experience. Thus I hope that the devs could finalize and release their game editor tools after the last major update this year. I believe that is the only way to turn things around and save this game.


//
Old review below, wrote in April, 2023, kept here as a reminder of how terribly this game used to perform,

It's been half a year since release, and now we can officially say this game is dead. It's broken beyond repair, no one could fix this kind of game.

There is no bug-free zone in this game, even walking around could cause fatal error. And you can't manually save, all your progress and RNG will be lost, if your save happen to be fine after all. ps. mods that support manual save would cause more errors to the base game, that's an amount bigger than infinity.

There is no concept of performance, no computer could handle this game without suffer. It's laggy the first time you open the character panel, be thankful 'cause that actually gonna be your most smooth experience. Yeah the devs can blame everything on ""that programmer"" who dropped half way, they always get something to blame, covid, flu, and their granny perhaps.

There must be good in this game, you wonder, or why I put this long comment here, how to explain my 400h play record. The legacy version, held the good and potential, though lack of art and other general content, put faith in me five years ago. None left now.

To all potential players, DO NOT BUY

加个结局都比这好玩多了。

立绘为什么变丑了？？？？原来还能越做越差的？？？

修改：好吧，修复的很努力，反人类UI也做了改动，还是改个好评吧，希望以后能更加完善。
通关评价：真的一坨翔。
作为一个收集建设的游戏给你搞的一点喘息都没有一直催着你打进度。
剑冢骚扰也就不说了，结局boss战真的是跟屎一样。
绘卷收集不齐恶心强迫症玩家，非要堆到后面给你放一大堆连战。
做了徐仙宫奇遇只给玩家两个选项：通关废档删游戏，通不了关卡在这里废档。
剧情简直都是次要的了。我就不吐槽了。
插个几柄剑都要几个月回档都没法回。
死了没法传剑还没法继续练级。
更不用说结局连战和最后一个剑冢间的战力差了。
前面一场剑冢想送死都打我不掉血，然后打过了，啪，超级强无敌boss战连打。
压根不让人传剑。
就给玩家一种：“你通关吧，我们不想让你玩了。别练了别收集了之前想打的奇遇也别打了”的流氓感。
想看看小时候的依以侯在地图上跑，好么，依以侯剑冢没有，直接给你变成奇遇龙套。完了直接奔着大结局就去了。
茄子你怕是智障吧？你是智障吗？你这个确实是智障吧？
前半段节奏松散，不打boss不让学新武功。
后半段压根没节奏，啥都不干点鼠标练级几十小时。

你这就看个片大家衣服一脱突然开始放天线宝宝，最后再尼玛给你来个科幻结尾。

有一个极其繁复复杂的战斗系统，但却不能真正地鼓励玩法套路的多样性

给与了玩家充分的沙盒和养成体验，后期却没有与之相匹配的精彩内容

Boss的设计各有特色，丰富立体，但是过于死板的剑冢机制在游戏过程中产生了大量的重复内容和垃圾时间

第一次经历太吾绘卷，觉得那就像是一部精彩的小说，有角色，剧本，背景设定，画面，机制。就仿佛真的如同天地的绘卷般，梦与江湖的宏大在挥毫泼墨间展现得淋漓尽致。

但当你真正开始游玩时，你就发现体验完全不是这么一回事。有多少的时间浪费在了查找攻略，寻求Build，搞最优解，种田，SL读书。新手或者一般的玩家要么缺乏指引，要么没有时间去专研，根本没有能力去参与这些曲折离奇的伤害计算机制，或者学习研究游戏的内容。而当你真正花时间去研究了之后，发现也许来来去去的也就是一些偷窃流，种田流，核弹流这种既成的套路。而等你真的天下无敌之后，你又会觉得后期的游戏内容乏善可陈，除了主线以外，并没有什么别的可做了。而主线本身，又充满了作者自身个人的喜好，作为小说看也许还行，但作为游戏的一部分意义不大。

这就好比你为了玩这个游戏，必须去做大量和玩游戏无关的内容，仅仅只是为了玩好这个游戏，而当你发现你真的玩好了这个游戏之后，这个游戏就已经没什么可以玩的了。

沙盒游戏的乐趣本来就在游戏的自由度，对未知的探索，对世界的发掘，和NPC的交流，资源的采集和利用。但是练武的时间却大大占用了这些游戏当中原本该是核心的部分。玩家被迫在探索和习武之间选择，必然就会造成设计和体验间严重的割裂。而如果游戏的最终目的仅仅只是为了挑战剑冢，那么开放世界的意义又何在呢？为了找一个外表随机得不错的NPC当伴侣？为了体验一下各种乱搞性关系的节目内容？离开了直播间的节目效果和论坛的话题，又有多少人会孜孜不倦地反复去做这些事情呢？


我能感受到螺舟在太吾绘卷的创作中倾注的满满诚意，但却又不得不说游戏的机制和设定上实在是有太多这种似是而非的东西。

缺乏以游戏体验为中心的设计逻辑，使得太吾绘卷能够打破常规，大胆创新，发展出新的沉浸式体验，但却终究逃脱种种机制流于表面，不合常理，以及昂杂无用的问题。过于零碎，割裂，以及不能相辅相成的游戏内容，令我甚至觉得螺舟不是在做一款游戏，而是在写一部小说的同时做一款迷你小游戏，你只有在小游戏上通关了，才能把这本小说读下去。

虽然这么说了，但我觉得太吾绘卷还是国产游戏的一次了不起的创新，一款独一无二的作品。我希望螺舟工作室能够一直努力下去，我期望能够见到他们的下一部作品。",1673158539,1673158539,True,16,0,0.70967257022857666,0,True,False,True

I'd still recommend most english speaking players to wait for official english translations but for those who are ok dealing with a bit of janky language you can play right now.

---

A hugely indepth RPG with town, faction and relationship management.
This is a complex game, it will take many hours just to learn the systems and hundreds to master.

Dying is not the end in this game, it is often beneficial as it allows you to power up your successor.

This is not just a game about combat, you must develop your life skills as well as your combat skills to be able to succeed and there are a large number of combinations that will work for you which you can tailor to your preferred play style.

You can be good/evil/netural and variations of each which actually changes the way you need to play and interact with NPCs to be successful.

Playing as a male you can have your own harem and have lots of children, choose the best one to be your successor! 
Playing as a female character you have options to beneficially modify the stats of your baby and you will gain additional experience in combat while pregnant.

There is a good English translation mod available that you can find in the guides section. You will probably need to join the community discord to ask questions as the game has so many interconnected systems that it'll take you hundreds of hours to figure them all out by yourself.",1576634605,1665892125,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

To begin with: nothing in the new game's systems are worse then the previous ones. We've lost some things that are familiar (I personally loved the old reading system), but the systems that replace them either have more depth or more accessibility. Often both. This is still the same familiar game that everyone fell in love with, and the developers have shown their passion with daily bug fixes and updates. Which leads into my second point.

What's the most different about the update? The performance. I don't think people realise just how poorly optimised the previous version of this game was. It was horrendous, and it would get increasingly worse the more turns you took in the game. I was looking at upwards of 5 minute loading times for each turn on a gaming rig that can play the latest releases in 4K Ultra. Because it wasn't a hardware limitation but a software. The new version is incredible in comparison and it's obvious how much effort was spent in the backend of the game during closed development. That alone is an incredible difference.

Why is the game not released yet? The game needs lots of QA work. Bug fixing. Many minor improvements that really need to be worked on. The developers have always sucked at prioritising QA and the game's only just getting the bare-bones of its much needed QA now. Part of the reason you see people getting mad in the reviews is because there are no real tutorials. The game's still not new-player friendly.

People getting upset at the game is justified. Their blatant attempt at misleading people who read their reviews isn't. The update is a strong step forward for the game regardless of what they personally believe. Is it worth getting now? Yes, especially if you want to take advantage of EA price. The fan English translation is very presentable right now, and the official one will release in 3-6 months. The content is all there - balance, bug-fixing and QA are the core of the updates. However you can also wait. At this pace you're looking at them finishing off the game's polish in the same ETA as the translation (3-6 months).",1593227728,1665573759,True,17,0,0.644837915897369385,0,True,False,True

- the game is very poorly balanced on its difficulty levels, you could autopilot half of the game on easy mode, and you will think the AI is unfair and cheating on hard mode.
- cluttered information, just take a look at Grim Dawn, Grim dawn has maybe three times more character information, and it's well organized, and presented in layers, without any inconvenience to check. in SoTW the information just smacks you in the face.

TLDR; Currently not recommended with the latest update in Sep 22 due to to many game-breaking bugs.

Edit 27 Sep: Recommended again as bug fixes are in, doesn't really live up to expectations considering the 3 year closed development but its still fun as I remember.

This game showed promise back in 2019. You were basically the chosen one in a wuxia world, training yourself to defeat an evil force that was possessing people and making them go insane. The UI and tutorial were simple and largely incomplete as an early access game, but there were enough guides to walk you through the early access build.

After the prologue explaining the backstory, you become head of a village which serves as a sort of base to develop as you wish. There is a lot of flexibility, you could focus on having the village make money, recruit people, produce resources, serve as a training dojo for a variety of skills. It was a simple city sim, building up your village took time but it was fun when everything was running and you stopped worrying about finances.

Training your character was just reading books and practicing martial arts by meditating, sparring or in actual combat. It was very repetitive, but because of the world built around it didn't really feel boring. As the chosen one, you were allowed to learn from every one of the sects, but to access the higher level skills you needed to have influence with members of the sect. So you went around making friends (and likely enemies), going around to get the experience to level up your skills. 

There were multiple ways to build your character. Your generated character will have strengths and weaknesses. It was easier to master a skill you had talent in, but you could also become a master with the other skills with enough time and hard work. You could be a lightning bruiser rushing up to your opponent for a beat down with your fists. a musician which sent sound waves to wreck your opponents with internal damage, an assassin that threw flying daggers coated with poison while staying out of reach. The hundred over skills across the various weapon types to mix and match were honestly really fun and deep enough to hold interest, each skill had an orthodox and unorthodox version with slightly different effects. 

As the game progresses, you come face to face with death many times. Most of the time you are victorious in your battles, but this time you can't escape death. Whether its from an apparition in a sword tomb, a vendetta from a sect's head, or maybe even old age. As your character dies, the torch is passed to the next character to carry on the fight. Maybe its your 14 year old daughter currently being trained at one of the sects on your instructions, maybe its your companion who was with you and witnessed your death, maybe its a random stranger who happened to be around. With your death you pass on your knowledge to them and continue the fight. Each character left their mark on the village and passed on their experiences until you beat the game, 

Even as an early access game, you could feel the scale of the world that the developers were aiming for. They went into closed development in Sep 2019 to polish the game. Honestly, the demand was there and people were understanding at that time.

This was pretty much the start of an example of how not to do PR.

Closed development went on for 3 years until 21 Sep 2022. There were impromptu updates but none of them showed any resembling gameplay, mechanics, screenshots or UI. There were zero releases in those 3 year and some people believed they took the money and ran with no plans for a final release. They promised a release in Sep 22 but even up to early Sep  they were requesting for ""beta testers"" from the community to playtest their game for bugs. 

As of 1 day after the Sep 22 release, there have been multiple complaints on crash to desktop, the lack of any sort of tutorial and complaints that most of the changes have made things worse. UI was changed, and it felt like there was zero consideration for UX. The damage system was changed, but there was no tutorial explaining how combat works. There have been 2 hotfixes for bugs just the past day.

Honestly, I believe the deadline of Sep 22 was a management decision given the past 3 years. You can feel that they rushed it out and that it is not a finished product by any means, it is a beta release at best. The release on Sep 22 does not live up to any expectations over the past 3 years and I honestly think it would have been better if they had released alpha versions and sought community feedback during development.",1663862598,1664283278,True,2,0,0.518248140811920166,0,True,False,True

I can still see it as Taiwu but alot also changed and had to be relearned. Overall though, the QoL of the game has been imrpoved compared to the atrocious original, art got all around better, and the new combat/martial art/book reading system all seems to be taking things in the right direction.

Make no mistake however, this game is still a game in its EA stage, I have beat 3 of the sword tombs and content isn't significantly improved from old taiwu, just polished or redone. Some of the new addition like the chicken house and multiple travel locations doesnt seem to do much at all. There are many janky balance issues like cricket battle now bringing almost no income (was too high before), you can pretty easily cheese the art competition to rob NPC of items without making too many enemies, etc... But the dev have done a good job in the last few days pumping out updates, if it keeps up, I am optimistic.

As for bugs people mentioned, I have not encountered anything game breaking that can't be fixed by simply exit and restart, but fortunately I am following the path of those who came before as dev seems to be fixing bugs that appear just a tad ahead of my progress. 

Lastly, just like the original taiwu, the ingame tutorial and info is atrocious and will not help you learn the game at all, if you cannot watch a chinese guide video I'd suggest wait until some more guide comes out, even now I am half trying to figure out mechanics, half searching on baidu as I go.

Overall, you traded one EA game with massive potential with a more polished EA game with massive potential, but very much still an EA game. I dont see it leaving EA for awhile, so if you can wait, I'd suggest you do, but if you really want to scratch the taiwu itch after the long hiatus I'd say you will have fun as you always had with the previous version.

正式版出成这样一点也不意外，说实话，在封闭测试前，茄子只知道为了所谓平衡性不停地修改功法催破数值的时候，我就隐约意识到，这哥们可能不知道这游戏为啥当时吸引了这么多玩家。

整个过程我感觉就是，一个人碰巧做出了一个大家都觉得不错的作品，而误以为自己就是一个天才，做什么大家都会喜欢。而正式版虽然是有一个团队在后面开发弄出来，效果还不如一个人做的抢先体验版，我只能说是，可能茄子也没有特别杰出的管理和与人沟通的能力。这一点从茄子之前跟玩家的沟通就能看出来，这也不是赖自己没有专人搞宣发就能掩盖的。

我很同意其中评论区一位玩家说的话，现在的感觉不是说bug多所以大家有意见，而是方向错了，而茄子意识到方向错在哪了没？这一点只有天知道。游戏做到这一步，我觉得向前向后都会很难，但希望以后的游戏制作人能够引以为戒，我还是很期待将来会有更多更好的国产游戏能陆续出来。

一开始刚购入的时候，我是非常惊艳于这个游戏的模式以及深度的，毕竟这些年卖座的游戏，游戏模式都非常趋同。太吾给独立游戏特别是武侠类游戏带来了新的曙光，所以相当多的玩家是能够理解制作人那种要把自己的想法贯彻下去的决心和动力。从发售到现在，太吾的问题不在于需要大量时间重构底层代码，而在于和既有的玩家的沟通的不到位，很多评论也都提及了，即使游戏开发需时，但也希望制作组给出时间表或者大致进度的更新。不过我给差评真正的原因是刚刚看到评论中有玩家提及到，制作组已经给番茄修改器的制作方发出警告，所以现在这个能让这个肝游不能肝的方式也被屏蔽掉了。我感到确实有些失望，因为除了制作组极度自我的风格，我确实没有感受到任何其与玩家群体沟通的诚意。可能太吾正式版还会像EA推出时那么惊艳，但是至此之前，我是不会更改这项差评，毕竟确实是有被制作组的态度伤害到。",1625555812,1664079928,False,6,0,0.492530852556228638,0,True,False,True

NGA有个帖子把被删除的爽点拉了个表，总结得相当到位，引起数百楼共鸣。对我而言，其中最要命的是：npc之间完全无任何交流（这个游戏能火的关键点，没了，导致玩不下去，我相信只是没有实装，但这种游戏命门不优先实装就非常迷惑）、衣着互动（也不优先实装，所以出生时可选衣服带入游戏是为了什么？）、斗蛐蛐（你家下注时能捂着？你愿意对方捂着赌注时就和他玩？真实吗？）、读书强制降低效率（闭关练功读书很真实，现在只能过月读书才一点都不真实，过去1个月3本书，现在1年能读3本就不错了，而且因为见闻系统的加入，完整读书的重要性增加，体验瞬间降低一个数量级）。
什么武学build，打斗机制，捏脸机制（多给几个脸型都做不到？人家mod都做出来了，你家美术是给你交钱才工作的吗？），混乱的UI交互，还有完全没提示的让玩家心力交瘁又无法享受游戏的种种“探索感”，大家已经吐槽过了，我就不再赘述。
现状的唯一解释：做正式版的人，不仅没玩过EA，而且没有游戏开发经验；做EA的人，没玩过正式版。

=====================================================================
Please play the game yourself instead of looking at all the negative reviews. Many of the bad reviews are reviewing out of emotion and barely have any game time.

This is the only game I waited years for. This is an author that could've taken the money and just said f*** it while the masses cursed his name but he stuck around to create the best game he could in his mind. Yes this game is not for everyone but for the crowd that it caters to, it is a masterpiece and unique in its own way. Not many games can say they created a genre but this game is the father of its kind. Through the many bugs and cons it may have, at the core it is the same game I loved from the original. 

Personally, from the original early release
* Graphics - much improved
* Animations - slightly improved
* Mechanics - easier and less grindy
* Guidance - not much but pretty intuitive if you played the original and have basic IQ 
* Story - greatly improved
* Overall - Huge props to the creators for sticking it through and adding so much content into the game and never giving up!!!

Haters will be haters, fuck em.


Original Review
=====================================================================
This is the best game I've played in a while and definite top 3 in my steam library of over hundreds of games. You are fully immersed in the world of jianghu and the world npc mechanic is amazing! You feel as if you are in a real life world instead of vising the same NPC and hearing the same dialog over and over again. The relationship system creates great (sometimes weird and funny) stories and each player can experience differently.

建筑方面我觉得还好，只是人数很快就没了，还需要平衡。商店呢？其他州大城不可能没有商店吧？难道只能等商人来？起码给个基础卖买道具的店吧？
没有了练功点格子小游戏，时间可以变得自由去找奇遇。这个和抓蟋蟀值得赞，但还可以更好。
七元设定搞得有选没选都没差，这体验你跟战斗部分换手动格子会好很多。不然没有历练惊喜感，一条路线下去就是没体验。

Positive
1. 更改的即时战斗模式我还是挺喜欢的，参与感高很多，而且动作绚丽了很多，打击感也增强了。
2. 地图的感觉不错，可以清晰看出地形等等。
3. 新的建筑立绘还挺顺眼的

Negative
1. 所有页面都UI基本都倒退了，4年你们到底做了什么？原来EA时候UI虽然不完美但是最起码简单清晰，一目了然。现在正式版做的什么鬼玩意儿？奇丑无比不说，密密麻麻一堆东西什么都看不清，满屏幕的小子。背包，奇遇，太吾村的UI 都被简化，丑陋到了极点。不知道你们的审美观哪里来的？原来好好的稍微更改一下就可以，你们把没有必要从做的东西从做了，还退步了，到底怎么想的？就是为了从做而从做？质量无所谓的？

2.严重缺乏提示（tooltips），很多东西就一个图片，标志，完全不知道什么鬼玩意儿，一点提示也没有，我还是玩了快400小时EA的，进来都一头雾水，别说新玩家了。

3.很多基本功能都没有了，比如太吾村资源收获页面，派遣人物不是按照最高技艺，完全随机，而且也不告诉你这个人物是不是已经在经营别的建筑了，还要我们自己去点开每个建筑去看一遍人物是否已被占用。

4.新设计的突破系统等等虽然稍微增加了一些新颖的东西，但是也就一点点而已，大体跟原来差不多，加上UI奇丑无比，还不如原来的体验好。


总体来说让人非常失望，整个游戏变的很丑陋，很繁杂。4年总体其实比EA还退步了。 对茄子的团队我是彻底不报期望了，只能希望他们快点把创意工坊打开，让玩家把这个游戏修好。",1607813141,1663911250,False,31,1,0.668671011924743652,0,True,False,True

3. About village management system: very poor. whenever I send a peasant for work, I don't know if the peasant is occupied. So if I build house, peasants would return to the village if they are working elsewhere (one turn) before building the house.

838350,122605483,76561198870653466,0,1,1320,0,276,1664069366,"I waited for this game SO LONG that my original steam account already became a hand-me-down to my son.

I also had 0 expectations for this game because I was tired of waiting.

But hey you know what, I talked shit about them for two years of their development behind closed doors and I should apologize by giving them another chance and try the game out now that they proved they really WERE working on the game instead of running with the money, right?

So I did.

And somehow this game showed me it's possible to be disappointed by 0 expectations.

So this is what happened in my 4 hours of playing this game, using my 500 hours of old EA knowledge to guesstimate and figure out the obtuse mechanics that are opaque and hardly intuitive for a new player:

Foster dad wants crickets. I catch crickets. I do Monkey sidequest.
COMBAT

Combat is now more active and faster paced, but unless you went into Keybinding menu to look at the controls, you don't even know what the hell to press. The game flashes with a symbol for left mouse click and D to move forward for like, 2 seconds and that's all you get for how battle controls work.

What they don't tell you:
How to move backwards
How to attack
How damage works
Why you can't move for a few seconds
How to use skills

But you know what? I played EA for 500 hours, I figured it all out so this is not why I am upset about this game, hardcore games require a bit of brain juice to get going, you know? Ezpz, low IQ shouldn't play this game.

So I go through with the story and exit the beginning valley and head into tutorial village.

Tutorial village chief is a madman and asks me to get him some Wild Grass to feed his crickets. Ok, no problem, wild grass right? I'm a high IQ megagenius, what he means is probably ""Go gather some food and herb resources."" I played EA for 500 hours, I know how this works. I step out of town and 3 NPCs accost me to tell me their sobstories or some such and give some basic semblance of choice at the beginning that I won't spoil for new players, but after their sobstories they scatter to the winds for you to find where the hell they went, totally optional, without telling you how to look for them. But I played EA for 500 hours so I know to look for the little person symbol on the map and talk to them one by one.

Then you do the Cricket tutorial with the kid NPC, and the cricket game tells you NOTHING ABOUT HOW ANY OF THIS SHIT WORKS. All it tells you is how to initiate a cricket fight. Which is about how much I learned in my 500 hours of EA time, so whatever, you watch the autobattler go until one side wins or whatever, someone more cricket-savvy can judge this part of the game, not my cup of tea, moving on.

Then edgy-girl NPC gives you her sob story and promises to teach you martial arts if you spar with her. Without telling you how to spar with her. But I know how to spar with her because I played EA for 500 hours and then I found out she gives you nothing if you spar with her.

Then you talk to asshole NPC who tells you to do bad things instead of doing these inane quests to get what you want, but I want to experience this in full so I ignored him.

Finally, there's a poor tortured soul who wants to help you finish this quest and tells you how to gather food.

So I gather food.

Now, bit of context here because OF COURSE YOU NEED CONTEXT FOR ANYTHING IN THIS GAME: When you gather food, you get a number of Food as a generic resource. But SOMETIMES, there is a SMALL CHANCE to get an ACTUAL FOOD ITEM that goes into your inventory instead of being a number in your resource bar.

I DID NOT get ACTUAL FOOD ITEM. I got 124 UNITS OF FOOD. I take 124 UNITS OF FOOD to crazy old man who wants wild grass. No response.

Ok, I figured it out, I need ACTUAL FOOD ITEM. Except now there's BARELY ANY FOOD ON THE MAP TO ROLL FOR FOOD ITEM. GOD DAMN.

So I pass the month looking for more food tiles.

Still no random food, shitty luck.

So I go back to the ORIGINAL tile where there was plenty of food and has respawned due to season, where the guy who was helping you out is just standing.

And he was like ""yo bro I got you here's some WHEAT""

Horray, I got my Wild Grass, ok that was on me, maybe they had a failsafe in the UNLIKELY CHANCE YOU STAND STILL DOING NOTHING BUT WAITING FOR A HANDOUT.

So I go back to crazy old man who wanted Wild Grass. ""YOU THINK THAT'S ENOUGH FOOD?! GET ME MORE!""

So I go back to helpful guy. Nothing. I go look for food. Nothing. Month pass. Helpful guy gives me another wheat when I visit him again, I'm starting to see a pattern here.

So I go back to crazy old man. ""YOU THINK THAT'S ENOUGH FOOD?! GET ME MORE!"" But then quest dialogue continues, ""Maybe it's not the food number, you have to COOK the food!"" Great, NOW you tell me how to access Cooking mechanic.

So I cook the food, pretty straight forward here... Then I give it to the crazy old man, and then we find out the crazy old man is keeping you in the village on purpose. Badabing badaboom, things happen, the tutorials were very convoluted and confusing and was like one of those forcefeeding tutorials where you must do everything they tell you to do, except they tell you nothing and you have to figure things out for yourself, ok, no problem, I played EA for 500 hours I can handle it.

So then this happens and that happens and finally you chance upon the titular TAIWU VILLAGE where it will become your main hub and main center of gameplay! Finally! The game is about to open up!

Oh, by the way, this is where I hit my 2 hour mark.

So then I head into the Taiwu Village, the cutscenes happen, you're crowned the king of Taiwu village...

And in the EA, this is where you're tasked with rebuilding the Hall of Taiwu. In the new, improved, updated version? They talk about how there's this sagely immortal living in the mountains.

Meanwhile, silently in the background, you are given access to building the Taiwu Village with no fanfare or anything.

But I played EA for 500 hours so I know what to do, I searched all over the entire freaking screen to find the tiny little hammer that's the Build button, and build a Hall of Taiwu.

Then I skip TWO ENTIRE FREAKING MONTHS BEFORE THE GAME OPENS UP THE NEXT QUEST, AS IF THERE'S ENOUGH GAME OPENED UP FOR ME TO FILL UP AN ENTIRE MONTH WITH ACTIVITY, before I can visit the sage in the mountains. Which opens up the sword tombs.

So one of the sword tomb spawns a nerfed boss ghost to attack the village. I played the EA for 500 hours so I know this is a tutorial for the invasion mechanic, ezpz. I go out to meet the ghost in combat. With a bit of cheese I won the fight, and ""The apparition dissipates and appears again at sword tomb."" Ok, maybe the fight was a little too hard for people who didn't play EA for 500 hours and I was meant to lose. So I lost on purpose. Back to title screen. Ok, you know what? Maybe it's a MORE FOOD situation, so I killed the apparition 4 times. Nothing happened. Finally, I am stumped. So after an entire hour and half of beating the apparition up to no avail, I look up the forums.

""You have to let the ghost enter Taiwu village.""

OOOOH, ok, let me just TWIDDLE MY THUMB SITTING IN MY VILLAGE FOR 3 ENTIRE MONTHS (90 DAYS OF ACTIVITIES) WITH NOTHING TO DO UNTIL THE GHOST FLOATS OVER TO ASSAULT THE VILLAGE. This is the TUTORIAL, mind you.

When it finally came, I blew my 3 months of pent up load in her face.

""The apparition dissipates and appears back at the sword tomb.""

I WAS SUPPOSED TO FUCKING LOSE HERE?!

So I Alt+F4'd to savescum to rewind this month instead of WAITING ANOTHER 3 MONTHS but I needed to tell my story here first.

TL;DR - After improving the game for 2 years behind closed doors in a circlejerk environment where they shut out all outside negativity, this game has become inherently inhuman in its gameplay design. It's kind of like asking for a bowl of soup and they give you a bowl of top quality engine oil, and you're not a robot...

===============================
edit after Sep 21, 2022 update.
sorry, I have to keep the thumb down review for this one.

What am I doing? where am I? What I should do next?  Those 3 questions keep popping up. 

I only noticed visual improvement after 3 years since I played last time.  The battle part is more tedious than before. I like the previous one much more than this one. 

The story mode is not even there, what have been done in the past two years' ""intensive development""?

The new version is worse than the previous one. The combat has gone to shit (why force players to manually move and click for normal attack? it is annoying as hell), the UI is more confusing than ever, the adventure mode is super weird now, the optimisation is non-existing, and I can't bother to play anymore after 2 hours into the new version.

I am utterly disappointed by the dev.

The Scroll of Taiwu is like one of those early 90s MUD game. The selling point is freedom to do whatever you want. While you can be a good guy and fight the incarnation of cliche evilness, you are also allowed to 

1) poison and kill infants; 
2) have unconsensual sex with women (and they may like it depending on how they view you); 
3) kidnap children and make them go insane so that you can steal their skills; 
4) commit adultery; 
5) just kill everyone.

注：对我来说十分出色，但个人感觉游戏类型玩法相较于别的游戏还是小众化的，加上没有引导，及其容易劝退）
游戏优点：
总体内容充实，比如：家园建设，读书，人物互动，战斗系统，奇遇，以及经典的蛐蛐
1. 其中战斗系统相当复杂且有意思，十五个门派，多达百种的功法技能，每一种还有正练逆练特效，可以产生多种搭配。
2. 玩家通过家园建设可以解锁不同功能，包括炼药，做饭，锻造，以及收集重要资源（特指钱）。
人物互动较为出色，可以和游戏中的npc进行多种互动，结交，加害，比试，交易，调节关系等。其中最令人期待的是婚恋繁衍（特指赌孩子，指结婚后赌生下来的孩子长大后的颜值和属性，emmmm大部分情况下都令人血压升高）
3. 奇遇，占据游戏相当大一部分的内容。在参加奇遇的时候会有不同的事件发生，面对事件做出选择获得收益（也可能会亏损）。大部分奇遇在最后才是关键点。比如促织高鸣的捉促织，比武招亲最后玩家打完情敌收获老婆，促织大会最后的奖励等，每个奇遇十分令人期待。
4. 蛐蛐，捉蛐蛐，斗蛐蛐，研究蛐蛐属性（叫声），刷蛐蛐胜场，参加促织大会，蛐蛐可太好玩了。
以上列举了一些留下深刻映像的系统。
其实作为玩家我觉得游戏值得夸赞的一点在于每次解锁世界进度的时候都会解锁更多的玩法或者功能以及玩法的环环相扣，所以游戏总是能在玩腻的时候带来一丝新鲜感。比如一开始想着手太吾村建设，会发现缺钱缺材料。玩家不得不去探索地图，抓/斗蛐蛐赚钱。等探索腻了，抓/斗蛐蛐累了，玩家刚好获得了钱和材料去进行村子的建设。村子的建设又要求了建筑蓝图，和读书技艺等级。为此玩家不得不学习交易，刷商家好感，以及参加奇遇商贾云集。村子好不容易建好后发现想要建设更高级设施需要打剑冢，为此又要学习功法,技能搭配以及复杂的战斗系统。这时候好不容易打过剑冢，发现世界解锁了更新的东西（实际上是玩家有能力去完成一些很难通过的奇遇），这时候又带来新鲜感。这些内容平均下来每一个都足够玩家体验数十小时而不腻，所以游戏性还是很高的。
缺点：
1. 为了后期打剑冢，玩家大概率需要花几十个小时读书，不可否认新鲜感一过之后只剩下痛苦
2. 教艺有些鸡肋
3. 人物互动固然有意思，但玩多了也就那么几样，而且缺失很多很多细节，总是一个互动点一下就结束了，缺少真实感。
4. 奇遇有点少，玩法个人不太喜欢（但完全可以接受）
还有其它缺点但暂时想不起来，有可能是玩多了玩腻了才会觉得是缺点，而且正式版很多东西都会变所以十分期待。
但最期待的还是mod。以上缺点完全可以通过mod改善，有了太吾的框架，这款游戏的潜力很大
(p.s. 有没有可能mod作者完全可以用游戏框架复刻一本金庸小说.....甚至想一想，找几本玄幻小说复刻好像也不是不可能？更甚者，再包含上述mod的情况下加个联机模式....?）
关于为什么会写评论
也就是2022.1.12号螺洲发了游戏更新进度动态后吧，有相当一部分人表达了失望和愤怒。
尤其是在今天看到有人拿 “我相信steam的评论” 来说事。好吧，你要的评论来了。
怎么说呢，太吾绘卷开发时间长，2021 coming soon跳票是事实，正常表达失望以及愤怒的完全可以理解。
但总有些人，没有实质证据情况下造谣太吾跑路，阴阳怪气太吾画饼，甚至公然嘲讽愿意等待和维护游戏的玩家。
看到这种评论，我只想说，拳头硬了，很想顺着网线给这种人一拳。
的确，并非所有玩家都会愿意花时间发表一番评论，但总有人喜欢太吾，相信螺舟，总有人愿意等......

-I meet some random guy, we talk a lot, then become friends, and then become lovers.
-He died because of my recklessness. I felt bad for my character so I try to woo some random women but no luck
-had another male lover, again. He died again because of an untended wound (gimme a break, I still learning the game!)
-depressed, trying to seduce characters again randomly.
-Add some random woman to the party, and we quickly become intimate and spend some nights together.
-dunno why she can't get pregnant, oh well.
-Had another companion, this time a male. He was pretty nice, but I got friend-zoned.
-We three had some good adventures together 
-One day in another village, I met a beggar woman, I felt bad for her, so I gave her some money.
-We quickly became friends.
-This woman continues chasing me like a stalker. Is she like me or something? So, I think, why not become lovers then? I confessed to her, and we quickly became lovers and married!
-Whenever I go, I take her with me, because if not, she's going to follow me like some kind of maniac.
-She then got pregnant (I seriously did not notice at this time).
-Again, I seduce random women whenever I go, meet some ugly woman when I come back to my village, and we become intimate easily (holy shit).
-Skips some time, my wife gave birth to triplets, then the ugly woman gave birth to twins.
-All the babies got locked into my party, so I must carry 'em whenever I go (why must the daddy take care of all these babies...?!)
-wife still in my party, we had a lot an intimate night, the ugly one too when I visited my village

-The ugly one went missing. I dunno where she went. I probably can't stand I keep cheating around.
-went into another village and befriended all the men and women.
-Had a crush on some pretty doctor, but she keeps rejecting me.
-Depressed because I can't get that chick
-I keep trying to confess to her again and again, but she keeps rejecting me. Guess I failed to add another person to my harem.
-become sworn brother-zoned by her (DAMMIT!)
-try to seduce some official, max his/her affection, but again keep getting rejected.
-depressed because I can't seem to woo people to join my harem. Did I get worse because I kept getting older? Am I getting ugly??
-meet some random merchant woman, manage to become lovers and become intimate (yis!!!).
-can't stand my wife because she's a nympho ( no kidding).  I kicked her out of the party. But she keeps chasing me wherever I go.
-had lots of intimate night merchant women, waiting for my 7th kid to be born.

With that said it is in a sense rogue like - you get old and die, the sword stores your kungfu which is then transferred to the next Taiwu. Another thing is you cannot get all the games techniques without dying a few times since some are gender locked and so on.

Music is great, nothing wrong here.

Combat is... wonky later on but it is pretty simple.

City Development - This is cumbersome and you will have to pay painful attention and attempt city building multiple times to optimize this part of the game in any meaningful way.

Art - I only wish there was more, it's great.

Graphics - Pretty nifty, nothing crazy but it isn't bad.

Gameplay - There are some things that feel like aside from it being a grind, that it is taking up too much time. So for instance the some of the transition screens just feel longer than they need to be,.

Scroll of Taiwu is a game that will easily amount to hundreds of hours of play.

This game has everything.
Great rpg system for people that like diverse builds, etc.
Various mechanics. Many different sects. Huge amount of different skills that work with and against each other. Elaborate crafting system. Village management with various buildings and villagers management. Alignment system that makes the word alive. Companions, sect members, your villagers, random villagers of many villages around the world, fight, live, get married, have kids, get recruited by you, act according to their alignment(Evil poison and rob, good teach etc), die etc, etc.
Everything has many tiers, allowing play and play and play. When your MC dies random/one you picked, inherits your efforts.

When I just started I didn't know that and the first epic boss with scripted appearance(random out of 10 epic bosses) killed me relatively easily.
Apparently you are not supposed to beat him on your first generation MC. BS! Pick the correct starting sect, combine skills, craft, learn, prepare, and you can beat it. It takes time and effort, but it is possible.

For people that like non-rushed strategic thinking this game is a blessing.
Overall I can carefully say that this is the best RPG I played.  This simply has much more options then alternatives I consider masterpieces.

Update:
After the first review, I spent like 150 hours in Cuzhi tournament (including catching them) and rare item digging. To hell with saving world.
Some design of the game is phenomenal, or addictive to some extent. Won't be surprised if someone quit drug abusing by playing this.

In fact, the game has a very long pace along with some terribly complex ways of playing. The writers only set 7 Jianzhong in a game probably is for the players to specify their powers to defeat the Jianzhong.  On the other hand, if all 9 Jianzhong are located in one game, and the game pace is redirected accordingly, then it is likely to find the Taiwu beaten 2 Jianzhong and then f*cked himself in a world full of stronger NPCs (due a increase in difficulty). 
A currrent important problem here is that many Taiwu cannot understand their duty as Taiwus in the game: they came not only for fighting against people and clearing the Jianzhongs, but also for participating in farming, running numbers, messing with the men and chasing after girls, finding brotherhood and family and wandering around for knowledge. Players are likely to have a pre-set for their Taiwus in the game, and they simply find themselves incapable to reach that goal. With all those wishes and dreams about purifying and protecting the entire world, they failed to reach their goal as a hero. Thats...just like reality, right? People would always find themselves the men they liked the least.

( this used to be a respond to one of many, um, comments of the game)
我玩下来也觉得只有7个剑冢是一件很鸡肋的事情。
实际上，游戏节奏的设定较为冗长，操作较为繁复是太吾绘卷不够吸引人的地方。制作组一开始做出来7个剑冢，可能是希望玩家依照这7个剑冢可能的属性去设计自己的角色的练武偏向。另一方面，如果做出9个剑冢，并且按照45点精纯调整游戏节奏，那么更有可能的是努力打完了两个剑冢，然而一抬头发现世界难度增加，刷出了许许多多令玩家毫无招架之力的怪。
现在的问题在于，许多太吾无法理解自己不仅仅是来斩妖除魔的，还是来种田/经商赚钱/比武泡妹子/找兄弟拜把子/到处找书看的。而另一部分人发现这个玩法的乐趣所在，但是苦于时间不够。玩家在创建人物时就已经有了一个关于自己想成为人的预设，而到了游戏当中无法实现从而开始抱怨，有了讨伐剑冢的理想却无法实现。实际上这也是社会的缩影：我们终究活成了自己不想要的样子。",1580995680,1580995680,True,0,0,0.491159111261367798,1,True,False,True

dont worry that doesnt matter theres a translation patch on discord done by a guy named teddy forest that has translated about 90% of the game (https://discordapp.com/invite/k78SA4n)  you will find no problem not being able to understand whats happening or what you need to do due to translation.

The game has a tutorial but it will only take you through the basics of the game and it will at least gives you an idea of how to play the game the reason why i say idea is very simple the game takes a sh*tload of hours of play through with trial and error to figure out there are many ways to play the game many cultivation paths you can take a wide variety of schools from good to evil, medicinal and poison, assassination one, a weapons one there's even a elegant one and others there's about 9 schools if I'm not wrong probably more too lazy to check either way you guys get the point.

The game is hereditary you pass down skills and such to the next generation but be careful not all are passed down only a certain amount so choose quality over quantity.When it comes to selecting a wife well check her stats and talents and make sure she has a high number on the ones you want your son/daughter to get or on the ones that better suit your martial arts path you trying to get your family to follow.
You also get to choose if your character is just, kind, even,rebel or egoist each allow you to choose different outcomes on adventures and certain actions when you choose different from what  you supposed to be your character gets a bit depressed so try not to choose different many times on succession that said if you are for example just and you only choose rebel for a certain amount of times not sure if in succession or not your character will switch their personality to rebel without you knowing.
well im tired of writing im gonna let you guys figure out the rest by yourself's good luck .

Almost forgot I highly recommend it if you like indie and strategy games this is for you the game is complex but once not hard to understand once you get down a strategy it becomes hard to let go of your computer this will take you generations untill you complete it and one life lasts a looooong time so you wont get bored of it quickly cause you completed it.",1565961168,1578502676,True,26,0,0.72758030891418457,0,True,False,True

 I've read many reviews saying that you need an in depth understanding of Chinese culture in order to enjoy it; that is absolutely false.

If you love thought provoking games that allow you to build on something over time, then this game is for you. It mixes elements from management, turn-based, rpg, world building and sim games, in to something new and engaging. Perfect for second monitor gameplay ;)

To the devs: I truly believe you are missing out on a huge potential customer base, as long as their is no official english translation.

Although it's a little brutal and depressing as the story requires, it's a nicely painted game of a genre that sadly under done in proper fashion.For those English speakers who want to get in a glorious world, there's a well done and nearly totally complete translation done by a man named Teddy forest that you can search for to understand your adventure through the Scroll of Taiwu.

For a game that's in 'Alpha', The Scroll of Taiwu has plenty of content to offer, from the rise of your bloodline in the main story to side professions and the myriad sects that dot the land, all with dozens of skills to learn and hundreds of randomly generated people to meet across their maps. More than one will end up as hated enemies or beloved family members throughout your many lives. Fighting it out for godly Treasures in the wake of natural disasters or finding natural materials, from the most common piece of copper to dragon bones and icy jades just begging to be turned into the best of equipment to be given to your friends or turned on your enemies. And enemies there are, from the lowliest bandits and diseased beggars looking to rob you to the deadly Sword Tombs, which have become the graves of many great heroes and threaten even the strongest Successor, and all the while your hated Enemy looms on the horizon. Whether you're a kind hero who spares the enemies defeated at the end of his staff or someone with a more... Extreme temperament, We're looking at you 'Just' players, Taiwu has the play style for you. Despite all thought on the contrary, your personality does not hinder your weapons nor your means or what skills you can learn, and even the most kind hearted hero may still poison his hated opponents to a painful death, even while a hateful villain may only beat and spare his opponents with his bare hands. From classics such as Wudang sword and Shaolin staff to hidden weapons, whips and even... Musical instruments?! The ways to bring down or defend those you meet on your journey are only smaller in number to those you'll meet. 

A personal suggestion I hope they add however, is a way to store items to allow your villagers to use them freely. As much as I like to play the divine doctor and cure all ails... I can't be looking over the health of 40 people every day. Currently my only way to know when someone is dieing is when they start losing years off their life, in which case I rush to their aid and restore their health and lost life span.

Honestly generally such game is never really my cup of tea. Thou I love wuxia stuffs, but this game is very much like a text base RPG game which is what i mean that it is actually not quite my cup of tea. I have never dig much visual novels as well as text base games. But after a couple of tries, I actually find this game pretty enjoyable. Maybe due to it's sandbox nature, allows me to do what I want and decide my own fate which is the really cool part of the game. The game does have pretty huge learn curves thou. Just when I thought I kinda understand the concept on how the game works, then I learn something new again which makes me feel stupid but in a good way. It is amazing that the game keep you discovering new things as you play. The short intro of the game thou is sufficient to get you started, but honestly going thru that you bearly touch the surface of the game. This game really have huge potential. And truly a hidden gem.

While this is still an EA, it is consider pretty stable and rich content wise simply because of the sandbox nature of it. The dev really deserve the support and I hope this really gets develop into something truly amazing. I can't wait for what's more to come even thou there are definitely much have not seen in the game. While I can recommend this game, please know what you are getting into as the game play may not be something you like. But once you really understand the game, you might really fall in love with it.

There is a straightforward mod made by TeddyForest, that you can find on the steam discussion boards. It translates more than enough of the game to make good sense of it. Without the slightest clue on Chinese language or culture I'm sailing.

This is one of the best games in my library. It gives me the same kind of ""I'll never need another game"" feeling that xcom2 and rimworld gave me (though obvs it's nothing like either of them). There is so much depth in building your village and character, and progressing throughout the game, learning all the different martial arts.I'm completely hooked. There's an amazing balance between just living in your village, studying the arts and fighting skills while building up support, and going out adventuring in the world, taking on villains and testing out your long studied skills. Simply working out the mechanics is like figuring out a whole new world, and very satisfying once you get the right combinations working. (While in the meantime becoming a chess grandmaster and fathering a brood of children one of which you will probably one day be playing as).

Highly recommended.

首先，我先重申：

这是个硬核肝帝游戏，这是个硬核肝帝游戏，这是个硬核肝帝游戏。重要的事情说三遍！！！
这是个硬核肝帝游戏，这是个硬核肝帝游戏，这是个硬核肝帝游戏。重要的事情说三遍！！！
这是个硬核肝帝游戏，这是个硬核肝帝游戏，这是个硬核肝帝游戏。重要的事情说三遍！！！

没错，这件事情本身也是重要的事情，也要说三遍！！！

如果你没有一个好肝，那么请绕道，这个游戏不适合你。如果你认为有，你可以继续看下去了。

这游戏预期说是个游戏，不如说是个武侠世界生成器。感觉类似于之前玩过的某飞行模拟器……优点是真实，缺点是太TMD真实……
我玩的时间不算长，600小时，但是也算能肝动大多数玩家了。

但是600小时之后你问我我的游戏感受，我认真的回答你：枯燥，但是不无聊。快乐，但是不轻松。

这游戏的重复性是否存在，认真地说存在，大多数游戏都存在的重复性在这个游戏中体现的可能更为明显一点。但是无论是地鼠（侠客）风云传还是刨矿世界（Minecraft）这种哪怕是半开放世界的游戏，重复性工作都是客观存在的。只是这个游戏采用了更极端的方式：它不再是点一下一个动画告诉你你学习了某个武功，而是采用了两个纯数字硬核游戏来表达你读书（心法）和练功（突破）的过程。这两个游戏硬核到很多玩家根本无法接受其中的数学模型，只是觉得：我做不到。实际上，游戏中遭遇战斗胜利过后会提高战斗突破的基础成功率，较艺胜利过后会提高杂学突破成功率。读书更是可以凭借堆悟性，造藏书阁阅经阁等多种手段来打成目的。但是唯一的问题是……看头顶上我说的前三句话。游戏开发者很清晰的表达出了，你想成为武侠中的人上人，你就需要付出足够的努力。你需要读书，练武，不同的武功还需要不同的技艺支持（比如少林寺的武功你需要佛学很好，然山仙师的武功就要求你在占卜上投入更多的精力）。也许可能会门口一个乞丐在机缘巧合下学会了太极剑法，但是由于他没有剑术基础，也没有道法理论支撑，个人资质没有定力加强。虽然剑法使出来凭借剑法的精妙能打到我。但是伤害效果却是大打折扣。完全符合越高深的武功越难的逻辑————但是也有特例，比如狮相门是个纯外功门派，它的武功就只要求你体格足够强悍，身体越好攻击就是越高。
可是以上的一切，体现在几十个小时的游戏逻辑里，你会发现你就真真正正的成了一个江湖中人。你需要真的拿出江湖中人应有的时间去练武。台上一分钟，台下十年功的含义被表现得淋漓尽致。武侠小说里我们看到的都是快意恩仇，却很少有人思索在快意恩仇背后，每一个侠客背后所付出的艰辛努力。

这也就是这游戏差评的由来：是我们玩游戏，还是游戏玩我们？我们代入了游戏中的人物，却发现我们不由自主的被这个江湖所控制，本来生活就很累，玩个游戏难道也要这么累么？

但是这也同样是这个游戏好评的由来：这就是真实的江湖，真正的武侠游戏，没有付出就是没有回报。也许五代人的努力，可能仅仅是为了最后一剑定乾坤的舒爽，是在无尽的默默努力之后终于得到回报的畅快。

我通关3个周目了，但是依然乐此不疲。虽然，真的很疲……

但是……我依然乐在其中，因为天知道这个档会变成什么样子……这个档里的世界会变成什么样子。我喜欢在通关的过程中，认真的去读每一个跟我有交集和没有交集的NPC随机出现的故事。被妖女蛊惑，千夫所指的少林方丈；一心爱慕百花谷谷主，最终做好事做到誉满天下的五仙教圣姑；村中行乞，机缘巧合偷学会一招太极剑法后干脆拜入武当，终成一代名宿的小卒。不甘被棒打鸳鸯，和被金刚门驱逐的弟子一同跑去村庄做木匠的少妇。心性大变入魔的人，就算你解救回村子，他的仇人依然会不死不休的追逐，除非你这个村长出面消耗声望来化解。因为萍水相逢爱慕你的人，也可能这辈子不求名分的跟你东奔西走（哪怕不在一个队伍里）。

你可以做一个优秀的村长，村庄科教文卫繁荣昌盛，各地商贾慕名而来，岁入近百万银钱（哪怕是最顶尖的材料书籍不过十万银钱），天下事没有钱砸不下来的。你也可以做一个行侠仗义的侠客，学好武功仗剑天涯，装备全靠杀歹徒强盗爆，钱全靠卖东西所得，浪迹天涯四海为家结交天下英雄。你还可以当个江湖大盗，专挑名门大派的弟子下手，杀其人，夺其谱。你甚至可以当个天下第一厨神，路边采个鸡蛋做一盘天地一口香，天下英豪会为之驻足……问题是……你做哪一个，都需要付出足够的努力。赚钱你就要安排人手建设村子，调配人工世界各地找材料，必要时候甚至要亲自跑去买，同时还要研究对应的技艺（譬如你想修藏经阁，那么你佛学至少要达到相当高的造诣），如果你要出去行侠仗义，你至少一半的时间是闷在家里读书练功的，否则你就不是去行侠仗义，而是被行侠仗义了……而这个过程的枯燥，和你最后获得的快感，成不成比例……只能说见仁见智吧……

扯了这么多没用的，最后说一句，这是个好游戏，我会一直支持下去。不推荐没时间的玩家选择这个游戏，它真的一点都不快餐，甚至认真地说你的第一次成就感可能甚至来自于100小时之后回顾这个过程的努力……

但是无论如何，武侠就在这里，太吾就在这里……

Long text alarm            
First of all, I would like to reiterate:            
This is a hard core game. This is a hard core liver game. This is a hard core game. Important things are to be repeated for 3 times!!!            
This is a hard core game. This is a hard core liver game. This is a hard core game. Important things are to be repeated for 3 times!!!            
This is a hard core game. This is a hard core liver game. This is a hard core game. Important things are to be repeated for 3 times!!!            
Yes, this is also an important thing, and three times!!! 

If you are not a very very good hard-core game player, please bypass. This game is not suitable for you. But if you think so, you may keep on reading

This is more like a Chinese martial art world rather than a game. It feels like a flight simulator that I has been played before. The merit is real, the shortcoming is such stupid real......
I didn't play so long, just 600 hours, but it is enough for me to write something. 

After 600 hours playing,you asked me how I felt about the game? I seriously answered you: reapeatable, but not boring. Happy, but not easy. 

Whether there is repetition in the game or not, seriously speaking, most games have repetition that may be more obvious in this game. But whether it's a hamster or a minecraft, for a semi-open world game, repetitive work is objective. 

Is this game a more extreme way: it is no longer a point about the animation to tell you that you learn a skill, instead of using two pure digital hardcore games to express your reading and Practice. These two games are so hard-core that many players simply can't accept the mathematical model, just think: I can't do it.

But in fact, encountering combat victory in the game will increase the basic success rate of combat breakthroughs, compared with the success rate of miscellaneous learning breakthroughs after victory.

Reading can be accomplished by many means, such as building a library, building a Kjing Pavilion and so on.

But the only problem is that the game is too hard-cored. 

Game developers have made it clear that if you want to be a great Chivalrous man, you need to work hard enough. 

You need to read books, practice martial arts, different martial arts also need different skills to support (such as Shaolin Temple Martial Arts you need Buddhism is very good, but the RanShan mountain immortal martial arts require you to invest more energy in divination). 

Perhaps a beggar at the door learned Tai Chi Sword(a very Advanced Wudang Factions swordplay) by chance, but because he had no foundation in fencing and no Taoist theory to support him, his personal strength was not enough.Though the sword method came out, it was able to hit me with the finesse of the sword. But the damage effect is greatly reduced.  Completely in line with the logic that the higher the martial arts are, the harder it is --- but there are exceptions, such as the Lion Phase Gate, which is a Factions of pure simple strength. Its martial arts only require you to be strong enough, the better the body, the higher the attack. 

But all of this, reflected in dozens of hours of game logic, you will find that you really become a man in a lake. You really need to take the time you need to practice martial arts. There is a Chinese saying that ""one minute on the stage,  the ten year's performance"" has been most vividly displayed. What we see in the martial arts novels is joy and revenge, but few people think about the hard work behind the joy and revenge, behind each Kjing Pavilion.

This is the origin of the game's Criticism: are we playing games or playing games with us? We have replaced the characters in the game, but found that we can not help but be controlled by this lake, the original life is very tired, play a game is also so tired? 

But this is also the origin of the game's praise: this is the real river and lake, the real martial arts game, no pay is no return. Maybe the efforts of the five generations are just for the comfort of the last undefeatalbe sword, and the joy of being rewarded after endless silent efforts. 

I've Eliminate final BOSS 3 times with 3 different Kjing Pavilion, but I still enjoy it. Though it is very very tired...

Because no one knows what this lake will be... I like to read every random NPC story that intersects and doesn't intersect with me during customs clearance. 
e.g.
The abbot of Shaolin, who was bewitched by a demon Factions‘ girl, Become poor reputation.(In this game ,abbot of Shaolin is who you come for Confession like the father in church).
A demon girl in Five Poison Factions, just because of love and admire the Lord of Dozen Flowers Factions(a high prestigious medical factions ) , and finally do good deeds to make her fame spreads throughout the world.
a village begger, chance coincides to learn a trick Tai Chi sword and then worship Wudang, eventually become a great Kjing Pavilion.
You can be an excellent village head,and in your leadership the village flourished, merchants from all over the country come here and make nearly a million silver dollars per year (even the top material or book are only 100,000 silver dollars per one), and there is no things in the world that can not be done by money. 
You can also be a knight-errant, learn martial arts to go out and wander, equipment by killing gangsters and robbers to obtain, money through the sale of goods, travel all over the world to make heroes.      
You can also be a bandits, robbing disciples of the great factions, robbing him even killing him. 
You can even be the world's top chef, just pick up an egg on the roadside ,can make the best dish,that could attract the highest-ranking people.(for Chinese,cook is cook,food is food)
The problem is... Whichever you do, you need to work hard enough.
Steam do not allow me to type more words,Input upper limited.
Anyway, the Taiwu is here. I am here.

Sorry for my poor English :P

-About How I found this game:
The game is like a Paradox game mixed with The Sims, but developed by only 5 ppl, including one founder who's just a normal gamer who'd love to burn his own money for the team to make this game.
One of the developer is my no-so-close friend. We have lunches n dinners sometimes and I've heard about this game through him before. However, I never expect their game to be so outstanding/ unique that it got me hooked immediately.

-About the game.
Unlike other Wuxia rpg games or most of the rpg games that only the things involved with your main hero matter. In this game, every NPC has their own life stories n relationships with others. 
The game auto saves every 30 days (in-game time) and operates what happened in this mounth for EVERY NPC, Wulin guild, village and city. NPCs interact with each other, live, work, learn, be sick/hurt and die without witnessed by you. You can make friends with the NPCs and invite them to accompany you, or learn/teach martial arts, life living skills and music&painting skills etc from/to them. You travel around in the ancient land of China, and learn various kinds of skills to help (or bother) ppl to win their support, and become a legend.

But most amazingly, after you died, [spoiler]you can choose one of your friends to be your new main hero to pick up the duty and continue your journey. That means you don't play as your first character forever. However as an individual character, your new hero may not have the same talents as yours. So I'd like to interact more with the most talented NPCs I can find to pass my duty to one of them. Or, you can just get married and then give birth to babies that inherite from you, then choose them to be your  successor. If you die alone, random NPC will pick up your sword and become your new main hero.[/spoiler]

I have to introduce a concept REINCARNATION in this game. After one(including every NPC and your main hero) dies, part of their spirit and talents will reincarnate into random newborns, and you can find them somewhere around the world. You may check the previous life of every ppl you met, or follow the hint told by your dead friend through dreams to find their afterlife. Kinda creepy but that's just a part of Chinese traditional belief.

It's hard to introduce the game here in the review bc it has massive systems& mini games. All I need to tell is that this game may be one of the most unique games you've ever played in your life,
and it's not available in English, yet :P It's still an early access version, the team needs time and professional help to complete the game. So it might be a while before the English version is available. 

Good day, and have good luck finding crickets!

Ok now I've played this game for over 40 hours and I still have new things to learn. Part of that was bc that the game‘s lack of wikis n in-game tutorial, part of that was bc it really has massive systems and more deadly -- hidden freatures.

BTW this game is kinda friendly to LGBT players. Plenty of gay characters and you can chose to be a trans hero. [spoiler] Some Wulin guilds only accept apprentice of specific gender, like Shaolin for males only or Xuannv for females only. Well it's part of the Wuxia world settings of China, that some martial arts can only be taught to male/female apprentice. But if you chose to be a ""male born as a female"" or ""female born as a male"", then you'll be accepted by both gender-required wulin guilds. [/spoiler] Have fun!

Ok now It's been 58hours in game. I didn't spend much time on the game bc I busy working life but tbh I'd rather spend all my night playing this game, but if I do that I'll die. I watched some vids about the game and started to search for guides. The bosses are impossible for me to challenge cuz me as a Chinese have totally not realize the working system of those martial arts, especially the way they effect each other and the differences of learning them thought different type of books.

According to the develop team, the mechanics and frame of this game is 90% complete, but only 30% content is covered for the current version. Still, I already spent 100+ hours of my time in a week since this game was released. The Scroll of Taiwu is definitely one of the best independent rougelike games I’ve ever played, and it’s my most anticipated strategy RPG in near future.
The game is based on an ancient Chinese Wuxia world-set, but perhaps borrowed some concepts of Chthulhu which makes it an interesting mix: There is a threatening being known as Xiangshu (相枢), which slowly corrupt people’s mind and once nearly destroyed the whole world. And the characters you play are the successor of Taiwu (太吾), who hold a Saint Sword (伏虞剑) and are supposed to stop Xiangshu and save the world. The work will continue for generations, so after the first character dies (get killed or just reach his/her age), you’ll play his/her successor, who could either be the son/daughter, or a companion you had (your decision to make). The skill you learnt will be passed on by the Saint Sword, but because each character has his/her unique status which may or may not be suitable for the build you planned, you should plan very carefully before making decision about the successor of your current character.
The game is a turn-based sandbox RPG, similar to Taiko Rissiden, you spend your action point practicing skill, visiting different places for adventure, or collecting your resources to build your base (Taiwu Village). After all your action points spent, you enter the next month and may encounter random events depending on what you did and who is standing next to you. There are two different types of skill trees: one is fighting skill and the other one is your life skill, for both skills, you need to collect relevant skill books to learn, and practice/breakthrough in an appropriate building (both require your action point). In current version, there are 15 factions in the game where you can learn different skills, but you can only learn the very basic ones at the beginning until you earn enough support from other members in the faction to unlock the next tire. Furthermore, ‘learning’ the martial art (fighting skill) is merely the very first step, in order to master each skill you also need to meet different requirements, which can be a life skill, or your character stats (by the way, you do not simply gain exp and ‘level up’ in this game, you only get a higher stat by ‘equip’ a skill you learnt)
I’m not going too deep to the complex fighting mechanics, which may worth a whole wiki site to explain, and I’m going to list a couple of other things you might find interesting:
1.	Completely random but interesting interactions between npc: all NPCs in this game live their own life (or even next-life) which may or may not has anything to do with you. They fall in love, get married and have a family, become enemy or best buddy with other NPCs. Although there isn’t much lines they speak (which may because this game is still in Beta version), but it makes you feel that each character has a unique personality and life. 
2.	Beautiful but somewhat realistic Martial art combat display: finally, the martial art skill is no longer one slash followed by a beam of laser or something. I also believe each fighting skill has a unique animation.
3.	Cricket Fight: You gotta catch 'em all!
As I said a number of times, this is still an early access version so the game still have a number of things need to be improved: NPC’s AI and their action is a bit too random and sometimes seems ‘very wrong’, the content in late game might be a little repetitive, the game only automatically save after each term and sometimes you have to be a save-scum to roll the best results. And most importantly, this game only has Chinese sub at this moment and probably for a while. But please understand and give the develop team just a little more time (considering it only has 4 formal members in the team up to this point, and believe or not, they are basically self-funded during the process of developing), there will be a masterpiece in one or two years.",1538424329,1538424577,True,230,25,0.932402729988098145,9,True,False,True

The world is static and interactive when the player is in action, the player's turn ends, and every NPC or natural event in the game runs on its own logic.
And our current general game, the whole world is still.
This game world is self-running.
To make a real RPG feel, the world can't be completely around the protagonist, but has its own rules of operation.
That day civilization can make a non-round effect, Zelda can not surround the protagonist and the level, Warcraft does not rely on the player. The world of this game may have formed.

这个游戏思路可以看到一些最基础的游戏世界逻辑思路

玩家行动时世界是静止可交互的，玩家回合结束，游戏中每个NPC或自然事件都凭自身逻辑运转一次。
而我们现在的一般游戏，整个世界都是静止的。
这个游戏世界，是可以自己运转的。
要做出真实RPG的感觉，世界就不能是完全围绕主角运转，而是有自己的运行规则。
那天文明能够做出非回合的效果，塞尔达可以不围绕主角与关卡，魔兽不依赖于玩家。这个游戏的世界，也许就形成了。",1538105866,1538105866,True,3,0,0.548872172832489014,0,True,False,True

I will put down an English comment for those who interest in worldwide.

Take it as simple, Rimworld with martial arts.
10 life cycle with a straight timeline. (Well I never make it to 3rd round yet, so unconfirmed :P)

You can start your beginning but with random various of personality.
You almost can do anything you want in the world, fighting, poison someone, marriage, kids...etc
And before you notice, 12 hour passed. (Yeap that's exactly how my yesterday slipped away)

However, there is still some cons that Devs need to work on more and adjust quick.
1. VERY, VERY POOR tutorial, basically I will say it is just a starting plot. No explanation on pretty much everything except battle. (which is the least important part to worry about) And it take me like 4-5 times to restart just because I finally understand the mechanism.
2. Battles are routine in late period, you just keep adjust your distance and wait for the cool down then click the attack skill. While two black man are pretending they are busy. Teammates almost does nothing besides add some strength on your skill or poke enemy with a branch since dev didn't teach you how to equip the, 

Over all, it is a good game with great potential and full of new elements.

It's an extremely complex Wu Xia/Kong Fu world simulator. Managing your own village, learning new style from different guides and practicing them,  finding a good partner and get married, those are just some examples from the huge amount of actions this game allows you to do.

And the story doesn't end when your character dies. Taiwu has a sophisticate inherit system, and which is actually one of the core elements in this game. It's not posible to beat the game within one or two generations.  Selecting and cultivating your inheritor carefully to make sure the next generation is stronger than the last, is a necessary and fun part of the game.

It is also a living world. In such a small game, hundreds of charactors have their own everyday life and relations just like yourself. Like in Crusader Kings, charactors don't really have very complex AI but the way the system work make you think they are alive. If you pay attention to NPCs' life, you would find many interesting storys that can be a Wuxia fiction by themselves.

The combat system is not completed yet. The current system favors those styles that causing directly injure rather than debuff. So some famous style is totally unuseable in the game(Tai Ji is a lie!!). The KongFu system is too huge to describe by simply writing about it, you would have to try to understand how it work. Let me put it in this way: it fullfill every wet dream you ever had about a world of KongFu(more precisely, WuXia).

The UI is anti-human, it must be change. Saving is not stable. Considering how much time and energy you could put on one family line, it is simply unacceptable to see your save break. 

As an early access, the developer already let us see enough potential. Thank you and please keep going. Hire a professional programmer if you can afford please, because you deserve a rest and the game deserve a better frame.",1537953794,1537953794,True,430,42,0.946638047695159912,0,True,False,True

    + Really realistic Chinese swordsman style 
    + Extremely complex simulation systeam 
    + Relatively original inheritance system
    + Artistic style is just perfect  

    - Unreasonable game saving system
    - Poor combat system
    - Cumbersome UI interaction
    - No multilingual support

    This is an open  world swordsman simulation game which has roguelike elements.
It is just like Chinese Kongfu version of Sims. Inside the game of a fiction world you 
can learn the secret of kungfu, recruitment partners, fall in love with NPCs, even 
create the next generation and let them inherit your skills. So you play the role of the 
whole family. Also, the game has multiplex martial arts skills, life skills, social skills, etc. The 
text and dialogue are mixed with classical Chinese which is  extremely difficult to do 
localization.
************************************************************************************************
以下是较为主观的看法（仅评价缺点）:
    1.游戏的存档系统很差劲，作为一款随机性很大的回合类游戏，没有办法选择是
否在恰当的时机存档是很致命的。每次存档都要隔几天，中间可以夹杂大量操作，而且存档的时候没有取消，一旦不满意就要覆盖掉几天前（游戏中）的存档重新来过，很是麻烦。
    2.战斗系统完成度不高。战斗系统采用即时+暂停的方式进行表现，在操作手感上显得
一断一续，缺乏整体感和连贯感。尤其是武器招式不能在暂停的时候查看，更是给策略的
执行带来困难。由于游戏中的战斗频率并不是很高，所以感觉还是把战斗场景做精做长点好，
增强代入感。
    3.游戏的系统过于庞大，UI过于割裂，人机交互几乎没有。我看了全部的教程后对UI交互
还是云里雾里，最后不得不借助官方攻略来提升自己的操作，这部分硬核的过分了。
    4.游戏的本地化表现不够完美，多语言几乎没有，字体太小，部分文本还有性别的
文本错误（捏了个女娃，结果被称为“他”，emmm）。
     游戏还是不错的，在人性化层面多打磨打磨，一定能成为国人的好游戏的。",1537637839,1537803628,True,38,1,0.761911928653717041,2,True,False,True

- The usage of archaic Mandarin Chinese is well designed and carefully executed, the names of character traits and kung-fu styles are exquisite and noteworthy, which would inevitably lose its flavour through translation, and it is understandable for the devs to mothball their plans to include multiple languages (to a later date maybe?) since it would be extremely tough for localisation.
- The world feels alive since NPCs live their own lives like the protagonist sans the village management.
- Unbelievable amount of skills and kung-fus to learn and master, and this is where you would spend time on the most(unless you are into cricket fighting)
- The music is nice, but could be better.
- Relationships between characters can go very wrong, be prepared for pedophiles and CK2-esque idiosyncrasies.

Cons:
- Being in EA, the content is obviously lacking, but there are lots of other things that you can preoccupy yourself with.
- Newborn infants seem to know more types of kung-fus than you do, and they can sometimes even be the leader of a sect.
- Interactions between characters felt robotic, and their personalities are utterly one-dimensional. IMO Most people are morally ambiguous, and there are no good guys or bad guys, there are only people who did the right thing at the right time and people who did the wrong thing at the wrong time. The characters in this game on the other hand have clear-cut moral boundaries and you can either be a diabolical exemplar, neutral, or a biblical moralist. This underestimated the complexity of moral living. But the devs made quite an effort to create more traits to a character to make them believable, and to that I’m grateful. 
- Given the number of skills and martial arts you can learn and master there will be A LOT OF grinding, and it doesn’t matter that you are a genius, you would still learn skills at the same pace as your intellectual inferiors.
- The absence of a character’s ability to give consent to sexual intercourse. If you play as a female character and you have a bunch of male members in your party, be prepared to get pregnant 24/7.

TL;DR The game isn’t half bad at all, has much potential to be greater. Kudos to the devs.",1537759761,1537759761,True,51,16,0.803157150745391846,0,True,False,True

This game is amazing. I highly recommend this game to people who enjoy City Building + RPG + Sandbox + Ancient Chinese games.  This game contain elements from a vast veriety genres of games. You must be satisified with this ""cocktail"".

HOWEVER, I really hope that the developer allow players to save the game whenever they want. Currently, the game is saved only after one month (in game) is passed. This is not user friendly. 

MOREOVER, there should be more slots for saves. 3 slots are not enough. This is a PC game and I think think additional save data will not hamper the storage space of PC greatly. 

FINALLY, the fighting scene should not be two shadow fighting. I believe the developers should replace the shadows with the art of the characters. It is quite unreasonable to see monkey, wood-man, young monk and old guy share the same shadow.
