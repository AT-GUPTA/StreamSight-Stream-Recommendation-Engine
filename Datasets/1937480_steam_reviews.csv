Graphics are a little bit better and there's some minor feature changes that are ok. It is basically the same game though. However, I'm writing this review because of one very specific thing:

My favorite thing about OOTP 24 is that during a game the developers saw fit to add in an audible ""GOD DAMN IT!"" mixed in with the ambiguous crowd noise. The ""GOD DAMN IT!"" is always in the same nerdy voice (the kind you know belongs to a super punchable face). ""GOD DAMN IT!"" guy chimes in about 100 times per game and never for any discernible reason or in any recognizable pattern. It is the ONLY vocals in the entire game aside from a couple Umpire calls. 

So, basically, the OOTP developers decided that the best way to recreate the atmosphere of a live baseball game is to have some insufferable guy next to you repeatedly shouting ""GOD DAMN IT!"" at random intervals for the entirety of the game. It is extremely annoying after a while, but perhaps not terribly inaccurate.",1708740358,1708740358,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Has a good layout and details, and comprehensible also. There are some lacks to it, but overall it's a really fun game, even if you're not into playing 2D baseball game and would just solely focusing on managing as the general manager

Almost every utility in being a general manager of a baseball team exists here, even though still lacks in some department (like deferral in contracts like in real time MLB, or assigning some development focus on certain player's trait like in Football Manager games), but overall, they are pretty useful and helpful

But still lacks the relevant defensive stats to assess a player's defensive ability though, like DRS for example. And sometimes, for a newbie in the baseball sport in general, the stats are still in need in translation, so the assessment of players can be too lacking for newbies in the sport, even in the age where stats matters the most these days in the sport. 

Football Manager already has this feature, where some other personnel would translate the stats for you, and making a summary and illustration on what's going on, so even the newbies in the game can still has some grasp from the data analysis of the players and teams

And it's better in my opinion, where the MLB would come to the age of accountants, for the game to have more tools for the accounting parts of the team, where economy also plays an important role in the continuance of the team also. Deferrals of contracts comes to my mind as an example for that.

As background, I’m no expert but I have a fair number of hours in OOTP 21 and thoroughly enjoyed the game. I recently decided to upgrade to 24 but I have been disappointed.

First, and this has been widely reported, the financial system is definitely broken. I first realized this when I tried to trade a player who was making the major league minimum, and it was flagged as an invalid trade because the other team didn’t have enough budget to cover his salary! When I started checking other teams, I found that quite a few teams couldn’t afford to cover a minimum level salary. The financial issues pretty much bring trading to a halt unless you want someone else’s overpriced dregs. Interestingly, I didn’t have any problems managing my own budget, so this seems to be a problem with the way the AI manages its budgets.

Other things just seem odd. I listed a team need for starting pitcher prospects and got plenty of offers. Unfortunately, they all wanted my starting pitcher prospects in return. Why would I want to trade away my SP prospects if that’s what I need? I offered a contract extension to one of my players and he said it sounded fair and would get back to me soon. A couple of days later he refused the offer and made an insulting remark about what a bad offer I had given him. I got mad and force-quit the game. When I restarted, he accepted the offer and said it was just what he wanted. You could make the argument that another team made a better offer the first time, but this was an extension. That sort of thing shouldn’t be subject to RNG. Either he wants the offer, or he doesn’t.

In OOTP 21 whether my team was winning or losing, I had a pretty good idea why. My bullpen was weak, I didn’t have enough quality players, etc. In 24 I have no idea. In my last game, 23 of my 26 players were rated average or above and most were significantly above. I had a good balance between pitching and offense, but the team struggled to stay above .400. I don’t have a clue as to why. Sure, plenty of unexplained things happen in sports all the time but this is different. You might see your team win 5 in a row against the best teams in the league and then lose 6 in a row to the worst and it happens all the time.

I wish I could be specific about what exactly is wrong but something has changed in the way the AI behaves that just seems unbalanced. The bottom line is that the OOTP franchise is a good one and I highly recommend it, but I just can’t recommend 24.

I was a member of their forum from 2006 - 2010 or thereabout, and suddenly was BANNED!

Permanantly banned!

Ive tried contacting them over the years. Never get any response. Ive created new accounts to contact the friends Ive had, and to participate in online leagues. Kept getting perma banned.

No warnings ever issued. No explanation. Nothing. 

I just now joined their discord to try and actually directly confront one of their moderators. I explained some things to him, and he just ghosted me. Again. No rhyme, reason, or explanation. Nothing. 

See? If you are a voter in a western democratic nation, this is EXACTLY why you do NOT vote for right-wing pro-business people. This is how they run their companies. They want to ban you without ever being given any chance to confront whoever accused you of whatever you were accused of. You are given no defense, no explanation, nothing. Just. BAM! GONE!

It absolutely blows much bigger competitors out of the water in terms of the realism of its 'franchise' mode. I had previously bought and played a couple thousand hours of OOTP 21, and this game is definitely an improvement in most ways. 

There are however some issues that do need to be addressed that have (likely) been in every edition of OOTP at least since 21.

- Teams really really undervalue good relievers. I constantly find 60/65 overall relievers (Jorge Lopez, Jovani Moran, Sam Hentges to name a few) on the waiver wire that put up all star or near that performances the prior season. On top of that elite relievers seem to be really underpaid as compared to their real life counterparts (Ex. I just signed Edwin Diaz in 2026 as the Reds for 3 years 35 mil after he opted out of his original contract. He is guaranteed 2 years 37 mil in 2026 and 2027 from the Mets with his IRL contract. He has been consistently elite and an 80/80 player).

- Players value Indy ball contracts higher than minor league deals with MLB orgs. Yeah that doesn't happen in real life.

- Those same minor league tier guys will sometimes sign and get released from Indy ball teams HUNDREDS of times within the span of a couple years, sometimes they will sign and get released on the same day. Indy ball teams do naturally have more roster churn but it gets ridiculous scrolling through a player's page and seeing them signed to 30 different teams yet have never played a game for 90% of them.

- Trade frequency is somewhat of an issue. If I it set it to average, teams will trade like it is the trade deadline every day, then I set it to low and there was one trade between February and the beginning of July, the latter of which involved my team.

- If you let a star player go to Free Agency without offering them an extension prior to Free agency filings they will always ask you for 30 - 40% more salary than what they will accept from other teams. I believe their morale towards your team becomes negative. Most high level or elite players IRL always go into free agency to drive up their price, even if the end goal was to return to their original team. (See: Aaron Nola). 

- Arbitration and Arbitration estimates seem almost completely independent of the previous season's performance. A player could be worth -2.0 WAR each year and still want to double their salary in arbitration every season and reject any reasonable pre-arb extension deals. As long as they have high enough ratings, the player will usually get ruled in favor of during the hearings if you decide to tender them an offer, regardless of their actual performance.

- The draft in the game doesn't seem to reflect current MLB rules regarding the draft order other than the draft lottery. RoTY picks and Competitive Balance draft picks don't exist past the 2023 draft order, even though they are outlined in the CBA until 2026. 

- Not sure if it is just my game, but every International signing I make struggles for 2 to 3 years in DSL and ACL before developing any overall. This also happens to HS players for a similar amount of time. All of them hit below .200 or have ERA's over 10 for that time. The AI promotes them from the international complex, my coaches have good skills and there are plenty of players on the team so I'm inclined to believe the competition level for those leagues is too high for the players that should be there. I don't recall this being an issue in OOTP 21.

- The Indian guru haunts my nightmares

These are many of my personal pet peeves, but overall I can recommend the game to anyone who truly loves the statistical side of baseball. It is a steep learning curve on how to play the game and do it well, but once you do it is a really enjoyable experience building a franchise from the ground up and watching your players develop and achieve, one that no other game really comes close to.",1703375025,1703375025,True,8,0,0.614786028861999512,0,True,False,False

Imagine your team is up 9 runs and your pitcher is throwing a 1-hitter through the 5th against the shitty Giants.

I'm also frustrated with how summer college leagues have been implemented.  

Things I would like to see in 25:
NCAA/NAIA
Ability to run true college leagues and have those players go play summer ball before being drafted
Return of international pro leagues
A more elegant way of building the Caribbean Series
More attention paid to online league development and support.

Compared to prior years, the predatory gacha monetization strategies are on steroids - including a launch week $500 package (hidden behind a check box in order to see it) to buy enough currency to carry a whale team through the entire season. 

Additionally, the Live Spec process was intentionally nerfed to reduce free currency gains from the player base, and Quick Tournament rewards were cut in half. 

Lastly, they introduced a monthly subscription feature. It was a solid idea to get money from traditional non-spenders, but it actually creates a situation where you have to spend more time (extra tournament and draft slots).

All of these problems stem from bringing in a new Content Director who, while he has tremendous baseball knowledge, has *absolutely no idea* how to run a gacha game, which is what PT is. Furthermore, the company laid off the one helpful employee they had on the Discord this year. 

Oh, speaking of Discord: feel free not to voice any sort of constructive criticism there. The trigger-happy mods recently banned four members of the community for doing just that. No toxicity, no harrassment, just got tired of hearing people try to improve a flagging product. 

Participation is significantly down from prior years, and it's no surprise. PT needs a massive overhaul, and it should start by bringing in people who actually know how to run a gacha game to mix with those who have baseball knowledge.

I haven't played since 21 but it's more of the same (in my opinion). The addition of Perfect Team is...fine? I guess? It's not for me, it's not why I bought the game, but it might be why some do. The only real gripe I have with the game is how glitchy the animations are. It's so insanely frustrating to me to have the opponent hit a weak ground ball, the SS to pick it up with what seems to be 7 years to make the throw and they just...don't. Sometimes fielders and baserunners will run SUPER fast, other times they look like they are have a leisurely jog through the park on a Saturday morning.

Below are some observations/thoughts on specific facets of this newest version of OOTP.

[h1]Cons[/h1]

[b]Reduced League Landscape:[/b]
This is the first iteration I've played that has the restricted number of real leagues included, but I'd say that is the least of my concerns 20+ hours into OOTP 24. I know some users are upset about this development, but if you're someone like me, who only controls MLB teams, the difference will be pretty negligible besides any real life foreign players not being available in-game.

[b]User Interface:[/b]
Not my favorite styling compared to past versions, especially since they moved around some of the home/back/forward and ""Play"" buttons up top. Overall just feels like they didn't put any sort of design effort into the UI this year. 

[b]In-Game Graphics[/b]
I can understand why they are putting effort into making the game look ""pretty"" for game play, but I'm not a fan of it. It's probably just on my end, but my laptop (2019 Dell XPS 15 w/ i7) gets noticeable performance lag on anything else I have up in other screens when game play animations are running. This has caused me to switch back to the old-school 2D animation for the first time since OOTP 16. I should preface what I'm about to say next with the fact that I don't care one iota about improved game play graphics, but I feel like they spent way more time on graphics for 24 than they should have, and other aspects of the game play have suffered as a result. I dont expect, nor do I want, MLB the Show level graphics for OOTP. I'd much rather the devs focus on improving issues within the AI/game play that have been known and unaddressed for [i]years[/i].

[b]Trade Ai[/b]
One of the most noticeable drops in game play quality that I've seen so far is that of the Ai trade logic, specifically Ai-Ai trades. OOTP 24 has produced the most lopsided and unrealistic Ai trades that I've seen from an OOTP game. I do play on the hardest trading difficulty, and I have the preference set in the middle for vets/prospects, but multiple times I've seen high rated prospects (55-65 FV) get traded for completely unrealistic and garbage returns. I'm talking about one or two 20/20 PV/FV caliber players. I thought maybe my scouting accuracy wasn't up to date on some of those players, but nope, they're all high accuracy and still minor league filler players getting traded for 55-65 FV prospects. I had heard about some bugggy trade logic on the OOTP subreddit, but figured that it'd be fixed by July. This one buggy feature has honestly made me stop playing the game for a few days because these trades completely take you out of any realism that the game immerses you in. Like I would spend days working on trade on hard-mode without the ""Make this work"" button to make realistic trades, and then the Phillies are over here trading Andrew Painter for a 34 year old 25/35 journeyman and a 20 year old 20/20 prospect with 25 potential across the board.

[b]Draft Prospect Ratings[/b]
Maybe it's just me, but all the draft prospect FV ratings are way too high and seem to be handed far too frequently. There were enough 80 FV players (all scouted to very high accuracy mind you) to last 2 whole rounds! In real life, you're lucky if you get one 80 FV in a draft, so this was another thing that completely took the realism out of it for me. 

[h1]Pros[/h1]

[b]International Scouting[/b]
I have thoroughly enjoyed the new IFA signing system where you build relationships with players to later sign them instead of throwing $5 mil at one player every year and hoping they sign. This adds true realism to the game and is the type of game play feature that the devs should be focusing more of their attention on instead of incremental improvements to the in-game graphics. 

[b]Trading Reputation[/b]
This is another new fantastic new feature in my opinion that adds true realism to the game, as front offices do build relationships between each other and often partner with some teams more than others on trades. I'd even like to see this expanded further to add even more realism in the game, like having an all-encompassing reputation with players/execs that can go up or down significantly based on certain actions you take (ie trading a player that just signed a large FA deal will tank your reputation with players, loading up on rule 5 picks to then trade will tank your reputation with execs). 

[h1]Overall[/h1]

OOTP 24 can be summed up as being a game that made much needed strides in certain areas, but went backwards in other somewhat surprising and concerning ways. Because of this, this is the first time I would not recommend an OOTP game to others.",1690496190,1690496190,False,4,0,0.543005824089050293,0,True,False,False

This is a definitively worse product since the ownership change a couple years ago.  I am specifically talking about the baseball simulation game, as that is what OOTP is supposed to be.  Perfect Team may be fun for some, I have no interest, but it is very clear that is the place all development effort is focused.

It's just little things.  Finances are glitchy.  Even with scouts turned off and 100% accurate scouting set, pitcher overall and potential scouting ratings change dependent on what view you are using to look at them.  The AI can't tell what players should be at what positions, so it brutally mismanages minors.  Several versions after they were introduced, the AI still has no idea what to do with 2 way players, so it misuses them.  It generates impossible two way player positional combos and far too many.  

I have played in online leagues with OOTP for a decade now, and will continue to buy versions as long as I play, but they are getting progressively worse.  This game peaked around 19 to 20.  Every version since has introduced new bugs that are never quite fixed and carry on to the next version.  Every new feature is shoddily implemented and never really completely fleshed out.  OOTP has not kept up with modern analytical understanding of baseball either.  For many, that's probably fine.  It does a good job of representing how we understood baseball 10-15 years ago, so it's not trapped in the dark ages, but there's no effort to incorporate any of the new things we've seen over the last 5-7 years.

It's the best product of it's type out there for mass consumption, but I wouldn't buy it to play single player.  It's a shame, this used to be such a great franchise.  I'm early awaiting the competitor that replaces it.",1690344391,1690344391,False,21,0,0.669822096824645996,0,True,False,False

Surprised some of the 2023 MLB rule changes weren't defaulted in the game - such as the new shift rules.  Played through a few seasons in one game, setup a new game with a fictional set of league players to adjust sliders and get things to my liking.  Played through about 80 seasons on that game.  The simulation randomization is terrible.  The best teams lose way too often in the playoffs.  I once decided to try and edit all my players to be way better than what they were to get me to the playoffs, and still ended up going 7 games in each playoff level only to lose in the finals.  Something's up with the way the top user teams always end up going the full # of games in each playoff series.

Shhhh don't say anything about it in the forums, people there are pretty awful about criticism of the game unless you have 5000 posts or more already.

The Perfect Team mode is still super pay to win, or filled with people who game the system (people who can get 6 teams, those same folks who set their alarms to wake up at 8am and sign up for the best 128 team tournaments with the best rewards with each of their 6 teams, etc.).  The perfect team forums are a mixed bag of helpful people and people who love to gloat and put down other players with ""my team is in diamond league, you can get there in 6 weeks for free by doing the right things"" etc.  They'll tell you how they finished X missions quickly, but there's no way to do that unless you are on the auction house 12 hours a day.  Wish there was a way to play in leagues in this mode where others didn't pay any extra money either, but there's not.  You're stuck with these PTW people.

1) Make it so I can clap back at players. When a trash player insults me and my team for only offering him a minor league deal I should be able to respond to him that he's a trash ass player that will never make the majors. Also being able to chat with players if they aren't playing well to give them a boost in confidence would be nice.
2) I really wish there were ways with upgrade your stadium and set different prices for different seats like in MLB The show 06 where I can set concessions prices, parking prices, and have to do maintenance to keep your park nice or it will effect attendance.
3) Make player development actual matter. For this one I'm taking about budget player development, I feel like it's so minuscule that you can just set it to $0 and it wont effect how a player is going to develop. If I'm spending $40m a year on player development I should be able to see massive increases in player development when everyone else in the league is only spending around $20m, at least make it a slider like how teams value players in the settings to where the amount you spend on player development can either mean everything, nothing, or somewhere in between.",1688689549,1688689549,True,17,8,0.683754861354827881,5,True,False,False

Was very lenient with this one given how much it looked like they added--but for everything they added, they broke 5 other very core parts of the game. I started a live start save from the 4th of June, 2023. I spent six days creating international leagues (to replace ALL the ones they took out as an overreaction to the NPB being ornery), got everything set up, only to look and see that the MLB rosters were COMPLETELY incorrect. Bumgarner was still on the Diamondbacks. Alek Thomas and Wander Franco didn't so much as EXIST. I am genuinely disgusted with the way Out of the Park Developments has treated its fanbase the last few months. It's beyond obvious that the player base is basically completely ignored, as core features shipped broken and have been left unfixed for months--which is astounding when you consider just how much of the game, realistically, shouldn't have even needed to be touched from 23. Focusing on visual updates like having a fake crowd to move around in the stands or showing a player's number on their jersey should not be the primary objective when the game itself is barely functional outside of it.
TL;DR: Do not fall for all the touting of ""new features,"" because those features are obscuring what the actual game is: broken and unfinished. In this state, this game is worth no more than $10. I'm beyond disappointed.",1686431360,1686431360,False,21,0,0.609474062919616699,0,True,False,False

Almost half way into the MLB season and this game still looks like a teenager in the basement took over and made things worst.

Literally no UI fixes, no patches for improvement in quality, and NOTHING short of A CASH GRAB. The Perfect Season is the only thing they're focused on.

Lousy Twitch streams with useless advice. Already changed back to OOTP23. Definitely not getting the OOTP 25. Actually, I'm done with the franchise altogether.

What OOTP is doing WRONG in 24?
- bugged UI on expansion during the season
- glitched and unfinished custom league modes
- garbage Perfect team promotions.
- lack of actually listening to the community.
- Profit before quality.
- We LOST MORE content than in OOTP 23'. Lack of sub-leagues...
- Bugged Owner goals

I seriously cannot be the only OOTP veteran that finds this game easily the WORST of the franchise. This is the Mcdonald's version of a mickey-mouse put together happy meal ever.

Those who actually played this franchise with over 3K hours in various games actually UNDERSTAND what I mean.

Absolutely pathetic.

OOTP veteran since 2009. Wow long time....

Not impressed overall. Graphically its a mess. Not an improvement. The UI finds itself with squished littering on the score board AND across various UI interfaces. Somehow siming baseball isn't fun. I keep losing. Am I bad player? No its the AI that's changed.

Plus side... If you expand to Montreal and call them the Expos the logos regnerate.

I am in two longtime Diamond Mind leagues, and both finally switched to OOTP this offseason. We were worried because Diamond Mind lagged farther and farther behind in getting out their new ""sim disks"" each season. OOTP seemed to be growing, and I really enjoy the OOTP Go! cell phone game, and have many different versions of it.

But our leagues are both struggling to adapt to the OOTP software so much, and the learning curve is so steep, that at least one of the two is in danger of closing- and that's after each GM spent $39.99 this offseason to buy the program. This is also a league that has been running since 2001, so these are dedicated guys who know their advanced fantasy baseball.

I am incredibly disappointed so far. While we may be able to salvage this and eventually become a full-time OOTP league, this is definitely buyer beware. Unless you have guys running your fantasy league who can devote hours and hours to fiddling with it- and really understand FTP settings- you're better off sticking with Diamond Mind for as long as that is a viable simulation program.

If any developers read this it really cheapens the experience when you purchase something brand new and it's riddled with clear errors that a few proofreading sessions would have eliminated. 

I just bought this and I'm having to already look past things within the first hours of playing. The tutorial of all things, the thing you can expect all new players to the series to interact with should be near perfect, and it just isn't close to that. 

I'll say that I am a massive baseball consumer, I watch a ton of MLB games, and I am super into advanced metrics and fantasy sports so this should be an easy product to hook someone like me on and they really are making it a struggle. This is my first OOTP game, and it may be everything it's said to be, but I'm left with a disappointing taste from the get go that one of the only officially licensed MLB games for the PC suffers from a clear lack of quality control. 

I'm not going to refund because I want to have fun with this game and I've checked out the Youtube of the developers and they seem to care so it just stinks.

UPDATE after 37 hours

I have been playing the OOTP franchise since it's first iteration in 1999. It was a labor of love for a solo German developer. Over the years, OOTP has evolved, sometimes making incremental improvements while making mammoth leaps in others. (Did mammoths leap? Who cares!).

Update at 47 hours:

I'm really surprised at the negative reviews. No game is perfect, but, what surprises me are the reviews talking about the game being poorly optimize. I have a two year old PC running a GTX 1660Ti and the games runs beautifully. Maybe the people talking about bad performance should update their drivers?
Without any hesitation, reservation or any ""-tion"" you care to conjure, OOTP24 is hands down THE best edition of the franchise. The graphics and animations have undergone significant improvements and they were already spectacular for a text based baseball sim. But, let's be real: a pretty face could easily hide a shallow heart. That is not the case for OOTP24. The game is ten miles wide and twenty miles deep. 

Significant work has been done on historical modes and the results should please the most discerning baseball grognard. But, if you're a casual fan, well, come on in!! There is plenty for you to enjoy even if you don't know Sherrie Magee from a glass of sherry.

You can check my lengthy review of OOTP22 for some scribbling about the plethora of play modes available. All of that applies here but ""here"" is worlds better.

What I want to address here are the rather strange statements that this is a GM only sim, or, that Perfect Team is the money grabbin' evil. I play this game as a student of baseball history - it's the only sport I love, follow, and study. I have never cracked a pack of Perfect Team cards and never will. I also have never touched financials. I don't wish to be a baseball bean-counter. Let the folks eat 56.00 ;pretzels. For me, OOTP24 is truly an almost infinite baseball sandbox. From every major league season, every minor league season, the Negro Leagues, and so much more, there are ten lifetimes of baseball and even then you'll never see it all.

The people grousing about Perfect Team are barely functional illiterates it seems. For 39.99 you get almost the entirety of professional baseball. The only thing missing is the AAGPL. (Think A League Of Their Own). Most of the other baseball sims out there require you to buy seasons. You get it all here and it kis accurate, beautiful, deep, and most importantly, FUN!!!

Come on in, the baseball is fantastic!",1679708071,1684120158,True,4,0,0.491735547780990601,0,True,False,False

I've gone through over a year with a team, and the new stuff is pretty good. It seems like the finances are fixed so the game is playable. The active trading deadline is an interesting feature which doesn't really put you in the driver seat but does give you more trades to choose from in a time trial sort of mode. The state of the international amateur signing period is acceptable given current rules and they have moved the time to the winter which allows for greater focus. 

How could it improve? I've read many of my box scores, game update emails, and even gone through the trouble of managing a game, but as of yet I have not seen anything about clocks, pitch clock or otherwise. Now, maybe this just means nothing was standardized at the time of putting out the game. But I think there were minor league box scores, and now there are major league box scores. I'm just saying that these rule changes were the big excitement coming into the season. So I would think they would be a part of the game.

To add to this frustration, the development team is laser focused on Perfect Team with constant updates and promotions. I have absolutely no interest in playing Perfect Team.  I can only assume the base price of the game is either too low or EA Sports has secretly purchased OOTP Developments.

This year's version is one of the worst versions in a while, it just seems like franchise mode has not properly gone through QA, or the devs simply decide to tinker things for the sake of tinkering. 

- The fonts are differently sized in different sections of the screen.
- Performance issues. The entire game just runs so slowly. It's frigging text-based game, it should not have performance issues on my machine with a 3090 card and 24GB of ram.
- The trade function is a mess. I can no longer choose a player on the opposite team and ask their GM what they want. I must first tell them what I must give them. 
- The ""Shop Player Around"" feature is downgraded. Why must I wait a day for the other team to decide on a package that they themselves offered in the first place? plus every time they come back and say the offer isn't good enough. 
- The trading deadline function is a buggy gimmick. there is a 4-minute timer but while the countdown is happening literally no new trades are being proposed to me, and no trades are happening anywhere else. So what's the point? I just sit here and wait for 4 minutes for what?
- Sometimes trades that I submit do not get a respond from the other side, it just disappears. 
- The budget given by the owner is comically stupid. I won 2 straight world series as the Jays, but the owner keeps slashing my budget, and then turns around and asks me to extend Vlad and Bichette, both requiring 30 million + extensions.

When I heard about the massive changes being made to the historical db, I figured it might be smart to wait till the All-Star break or later.  As usual, curiosity got the best of me and I purchased the game the day after it was released on Steam.   So glad I did.  I'm a random debut player and it might be all in my head, but I swear the talent distribution is the best it's ever been this version.   I'm usually someone that buy the new version and then starts, stops, and starts leagues over and over as I search for the right fit.    This year, I started a random debut and I'm now approaching the end of my 4th season.     I'll never be 3D guy, but the new yellow ball flight feature is pretty darn cool.

OOTP24 takes the Perfect League side of the game and somehow makes the most blatant pay-to-win game ever in  the history of pay-to-win games even more pay-to-win than before.  

On the offline side of things, all the same old problems remain with little improvements added.

Coaching ratings remain a complete joke.  On a scale of 0-200, the supposed best coaches, managers and GMs in the world rarely get ratings over 100.  In other words, 99% of them are below average!  How?  How can your entire field of coaches in the entire league be below average?

Player salaries continue to escalate out of control within a few seasons, no matter what you do.  I even tried setting inflation to -1%-0% and my salaries still quickly escalated far above what they were set to be.

Offered trades continue to be inane.  Why would I want to trade my best prospect for your 37 y/o, washed up player with 3 years left on his inflated contract?  And stop asking me every day, too.  Maybe 5% of the trades other teams offer actually make a modicum of sense.  Most just drive you crazy and waste your time.

The new graphics for base runners makes them look like they have physical disabilities and can't use their legs properly.

I could go on and on, but I think you get my perspective already.  One expects a franchise to improve its product each year.  OOTP stopped improving several years go and now they are backsliding.

After having a year off, I thought I'd jump into OOTP 24 and see if the game is any better. I've really enjoyed what I've played so far and it is still the ultimate baseball management sim and if you ask me, it is the second best sim management game on the market after Football manager. The game is incredibly in-depth and you can do pretty much anything you can imagine. Although the graphics aren't anything to shout about, you can see the minor improvements in the animations that make the action more smoother and enjoyable to watch. They have finally put the numbers on the back of the jerseys now. Which of course is such a tiny and superficial thing, but they have finally added it and it gives the animations more character if you like. 

Unfortunately I can't speak for the Perfect Team part of the game, because I focus exclusively on offline single-player and don't really have any interest in PT. I much prefer the conventional aim of building a franchise and making them competitive again and developing young talent along the way. If you are like me and are a baseball fan, I think this is a great game and an excellent year for new comers to the series.

Interesting integration of multiple modes too, and you can win without spending real life money on dlc. 

It is sometimes frustrating just like real life-- it hurts when your star player goes on the IL or you can't sign a free agent. 

My only knock is that you can't see under the hood totally to see why a result occurs (like with Strat-o-Matic card view).

Trading hard mode is unfinished and was clearly untested. You lose ""reputation"" simply for rejecting and/or ignoring the numerous trade offers you receive from AI that in general are awful. I know they say they base ratings off ZIPS projections but that doesn't really match with a lot of the ratings they give. I don't think whomever they have doing ratings puts very much effort into it. The owner goals changes are also very underwhelming. There are some goals you can swap for a different and some they won't budge on. That's it. The goals are still often nonsensical.

The biggest issues are the lack of improvement in AI causing complete immersion breaks. AI still has no idea how to put together a team, evaluate players/age/injury, put together trade offers that actually make sense for both teams. They also screwed with AI trade logic this season and AI goes absolutely nuts with trading making teams unrecognizable within 2-3 years. Absolutely awful trades that would NEVER happen in real life are commonplace. 

In my most recent save that I mostly have abandoned Andrew Vaughn was coming off a 43 HR season and was traded to the Mariners for JP Crawford who became a backup SS in Chicago. Bo Bichette was traded for a very poor return to the Mariners as well while Toronto retains 95% of the salary. Bobby Witt was traded for a 17 year old prospect who had 70 potential to Cleveland while still in Arb. All of that happened before the 2025 season started and that is just a small sample.

On their official forums a developer said that they're looking into it but aren't making changes right now. This is the first time I've ever felt disappointed in an OOTP release. As of now, it feels rushed, untested, unpolished, and mediocre.

They re-tooled the trading system and now trades are happening at an absurd rate. Like multiple trades every single day of the year until the trading deadline.

Secondly it seems they did nothing to reflect the increased spending from the new CBA. Both the Yankees and the Mets immediately go into cost cutting mode from my two playthroughs and guys like Shohei Ohtani get a 7 year 115 mil deal. Shohei could tear his UCL and still double that.

I expect the game will get updated to fix the realism but this is probably the most disappointed I have been in a 1.0 release of the game. Realism is just not there.

I would like to note the loss of international and independent leagues (except KBO) is disappointing but understandable as they were always unlicensed.

A couple cool things that I DO like: trade deadline is better than ever and is the closest to a real life system. The international amateur signing was improved and your scout can focus in on 10 players to improve their scouting accuracy and relationship, making them more likely to sign with you.

I mean, as a high school right fielder, I almost threw out two batters at first base on hard hit, one bounce, line drives to right.

The international amateur free agency being fixed is great and it's much more engaging now. Catcher rating finally seems to be a bit nerfed so that you don't absolutely need a 70+ catcher rating even if they're trash at hitting. I can't say I've found other changes impactful.

I would love to see some sort of statcast type implementation where exit velocity and launch angle are measured and actually mean something to the output. With that, being able to influence managers and coaches or at least have a better understanding of their strategies before you hire them would be good. I want to know that my coach is going to work on improving the launch angle of my players or know my player with a low BABIP is unlucky and not just bad because he has a high average exit velocity or barrel rate. I want to know before hiring a manager how they value each spot in the order. Do they value a 9 hitter to get on base for the top of the order? Do they devalue the 3 spot because of how frequently that hitter comes up with nobody on and 2 outs in the first inning? Will they utilize stoppers out of the bullpen? The sliders for coach tendencies and one word descriptions of styles don't quite cover enough.

I'm also very confused at speed ratings. Oneill Cruz and Corbin Carrol have 2 of the highest registered sprint speeds in the MLB and they were both 55 speed. Harrison Bader was 55 or so speed for years (I haven't checked this year). How hard can it be to just code sprint speeds over to a speed rating for players?

I will say I've primarily played the single player experience.  I tried perfect team mode, but its not that interesting as of yet.

I've owned several versions of OOTP.  The 3d edition is a nice addition.  Its still a little glitchy in terms of what you see vs what actually happens, but we are in the first week of release.  The problems are minor.  For example, an OF will go at lightening speed sometimes to go catch a foul ball.  Outfielders almost always pass up throwing to the cut off man when someone running home and yet other runners don't always advance.  When there is a possible double play and its close or looks close the AI won't throw to first.  I've had infielders who are positioned deep/normal depth throw home in the early innings to try to unsuccessfully throw out a runner there instead of taking easy out.  Seems to be an inordinate amount of wild pitches when playing the game even with a good catcher.  All but the last two I believe are purely visual bugs.

And lastly in challenge mode it seems if you play the game's offense is extremely reduced.  For example, I started a season as the San Diego Padres playing every single game.  Through end of July, Manny Machado and Fernando Tatis Jr were both hovering around .700 OPS.  I decided to test what happened if I simmed and they returned to the typical .900-1.000+ OPS levels.  This was pretty much across the board for all my players with the exception of Soto having a .900 OPS buoyed by very high OBP.  Its possible the issue is because I frequently used the Sim til runners in scoring position option each inning which may be the issue.  

They usually fix these issues over time.  Its still very fun and I haven't found a game for baseball lovers that goes as deep as it does while keeping it fairly easy to manage.

The game offers robust state tracking, deep scouting, team management, league customization, and so much more. 

The game definitely needs some optimization though. The game crashes often enough that I force myself to save far more often than I am used to in the series. 

New this year are some new features related to trading. Specifically a new ""trade deadline"" scenario that pops up on your final day of the deadline. To be honest, I do not see the point in this new mode. It puts you through multiple timed rounds where you negotiate with other teams and then get their response. There is not anything unique about it though. It is literally the trade block screen with a new UI. It would have been interesting if the AI was engaging you in talks, dangling some players in front of you to entice an offer or inquiring about different players on your team to try and work a trade. None of that happens though. 

Critiques aside, this is still a great overall experience for fans of management sims. For those who own OOTP 23 then you should note that this is effectively a roster update, given the poor implementation of new trade features, and so you will need to decide if paying out $40 is worth it to you. There are some QoL improvements that could help to justify it though. For everyone else, there is a lot to like here.

    [*]Has a nice, older age community on Twitch and Discord.

Negatives

[list]
    [*]As always, IMO, if you have the previous version of OOTP, it's not worth buying the next one at full price. The changes are not worth $40.00.
    [*]Perfect Team is still a money grub aimed at whoever has the most $ to spend IRL.
    [*]One of the main devs once said that there would never be rewards for people who played previous versions of Perfect Team. Obviously this was a lie as now people who own the previous versions of OOTP get free loyalty packs. This is not a good sign for the future.

tl;dr

Worth buying for Franchise Mode if you don't own OOTP 23.
Avoid Perfect Team if you you want to compete without your wallet.

If you buy the game, don't forget to join the community on Twitch.
May the scouts be with you.

Imported my v23 game the day before off-season and have moved on from there. The first thing I noticed, after the gorgeous skin, was when offering a contract extension to a player that would be arbitration eligible, that each year was labeled as either an Arb year or FA year.  Nice touch.

Names, numbers, shoes, bat color all add immersion to the 3d game. Animations for 3d games have been upgraded significantly.  Always room for improvement, but these have come a long way in a fairly short time.  The players on the field look better and move better, with player movement after plays enhancing the atmosphere.  It’s all a big step forward and being one that plays out all of my games I am loving it.  The Super Stat Replay is pretty cool for those special plays.  I'm only 5 games into spring training, can't wait to get to regular season and the ""real"" ballparks. 

The skin is crisp, clear, and easy on the eyes.  I’ve settled on the dark skin.  The classic is well done but just a bit too bright for my eyes. I have looked through most of the category choices for building views and it looks like it’s the same as v23. Not necessarily a bad thing as the list is already quite extensive, but more would be nice too.  Having said that I did find one very nice enhancement.  Traits are done as one letter abbreviations when OOTP detects the columns are going to run together.  IE Low  = L, N = Neutral etc.  So nice to be able to add all of the attributes columns for Wok Ethic, Intelligence etc. without them taking up half the screen.  Nice QOL addition.

I like the addition of trade reputation and the hard mode.  I play out all of my games so am nowhere near checking out the Trade Deadline Day, but look forward to seeing it in action.  Lot’s to like about the new version and I’m sure I’ll find a lot more as the hours pile up.  

Like any game OOTP has it’s flaws and things that didn’t get added that one hoped they would see.  No game will ever be perfect but OOTP 24 is 9/10 IMHO, and another step in the right direction.  Still the best baseball simulation on the market.

For example a 2023 HS senior that is now considered a top prospect, and maybe a 6th round pick will have their velocity from their sophomore or junior season posted on their scouting report in the game. So in the past he threw 88-90 which made him a future draft prospect, because he is young and still developing, but the game doesn't factor in his real life development where he now as a senior right before the draft, throws 93-96 in real life, which makes him an actual draft prospect. Unfortunately in this game he is still an 88-90. And that causes 3-20 rounds of the draft to be full of 88-90 velocity high school pitchers. For an example, Walker Buehler threw 84-86 as a sophomore, this game needs to figure out how to realize that's not his velocity 2 years later in the draft, OR his velocity 3 years after that when he was a 1st round pick. Very unfortunate in an otherwise incredibly complex game. I cant say ruins the game, but definitely detracts from what could be.

At the end of the day, not much can be done to improve the already real-life experience of the best GM mode in sports video games. But year after year, I remain impressed by the extent that OOTP goes to exceed my expectations. 

Pros:
- I love the new trading deadline system. The trading ""Hard Mode"" is also great for people who want more of a challenge (I'm not quite at that level yet lol)
- Adding Names/Numbers to uniforms was long overdue so I'm glad they added it this year. I do wish they would add the ability to adjust the colors on the generated numbers on custom uniforms using color codes. I will have to look into a bit more but it looks annoying as hell to do for uniforms made before OOTP 24.
- This is a bit of a stretch for a ""Pro"", but man do I love that classic theme. The wood grain is pristine. Hands down the best theme we've ever seen in OOTP. It makes a difference, trust me.
- I love this Owner Goal system. Hopefully they can make it even more like negotiating, and perhaps it can eventually end up like negotiating with free agents. One can dream I guess.

Cons:
- I will say that after another year of supposed ""huge 3D upgrades"" I really haven't noticed a difference. Sure, the animations are a little better than last year, but there are still jarring issues with the 3D play, which aren't game killers, but are still annoying to run into. For example, players just running through the outfield wall with no issue. Hopefully the 3D aspect continues to get better, but I will admit it's not great right now. 
- Relating to the above point, I feel like the player models specifically could be improved. They look like polygons. The uniform worps weird on the player model. I understand that these are not easy fixes but I will admit it's a little annoying to see a headline of ""HUGE 3D IMPROVEMENTS"" and then see what it's really like in game.

Don't get me wrong with those last two points: this year's 3D gameplay is better than last year's. But I don't think it's good enough to justify buying OOTP 24 over 23 on the visual improvements alone. I think that there's enough this year to buy OOTP 24 if you have 23. And with all of the tutorials in game, it's the perfect time to buy your first OOTP! And at the end of the day, OOTP's appeal really isn't the 3D gameplay. Not buying OOTP because of the visuals is like not getting pizza because the design on the cardboard box isn't visually appealing.

I'm someone who replays the previous season for his favorite team (NY Mets), and also, simultaneously during the year, usually replays two historical replay seasons, with actual lineups and historical trades. I constantly keep updated (through the Steam OOTP Workshop) the facegens (player computerized-faces) and uniforms...as well as all historical stadium updates (created mostly by SIlvam or Adion, the two historical stadium mod-geniuses who you can also find contributing on the OOTP Developments Forums online). 
These graphical mods/updates usually start being uploaded within a few weeks of the new OOTP release. The game does NOT come with any historical stadiums, and, although you can create your own stadium with the game's tools and tutorials (I am not that adept with modding PC games, so I don't ), the tremendous work done by modders like Silvam is so brilliant it's worth the wait for the modder(s) to upload their files to the OOTP workshop. And the mods help TREMENDOUSLY with one's historical season-replay enjoyment, IMHO. You can even set up your OWN camera angles to add onto the plethora of already-existing game-included camera angles (to view the game from many different places in the ballpark), with current OR historical ballparks.
The base game DOES come with great animated renditions of all the CURRENT MJL stadiums and facegens of all current MJL players, and over the years, especially this year, their crowd and player animations have improved greatly. There's also a text play by play that's fun, and you can choose to have game recaps created at the end of each game. Plus: instant replays available, highlights, 7th inning stretch, ballpark music and vendor/crowd sounds. It's all there.
I don't ""get into"" the deep management tasks of playing GM, but that is where this game shines, so I've heard and read. You can GM historic teams or franchises over a number of YEARS, if that's your thing, and play games in the background to see things develop over time. 
Personally, I prefer playing GM / MANAGER of the teams I replay (last year's or my historical replays), select historical trades and historical lineups when available (all easily available, within the game itself). And then watching each game play out in front of me, either pitch by pitch or batter by batter. You can also skip innings when simming a game. Change lineups, make subs as you wish. Or let the computer sim the game for you. 
There is a WIDE and almost endless array of details to choose from when setting up a season replay. I really can't list or hint at them. It's worth it for the first-time OOTP player to dive into all the game has to offer. Certainly read their massive tutorial (available with the game or online). It took me most of one season to get used to the interface and all the choices in its entirety. 
But OOTP it IS simplistic enough at its core to be user-friendly within a short while. OR: it can be very beautifully complicated if you WANT it to be, and want to see EVERYTHING the management side of the game has to offer.
--I was used to, and a huge fan of, APBA baseball-simming, cards and dice from the early 1970s until the late 90s, when I switched to APBA for Windows (BBW). I still love that game for simming. But there are no grfx to speak of with that pure simmer other than static stadium pictures, and one has to pay for each separate season.
But with Out of the Park? Each and every baseball season throughout organized baseball history....ALL OF THEM!!!!...are included with the game. Can you BEAT that? With real players and real stats, just waiting for you to manage them. You can even play the current season, with up-to-date daily ""Live Starts"" if you wish, where, for instance, if you want to begin your current 2023 season one week after it's already begun, you can set up a Live Start and your 2023 season will begin that current day, with all previous games results as they happened. Rosters intact and realistic.
In summary: naturally, the graphics in the game are NOT on par with MLB:The Show. Of COURSE not. They're not even as good as MVP 2005. But considering where they were just a few seasons ago (sprites!), it looks pretty good. It's fun to watch as you play out a game; it really is. Realistically, the graphics are damn fine 3D grfx for a sim game. And you get realistic results, which you don't get in the eye-candy kiddie-console sports games. It's a breathtakingly realistic sim game, with pretty good grfx and ballpark sounds.
For what OOTP includes, it's a VERY fair price. EVERY season in baseball history available, plus a historic almanac? All current MLB stadiums available? Easily-downloaded historical stadium and player-face mods (even real player photos, if that's your thing) once the modders ""do their thing""? The ability to deep dive into an owner or GM's role, or simply to replay games, historical teams, or seasons, to your heart's content? Add to that: constant feedback and answers to questions from the OOTP devs and hundreds or thousands of players on the OOTP development forums, and timely bug fixes and game-improvements? Constantly updated rosters as the current season ensues. Improved grfx. Etc etc.
It's a GREAT deal. And the game runs very well; no optimization problems when playing individual games visually. OK, once in a while a random CTD (what game DOESN'T have that?). 
Full disclosure: I don't take advantage of the game's separate ""Perfect Team"", so I can't offer opinions on it, or what it's for or how it's advantageous to enjoying the game more, but apparently a lot of people are buying into it (while some have issues with it). I can't offer an opinion, but plenty of people do. I can say that I have GREAT fun playing OOTP, including this current OOTP 24 release, WITHOUT making use of Perfect Team. But others swear by it, and some are against it. Not my thing.
I think after reading through my word salad-review you've got a good idea of the game itself and how much a simming fan like me, going on 50+ years of simming tabletop and PC baseball games, feels about it.
I buy it EVERY year it comes out (or have for the past 6 or 7 years), and I never regretted doing so. Fanboy here.
If you love simming, like simming, or were thinking of getting into simming baseball, current season or historical replays, get this game. There is NO OTHER game out there that serves so many simming purposes so very well.",1679956204,1679956768,True,6,0,0.573678195476531982,0,True,False,False

The following leagues are available in this version: Major League Baseball (MLB, USA); Korean Baseball Organization (KBO,  ROK); MLB Partner Leagues (USA); World Cup of Baseball (16 teams). This is down from (OOTP 23) MLB, Partner Leagues, KBO, World Cup of Baseball, AND leagues for Mexico, Cuba, Italy, France, the Netherlands, Spain, China, Australia, Germany, the Czech Republic, Austria, and Belgium. That's a huge stripping down of teams. [/list][list] - the default font is uglier for no good reason, in my opinion.

My issue is, that on 2 different PCs, the game goes to a black screen mid-game (often) forcing me to go to my task manager and shut down the game. You lose the game you were playing and anything since your last save. It really makes the game unplayable at this time. OOTP 23 or 21 for me this season unless they fix this issue.4",1679738974,1679738974,False,18,2,0.658038496971130371,0,True,False,False

My ultra-wide monitor makes the game look very blurry, I haven't had this issue with any other OOTP game, I have yet to find settings that look somewhat decent.  I also really can't believe how they took away almost all of the leagues you could have in your save. Really only Mlb, The minor league, KBO, and World Cup of Baseball? I hate to say it but to me this just makes the game no worth it to me, I will be returning to 23 as I quite enjoy it, hopefully they can fix it over the year and I'll pick it up on sale.
