Assassin's Creed Syndicate is the ninth major installment in the Assassin's Creed franchise.
Set in Victorian London during the Industrial Revolution, you play as twins Jacob and Evie Frye as they attempt to regain control of the city from Templar Grand Master Crawford Starrick.

[h1]Pros[/h1]
[list]
[*]Beautiful graphics.
[*]London looks great.
[*]Combat is pretty good and more fast-paced than Unity.
[*]Stealth is pretty good and more polished than Unity.
[*]Good mission design.
[*]Optional objectives are actually fun this time even if some are annoying.
[*]Fun side activities, although they get old after the third or fourth time.
[*]Decent soundtrack.
[/list]

[h1]Cons[/h1]
[list]
[*]Microtransactions, because f*ck you, we want your money!
[*]Frequent crashes. I stopped counting after the tenth time.
[*]Dreadful Crimes DLC is not included with the Season Pass or Gold Edition.
[*]Cloth physics are locked to 30 fps. Can be fixed in the .ini file.
[*]Depth of field can't be turned off in-game. Can be fixed in the .ini file.
[*]Mediocre story with a generic Assassin vs. Templar plot.
[*]There aren't many missions where you play with both characters. There are only two, and one of them is the last mission.
[*]Uninteresting modern-day story.
[*]Parkour is too restrictive. Can't do unsafe jumps.
[*]Rope launcher makes parkour completely useless. Would've been better if it only worked horizontally so it wouldn't be too op.
[*]Yet again, there are more f*cking collectibles.
[*]Most DLCs are filled with bugs. Jack the Ripper was the worst as it reset 2 hours of progress after fast traveling.
[*]AI rubberbands like crazy during races. It will even teleport if you get too far away from it.
[*]Teleporting disables waypoints.
[/list]

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
While I think Assassin's Creed Syndicate is a better game than Unity, it's still a generic Ubisoft title. Its story is shallow, its villains are generic, and its DLCs make Unity look like a polished game.
There are also microtransactions for some stupid reason. Don't waste your money on that garbage, they give you nothing of value.",1709047353,1709047353,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Not having to worry about launcher issues, I loaded up the game and played it, and I had a damn good time. Truly, if this game actually runs, it's visually beautiful, it's probably one of the best AC games mechanically speaking, and the writing is pretty good. 

Of course, all that being said, you may have noticed that this is a negative review. That's because during sequence 7, FIFTEEN FUCKING HOURS INTO THE GAME, there exists a bug in the mission, ""Playing Politics"", in which Jacob Frye must tackle a spy and press him for information about the attempt on the prime minister's life or something. The thing is, when you tackle the spy, NOTHING HAPPENS. He just gets up and stands there, and you cannot progress further in the mission. Apparently there's a solution where you open task manager during the mission and mess around with your CPU, and then the mission works as intended, but as I said before, I was streaming the game on Geforce NOW, meaning it wasn't running on my PC, meaning I can't fix it in task manager. The only other option would be to run the game natively on my PC, which, aside from just not running as well, means I would have to deal with the Uplay launcher, which I have made no progress with.

I normally don't like to fault games for bugs. Every game of this size is gonna have bugs. Hell, AC Unity was filled to the brim with glitches. The difference is that those were at least mostly visual bugs, and the game could still be played to completion. So either Ubisoft fixes the glitch, or I get the Uplay launcher working, neither of which will likely ever happen.

This is all so sad because the game is probably the best (traditional) AC game up until that point where it doesn't work. I would recommend it if not for the launcher and that one bug. If you want to play an Assassin's Creed game, get Unity.

First off, diving into Victorian London was like stepping into a time machine. The attention to detail in the city blew me away. From the crowded streets to the grand landmarks, they really nailed the vibe of the era.

Combat in Syndicate felt smoother than ever. The rope launcher was a game-changer, letting me zip around buildings like a Victorian Batman. Taking down enemies felt satisfying, especially when I got creative with the environment.But it wasn't all perfect. Some missions started feeling a bit repetitive after a while. Sneak in, assassinate the target, get out. Rinse and repeat. It would've been nice to see more variety in the objectives to keep things fresh.Lastly, the bad guys could've used a bit more oomph. They felt kinda one-dimensional compared to the rich world around them. A bit more depth to the villains would've made the story feel more gripping.

Overall, though, Assassin's Creed Syndicate is a blast. Exploring Victorian London as a badass assassin is an experience I won't forget anytime soon. If you're into historical settings and sneaky, stabby gameplay, give it a shot. It's not perfect, but it's definitely worth the ride.",1708384702,1708384702,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

At least on max settings, though it's also surprisingly demanding for a 9-year-old game (5800x3d, 6950xt, 1440p, ~100fps). The story is fine, nothing special. Gameplay is really interesting with the 2 siblings, cause you can feel a difference in the movement and combat. Also, the grappling hook is really cool. I also think it's good that it's not a game like Valhalla, where you need to sacrifice your whole life to finish it. Just a nice ""classic"" AC game with a few new ideas compared to the old old AC games. Definitely worth a try. For me, top 3 in the franchise.

After playing it I really don't understand why? Apart from the Ezio saga (AC 2, Brotherhood and Revelations) I think this might be my favourite Assassin's Creed game.

The setting is in London, which is a city I'm quite familiar with and I just enjoyed looking at the monuments, the streets and the overall atmosphere of 19th century England. There's plenty of historical throwbacks to popular people of the era and the story (whilst not unique in any way) was interesting.
Ubisoft have done well to refresh the formula a little bit compared to the older games, but still stayed faithful to the franchise as a whole.

Overall, if you like Assassin's Creed games, this one will definitely not disappoint!

Well, it turns out that i played past 13 hours pretty much in a go !

It seemed top tier at first but it all came crashing down... and fast !

I have not finished the game yet but here's what I can say :

The tone of the game is a huge disservice given the time period. It was a grim period with a lot of pollution, child labor, poverty and so on but this game feels sunshine and rainbows, constant banter between characters (while enjoyable) ruin the setting, days last ages while night is just a few minutes (if you fast travel at the beginning of night it'll likely be day again)... The lack of consequence for pretty much anything is another bad element of the story's delivery. The ending is not satisfactory either.

Collectibles are a chore : You can buy maps to reveal them. However, said maps won't show them (animus fragments now called animus glitch).
Map markers are broken.
Fast traveling breaks markers.
Replaying missions can put you in an animus loading loop until you give up and Alt+F4...

Controls are unresponsive, the grappling hook should be awesome but it's far from it :
Do you remember when back then instead of climbing up you would sometimes jump to your death ?
It's more annoying even though you don't die EVERY SINGLE F*CKING TIME !
AI can and will shoot you across buildings 100m over if not far more.
Some perks straight up don't work.

Also another thing that by itself would flip from 10/10 to begative is that it is an inferior port and is not feature complete (lacks badges/cards and achievements).

There's also uplay which straight up doesn't work and an in-game store which i couldn't explore.
Even then, I can deduct that part of the idea was shoving way too many collectables and grind in order to make the game next to impossible to enjoy :
like a f2p except a total price of at best 70 bucks or maybe 112 which I can't verify through the steam page AND there's microtransactions adding to that !
The whole experience is made miserable to push the purchase of microtransactions (that can't be purchased anymore). This is beyond pathetic !

When it comes to performance, the game tends to crash a lot, there are a lot of visual glitches (texture, npcs, clipping...), some missions are bugged and in case i didn't mention it yet some collectibles are glitched too, add to that more glitches the higher the framerate, framerate settings in the game not working, capping framerate manually causes minor performance issues (sub 60fps while over 90fps uncapped) !
Some textures are really bad (for instance, hair was significantly better in Assassin's creed 2). How did they f*ck that up ? Overall, textures are far worse than Unity and more glitchy than most other games in the series.

First of all, I love the setting. Victorian London has always intrigued me, and I enjoyed how AC: Syndicate handled it.

Secondly, the characters were also a big part of my enjoyment of this experience.
Evie is my favourite by a long shot, but Jacob grew on me throughout the story. Their dynamic as siblings is entertaining, and I love their banter. The side characters like Abberline and Henry Green were pretty cool too, and I liked their interactions with the Frye twins.

The combat was nothing too special, but it was easy enough without being boring, so I can't really complain. The stealth was fun, however the melee fighting was a bit lackluster for me.

I nearly got 100% completion, but because of some optional objectives in the quests that I didn't complete I ended up with 98%. I did get all the collectables around the map. For someone like me who loves exploration, it's nice to just put on a podcast and get all the chests and helix glitches.

Unlike the others in the AC series, where the main story missions are clear and easy to tell apart from the ""unnecessary"" or ""optional"" side missions, AC:S missions don't seem to lead you anywhere.  You get to Sequence 4 where Jacob and Evie have their differences.  But then there's no path to follow after that.

There's a bunch of missions all over the map, none of which seem to be associated with the main story.  You can roam the map for hours on end, switching between to two protagonists, and still not figure out what to do next.  I've completed every mission on the map with every ""Associate"" that you need to gain loyalty with, but I'm still in Sequence 4.

Also, I have yet to see the present day characters ""pull you back"" from your time travels to talk to you about how you're doing either, as is the case with the other AC games.

Most of the Associate missions are severely buggy.  You can do exactly what the mission tells you to do, including the usual tasks that give you extra credit.  But 90% of the time, you won't get credit for one thing or another even if you accomplished every task with incredible ease.

There an Assassination Target map in your hideout train, but it serves no purpose other than to tell you what Sequence you're in.

I've given up on trying to figure it out, and went on to collect all the collectables on the map.  But now that's even finished, and nothing left to do on the map, and STILL in sequence 4.

I was really hoping for this one to be a winner, mostly because of my British heritage and my fascination with the 19th century Industrial Revolution era (where the concept of Steampunk came from).  But it's time to move on.

Oh and BTW, I did all of the things I've listed in only 32 hrs gameplay in about a week's time.  Unlike AC Unity, Rogue, Black Flag, etc. that took about a month or more (each) to accomplish the same amount of tasks.

 - The grappling hook does kill a bit of the Assassin's Creed DNA in my opinion as you now can scale tall church towers in few seconds; yes it makes it much easier and makes our heroes less prone to suddenly decide to commit suicide because they choose to jump away from the wall although you are pretty sure that was not what you commanded them to do, and it also makes it easier to get some of the collectables. However it makes it feel a bit tame. It is 1860's so perhaps some good. old development is just what was needed...?

Now for the major issues: Stuttering (especially when driving), freezing up - which gives some scares as it some times may end up in the third issue: game crash - thank you for closing down my game after I spent a long time sneaky-peaky killing enemies before moving in on the boss...

My computer aren't the newest, but it is well beyond the specfications, but I still experience these issues.

The other characters were also interesting, despite not getting much screen time, so to speak, to interact with them.
The grappling hook was a lot of fun to play around with, and makes traversing London far easier than it would've been otherwise.
For Templar hunts, the varied methods to approach and assassinate a target were extremely interesting and were a breath of fresh air for me after previous AC games (I believe this is also a mechanic in Unity, but I haven't played it yet). Each hunt was different, something that I felt other games somewhat failed at, and I'll definitely be going back to replay them and see what other routes there were to take.

Now, a couple complaints that didn't ruin the experience for me, but were a little annoying: The buildings are quite uneven and can make movement a little tricky at times, especially on tailing missions, but luckily these are few and far between. The multi-kill mechanic is a little inconsistent, but people still die so not too much of a problem overall. Using carriages can be equally fussy since your lowest speed is still faster than all the NPCs', but you can get around this alright by weaving through traffic.
A common thing I hear about this game is that the story is weak compared to the other games, but I honestly can't say I minded very much. I prefer good characters to a strong, perfect narrative, so I had a fun time overall regardless.",1704782203,1704782203,True,4,0,0.577672779560089111,0,True,False,False

II played, 50 hours, half the game doing more or less everything.
Don't look at Metacritic: 74? This? Throught 90 and 95 in my opinion.
I will write more in future; but it's a masterpiece.
The graphics, maxed out, are very heavy, and an water cooled 6800xt handle it from 80 to 90 times a second on a 3440x1440 monitor, this also is an Nvidia optimized game; however it is fantastic. 
Maybe one or two videogames can compete: RDR2 is one of those... I am thinking to the second!
Great.

At 80 hours I've finished the main plot and almost everything that revolves around it: I'm looking for the last collectibles. However, there is still a lot to do, always in the same saved game, due to a gameplay that is not to anticipate.

The video game lasts a very long time e it's always fun to go play: it's a video game I feel nostalgic for.
I think Assassin's Creed Syndacate is a really refined and very beautiful title.
I confirm my opinion also in numerical terms: I would say between 9 and 9.5 points out of 10.
Unfortunately it doesn't seem possible to have multiple saved games (maybe I'm wrong, I'll search the internet for more information and correct these words accordingly): these are things that annoy me quite a bit; who knows if it might be possible to do something from the file system.
Nonetheless, Assassin's Creed Syndacate is certainly a very notable result of videogaming in our era: an old-school structure in its pure state, identical to what a San Andreas could be, that meets extremely refined graphics, an aesthetic taste which combines moving panoramas with musics but free from any languid sentimentalism, and two different but complementary and pleasant protagonists, with their own strong personalities, their irreducible individuality, and that profound fraternal bond that keeps them in balance, even intimately, spiritually, morally, over the difficult thread of the events they must run.
A hymn to freedom, the freedom of all, including that of children, with a simple but severe and undaunted criticism of child exploitation, here joins the usual journey between fiction and reality that has always characterized the Assassin' Creed Saga.",1694760715,1704754621,True,3,0,0.551620185375213623,0,True,False,False

It is an improvement over Unity in certain aspects, The parkour controls feel much better. Stealth crouch & corner cover are way better. However You never really need to use parkour as the world is not designed for it & it's easier to go in guns blazing than relying on stealth, unless the mission requires it for synchronization.

Unity was better in terms of stealth & the world was much better designed for parkour, unfortunately the game was broken. Syndicate is really beautiful, face animations look better than any other Assassin's Creed game, old and new in my opinion, it has all the improvements the previous game required, just the wrong setting.

With the addition of a grappling hook, you can Spiderman your way around the city with ease and escape just about any sticky situation in seconds. While fun, the grappling hook does nearly eliminate the challenge and perception needed to parkour effectively around the game's city. That daunting viewpoint all the way at the tippy top of a massive structure that will challenge your vertigo?  No sweat with the hook.

In terms of gameplay, hands down my least favorite aspect of the game were the carriage races. I felt the rage monster from decades long past bubbling up inside of me watching opponents suddenly have bursts of speed to win a race in the final seconds.

Some quick comments and observations:
[list]
    [*]After a lot of RDR2, the carriage driving was quite comical in comparison. I know this isn't fair criticism, but I was chuckling as I flew around corners wreaking havoc on anything unfortunate enough to be in my way.
    [*]The story was decent, though predictable. 
    [*]The typical AC gameplay loop is there complete with plenty of climbing (grappling), jumping, diving, running, stealthing, and murdering (quite a lot of that). Collectibles? of course. Not as many as some past games, but still plenty if you're vibing. 
    [*]The WW1 DLC wasn't bad, though like the main story, just a little bland. An intriguing setting, but maybe a little empty.
    [*]The game crashed or bugged out at least a dozen times throughout my playthrough. Not an unplayable amount, but the last few AC games seem to be a little janky like that. 
[/list]

Despite its flaws, Syndicate was definitely one of my favorite AC games so far. Other than what was already mentioned, no notable changes to the game experience when compared to other titles. You had 2 protagonists for the first time however and I can't decide if I liked playing as Jacob or Evie more. I tend to favor a stealthy approach so I was on Evie a lot once I had all of her skills trained up, but I certainly didn't mind having Jacob's additional combat abilities to mow down enemies.

The story was...fine. Forgettable, moustache twirling villain, uninteresting plot with one of the protagonists just derailing the main story for most of the first act because he wanted to start a gang or something instead of like, doing his job. 

The combat was...fine. Enemy design didn't really improve or worsen compared to any of the other older titles. Both protagonists have different weapons with decent combat animations but the RPG elements both hinder and help the combat.

The aforementioned leveling and RPG system exists and it's...fine. Both characters have their own skill trees and specialise in different things. Jacob can smacks and shoot, Evie can sneak and stab. They both feel distinct but character-locked missions made this effect grating, getting locked into playing Jacob in a stealth mission or low-level Evie getting completely bodied in a combat-heavy mission. You will sometimes get rolled by an enemy simply because the number above his head is higher than yours and that's dumb. Also you outscale most of your weapons faster than you can upgrade them. 

The character writing was actually pretty decent most of the time but your mileage absolutely depends on how much you like the dumbass vs straight-man trope.

The city was...weirdly forgettable considering it's industrial era England. None of the burrows felt distinct other than arbitrary difficulty levels and you're basically locked inside just regular old timey England. Not the usual sprawling landscapes previous titles offered while also not having any of the content density (or quality) a smaller scale usually brings. 

The parkour was fun. You get a grappling hook and can zip around like old timey Batman.

The stealth was better than Unity.

The side content was boring.

The level design could be interesting sometimes but for others you could just sort of walk in, smoke bomb, kill your target then leave in under 30 seconds. This was possible for multiple main missions.",1702832356,1702832356,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

When released, it also flew under the radar after the messy launch of the previous title, Unity. People got burned and lost faith in the series after that, and Ubisoft had to take a break before the shift, so Syndicate is in a weird spot.
With all that aside, I found this game to be disappointingly average. I don’t know exactly what it is, but it’s simply not very interesting. The setting is nice, taking place in Victorian London. It has a steampunk vibe to it, taking place after the first industrial revolution. Some may not like that, but at least it’s something the series hasn't seen before.
You play as twins Jacob and Evie Frye, and outside the story, you can freely swap between them. Jacob is supposed to be a better brawler, and Evie better in stealth, but in practice, they play almost the same. The story is generic, mostly finding and executing the various Templar members in London until you eventually confront the leader.
They are disappointing, especially the leader since you have no connection with him, and he only appears in some cutscenes until the end. In most AC games, you have a more personal reason to deal with them, but this time it’s just a bad guy must die.
Gameplay is also average. Combat lacks the multi-kill sequences, and the cool kill animations are locked until enemies are put into a near-death state, which makes them much harder to trigger. You could argue that means combat is harder, but it’s just attack, counter, and break defense until you win. Enemies lack variety as well.
Parkouring feels a bit off. The first thing I noticed is that you have fewer opportunities for seamless parkour on rooftops because the streets are so wide compared to past games. The game gives you a grappling hook, which feels good to use, but at the same time feels like a band-aid to cover the mediocre parkouring.
Besides the story, you have the usual collectible hunting and side missions, which aren’t so bad. Historical figures are present as usual, this time featuring the likes of Charles Dickens, Charles Darwin, and Karl Marx.
However, collectibles have a HUGE catch. You can buy maps for most of them; however, two of them aren’t available in-game. Instead, they’re only available in the microtransactions store, with real money. A scummy tactic, since without those maps, you’ll need an external resource to find everything.
Stupid microtransactions, but at least besides these maps, there isn’t anything useful to buy. I bought the Gold Edition with the Season Pass, so I started with enough currency to buy one map, but I couldn’t naturally get enough to buy the other one. You can get more premium currency in-game, but it wasn’t enough for me to buy the other map. There is a way to farm slowly with temporary collectibles, but of course, most of the time, they are bugged and won’t count…
Speaking of the Season Pass, it doesn’t even give you all the content. Ten detective missions are available to buy, but it’s not included. They aren’t special but offer a different gameplay style you won’t find in the base game.
The main DLC content is the Jack the Ripper storyline, but it’s also disappointing. Very early on, you’re spoiled about its identity, and there’s only one new mechanic where you can fear your enemies. At least that feels satisfying to pull off.
The game also has a lot of small bugs, but nothing game-breaking I could find. The DLC, however, had one game-breaking bug that made me replay a side mission multiple times because a carriage would fly out of nowhere at the very end, killing an NPC and resulting in a fail. That was incredibly frustrating until after a few tries it worked fine.
The Ubisoft Connect also has its problems, mainly the lack of achievements and statistics in the in-game overlay. You can check the achievements in the desktop app, but the stats are only available on the web app. They at least work correctly, but having to check them in specific places is ridiculous, at the time of writing this review.
It looks like I’m being too harsh on the game, but it’s not bad, just average. I’ve had fun with other Ubisoft titles, including other AC games, but playing this one simply felt like a chore most of the time.
I can recommend it on sale but only after you’ve played some of the other, better AC titles. It’s not a good introduction to the series, and it was a disappointing title to me. I would give this an average rating if I could.",1701954871,1701954871,True,16,1,0.708361685276031494,0,True,False,False

At times, it was more like playing an Arkham game than an AC game. The organized-crime element of the game reminded me of Mafia or The Godfather games. This is the most modern setting of the AC games, and there is some initial awkwardness with the juxtaposition of an ancient order of assassins doing their business in 1868 London. In my opinion, this installment of the AC franchise does very little, if anything, to advance the overall plot and narrative of the Assassins vs. Templars.

Apart from free running, using tools, stealth, combat being similar. The concept is overshadowed by sheer repetitiveness, Lack of interest towards the narrative, Poorly written characters, poorly designed missions, poorly game design with the stealth mechanic as a whole, overly comedic tone, weird goofy animations, and lastly boredom. To keep this short, the game doesn't do much to compliment the setting other than the classic steampunk, carriage riding, gun slinging vibe. even if this wasnt an assassins creed title i still will say this game is pretty much stale and limited to the lack of creativity the dev used to have. the only good thing about the game is not the base game but the WWI bit and the Jack the ripper DLC. honestly if the game had more of the WWI portion or was set in that setting i would probably enjoy the game much more.

The damages of a full train with wagons and the damage to the bridge would be in the millions. I also seriously doubt that the english railroad ever had live train traffic on tracks with one active switch leading into a ravine dead drop. That kind of wily coyote stuff is just stupid.

The actual game however was kind of good. I was surprised but the game actually works quite well. The missions are fun and the grappling hook makes traversing the city a joy. 

There are some stupid stuff that's very annoying though. The horse carts are too fast, if someone escapes with them you can't really catch up easily. And you can't aim your gun while ""driving"" for some reason. Only quickshot seems to work while driving a carriage but it's so bad.
The last mission in a area where you fight to the death with a miniboss is kind of retarded. You often meet the miniboss earlier during some kind of event but at that point they always seem to run away. The miniboss is scared out of his mind and runs away from you only to agree to fight to the death 5 minutes later on a one on one? Is this a joke?

At one point in the story you work tirelessly to find a secret key, you solve some ancient riddle high up on a building and the final secret hiding place is located even higher. After some time freeclimbing the building you finally enter the inaccessible located entrance to the secret room you just opened... And at that point the villian suddenly appears behind you. Is this some kind of joke? How re*arded would you have to be to even consider this kind of stupid sh*t? 

Some of the run and tackle missions are stupid to the point of insulting the player. The game says that you need to catch a enemy but at the same time the whole event is scripted making the enemy run faster always getting away until a certain point. It's painfully obvious when this happens since they suddenly run extra fast and it's just so stupid since it's obvious you are 
not supposed to be able to catch them dispite being told to do that.

Can't say I enjoyed the henry and evie bits, henry looks like he's 40-50 years old while evie looks like a young teenager. The thing felt so strange and not giving the player any sort of control or interactivity at all just felt stupid. The whole thing just happened without much backstory and since you control both siblings the whole thing felt very weird and forced.

Duleep Singh DLC missions are can be encountered and played through before he is introduced into the story. That is no problem, the problem is that Ubisoft hasn't patched or made any checks for this so if you encounter him after playing his DLC he will still act like it's the first time you meet. A showcase of Ubisofts disregard and sloppy practice of story elements of assassins creed.

Despite all that it's still a decent game and one of the better assassins creed i've tried. 
It just strikes me how simple and crude the stories are from assassins creed despite being such a long series of AAA games. Compared to other big name games they are so unrefined and bland.

The side missions are as compelling as the main story, providing a glimpse into the lives of Londoners during that era. The game also does an excellent job of integrating historical figures into the narrative, adding an extra layer of authenticity.

In conclusion, Assassin’s Creed Syndicate is an exhilarating experience that blends history and fiction seamlessly. It’s a must-play for any fan of the series or anyone looking for a deep, engaging gaming experience.",1698346894,1698346894,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It's not my favorite Assassin's Creed by any means, but it's still a great game. I enjoyed it, and, you know, the fifth time I played it wasn't any different. What I really appreciate is the more modern and fast-paced gameplay. The city is huge and meticulously detailed, with lots of tall buildings that are wonderfully designed.

However, the story isn't particularly strong; it feels recycled from older games, and the characters only seem to have one personality each. The villains are forgettable, but the one character that stands out in this game is Evie Frye. She really gives off those old Ezio and Altair vibes.

All in all, it's a very good game, especially with the best DLC in all the Assassin's Creed games. Seriously, this DLC is so good; I highly recommend playing it. The DLC is S Tier, for real.

For me, Assassin's Creed Syndicate is a dream fulfilled, allowing us to step into the shoes of the intelligent Evie Frye, a refreshing and formidable female lead in the Assassin's Creed universe, and her charismatic sibling, Jacob Frye, who happens to be the funniest assassin ever. This adventure unfolds amidst the historically rich tapestry of 19th-century London - a city I've always yearned to explore.

Playing through the narrative, I found myself deeply invested in the Frye siblings' journey, their struggles, and their aspirations. Evie's dedication to preserving the Assassin's Creed with precision and intellect beautifully contrasts with Jacob's more impulsive and flamboyant approach. The world is meticulously designed, with landmarks like Big Ben and the River Thames brought to life with astounding accuracy. The downloadable content enhanced the gameplay experience by providing additional storylines and challenges, allowing me to extend my adventure in this fascinating world.

Let me guide you through each DLC in case you're still deciding on buying any:

[b] Jack the Ripper DLC: [/b]
A Must-Buy. This one is a true game-changer. It's like stepping into a whole new thrilling world within the familiar one. The atmosphere is dark, evil, and intense, immersing you in an adrenaline rush and stress that is surprisingly incredible.

[b] The Last Maharaja DLC: [/b]
There's a mission with drunk Jacob. Need I say more?

[b] The Dreadful Crimes DLC: [/b]
A fantastic brain teaser. The mysteries are tough in a good way, keeping you engaged and making you think hard to solve them. If you love challenges, this one's for you! It also prepares you well for some of Jack the Ripper's gameplay, so I'd recommend playing it first.

[b] Is the Season Pass Worth Buying? [/b]
It can be quite helpful especially when you're just stepping into the game, offering a lot of weapons, cool suits, double XP for faster development, and a few unique missions. Definitely a great addition to own if you're a fan. I got mine after finishing the main story and didn't regret it for a second. I simply liked the feeling of owning everything. Note that the Dreadful Crimes DLC isn't included in the Season Pass.

Assassin's Creed Syndicate became more than a game for me; it transformed into a treasured realm where history meets fantasy, where Evie and Jacob Frye's journey became my own, and where the allure of Victorian London never fades. I wholeheartedly recommend taking a look for yourself if you haven't already.

One of the standout features of Syndicate is the introduction of two main characters: the Frye brothers, Evie and Jacob. The freedom to switch between them during roaming, except for most story missions, is a brilliant idea. Evie, the more serious and focused sibling, feels like the perfect assassin, while Jacob, with his not-so-serious personality, takes some time to get used to, but he grows on you. I must admit that Evie is my favorite of the two, and her presence was a breath of fresh air after the last two main protagonists in the series.

The story is captivating and set in a unique period, the industrial revolution. The English atmosphere and the dark side of the era, including child labor, adds depth to the narrative. London is beautifully designed, with grand buildings waiting to be scaled. The grappling hook, a new addition, fits seamlessly with the vast cityscape. Although it makes combat and escape a bit too easy, I found it to be a perfect fit for this setting.

However, parkour in Syndicate feels somewhat scripted and restricted compared to the previous titles, taking away some of the freedom we once had. This may not be a major issue for me, but I understand it can be a significant concern for others. On the animation front, Syndicate outshines its predecessors, offering more realistic movements.

Yet, there are some elements that stray from the traditional Assassin's Creed style. The GTA-like aspects, such as stealing carriages from random people on the street, don't feel quite right for the franchise. Additionally, the focus on gangs, while fun gameplay-wise, might not align perfectly with the essence of being an assassin.

Nonetheless, the stealth and assassination mechanics are outstanding, surpassing even Unity's excellence. The combat has also undergone significant changes, making it feel fresh and enjoyable. While this combat style may not be suitable for a medieval AC game, it fits perfectly in the Syndicate setting.

Regarding the present time story, while better than Unity and Rogue, it doesn't match the depth of previous entries. The shrinking importance of the present-day gameplay and story across the series is disheartening for those of us who loved that aspect of the games.

For achievement hunters: they are not implemented on Steam, but on Ubisoft Connect. It's frustrating to work towards unlocking all 56 achievements, only to have no way for others to witness your accomplishments. Ubisoft Connect is currently the only place where you alone can view your achievements. Where only you can see them, having no way to share your progress with others. I am planning to complete this game in the near future. I will then come back with an edit.

To sum up, Assassin's Creed: Syndicate is a standout title in the series, offering a fresh perspective with two compelling main characters and an intriguing story set in the industrial revolution. The gameplay is fantastic, with excellent stealth, assassination, and combat mechanics. However, some elements may feel out of place for the franchise. Despite these minor setbacks, Syndicate remains a must-play for Assassin's Creed enthusiasts, delivering an entertaining and immersive experience in Victorian London.

Victorian London is absolutely beautiful to explore. It Runs SUPERB on curren-gen PCs (only need 1 small fix for the cloth physics) 

Story is pretty decent fun side/missions. Story is alright; Evie and Jacob are not the best but the diff personalities make the game abit fun, not to forget the rope launcher makes you feel like batman in london! 

There is MORE CONTENT AFTER SEQUENCE 8! so DONT QUIT RIGHT AFTER! 

Dislikes about this game: The crafting system brought RPG like element in a game with linear story doesnt sound good, abit of grind at start but once you learn the flow its fun.

Parkour MORE watered down with new combat which is just ""OK"" not superior as older AC games.

I'd recommend it on the sale  price for a GOOD 30-35hrs of SP game, I enjoyed it.

Environment is great: full of crime, sadness, industrial London. NPCs living their best lives, and the variety of their actions is truly fascinating. Hats off. The new mechanics of traveling through the city, the original assassin's base, are also pretty great. The chemistry between the two playable characters (twins) feels natural.

There are also cons. The acquisition of territory (different districts have about 6-8 quests with different goals, all to defeat the gang named Blighters) becomes repetitive after a few times, and it feels like chores. There are also a lot of collectibles that don't make much sense.

Considering all the cool stuff Ubisoft did, as mentioned above, there is a huge trade-off with the story. And the final boss, which is stupid. The final mission is nice, but the boss fight could be replaced with a cutscene, and I feel offended by this. The objectives of story-driven side quests, except for Detective DLC, are poorly written. I can't relate to the story, I don't find it interesting. I liked the story in AC: Unity, the character development and his chemistry and conflict with his girlfriend, but I don't see any progression in Syndicate's story. It just isn't there, but it could be, considering that there are a few good chapters that I really enjoyed.

Anyway, if you are a fan of the AC franchise and don't expect much of an interesting storyline, I would recommend this game. The world and gameplay are astonishing and worth playing.",1696000253,1696000270,True,0,0,0.480769246816635132,0,True,False,False

Movement, especially stealth, is polished so having missed inputs are rare, and actively encouraged, which will become less and less the case in later iterations. Story wise very fun and engaging; Syndicate does a good job showing what it means to be an Assassin fighting for the little guy, while also showing the consequences for using such methodology with too little care.

Unfortunately, the story is kind of bland and not as memorable as previous AC titles. The main villain, Starrick, is so forgettable and cookie-cutter, even the boss fight is disappointing.  Despite that, Syndicate remains a good game and I highly recommend it to action/adventure fans.

-Graphics still looks better than most games
-Perfect use of stealth
-Voice actors did amazing work
-Combat is really fun
-Parkour of this game is cool
-A complete experience

Loved it when it originally released & now having played it all these years later i still had the same feelings. Such a shame that this game hit with the big AC fatigue with it's yearly releases & right after the Unity fiasco. The sales showed that a lot of people avoided this when they likely wouldn't have without those issues.

The characters, setting, story, writing, music, progression system, side missions & general atmosphere are brilliant. Going back to this after the newer RPG AC's felt like a breath of fresh air. [b] No [/b] +100hr slog, [b] no [/b] overly enormous & mostly empty world, [b] no [/b] horrible levelling progression in which you need to spend forever doing monotonous & boring side quests in order to continue through the main story.

Whilst Syndicate does hold up really well considering it's now 8yrs old. It would still highly benefit from a remaster. Higher resolutions, improved lighting, better LOD's, better draw distance, more character models for the gang members, better sky-box & rain effects, improved combat system (even if that's just more combat animations) etc. 

I think a lot of people that missed out on this the first time round would pick up a remaster. It's also probably the closest will get to an open world Peaky Blinders game which it definitely felt like at times.

I highly recommend Syndicate if you never picked it up at launch.",1690750452,1694894443,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False
368500,146409207,76561199550807099,0,6,2608,0,1736,1695012112,"I am a huge AC fan, this game is entertaining, I highly suggest playing First Black Flag, Rogue and then Syndicate because they are similar in terms of timelines. The game controls are very much alike to AC Rogue. The story is fun, you happen to immerse into the character, the new mechanic of weaponery distribution is based on how you would train an apprentice asssassin on previous AC series which for me is understandable and makes more sense. The game is intended for new AC fans that are more opened to changes and mechanics, which is why, I highly recommend playing Black Flag, Rogue and then this game for long time AC fans. 

For Ezio Auditore fans, Graphics are marvelous and attention to detail is very nice. Only side note: You will have to get used to the new combat mechanics and get into the idea of having to go through Levels to unlock or use weapons. The game technology (Weapons) is fresh and you may find some of it appealling. It still feels like Ezio collection weapon technology was more advanced than Syndicate but that is just me.  

I am grading this game a rock solid 7 out of 10. I would have given it an 8 but it has combat bugs (Mostly happens when you are getting attacked by 8 or 10 enemies at the same time - The amount of enemies will depend solely on you, most of the time, you face a max of 5 or 6), jumping bugs ( Some times, It never jumps unless you go back, agarras impulso y saltas - Specially on trains or Ledges) and world bugs (Carriages flying away when you fight some big bosses, NPCs walking into walls) and even though it does not hinder your gaming experience, I was not expecting these types of mishaps on newer AC series games.  

Overall, Syndicate is a great game with some areas of opportunities. Would I personally buy it for a friend as a present gift? Yes. Would I stream it? Yes. Would I recommend the game to people? Yes. Would I feel satisfied after completing the game and say: it was worth the money? Yes.",1694879109,1694879109,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

For a stealth game, this is super frustrating. Dishonored came out 3 years prior and did it right: quicksave/quickload allows for rapid iteration until you solve the problem.

La ambientación histórica es probablemente mi favorita y sus protagonistas, Jacob y Evie son geniales. La narrativa cumple sin complicarse mucho y resulta, gracias al carisma de los protagonistas y personajes secundarios, entretenida. Al final sigue teniendo los mismos puntos de mundo abierto de Ubi: A rabiar de coleccionables y misiones secundarias de relleno y con una IA un tanto malilla. El parkour a pesar de verse mejorado en algunas cosas también se siente peor y un pelín menos responsivo. El combate se siente mejorado respecto a pasadas entregas al menos en hacerlo divertido y flashy. La banda sonora es digna de mencionar ya que el uso de las cuerdas en un Londres Victoriano no se podría haber usado mejor.

Movement is frustrating, including taking ages to get down from buildings, having to press E dozens of times.  

The storyline is over the top Wokeness, with starting splash screens about gender diverity, and a female protagonist who throws out lines telling Queen Victoria to stop expanding the British Empire and telling Winston Churchill to give women the vote.

I will say this. This has been in my backlog for a long time, and I felt like I really needed to go back and play this, as I had been a fan of AC1 through Revelations. Fell off after that and this was the one people talked about that I kept thinking that I should play from the older style AC games.   This wasn't worth the time or attention in my backlog. It was fine but if your backlog looks anything like mine, play the other stuff first. 

- Story is predictable, and pretty much meh.
- Combat is fine, but very repetitive. 
- Stealth can be frustrating at times for a variety of reasons. Finicky controls being one (where you go climbing up something in the wrong direction). Another is that it doesn't feel like several were designed for stealth. Instead, it's frequently better to just start smashing people in the face until they are all dead. Eventually when you get more upgrades, this gets better. And Evie can be played pretty well as stealth. But honestly, you will spend more time doing it and there is rarely a downside to charging in and just punching people in the face.
- Toward the end, several missions are trying to drag out the game and it shows. Things where you have to spend a LOT of time just traveling back and forth.

Bugs
- In 2023, still lots of bugs. One, I had to lookup a fix for, which was a game breaking bug that wouldn't let me finish a mission. The character I was supposed to tackle, would stop responding, or attack me.  After 10-15 tries, I looked it up, and the only solution, was setting CPU affinity to use a single CPU. It caused it to be extremely choppy, but I was able to get through it.
- Multiple times during climbing, my character climbed into no where, and then would launch off in to the air, and die.  
- Multiple bug where people and carriages went flying, which was more funny than anything, but definitely pulled you out of the game. 

And I realize that is a ton of cons, yet a positive review. The reason is that, it's fine. But just fine.  The recreation of England is awesome.  Evie, and to a much less extend Jacob, are semi interesting characters.  And the gameplay is moderately fun, when it isn't frustrating.

I like its technological side - I think what Ubisoft's studios managed to achieve with London is still extremely impressive, even almost 8 years later. However, even on technical side it's far from perfect with occasional bugs that will kill your progress (especially when playing with grappling hook) and extremely unresponsive movement. What's worse - the whole implementation of RPG-like weapon stats and progression is just not fun, making every fight that is above your equipment or character level - a tedious grind.

Story wise - the game is a bit of a mess as well, stretched thin with its plot over 9 and half chapters of mostly uninspired quests that we have seen hundreds of times already in previous Assassin's Creed games. Consistently throwing famous people from history as the replacement for the lackluster plot and lacking overall objective. The split between 2 characters doesn't help much either, as their gameplay is near identical and none of them is really likable or written to have any depth. New additions like train system or horse carriages don't do enough to address all of the pacing and variety issues these games had from the very beginning.

Worse - with the whole cheesiness and ever increasing absurd setups, Ubisoft kind of killed the motivation for actually being an assassin and trying to be quiet (not that these games ever truly succeeded at it, with Ubisoft consistently being desperate to force players into combat scenarios). Finally there is a problem of essentially ""nothing"" happening in modern times, as pretty much everything that's happening is now restricted to a few seconds of pre-rendered cutscenes poorly tying them to actions of the player in the past.

It's a shame really that Ubisoft with its greed has gotten the series to a point, where everything is stretched to maximum, lacking motivation and grand goal, with the whole idea of overarching plot connecting the games being pretty much dead since Assassin's Creed 3. I don't know - if you want to see how Ubisoft recreated London - I guess you might check it - it's not an awful game... just a game with a content stretched incredibly thin that failed to address issues carried over pretty much from the first game in the series. But other than that - play something else... especially if you are in mood for a stealth game, as this is horrible as stealth game.",1693585944,1693585944,False,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

It should have been part of the Gold edition. The rewards from missions often lack real value. And the level 7 equipment surpasses level 8-9 gear and even approaches the effectiveness of level 10 gear.

After the Ezio trilogy, ACIII, and Black Flag, the subsequent AC games lack the worthiness of playtime or even purchase. They simply don't justify the expense.

[b]If you decide to ignore my warnings or you are a masochist like myself:[/b]

-The Season Pass excludes ""The Dreadful Crimes"" DLC. Enough said.

-You need to install Ubisoft Connect and create an account (if you don't have one) to play. If you try to boot up the game without doing so, it will try to open through the uplay launcher (even though it was discontinued).

-If the game doesn't register your controller: go to the Steam settings, controller settings and disable (yes [b]disable[/b]) your controller's steam imput (disable Playstation controller steam imput, in my case).

-You may get softlocked if the fightclub missions bug out. Same if the train decides to kill you before you start a new memory in-between memories (although for this one you can try to track the train, hop on it and  interact with the board).",1692591203,1692591792,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

A new, welcome mechanic to the game is a rope launcher, allowing the characters to quickly scale larger buildings and to create their own zip-lines for easier travel between buildings too.

The setting is beautiful and running through the streets of victorian London is amazing. I love all the tiny missions you can do, especially everything surrounding Dickens and Darwin. It's nice to have variety, simple as it may be. 

Having two different characters to choose from is extremely fun, seeing as it requires a bit of forethought on who you want to pick. (/[spoiler] Albeit I hated having to pick Evie, simply because she's a stuck up bitch. God, she's so annoying. Shut up and live a little, lady, you're barely of age. Jesus. - Jacob, however, was a joy and a charm. [/spoiler]) 

There is nothing that's truly irksome about this game, but there is one thing I really wish they'd done a bit different. 
The rope launcher is my own personal nemesis. One of the things I adore about the Assassins Creed games is the whole climbing and jumping from roof to roof thing. It's one of the things I enjoy the most - and it's one of the reasons I don't mind walking even though I have the option to quick travel. That, however, wasn't the case for Syndicate. Jesus fucking Christ, that god forbidden rope launcher is so annoying. Don't get me wrong, it has it's uses and there are moment's when I'm thankful it's there but it takes a lot of steam out of the parcour bits - because you absolutely [i] have [/i] to use it. There's no way around it, lest you want to climb up a building, down again to cross the street and up to the next. I really wish they'd made the streets just that tiny bit narrower, just enough to give you the option to jump and climb instead of slide. 

All in all, that is a very small complain to have and it's definitely overshadowed by the return of a very classic Assassins Creed game. One town, not a whole lot of travelling to do and more in line with what I would expect of an Assassins Creed than, for example. Black Flag.

I  am playing on PC and comment on that alone. PC controls are seriously poor - very slow in response IF they work at all, they barely target your intended victim. Gameplay is over-complicated, you need to press 3 buttons at once for a leap of faith - why?? There's a 'press f for quickshot' - yeah, and what's that do? The throwing knives are more accurate. The parkour is 'meh' at best, I end up shouting at the screen 'get down you twat!' Here I am dancing pigeon-toed on a roof edge that I should be able to jump off or running sideways along a fence I am trying to get over. The ziplines might be fun IF you could place them where you want, in the event of an air assassinate they are never over your targets, and that's IF you can release in time to drop down (on pc that's E to drop, might work if yur lucky, otherwise you just end up spinning on your zipline).
Other reviews comment that this game is better than AC Unity, I'd agree with that but not by much. The game is very similar, story progression is the same, locked behind unending emptying of chests, killing pple in the streets, getting collectables, some random kidnap and  a bit of gang warfare (and that's getting tedious real fast)
I also dislike the 'bad dog' red mark system for not completing a mission according to what the game wants - that's red marks for you and you don't get all the gear, that's be ok if you knew what they wanted. There's a Kenway mission for example, examine 7 items - so I stealthed my first 4, number 5 is the piano puzzle, the last were in the room that opened, all hell broke loose and I couldn't get the last ones - red marks. Oh and look away for this slight spoiler, the piano puzzle on pc - you cannot use the numeric pad or mouse pointer, use the numeric keys above qwerty - the code is 212342 - just so's you don't get red marks like I did (bad dog!).
But hey folks there is one thing that is very amusing - on pc the carriages are almost uncontrollable - drive those things at full speed, and use the boost - kill everyone on the streets, mash the opposition, smack down light poles, run up walls, go careering out of control - it' so dumb it's hilarious, I nearly cried I was laughing so hard, but I did 'deliver' my kidnap person.
For the company that made AC Odyssey, AC Origins , the 3 earlier Ezio games, and even Valhalla, I dunno why they can't stick to good story, good skills, good weapons, combat and interesting missions, that's gotta be a winning combo one would thunk......wouldn't one? 
At this point I have no idea what the story is - who are these people, why are they assassins, who is the father they keep referring to, who's the mentor guy at the start? I will complete the game because I always do, but I currently have no investment in the characters or the story - just fingers crossed it'll improve.
London is very atmospheric, the music is annoying at times. 
At this stage, it's a 3/10 from me, I agree 7 hours is not long into it perhaps, but if I wasn't a completionist i'd put it in the 'finish it sometime in the never-never' basket.
So Steam asked me if I wanted to change my review since I have played additional hours - uh, that's a big fat NO - character movement is seriously poor, frustrating and beyond annoying.Could have been great, just isn't. Caveat Emptor!

[b]Pros[/b]
     - Decent graphics
     - Really cool setting
     - Still has some of that Assassin's Creed charm
     - Interesting concept in adding 2 playable main characters with slightly differing skillsets
     - Train HQ is an interesting change

[b]Cons[/b] 
     - Possibly the worst Assassin's Creed game to be released
     - The most bland characters in any of the series (at least to this point, from my knowledge of all the 
        games)
     - No significant utilization of the plethora of interesting side characters at their disposal
     - Weird RPG element that felt half baked 
     - Moving HQ was a little annoying to deal with and served no real purpose
     - Worst combat in the entire series, feels extremely arcade like
     - Worst villain in the series to date
     - Worst storyline of the franchise
     - Weird Hitman style assassination missions that feel tacked on

Obviously a long list of cons, this being my second playthrough I really wanted to enjoy it more than my first. After my first playthrough when it first came out, it left me with the feeling of it being the worst in the series and that hasn't changed. As I'm playing through them all again I was hoping that with a second take I'd feel differently, similarly to my experience with AC Unity. All this did was solidify my though that this is indeed the worst Assassin's Creed game to be released, IMO ever.

The story on all fronts is boring, the characters are paper cut outs with no real personality, which includes the villains which is a shame. They continually try to paint him as this awful character and while that's successful, there's no real interaction with him so it feels meaningless. The main characters are also just so boring and the worst of the entire series. No real redeemable qualities or anything that makes them stand out. 

The gameplay is also the worst, the tacked on RPG element feels bad and pointless (not like the later 3 titles that are full blown RPGs and are generally decent at that). The combat is weirdly sped up and feels like an arcade game. The climbing is still awful feeling, only made slightly better by a ridiculous tool you get relatively early on in the game. It also is the first to have these truly ""forced"" side missions to finish the game which I personally hate. They also seemed to tack on the ""Hitman"" style assassination missions for unique kills and whatnot. This also just feels like it was added for no real reason and seemed to provide no real benefit to the actual game. 

Overall it's the worst game of a great series, and it still is an Assassin's Creed game. It still has that charm and still has it's moments of good fun. If you're already this invested into the series it's a recommend, but only because it's a piece of the story. If you're just in it for that, watching a play through might be for the best.",1690074756,1690074756,True,1,0,0.506870269775390625,0,True,False,False

The game is a mess. Movement is clunky, combat is awful, and the game just seems too broken to enjoy the otherwise fun story and premise. I want to love this game, i really do, but installing and uninstalling 3 times just wont let me. Block bars wont appear but enemies will randomly become immune to damage (not even showing the blocking animation, just straight-up denying damage like they have god-mode), the reaction time varies all the time which makes consistent gameplay a foreign concept, and the target tracking is so bare-bones it can cost you the game. Doing a bounty hunt and have the target knocked out on the ground? Enemy comes up and you need to fight them so you can escape with the target? No Problem! Let the game targeting just unalive your target so you fail the bonus objectives! I kinda expected a top-shelf company to employ common sense mechanics into their game, but i guess thats impossible when said company hasn't had a good actually-finished-game release in... ever? I want to love this game because its story is fun, the newer mechanics (zipline, train, horse coaches, character swapping, etc.) are so promising but they only came halfway to completing even the most basic of game mechanics, making this game impossible to love. It just feels like suffering. I'm going back to the small-developer indie games that took half as long to make with a fraction of the budget and still provide a STABLE and ACTUALLY ENJOYABLE experience.

I liked the style of AC, its story, and the idea. But this one just disappointed me. The best mechanics of older games fortunately have been intact. London itself is beautiful. But the story is boring. The characters are flat. Bugs are so prominent and frequent that you can't be immersed in the world for longer than 2 minutes. NPCs are so dumbed-down that you feel like you are fighting against ants, not humans. The logic is missing. ""Assasins didn't kill the civilians""... but riding through them with a carriage was a daily routine for them. ""My fellow guard has been stabbed to death, I guess I'll look at him for a moment and get back to my default position"".

I'd think I was being picky, it's just a game after all. But I'm coming here after a similarly priced RDR2... That's a completely different story.",1689529000,1689529000,False,0,1,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

sorry about the tangent, but any way, the second big thing is the controls for the free-running, you have to either hold A or B on an Xbox controller while holding RT to free run, with A being to 'free-run up' and B for 'free-run down'. who in their right mind thought that was a good idea to put in an assassin's creed game? is so stupid.

It was bad before, but latest updates have either just been coded by morons, or was %100 intentionally to break the game to drive sales to other newer titles, either way, I just had a mission fail 11 times due to BUGS, not lack of skill, but bugs suck as key prompts not showing up, your gang randomly spawns between you and your target, they get in the way of you and your target, or kill your target, every respawn they are already %100 alert from last time somehow, you can't put him in the carriage by just pressing be or holding b, because either way it would choke out the target and de-synchronize you. Other times, enemies who usually would never bother you due to being maxed out on levels, usually they ignore you in the street, all of a sudden break ALL CODE! and randomly start attacking, causing your men to attack even if you never recruited them, and you failt he mission! You go upstairs, to smoke the hypnotist, and he somehow not only gets smoked and is coughing, but runs in a half broken animation to come and hypnotize you and restart the mission again, and again, and again, and again...

Seriously...this was not like this before...but after the last few updates more and more missions have been what seems to me, intentionally bugged and broken on purpose. Wouldn't put it past Ubisoft to sabotage older titles so they have an excuse to take down all servers as well, save money, pocket it, and demand their employees save their company while they bleed it dry....

Either way, unless you want a buggy mess, do not buy this game even on sale. The amount of glitches and bugs is absolutely inexcusable.",1688534132,1688534132,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

-Being able to have your own gang and give them upgrades
-New tech like trains and revolvers
-Carriges are a fun way to get around
-Open world is very interesting
-It runs better than Unity, which mattered a lot to the younger me playing on a shitty PC.
-you can switch characters
-interesting side activities
-more modern day story than Unity, although that's the bare minimum
-awesome black box assassination missions

One mechanical con is the lack of weapons. There are only three melee weapon types (cane-swords, kukris, and brass knuckles), pistols, and tools you have in other Assassin's Creed titles like smoke bombs. Having more weapon variety would have been interesting, and they would have had many options considering this is the furthest into the future Assassin's Creed has gone excluding the modern-day story.

Now onto the story. The story and narrative is lackluster, it is not as strong as the older titles. When I first finished this game in May 2016, I liked the story, but editing this review later, I gave it way more credit than it deserved. It was corny, campy, and too lighthearted. That goes for all the main characters, as they all represent simple personalities for most of the game, and just as [spoiler]character development starts to happen with Jacob in Sequence 8, the game ends in Sequence 9, and we only see him for a little bit in the Jack the Ripper DLC. He could have been an awesome, memorable protagonist like Ezio, but they never focused much on developing his character. The only good villain was Maxwell Roth, the rest are scarcely explored, including the simplistic main antagonist, Crawford Starrick. [/spoiler] Ubisoft said Jacob is canonically bisexual, but unlike his twin, him having any love life is not hinted at anywhere in the game, making this announcement meaningless. It is superficially Assassin's Creed, because while the story has all the traditional elements, a big bad Templar and his goons you need to assassinate, with a piece of Eden macguffin involved, the story lacks heart and soul, it does not give you enough reason to care or be invested until [spoiler]the last two sequences[/spoiler], which is not good enough because the story beforehand did not develop up to there properly. This game had the potential for a great narrative and cast of characters, they could have done it if they just took longer. If they want to learn how to write enjoyable stories, they need only look to the Ezio Trilogy of Assassin's Creed Games. But at least unlike later titles (looking at you Odyssey and Valhalla), you actually play as assassins.

Another problem is while the open world is overall good, it can feel dead in places. The London Stories, where you do side missions for famous historical figures who were in London at the time, were great. The gang activities have their fun parts, especially raiding Blighter hideouts, but since most of them are just copies of each other, with only the kidnapping missions have unique dialogue, they get stale fast. There are far less buildings you can go inside than the previous game, Assassin's Creed Unity. There are plenty of skyscrapers in the City of London, barrack-like apartments for factory workers in Southwark, and upscale penthouses in Westminster, and they look like such a natural and realistic part of the Victorian open world, but you cannot go into them, interact with them, or get a quest from people inside them, or as I should say, the overwhelming majority of them, I would say ninety percent, and this kills the immersion.

This game had a great and mostly enjoyable open world with plenty of fun things to do, but heavily fell short when it comes to an enjoyable narrative and world depth. It was good but not great. While it had a better release than Unity, it did little to innovate. Final verdict: 7/10",1448164960,1688524952,True,32,3,0.602561771869659424,2,True,False,False

Full disclosure I got this on sale for £6.50 and for that price you get a lot.  The storyline is pretty good: fun side quests for Charles Dickens, Alexander Bell and Charles Darwin plus a good variety of quests to get through the main storyline.  Aside from that, in order to unlock items and gain levels, you need to capture a number of London boroughs.  This part is a bit stodgy as the same basic tasks are repeated in each borough and there's a lack of variety in the gang members and gang leaders (they all look like perpetually angry Butlins redcoats) but if you want to steam through the main storyline then capture all of the boroughs first and you'll have enough XP to power through every quest.  The combat is a bit disappointing: you're basically spamming left click and if you're on MnK then the movement mechanic is not the easiest (you'll need to press 3 keys or 2 keys plus a side button to climb a wall) and the game hates it when you try to climb down even if its showing the key prompt to do just that.  There is no real difference between Jacob and Evie until you get near the end of the skill tree when you can unlock some character-specific special abilities.  The game is pretty fun though (i'm 89% of the way through the main storyline at time of writing) and for £6.50 I can't complain.",1688465921,1688465921,True,9,1,0.619903266429901123,0,True,False,False

The combat is good, but different. It doesn't follow any kind of formula, old or new, and it's an outlier in the series.
The parkour is the same as Unity, and it is so bad. The buildings in London are super spaced out and that makes the parkour even less fluid, that they had to introduce a grappling hook that doesn't want to function when you're on the ground. It's fun to use, but only when it's usable. 
The story is probably the most brain dead AC story so far, following Jacob and Evie Frye who are twins. They're good characters in my opinion, but the story would've been better if they had a dynamic rather than it trying to split them apart. Evie's story was definitely the better of the two, but then the last two sequences kinda just give up on her and rush everything to an end. And I think it's weird that they've been assassin's for this long, and they suck this bad at it. Especially Jacob, who just causes problems for everybody. The story outside of their dynamic would be good if they tried taking it more seriously instead of just making character like Alexander Graham Bell and Charles Darwin as fucking goofy as possible. It's a disservice to how historical figures are treated in this series, looking back on someone like Leonardo Da Vinci from the Ezio trilogy who was handled far better. I cannot recommend this game, as not even the side activities were ever very exciting. Just all the same.

On one hand, it's a masterpiece when it comes to how well they recreated the industrial revolution of London. It is beautifully crafted, with no street looking the same and everything being amazingly pretty at the same time.

On the other hand, it clearly showcases where Ubisoft went down as a company. It doesn't feel like an Assasin's Creed game, I have no backstory when it comes to the main characters and most of the time, it feels more like a Peaky Blinders Assassin's Creed crossover than an Assassin's Creed game.

More so, I completely despise Jacob (one of the main characters), him being a poorly written character and it shows, with toilet-grade humor and conversations reminiscent of the worst tinder dates you can get. Evie is, however, sweet and charming, and at the same time, interested in preserving the history and culture of the assassins. She's more of a main character than Jacob is, even if it feels like she was added at a later point in the development of the game (you barely get to play with her in the latter part of the game).

The character customisation is mediocre, at best. Nothing really looks good, and the good looking outfits are the ones borrowed from other assassin's creed games. The graple mechanic that has been added had me questioning it at first, but I believe it is one of the best additions to the franchise, given how fast it is now to climb a building. It keeps you swinging like a steampunk Spiderman in London.

The main story is somewhat short, and the pacing is all over the place, with sidequests feeling more like main quests given how big they are. They are no fun.

Syndicate is a great improvement from Unity, adding on top of what made Unity good, but still, a very lackluster story experience. I would recommend it at a hefty discount, but you shouldn't pay more than 10 euros for it. Still better than Odyssey, and more fun than Origins since it lacks the RPG element that made the latter a pain in the ass for me to play.

368500,140107419,76561198058413662,0,123,855,0,855,1686778923,"[code]Assassin’s Creed: Syndicate is a farewell to the classic Assassin’s Creed formula, with all the ups and downs one might expect from that by now[/code]

At its launch in 2015, [i]Assassin’s Creed Syndicate[/i] might’ve been met with a more critical reception amongst some players than it might receive today. The reason is simple: At this point in time, there had been at least one [i]Assassin’s Creed[/i] release every year (since 2009) and – not surprisingly, considering the short development time – each of these iterations differed very little from another. Players understandably grew tired of playing through the same game every year and especially after the [url= https://steamcommunity.com/id/dreamylotus/recommended/289650/]rough launch of Unity[/url] one year prior, the general anticipation for a new [i]Assassin’s Creed[/i] title – which would be [i]Syndicate[/i] – was not particularly high.

As a result, publisher Ubisoft decided that the franchise was in need of some major reinvention, which in turn led to a two-year break before the next main title released in 2017: [i]Assassin’s Creed Origins[/i]. And indeed, [i]Origins[/i] was a completely overhauled [i]Assassin’s Creed[/i] game in many regards, including a different gameplay loop, which now featured many RPG elements. This makes [i]Syndicate[/i] the last main game in the franchise to feature the “classic” [i]Assassin’s Creed[/i] gameplay (until the upcoming release of [i]Assassin’s Creed Mirage[/i] in October 2023, that is).

This could mean that [i]Syndicate[/i] – being the last of its kind – is the classic [i]Assassin’s Creed[/i] formula honed to its perfection, both in terms of gameplay and story. But while [i]Syndicate[/i] might be an improvement upon its predecessor [i]Unity[/i], it’s really not much different (or even better) than what came before. In fact, almost all of the usual criticism applies to [i]Syndicate[/i] as well.

What could’ve been a gamechanger is the new protagonist duo, the assassin twins Evie and Jacob Frye. Evie’s strength lies in being stealthy, while Jacob is more focused on combat. They both got separate equipment and skill trees, which sounds bigger than it really is: The skill trees are the same save for a few unique ones, experience points are shared, and you’ll share most of the equipment as well (e.g. guns). But what’s most disappointing is that this supposed duo only acts as a duo during exactly one (!) story mission, where you’ll switch between both characters. All other story missions are focused on one of twins and the game forces you to play as said twin during these missions.

This would’ve been disappointing but fine if the twins had equal screentime at least. But looking at the base game, this [url=https://gamerant.com/assassins-creed-syndicate-evie-jacob-screentime/]isn’t the case either[/url]: You’ll play as Jacob for roughly two-thirds of the main missions, while Evie is only left with the remaining third. [i]Syndicate[/i] clearly has a favorite twin and it isn’t shy about that.

Story-wise, the whole twin dynamic is quite messy as well, with forced character arcs and a lot of “but father said…”. There aren’t a lot of games with twins both being playable protagonists, so it’s a shame that [i]Syndicate[/i] doesn’t really make use of this opportunity at all, in both gameplay and story. Though considering the story is riddled with its own problems, that’s hardly surprising.

[i]Syndicate[/i] does not only suffer from the usual story problems of open-world games (mainly pacing issues and unnecessary roadblocks like “do X side activities in order to continue the main story”) but also fails as an [i]Assassin’s Creed[/i] story. The brotherhood is mentioned at the beginning as Jacob & Evie take things into their own hands, going against their orders, but that whole plot point never comes up again. Including the twins, there are only three assassins present in the entirety of London, [i]Syndicate[/i]’s setting, when even the Caribbean Sea was filled with assassins in [i]Black Flag[/i]. There’s a lot of templars to take down, sure, but they’re forgettable villains with the only templar connection of being called one.

As for the modern-day story, the Phoenix Project story of the [i]Assassin’s Creed[/i] games since [i]Black Flag[/i] continues – through small cutscenes between story chapters. But considering the entire Phoenix Project story was only continued (& finished) through a [url=https://assassinscreed.fandom.com/wiki/Assassin%27s_Creed:_Uprising]comic book series[/url] after the release of [i]Syndicate[/i], it should already be clear that Ubisoft didn’t really care about it in the end.

Overall, the main story of [i]Syndicate[/i] works in terms of telling you where to go next and why but it’s not much more than that. I feel like it could’ve been so much more if the twins were properly used and the villains (as well as the assassins) more fleshed out but in the end, it’s the usual quest to take down a bad guy’s minions in order to finally tackle the bag guy himself. While I’m on the topic: [i]Syndicate[/i] also got one of the most boring final battles I ever encountered in a videogame. I couldn’t help but think “wait, that’s it??” as the final cutscenes started rolling.

In terms of gameplay, [i]Syndicate[/i] is basically [i]Unity[/i] with some improvements. Instead of being stuck running around the city, [i]Syndicate[/i] offers horse carriages and a grappling hook to get through the city of London. Both are well appreciated since the city’s big and the fast travel points are few. The grappling hook is more of a hit-or-miss, however, since you can’t really properly control its target.

The rest of the game is really the usual mix of chasing people, tailing people, killing people and interacting with certain objects. There’s a lot of side content one could indulge in but considering it’s all just the same few objectives repeated over and over again, I don’t really see any reason to do so. That said, combat and parkour works fine as usual – it’s not particularly complex and I definitely don’t want to keep doing it for hours, but it’s fun for a few hours and offers some great animation work.

Unfortunately, [i]Syndicate[/i] also suffers from a weird technical problem where the game sometimes renders in higher resolution than set in the graphics options. This might lead to distracting black bars during cutscenes. Follow [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=806615157]this guide[/url] to fix it.

Concluding, [i]Syndicate[/i] is less of a “greatest hits mix” and just “more of what worked before”. It’s a good [i]Assassin’s Creed[/i] game that maybe got treated a bit too harshly at launch – but it’s also nothing more than that. Fans of the franchise will enjoy it and even newcomers might consider taking a look as there are only few ties to the previous games. But in the end, it’s no surprise that Ubisoft went for a major reinvention of the franchise next, as the “classic” [i]Assassin’s Creed[/i] formula had really run its course by that point in time.",1686846154,1686846154,True,48,3,0.821657001972198486,5,True,False,False

A character is introduced into the story like it's going to be some amazing hero, then disappears after one mission or two. 
Combat is floaty and weightless and kill animations drag on for way too long, making the combat feel like a slog. 
The story is completely disjointed and you get more side missions than you know what to do with with no relevance on the story whatsoever. I'm 10 hours in and the BIG BAD has been mentioned only twice so far despite being the main antagonist.

Jacob and Evie are already assassins when we meet them, so it’s not an origin story like Black Flag or Unity. Even so, their immaturity is reminiscent of those very games. 

The game allows you to play as both Jacob and Evie, to alternate between them outside and during some missions. I like that they aren’t just the same character gameplay wise, Jacob specialises in combat, while Evie in stealth, but Jacob is annoying. Unfortunately, for some reason, the game wants you to play as Jacob more and towards the end, most main missions are played as him. Evie deserves more screen time. The romance between Evie and Henry would have been acceptable if not for its lazy writing.

Syndicate’s Victorian London matches Unity’s Revolutionary Paris in attention to detail. However, unlike Paris, London’s tone is less on inequality between classes and more on how it was just a horrible place to live in in general. The city is monotonous enough that this message is successfully conveyed, yet has enough depth to make it interesting. The sky is polluted with smoke from factories in which children work and crime is rampant, yet through enough exploration, you’ll find people playing cricket, kids playing football, and couples taking photos. The game manages to draw a city so depressing and lifeless yet so immersive and full of life, and it looks incredible. Its size can be intimidating though, I found myself fast travelling a lot compared to in Unity.

However, London is not fit for parkour. Its buildings are too far apart and its streets are too wide. Without the rope launcher, which doesn’t even work right half the time, it would be impossible to traverse through usual AC means. At the same time, the rope launcher also takes away from the parkour experience. Other than that, parkour is further simplified and doesn’t have the same charm as its predecessor. Carriages give life to the city, and are nice to ride recreationally, but not very functional in chases and carriage-fights. 

I have mixed feelings about the combat. It looks amazing; the violent successive punches, cuts, stabs and revolver shots as well as the brass knuckles, cane-swords and kukri fit perfectly with the setting of Victorian London. My problem with it is there seems to be no rhythm to it. I don’t know how long it’s going to take to kill an enemy, or how many hits it takes to deal damage to an enemy. Other than that, I didn’t have a problem with the levelling system or the skill tree. Stealth is improved. The kidnapping mechanic is fun, albeit unrealistic.

My biggest gripe is how the game doesn't take itself seriously. What could be important and emotionally heavy scenes are often interrupted by bad jokes, both in the historical setting and modern-day. There’s little emotional connection between the twins and the story, the missions, or the city and that reduces the gravity of the story the game is trying to tell. We know that their father was an assassin operating in London, but all the game does with his character is use him as argument fuel between the twins, and the game completely forgot about George, whose orders the twins defy in the first place to end up in London. The game just doesn’t feel like a main AC game.

Syndicate isn’t a bad game, but is definitely the worst AC game I’ve played so far.

Brother and sister are introduced to us as already initiated into the ranks of the Assassins, thus sparing tedious prologues and investing precious time in characterization that is all in all well done, and, above all, functional in context. Although undoubtedly stereotypical - impulsive and restless he, more thoughtful and pragmatic she - the two embody very well the two souls of the proposed gameplay, and above all they live a relationship based on an entertaining chemistry of constant bickering and contrasts. The plot pits them against an insane and idealistic Templar, who is convinced that he can turn London into a ""paradise"" by settling internal turmoil with violence and exploiting the flourishing of industry to subjugate the souls. The atmosphere is fascinating, and in its own way (fanta)historically convincing, although the chain of events leading up to the finale has no particular twists. What works more than anything else is the characterization of the individual characters, which also goes to include historical figures of the period, including Dickens, Darwin, Marx, and Queen Victoria. Although the latter's are only unlocked once the story is completed, this quartet of characters (reproduced with particular verve and a touch of humor) will ensure a good overall number of ""memories"" to be experienced parallel to the nine sequences of the main campaign, providing a nice cross-section of London at the height of industrialization. So if the validity of the glimpse was already confirmed from the first appearances of the game, what is striking is the excellent characterization work done on the historical moment, narrated on the streets of a city that at the time really represented ""the center of the world."" The gangs, the cultural, technological and political restlessness, the unstoppable expansionism. An industrious empire but also full of contrasts, between the first technological marvels and the brutality of the slums. The good reproduction is complemented by a thorough level design work, offering interesting paths to exploit through traditional parkour: as for the latter, compared to Unity there is an improvement in the fluidity of the animations and in the recognition of the controls, with a latching on to the handholds that still generates some headaches in some frantic moments, but it rediscovers itself to be more accurate.
The two separate buttons for ascent and descent, to which moreover we have become accustomed by now, return, flanked by a brand new feature, namely the grappling hook. The latter can be used either to rise in a matter of seconds or to stretch a rope between two points so that it can be used to move quickly from one building to another. Although it makes the task easier when it comes to escaping from enemy alerts, the tool proves to be a lot of fun to use during the action, and it alternates very naturally with the",1683834952,1683834952,True,7,0,0.593039572238922119,0,True,False,False

Maybe there has always been something special about each which maintains my enthusiasm, for example I did like sailing ships around in Black Flag. I hadn't bought Syndicate because to me it was always too expensive. But I played Unity back in 2019 and 4 years later I just had to scratch the itch and got the full package for about £15.

Initially I was a bit disappointed because right from the start the gamer is forced to complete a linear mission, whereas I was looking forward to the open world play style. But I did like the chance to play both Evie and Jacob. At first the idea of the train seemed interesting but since it can't be steered, and there's no way to FFWD to a location it seems to become a bit pointless. So then I was left with the open world style that I have been used to. I did enjoy it but maybe I have finally lost my enthusiasm for AC. The designers have still not improved the controls so I was often frustrated that Evie or Jacob would go the wrong way or take the wrong action just because I was slightly off alignment. There are indeed a lot of bugs so it seems impossible to get 100% in many missions. I had a few crashes but I guess no worse than many other games.

As I had the full package I can't really assess the value of the DLCs much. I did have to pay £1.45 for dreadful crimes which was worth it, even though it was a bit ""cheesy"". Jack the Ripper was mostly fun, but seemed not much more that a simple extension of the game with new tools and modified missions. But I found the parts when I had to play Jack irritating and somewhat pointless in terms of value to the game.

I guess I will play the next AC which I think is Origins, but I'll definitely wait for a sale because if its the same formula then maybe I'll have finally had enough of AC.",1682872024,1682872024,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

-> London looks absolutely stunning in this game, with detailed graphics and a great sense of atmosphere.
-> The addition of two playable characters, Evie and Jacob Frye, is a great change of pace and adds some variety to gameplay.
-> The grappling hook is a fantastic addition to the series and makes traversal much more fluid and fun.
-> The side activities are plentiful and varied, from gang wars to street racing to taking over enemy strongholds.
-> The soundtrack is amazing, with a great mix of classical and contemporary music that perfectly fits the game's setting.

Cons:

-> The main story can feel a bit disjointed and lacking in focus at times.
-> The combat can be repetitive and frustrating, especially when facing off against large groups of enemies.
-> The AI can be a bit wonky, with enemies sometimes not reacting to your presence or behaving in strange ways.
-> Some of the side activities can feel a bit tedious or uninteresting, especially if you've done them before in other Assassin's Creed games.
-> The game's performance can be a bit choppy at times, especially on lower-end hardware.

Overall, Assassin's Creed Syndicate is a fun and engaging addition to the series, with some great new features and a gorgeous setting. While it has its flaws, it's still a solid entry in the franchise and well worth checking out for fans of open-world action games.",1543301126,1682203958,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

From the moment I launched AC: Syndicate I thought it looked visually boring and I thought the characters weren't believable... but I was so very wrong. I am very glad I decided to stick to this game and really give it a chance, because by the end of it I loved the story, the setting, and most importantly, the characters. Jacob and Evie take a little time to get fun, as they are semi-standoffish, but by the end I found myself audibly laughing at Jacob's jokes and Evie's cleverness.

The actual gameplay itself was also an incredible step up from AC: Unity, not just with the obvious (but awesome) zipline mechanic, but the game UI was far cleaner, parkour was cleaner, and the map was also actually enjoyable to look at. The music was also very well written, having a chipper or dark tone when necessary.

The only gripes I can think of with this game are as follows:
1. Ned Wynert's missions were boring and repetitive.
2. There are only so many times you can look at the same Big Ben loading screen and think it's pretty.
3. There are a few kinks in combat that detract from the fun of fighting a bunch of enemies at once.
4. Obligatory ""Karl Marx and Charles Darwin were totally unbelievable"" complaint.

Overall, an 8.75/10, would recommend.

I played this entirely on Steam Deck. I completed the campaign and most of the side activities (currently at 71% total synchronization). It had some performance issues, even on Proton Experimental, causing crashes ever hour or so and needing to limit the framerate to 30fps. I also had issues launching the game and had to update Ubisoft Connect manually and move the newer version into the games folder.

I have reall enjoyed the evolution of the Assassin's Creed games, and I vividly remember all the ads for this one when it came out. I did not know a whole lot about it going in, but knew that it was one most people really enjoyed. I really liked the twist of having two controllable characters in the game with their own strengths and weaknesses. It made the game feel fresh (Evie was definitely my favorite though). The addition of a zipline/grappling hook was pretty awesome as well.

The story was a solid entry in the series, although didn't really bring anything new to the table. It felt like an AC story. However, the side content was blended into the game very well this time around. This includes the collectibles (which I appreciated having to ""hunt"" for them), the territory activities for the ""gang war"", and the NPC quests (looking at your Bell and Marx). It never felt like a chore doing any of the content, which is a first for me in an AC game. Although fun, most of the previous game ""gave"" you all the side quest/collectible locations when you synchronized an areas viewpoint. This one you had to work for it a bit and the discovery felt good.

The characters and world felt alive and vibrant. Most people were pretty generic but some of the characters you encounter felt really unique. The most engaging ones to me were Roth (a true madman), and Alexander Graham Bell. 19th century London felt awesome to just roam around in from the industrial zones to the sprawling urban neighborhoods. It was just fun to explore the city. Lastly the combat felt REALLY satisfying, most of the time. I see now why people make the comparison to the Arkham games. When you combine the combat and the grappling hook, it is hard not to feel like Batman.

Overall, I really enjoyed this entry into the franchise and plan to revisit the game to finish out all the side content. A very solid entry into this franchise.",1681220364,1681220364,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Or I'm just a sucker for Evie. Its one of the two.

But genuinely for me this game was amazing, it was quite funny to at moments with the twins bickering and arguing sometimes. Eventually having a rather nice end. Graphics wise its probably what you expect from a game of its age, maybe just a bit better. The stealth in this game I found to be quite fun. Especially if you utilise everything it gives you. 

Only negatives I have really experienced with this game is the carriages. It seems that if I boost with the carriage and I move quicker than my pc can load the areas. I stutter a bit. This can also cause a temporary degrade in texture quality of structures which does quickly fix after 5 seconds. So I believe those are just hardware issues with my pc being the beautiful brick it is <3

The game's graphics aren't better than unity, but they are different and still very beautiful, except some parts of London looks really rather awful. On the bright side, they certainly run better. the stealth is faster paced and actually feels functional, as the slow and clunky feel of detection and stealth moves in unity somewhat kills the mood. The main characters have great chemistry but somewhat lack conviction compared to previous assassins. The setpieces were incredible though, with the WW1 segment and the tower of london both being really cool and interesting to look at. The blackbox missions too were very well designed, and executing (literally) unique kills never fails to entertain me.

The Assassin's Creed franchise is known for barely for making any changes into their game, this has been a known thing since AC Brotherhood or Revelation. But the thing that keeps people from coming back in my opinion are the stories. From Ezio's pursuit of the truth and liberation, to Conor's internal conflict regarding his father, to Edward's pirate adventures, to Shay's revenge, to Arno's Romeo and Juliet story. And in syndicate? I have no idea! There's nothing special about it, it's just Jacob Frye fighting the templar and Evie Frye pursuing the pieces of eden, very very bland. To really see how bland the sequences are in Syndicate, in Black flag, in one of the first sequences, you accidentally infiltrated the templar's order and to get the reward they promised you, you have to act as if you are in character, in syndicate, you have to burn omnibuses of the templar order, wow very exciting. 

In terms of game play, the only note worthy thing to talk about is the grappling hook, I mean it's cool and all but it's not like it's the ship in the past games, it's cool but it doesn't really change a lot. I've seen some people complained that the ship mechanics in the past games are gone, I mean in makes sense because the setting doesn't really fit, the themes in the past games can fit a ship mechanic, AC3? Yeah it's at the time of 18th century colonial america, black flag? obviously there's a ship. So what does Syndicate have? it's London industrial revolution, time for some street razor gangs! Now that's something that you can expand on and make something interesting about it, and the game supports the idea, Jacob's out there to make a gang, the rooks! And how significant are they in the game? Barely almost nothing! Other than the open world missions (which are checklist gaming) there's almost no missions in concern about gang related stuff. And if there are, then it's the most uninteresting uninspiring missions out there. I don't really know what to expect in this type of theme, maybe some criminal organization like in other stories like the godfather, peaky blinders perhaps but you know it's london industrial revolution, it's a whole pack of disappointment, that's all there is to know.",1680466298,1680466298,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

FYI, this was my very first play through of an Assassin's Creed game.

Decent game, but nothing stunning.
Combat is better than AC:Unity.. not hard though^^
Still behind AC:4 and AC:Rogue!! ..Reasons:
- Those stupid forced Carriage-fights are annoying as hell.
- Again, some Ubisoft developers wanted to re-invent the wheel.. 
thought it´s cool to hit enemies 5-10x till they finally die.. extremely unrealistic
(this can only be changed once you´re Lv.8+ and have all combat perks.. at that point the fun is back^^)
- some Story-parts and Side-quests are quite restricted
- the END is ok, but a bit unfulfilling

-> On a sidenote, while Syndicate has definitely a good atmosphere, even at very high in 60fps.. it looks sometimes bland and blurry with all those special effects.. I miss the clear sharp visuals of AC:4 and AC:Rogue ;(

->> SUMMARY:
Buy in SALE! Still a good AC-game and despite some flaws ~50hours fun ;D

***************************************************
Curious about other Assassin´s Creed -titles worth a buy ??
Here you go..

For me.. the original AssassinsCreed was nice, but restricted, that´s why I´d only suggest it to hardcore-fans that played at least AC:2 + Brotherhood ;)
AC:2 +DLCs (Ezio Trilogy) was by far the best experience.
AC:3 was pale.. took me time to enjoy playing with axes and some combat-decisions.
AC:4 is just great out of the box. Plays similar to Ezio-Trilogy plus additional ships, cannons and seafights. Also the big majority of the AC-playerbase loved it...
AC:Rogue feels like the optimized version of AC:4.. just way more exploration instead of occupying a city ;)

Now.. AC:Unity failed very hard when it released.. it had tons of issues. Actually, I just bought it recently in SALE, but it feels forced.. also combat is quite bad - at least not enjoyable.

AC:Syndicate delivers what everyone was waiting for.. not perfectly, but quite well. The story, the setting, it´s just fun to play. Also seems it was the last real AssassinsCreed game worth of the name ^^

And the latest ACs are just overprized and don´t even run 60fps in high/very high unless you invest a fortune. Even my 1 year old Geforce (already Turing) has trouble in 1080p.. this is a joke. Gameplay-wise the new titles are also more ShadowsOfMordor 1+2 than real stealthy killing.
AC:Origins plays very different and does not really feel like AC anymore. Stealth is a joke!
AC:Odyssey is a worse version of AC:4.. only a different setting and new combat mechanics ;(
AC:Valhalla ..well, as it shows, it will be another flop.. ;((",1594225295,1680206900,True,3,0,0.511063933372497559,0,True,False,False

PC(Steam) | 11 Hours
[Last Update: 30 March 2023]

Amazing steampunk experience. Experience the true feel of ancient London whilst soaring from building to building like Micheal Jordan on steroids this game is one of my favorites of all time and favorite of the assassins creed series. The transitions between the 2 main leads from time to time are very refreshing and the balance and freedom of changing characters ads to the aesthetic. (I also LOVE the 2 main characters.) 

The graphics are amazing on its own and for a game made 8 years ago (2015.) The variety of skills there are to choose from while keeping it easy to get skill points is awesome. Most assassins creed games focus too much on the main story and this game is the most open world in the series. Exploration is really fun with historical sights like big ben and more. On top of that if you choose to main the story even that is super enjoyable since the missions for the story have open-world aspects too. The auto saving mechanics crafting, collecting, weapon variety, armor, resources to collect, and so much more in the game helps you feel like the world is realistic if it weren't for the fact that you can jump from big ben into a box of hay and survive.

The combat in this game is the first time in the series I felt like I wasn't a guy in the center of a circle of enemies just spamming counter. The combat is a mix of hand-to-hand combat with your weapon and gun. The combat is fluid and fun. It is super satisfying to successfully pull off a win against enemies higher leveled than you. Pull of execution in the middle of a fight to then dodge a bullet counter of punch and stab two enemies at the same time is so satisfying. Also, the executions are all so well animated and brutal that I never got bored watching them.

You can freely switch between Jacob and Evie at most points, with side missions and open-world activities open equally to both. Campaign missions, however, are different, with Jacob taking the lead in the majority of the core assassinations. This is frustrating, especially since Evie is pitched as the more stealthy of the pair. But I soon realised that Syndicate is just not that interested in exploring forgotten tombs in search of dusty relics; it wants to liberate the great city of London from its terrible oppressors. And to be blunt, Syndicate’s a much better experience for identifying more closely with the goals of Jacob.

Most Assassin Creed games have just a copious amount of side missions that clutter the entirety of the map (looking at you AC: Unity) but, this game had fun side quests with colorful historical figures like Charles Dickens and Karl Marx. They were usually silly and lighthearted. And the side quests that weren't all that exciting were easy to run into and complete in under 3 minutes. Plus, as said before it was fun going from mission to mission. Especially crossing the river like a pirate.

Assassin’s Creed Syndicate is the most fun I’ve had with an Assassin’s game since Black Flag. In fact, I liked it more. Apart from its ill-fitting conclusion, it never takes itself too seriously and delights in the rich possibilities of its Victorian setting and great new grapple gun. As you explore its contrasting boroughs, you glean some sense of what powered this great city in the 19th century. The story missions capitalise on this by exploring different spheres of influence, which when combined with elements like mass transit, heavy industry, and law enforcement, make this feel like a different type of city than has been featured in the series to date. Best of all, Syndicate asks you to take London back in a way puts the last few games to shame.",1680156855,1680156855,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

AC Unity could be really good if they were to use syndicate's mechanism 
Combat is nice too reminds me of AC3 combat, it takes a while to actually understand the combat for syndicate

Oh and there's horse pulling carts and trains to get you to places so its pretty convenient for a big map
But still until syndicate it was an ""assassin"" game but from Origin to Valhalla they change everything so its kinda disappointing shit went from assassin to rpg game 
overall i had alot of fun playing this game definitely recommended
I would give this game a 10/10

Jacob and Evie are a dynamic I love so much, chaotic siblings - plus, I love the architecture in London! It's so much fun to ride around on a carriage randomly stabbing people and walking away like nothing happened. The plot is very interesting and I enjoy seeing what's happening in the current-day assassin's world (especially because of my favorite sassy ginger man.)

The story missions aren't as redundant for me as other games are - I have a lot of fun figuring out how to sneak into a building and kill/capture/free the targets without getting caught! And the carriage chases? Ugh, I love them!

I hope to get the Jack the Ripper DLC, but until then - I have to catch up to where I was on my Xbox. :)

Like all open world games, this one reuses a lot of general elements you've seen before (and will see again), but the gameplay is smooth and things are paced nicely. What's here works--and works well. Switching between the two characters was a nice change of pace; although you won't always get to choose which sibling to use. There's plenty to do and see; I found it easy to work my way to the end without the game becoming a chore. The game was fun and it didn't feel like a grind chore. 

At release, this game was met with a collective shrug from the community, but never mind that. It's a good purchase. Not as fun as playing pirate in Black Flag, but nothing ever has been. Origins took the franchise is a new direction, but this one (Syndicate) probably represents the best (and most polished) iteration of the old Assassin's Creed gameplay (with the well worn WB Games Batman-flavored combat and old school parkour).

It's lightning in a bottle. This one just works. Recommended. As of this writing, it's still a decent looking game, as well.

One negative of this game is the mandatory switching between the two main characters ... I found it detracted from the single character experience.  Another thing I noticed playing the game (and all the other Creed games) is that the non-historical scenes were a distraction and really unnecessary.  I also would have liked the game to have more gang-related activities.

As someone who has been away from the series for almost a decade, I can confidently say that Syndicate has brought me back into the fold and hooked me like never before.

One of the most notable changes in Syndicate is the introduction of a dual-protagonist system. Players control both Jacob and Evie Frye, who are twin siblings fighting against the corrupt Templars in Victorian-era London. This new approach not only adds variety to the gameplay but also allows for a more immersive narrative experience. Both characters have their own unique skills and playstyles, and players can switch between them on the fly.

Another significant change is the addition of a grappling hook, which completely alters the way players approach traversal. The grappling hook allows for faster, more fluid movement around the city, and it opens up a whole new world of exploration opportunities. The parkour system has also been refined, making it smoother and more intuitive than ever before.

The combat system in Syndicate is also a departure from previous titles. While the basic mechanics remain largely the same, the addition of more weapons and gadgets, as well as the ability to counter multiple enemies at once, makes combat feel more dynamic and engaging.

One of the things that I appreciate most about Syndicate is the attention to detail in the world-building. Victorian-era London is brought to life in stunning detail, and the city feels alive with activity and bustling crowds. The historical accuracy and attention to detail extend beyond the city itself, with characters based on real-life figures such as Charles Darwin and Charles Dickens.

Overall, Assassin's Creed Syndicate is a fantastic addition to the series and a must-play for fans of the franchise. The changes to the mechanics and the attention to detail make it a standout title, and it's easy to see why it has rekindled my love for the series after so many years away.",1678733075,1678733075,True,0,0,0,0,True,True,False

It incorporates the signature free running into the game play with a beautiful city scape to explore. the combat system is simple enough while also fun and diverse. the game boasts a leveling systems which is not overly complicated however are rewarding and adds desirable features passive and active. The story is rich and playful with characters that are vibrant in personality. Over all I describe this as the best modern assassins creed because it captures the original games mechanics and preserves the core concepts of the games while bringing new age features and play styles without selling the original game builds short by creating an open world RPG that has the play style of a game like skyrim IE origins and odyssey. When you care for the core mechanics a franchise originally presents you make it feel like it belong in the series while also bringing it to a new era of gaming and i feel the new games lack this subtlety.

A separate launcher Uplay popped up and asked me to make an account. I typed in all my details only for the launcher to tell me account creation isn't available at this time. I did a bit of googling and found it you can get around this by making an account on the Ubisoft website, So that's what i did.

I then re-launched the game and typed in my credentials only to be told there are no ubisoft servers at the moment. I tried a few more times over 10 minutes and still couldn't play. It had the option to play in offline mode, which i clicked only to be stuck on initialising for 10 minutes. I closed the launcher tried again and was stuck again.

Then i went on a google deep dive and found a few tricks to get around this. One was change the launcher to always launch in offline mode but this made the problem worse and now the launcher is stuck in initialising.

I then tried reinstalling the launcher but had the same problems and. Then i totally reinstalled Syndicate and still had the same problems.

I've spent the best part of an hour trying to actually this game i've purchased. I've seen many people have this problem and some haven't been able to play the game for months. Ubisoft support is giving generic automated responses.

💎1800 British era.
💎Well thought out characters, fiction and non-fiction.
💎London layout.

PLAYER GAMING REQUIREMENTS:
💼Assassin's.
💼History.
💼Parkour.

VERDICT:
Being a British fellow myself, I found this game very relatable when it came to London itself. Most things were in the right place, with the atmosphere being how I would picture it back in the 1800 (Aside from Assassin's running around). The story didn't live up to some of the other Assassin's Creeds but the gameplay was very smooth and adding my new favourite gimmick (The Zipline) gave it a more fresh approach. 

What I enjoyed the most out of this game would be the voice acting and how the characters reacted to certain things, just walking across the street was entertaining! This is the closest they get to the modern era and i'm very relieved that they stopped it here... in London.
Total Score = 81/100.

SIMILAR GAME LIKE THIS? / REVIEWER PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE:
Assassin's Creed franchise, DEATHLOOP.

GAMEPLAY:
It is the ninth major instalment in the Assassin's Creed series, and the successor to 2014's Assassin's Creed Unity.

The plot follows the premise of the Assassin's Creed franchise, involving a fictional history of real-world events where a secret war has been fought for centuries between two factions: the Brotherhood of Assassins, who promote peace and liberty, and the Templar Order, who desire peace through control. The framing story is set in the 21st century and follows the same unnamed and unseen protagonist from Assassin's Creed Unity, who assists the Assassins in their race against the Templars to find an artefact hidden in London. The main story is set in London in 1868, at the onset of the Second Industrial Revolution, and follows twin Assassins Jacob and Evie Frye as they navigate the corridors of organised crime and take back the city from Templar control.

The game is played from a third-person perspective and its open world is navigated on foot or by carriage. The game introduces new travelling systems and refined combat and stealth mechanics. Players control the two lead protagonists throughout the game's story, switching between them both during and outside of missions

Syndicate falls short of its predecessors, with dull visuals, and boring gameplay. While the game does have its moments, they are few and far between, and it ultimately fails to capture the imagination of the player.

VISUAL
Set in the sprawling metropolis of London in the Victorian era, the game boasts a beautifully realised city. Despite this, the visual design of the world is ultimately lacklustre. Environments are detailed and historically accurate, but the overall appearance of the city is dull and bland, lacking memorable sights and screenshot-worthy moments. This may be a result of the game's England setting and time period, but was still underwhelming visually and lacked those views that made previous entries into the series so visually striking.


AUDIO
Unfortunately, the soundtrack in the game falls flat, being far less memorable than other games in the series.

The protagonists' dialogue is also one of the weakest and most boring aspects of the game. The main characters' conversations are often tedious and uninspired, making it difficult for players to connect with them on an emotional level. Moreover, the game makes the mistake of repeating the same generic dialogue far too often, which can quickly become irritating and repetitive.

GAMEPLAY
The gameplay is some of the most boring in the series, failing to offer anything new or exciting to keep players engaged. The game's story feels rushed and disconnected, introducing characters and relationships out of nowhere, and dropping them just as quickly.

Syndicate has very few memorable missions, with the only real standout moments occurring in the last two sequences. None of this is helped by one of the protagonists, Jacob, being a one-dimensional character with poor dialogue. They've tried to make the character funny, but his humour often falls flat, making it difficult to connect with the character on any level. Evie was far more enjoyable to play as and connect with but still doesn't compare to leads in past games.

Navigating the streets of London is a chore, with wide streets and clunky parkour mechanics making it slow and uninteresting to move through the game world. The grappling hook, which seems like an afterthought, is often required to navigate the environment quickly, but it doesn't feel like a well-thought-out mechanic that does little to make traversal enjoyable.

Combat is average at best, and it fails to introduce anything that would make it feel fresh or exciting. Carriage riding/combat is also a major problem, as it is often required to travel quickly across the game world, but the mechanics are so poorly implemented that it can become frustrating and unenjoyable.

After all, is said and done, the game's conclusion doesn't do enough to tip the scale. The ending is rather disappointing, failing to offer the satisfying conclusion that players might expect after investing so much time and effort into the game.


POOR PACING
The pacing of the game is uneven, with long stretches of tedious gameplay and poorly executed storylines that leave players feeling unfulfilled. The game's world is not engaging enough to keep players interested for long periods of time, and many of the missions are uninspired and repetitive.

The story is also a major issue, as it feels rushed and disconnected, with characters being introduced and dropped without much explanation or development. As a result, it's hard to become invested in the story or the characters, and it's difficult to find the motivation to push through and greatly overstayed its welcome for me.

CONCLUSION
With all the previous points in mind, I can't say I had much fun playing through the game and the most satisfying part of reaching the conclusion is that it was over. This is a game that even die-hard fans could probably skip without missing much. While the game has its moments, they are few and far between. Overall, this makes the game an unworthy addition to the series and one I will not be returning to.",1676843358,1676989793,False,3,0,0.484396189451217651,0,True,False,False

The stealth is a huge step up from previous games that improves drastically from previous games in many different ways.
The parkour is similar to unity in regards to its freeing movement, however it sacrifices the dedicated jump button and a slight bit of vertical movement in return for fixing a large multitude of transition/animation bugs.
The combat, while nothing truly amazing, is fully functional 100% of the time, which is a huge step up from unity. The multi kill animations are also pretty fun and they reward you for setting up multiple enemies for finishers while thinking about your next move.
The map design is great, having a great deal of variety, while at the same time focusing on and complementing the new stealth systems, along with the new grappling hook mechanic (although the grappling hook can invalidate the parkour in many areas, it’s not required for you to use and it spices up stealth/parkour gameplay when combined with arial assassinations.)
There’s a lot of side activities that fill up the world as well, which is a nice change of pace when compared to many other Ubisoft games where the world is almost completely barren.
The setting is another great aspect that they take full advantage of, having many missions related to Victorian English folklore that was commonplace during the Industrial Revolution. 
Overall I’d give this game a solid 9/10, it’s nearly perfect, with the only thing I really have any complaints about being the story. Starrick is a very stereotypical antagonist that wasn’t fleshed out at all until the last few missions, if they gave him that kind of personality throughout the whole game, the story would be much more compelling.",1676834281,1676834281,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It's not bad, but not great. It has all the fun, classic ""Assassin's Creed"" type gameplay you'd expect, but not much really sticks out in this entry of the series here either.

What is outstanding though is Ubisoft's depiction of late 1800's London in the Industrial Revolution. Ubisoft has always done well in this regard to mastercrafted, historically accurate locations, but this one was one of my all-time favorite cities they have ever produced. Also must say, the traveling Train Headquarters is one of the coolest HQs/Bases in the franchise.

The game is worth it alone just for the ""Virtual Tourism"" experience of exploring around, walking the city & soaking in the atmosphere.",1676749798,1676749798,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

At least, that is how most of the places look like. However, there is a rich few, ruling the city and taking advantage of the poor - Crawford Starrick and his comrades.

I really liked the hookshot that helps you climb faster. For me, as I get farther and farther into the series, I get more and more impatient when it comes to climbing the walls. While the parkour/climbing isn't perfect in this game, I felt like they hit the nail on the head. It feels pretty smooth for the most part.

I really like the Skill tree in this game. In Unity, they took away basic gameplay mechanics from previous games, but in Syndicate they actually added to it this time and kept the same core mechanics from previous games. Also really liked the gang upgrades too.

The side quests felt important when playing them. While most, if not all, of the side quests weren't important plot wise, there was a sense of importance when you're either making more of London ""less red"" on the map to get more territory for your gang or talking to an important historical figure.

The story was pretty solid. Unlike Unity and Rogue, it felt like there was a sense of purpose when doing every mission when all of the templar leaders are laid out in front of you in the pause menu. It was interesting getting to know the enemy and your two protagonists as you journeyed through the main story. I also really liked the ending. While it seemed weird for the story, the final cutscene felt just right for an ending. Also the story for the Jack the Ripper DLC was fun.

My couple of gripes is that I wish Ubisoft polished the game a little better. Lots of glitches, especially in the Jack the Ripper DLC; however, the game is playable. Only other gripe is that on the box art. Evie deserves better.

Something has stayed the same, something has been added and become interesting.
When I first saw the rope I thought the all too beloved parkour was going to be destroyed but 5 minutes later found myself happily swinging back and forth on the whole thing along the parkour course.
The story quality isn't the best, but I enjoyed it. A step back from epic battles and world-shattering revolutions felt good. The game looks great too, just as good as Unity but a bit more optimized this time.

The common gripes for this game usually come in the form of the contrasting environment and storyline/characters. The drab, polluted skylines of London during the industrial revolution set a darker mood than the characters seem to be in. But I am of the opinion that this very contrast serves to bring a sense of balance that makes the player want to explore every nook and cranny of this city.
If every aspect of this game was set to a dark tone, I doubt it would have been able to draw as much play-time and more specifically exploration time out of its players. The characters being witty, some missions that are more light hearted, give more depth to the game's atmosphere highlighting both the grim and the gleeful.

Overall, this game should definitely be tried once for both regular gamers as well as fans of the Assassin's Creed franchise.

And now that I have played ACII and Brotherhood, I can see the overall drop in quality for the franchise. Watching paint dry is a more interesting prospect. Combat is weak and uninsipiring, and the game has a lot grinding for levels, money and xp. The map is monotonous and boring, being grim and filled with bricky industry and row-houses, but maybe that's because that London was during the time period. The main storyline has excessive cutscenes and rail-roaded content, and suffers from genericness and lack of memorability. It feels like a weak imitation of much better games and stories.

Still, the model of Victorian London is well-executed, and racing the streets around with horse carriages is the most fun aspect of the game. Overall, I found the side activities and exploration much more fun than the actual storyline. Beneath the surface, you have a great walking simulator of Victorian London, you just need to bear with the story and gameplay to get there and unlock all districts, meh. Wish there was a Discovery mode for London, so one could explore without being bothered by boring enemies. And for once I love hearing voice actors speaking with a proper posh British accent instead of a forced foreign accent that nobody speaks like in reality. But that's about it. On top of that, the game crashes a lot.

And the modern day storyline - oh boy, if one can even speak of it, so brief it is - is entirely made of scripted cutscenes and is probably the weakest in the whole series. The game would probably suffer no consequences if it was left out entirely.",1639592645,1674590336,False,2,2,0.454791665077209473,0,True,False,False

Every AC game thus far has  different mechanics and gameplay style and the one thing that is constant is the linear storyline which i dont mind

Story 7/10 - The storyline is decent as usual , Evie & Jacob lacks depth yes , but dont mind it at all as both of the characters has different motivations and has its own mini subplot. it's entertaining enough. Side mission story is a good improvement as well , worth playing.

Gameplay 9/10 - AGAIN changed with every AC game and I dont mind. Great Improvement on combat albeit simple mechanics. Plenty of upgrades as well as crafting to change approach for each mission , the variation is satisfying. Although the combat is cool , every hit lacks a bit of ""weight"" with each hit. Weapons is 10/10.

The zipline gun is intentional added I think due to the size of the City and industrial settings , making it easier and smoother  to navigate with the building bit batman like unlike Paris which is very condense and close .

The parkour is also different , I think they want you navigate every movement intentionally if you want a smooth free run instead of just pressing one button and the free run is just automatic, I make less movement error compared to other AC games because of it and i welcome it.

All in all i give it 8/10

Once again another AC game in the franchise that reinvented things that didn't need reinventing. Combat gets changed up again from its predecessor Unity, which was changed up from its predecessor Black Flag. Combat in Syndicate really tries to imitate the Batman Arkham games, working out all the combatants in the room and valuing chained attacks and perfect freeflow. Combine that with more grinding elements, more leveling needed to stand a chance in certain places, and stockpiling resources to get better stuff make this game a chore at times. That said, its not without its positives. I found most of the missions enjoyable, and the addition of kidnapping people to sneak on into places really seems unique. Gunplay is a bit wilder especially when playing Jacob, which brings me to the other plus; having more than one character to play. Some mission will require you to play one or the other, though there are a number of things you can do as either one which have some variation in their endgame skills. Nothing outstandingly bad in terms of glitches or stability like Unity, which is definitely a plus too...though its a low hanging bar to hop over.

If you appreciated games more like ACII and are not in the market for a grindy change up, pass on this title. If you're ok with grinding, and are willing to try an AC game that changes mechanics up a bit then go right ahead.

London is one of the best worlds in the series in terms of authenticity, standing alongside Egypt and Paris but arguably is better for having lively npcs, playing cricket and other activities. Side activities such as carriage racing, boxing rings and gang wars help you get into the setting well. The Frye twins do entertain but had much more potential, you really only get one mission where the game fleshes out the co-operative aspect which is a shame. 
Story's tone is the opposite from Unity so don't expect it to be serious (Jack the Ripper dlc has a tone more up Unity's street if you fancy that) and movement has been made worse also which will make you rely more on the grappling then free running. 
This game is entertaining despite its flaws, only really getting blasted on release due to fatigue over the AC series. Play this instead of going to London yourself, you'll see the sights while playing AC Peaky Blinders",1673528366,1673528366,True,3,0,0.565217375755310059,0,True,False,False

You can also see the beginnings of where they'd go with subsequent titles (which I also enjoy).

It is literally what the entire franchise has been needing for a long time. A lot of the systems have been reworked and all of them have moved in the right direction. I cannot believe I am saying this, but it is so well done that I very much doubted it was made by Ubisoft.

To address a few of the improvements:
- The interface is a lot smoother and more intuitive. Data, missions etc. are categorized in a more streamlined way so there's no excessive clicking on a slowed down menu anymore. 
- The parkour engine has been tweaked, and after the abomination that was ""Unity"" this one feels so responsive and light that it never ends up being frustrting. Which I don't think I've felt since the days of Ezio.
- The combat system has been completely revamped. No more sluggish drawn out fancy finishing moves while many other enemies circle you, mouths wide agape in bewilderment as to why their coders were stupid enough not to allow them to attack in the meantime...It feels faster. Almost jittery at first but you get used to it very quickly and it is actually as skilled based as an engine like this allows. 
- The world has been balanced very well. It is a bit grindy but nothing that feels like a chore. There are skill and gang upgrades and all have a noticeable effect on the world and your experience in it. The new addition of the ""batman hook"" is absolutely brilliant, super well coded and I believe a staple of the series going forward. Whomever came up with that needs a raise. 
- The quest objectives are actually enjoyable and almost never recycled. Gone are the days of the tedious ""don't get seen or you have to retstart the mission you pleb"", these ones are actually good and they make sense in the context of each respective mission, allowing for plenty of approaches depending on the player's preference. 
- The coding - again, it's like the game was outsourced to another, far more capable studio (yes I don't have the highest regard for Ubisoft, given their last I dont know how many miserable attempts to produce games), but this one is both refreshingly stable and light on the system. No lag, no crashes, no glitches, you could actually allow yourself to get immersed in the game for hour without interruption. 
- The story and the characters are....excellent. The dynamic between the Frye twins is quirky, yet endearing. Each have their own personality, which plays a role in the plot. Compared to the absolute travesty that was Liberation for example, these characters feel like they are coherent and complete personas with their own agency in a world of similar personalities. There is a bit of completely misplaced feministy rants such as Evie chastizing the QUEEN OF ENGLAND for her imperialist ways and getting cake in return, but they are few enough not to induce anything other than a mild eye roll. There is plenty of proper british humor involved, for better or worse, but it really helps the setting. 

Honestly, after Liberation, Rogue and Unity, going into this one I was almost dreading to see what they woul mess up this time but...they didn't. In fact this installment restored my faith in Ubisoft's ability to produce a well-made game (to some degree, anyway). I am giving this a surprised thumbs up. It is right up there with Brotherhood and Black Flag, and while it is not on their level in terms of storytelling and atmosphere, I daresay it runs smoother as far as gameplay.

one of the worst assassin's creed games, after unity and the first one.
story didn't feel very cohesive, it's just murdering people until you get to the final boss
i did like the unique kills though
controls were less annoying than in unity as well
the grappling hook makes parkouring obsolete, which makes scaling high buildings really quick

I've gotta' say that although this game is reasonably well-polished and bug-free, as I approach the final acts of the game it's increasingly feeling like a slog.

I usually get involved in a lot of side-quests when I play OW games but in Syndicate I'm just getting bored of them.  That's doubled-up by the fact that the rewards are all kind of pointless anyway, if you build up the economy-related skills early in the game (as I did).  My character is awash with resources and I've already got endgame-quality gear & abilities, so there's nothing left to gain.  I'm finding myself wanting to get the main story done with now so I can mark this game as ""Done"" and move on to something different.

I'd classify this as a barely-positive review.  I'll see the game through to the end, but for an AC game this one is decidedly average.  Not bad like AC3 was, and a little better than Rogue.

I would say this AC game was one of the best, lot's of gameplay is offered. The story wasn't the best but was up there, and the gameplay mechanics are the best so far. The skills tree with other upgrades was great, but not many outfits to choose from such as Unity had. The Jack the Ripper DLC was unique adding to the story after the main game. If you ever wanted to feel how it is to be a serial killer this DLC is for you. Syndicate was defiantly worth picking up even if you haven't played the previous AC games.

I came straight from Unity and they have same problem but worse.
The story is really not strong and the main villain equally underwhelming.
From Sequence 1-8 we only hear the main villain might from mouth to mouth but we never see what he capable of and I don't know why he keep monologue to himself in the office as if it is what make a strong and fierce villain which is not.

The story flow is also another problem. Since we play both twins, we can choose which twins we going to do first but because of that the story end up all over the place.
This what make mid part of the game seems extremely boring.
Also we can do Character Side Quest way over than what we should have and create a weird connection with the main story.

I welcome ""Rope Launcher"" mechanic, it's fun and easy to go place to place...
BUT
This also a major problem because the parkour centered around ""Rope Launcher"" and they restricted the Climb Up, Down and Jump. 
- You can't no longer to jump from roof to roof if the range are slightly long even if in the previous game you can just jump but in here, the character will force looking down/parkour down/use Rope Launcher
- You can't drop down from roof like previous game
Basically the parkour become so static and didn't flow well.

BUGS! I experience quest break and stuck in cutscene because a major character died on Horse Carriage.
This happen a lot and mostly because Horse Carriage really buggy and sensitive. There are so many times Horse Carriage just launch to the sky and smash to the wall randomly.
I also experience stuck in Black Loading Screen but I able to move my character during the quest.
I never encounter game breaking bugs or a crash in Unity which is weird to be honest.

This is the newest one I've played as I'm years behind on AC games. You can skip this AC if you want. I don't feel like I learned any new information from it, as the main story with the Precursors interest me. I feel like I should have skipped this one and went straight to Origins from Black Flag. It was a decent game, just didn't hold my interest and I found myself pushing to complete it.

<<THE BAD>> I found the main story a little bland. I felt this AC was a bit rushed. The game has a real GTA element to it. You run around London stealing carriages and taking over territories. The game play felt bland and very repetitive. But, I'm years behind on these games and I skipped over AC Rogue and Unity. Sorry, French history doesn't interest me. But neither does English history, so it may be why I find the entire game bland. The ending of this game is underwhelming. The game has some bugs. The most annoying one is the music box tune that plays every single time you load into a new area or fast travel. You have to collect all the darn music boxes to make it stop. I did not... X'O

<<THE GOOD>> Jacob and Evie Fry, the main characters, are really interesting. I liked both of them and found myself playing Evie the most due to I like stealth play and Jacob felt more like a wrecking ball. This is honestly the only reason I kept playing this game, as I have my eye set on playing Origins next.

This had potential, but I ultimately found it uninspired, and, thus, uninteresting. I've played every AC game to this point except Unity, including Liberation, and I like all of them a lot more than this one. This one looks pretty good, some of the new weapons are cool, the real-world characters held promise, but I felt it was all poorly/lazily executed in the end. Playing as a Templar in Rogue was a hard pill to swallow at first, but at least they had the story, gameplay, open world and execution to win me over in the end. To the main characters in Syndicate, everything is a joke or a duty; neither character made me give shit about them or their mission for even a second. Real world characters were little more than NPC-type quest givers or people you had to follow slowly around while they prattle on about meaningless shit. And, boy-oh-boy, I sure hope you like slow paced detective work that amounts to using superhuman vision to walk around slowly gathering the little bright-light clues, because there's a lot of that. Plus, like so many games from these years, the incessant, stupid fucking rain and all the noise that comes with it... just: fuck you.

After playing all of that content, I'm happy to say Syndicate is one of my favorite Assassin's Creed titles; it's probably sitting at number 2 or 3. Victorian London is a pretty great setting, and although once again the Assassins are basically just domestic terrorists destabilizing the existing regime, the twins are entertaining characters. I will note that most of the game's notable missions force you to play as Jacob, the male (and more stupid) character. The game does lean into this by having the characters canonically make mistakes but if you prefer a specific character know that you will have to play both.

This game adds a couple new mechanics; we get the zipline feature which makes traversal much simpler, new assassination mission structure which appears to have taken inspiration from Hitman, an investigation mechanic introduced in the Last Maharajah DLC, and fear mechanics in the Jack the Ripper DLC. None of these mechanics are really used to their full potential or significantly developed, although their inclusion is appreciated. Rooftop carriage combat may also be new, but having skipped Unity I'm not confident in making that assertion. The game does see a reduction in scope from previous titles, being limited to two maps; London and World War I London. Jack the Ripper has its own version of 2 London Boroughs and 3 unique mission areas as well. The soundtrack uses a lot of public domain pieces but the performances are excellent and the soundtrack was a real high point in my experience. The game also features a skill and leveling system; the leap from this to Origins was a lot smaller than I expected.

Most of the side missions are pretty bad, although the activities were decent fun and had a good amount of variety. Historical characters are usually portrayed in a disingenuously positive light, and have no real reason to be involved, but this isn't exactly anything new for the series. The exception to this is the Last Maharajah DLC which adds a 10 mission side quest line which is completable either as postgame content or alongside the base game; these missions were varied and interesting. Lots of reviews mention the bugs but I only encountered one bug, which did unfortunately force me to reboot the game. World War I and Jack the Ripper have their own side activities which add some additional variety. For World War I, you control Jacob's granddaughter Lydia and have a fixed level and toolkit. Jack the Ripper presents a similar situation, with all characters having either fixed or limited level ranges and toolkits. Jack the Ripper is actually a completely separate executable with its own progression; selecting it from the main menu just backs you out and loads the other executable.

Overall, I really liked the Last Maharajah and all of the assassination missions in both the base game and the dlcs; the Hitman inspiration did a lot to add replayability to the game and make those missions feel more engaging. Jack the Ripper, despite its high production values and added mechanics, I could take or leave. The plot of the base game isn't anything special but Jack the Ripper's plot is very trite and the mechanics just aren't developed enough to make them interesting. The wonderful soundtrack and multiple traversal options take a lot of the sting out of traversing the open world; I found myself avoiding fast travel and hoofing it instead. I think the game and the Last Maharajah are definitely worth a playthrough (buy the Last Maharajah and play it in tandem with the base game), but only buy Jack the Ripper if you still want more when you're done.

Addendum: I didn't realize when I initially wrote my review that there was another DLC not included in the Season Pass called Dreadful Crimes which is another 10 mission questline. It's entirely investigation missions. The missions themselves are pretty simple but enjoyable, with no combat. It's an interesting diversion and uses the same investigation mechanic from the last maharaja but with an included notes log.",1670220475,1670464753,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Victorian London is a wonderful setting for the franchise ranging from the dirty grime covered alleys of Whitechapel to the beautiful gardens of Buckingham Palace. Gameplay is more advanced than the simple ""counter-kill"" era games, but still enjoyable enough.

The weakest point of the game is by far the Templar antagonists. They are rarely intimidating, have little to no character depth, and most don't get enough screen time to amount to much more than murder fodder.

The dual protagonist approach will either be love or hate. To me it is simply disappointing. The potential was there for it to be so much more, using two characters to coordinate on the same mission and allowing the player to jump to those different perspectives seems like an obvious choice as is the case in GTA V. However the only time this happens is the very first and very last missions of the game. In any other mission you simply pick (or are forced to play) a specific Frye twin and the other will appear in intro and end cutscenes despite being absent in the actual mission.

It should also be noted that the screen time is pushed heavily in favor of Jacob so if you prefer Evie I have bad news. (Until Jack the Ripper, where she stars as the main playable character)

All in all I think an 8/10 is fair. It's a good entry in the series but by no means a masterpiece in gaming at large.",1670396095,1670396095,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The best thing about this game is obviously the setting, running around the aesthetic city of London in 1868 for me was an unreal experience. Just walking around the city at night time when all the street lamps litted up is a beautiful sight to see, the game also come with dynamic weather system and transactions between days and nights – you can clearly see the changes with the NPC’s behavior. All the core gameplay mechanics of this game is kind of identical to Assassin's Creed Unity but just smoother, easier and felt really good when controlling your character compare to ACU which was very slow paced. Finding chests actually have meaning now because it now also gave you crafting materials to crafts weapons and upgrades, you get better weapons and upgrades from increasing loyalty levels with your allies by completing quests and activities which sometimes very repetitive hence AC games… But stealth sequences in this game is pretty much throwing knifes/smoke bombs spam and maybe berserk darts once in a while!? Plan B combat are now free-flow-like Batman Arkham Series but just dumber… I recommend to avoid fighting enemies face to face because it was so boring… The story is not really memorable, just some powerful bad dude wanted to take over everything and you just have to messed up his all his plans then take him out of the picture that all no twists and turns. The only thing I hate about this game is the Perks Progression System - it was a horrific experience for me to unlock all of them because some of the requirements is very misleading (The Countershot Perk want you to Countershot 2 ranged attacks in under 10 seconds but you not gonna get counted when fighting MOST of the enemies in the game because its only get counted when you counter shots from the Royal Guards and NOBODY TOLD YOU THAT!).

Pros (+):
  The game has a really great map and atmosphere.
  They clearly did some research on the victorian era, and on the specific time period/decade, and you can feel it and immerse your self on it.
  The graphics look great. If you want a sunnier and prettier world, search for the graphic's guide on steam, where they tell you how to take out the fog.
  The music, even though pretty simple, is probably one of my favorite OSTs on the franchise.
  Awesome sound effects.
  If you liked Assassin's Creed Odyssey and it's story, this can be your game, since the game is full of jokes and silly moments, mostly done by Jacob.
  Because of the Grappling Hook, stealth and assassinations feel really good, making you feel like some sort of mix between Assassin and Spider Man.
  Even though it's a simplified version of Assassin's Creed Unity, the parkour is still one of the best in the series, being the second best parkour system of the franchise for me.
  Like most Ubisoft Games, the map has lots of points of interest and items to collect, but I never felt too overwhelmed. It's certainly not on the level of Assassin's Creed Odyssey's (god forbid) or Assassin's Creed 2's feathers BY FAR.
  The game's story isn't that long, meaning you can finish it in less than 40/50H, unless you decide to go for the markers, then it can take 80 something hours.. If you are a completionist like me, and you want all the achievements, perks and 100% on everything, it took me 119H for the whole game (DLCs included), but I know it can be done in way less time.
  Compared to Unity, there aren't that many bugs. The only big bugs only happened to me after the 80H mark.
  The Dreadful Crimes DLC is probably one of the best DLCs I've ever played on any videogame in general. It is definitely a must have if you want to play this game.
  The Jack the Ripper DLC is also really good, introducing new game mechanics that are enjoyable while being a fairly short DLC.

Cons (-):
  The story lacks a serious tone and the villains are horribly written (with the exception of Jack the Ripper which is awesome and badass).
  The story can feel a bit random sometimes.
  Not that many memorable moments.
  Even though the Dreadful Crimes DLC is awesome, the game doesn't allow you to replay them. You will have to start a new game from scratch to replay the missions.
  Even though you have historical characters, like all Assassin's Creed games, they never felt too important, sometimes feeling really weird and wacky.
  Most of the cutscenes are a bit meh or straight up bad, specially on the Jack the Ripper DLC, where the cutscenes are literally broken.
  Voice acting could have been better, but the voices of Evie and Jacob are top tier.
  Lots of re-used animations for non-cutscene dialogues. Some feel dumb or exagerated.
  Some missions can feel a bit repetitive, but overall fun.
  Combat is trash, no questions asked. The finishers are really good though, and I suggest switching weapons from time to time.
  The perks and achievements are definitely not worth grinding or collecting, so don't lose you brain over them. If you do, I suggest you want watch/read some guides.
  It was never my thing, but there's no modern day content. There are cutscenes and a ""story"", but it sucks so much you might as well forget it ever happened.

Bonus stuff:
  You won't do much parkour because of the map layout, but that's part of the era the game is set in, so I can't consider this neither a pro or a con.
  Evie is waifu material.
  Jacob is comical chad.",1669894417,1669894728,True,29,3,0.765729188919067383,0,True,False,False

+ the grappling hook makes getting around so much easier, although it too starts feeling like a bore very quickly
+ dual protagonists, charismatic this time around, especially Jacob
+ the fighting system is different from Unity, more brawling-oriented; it's just fine, nothing special occasionally even enjoyable
+ you can ride and hijack carriages
+ wear a top hat, pull down hood when necessary
+ your base is a moving train, and your Assassin liaison is Arbaaz Mir's son
+ finally reasonable secondary mission challenges (most of them)
+ meet Charles Darwin, Charles Dickens, Queen Victoria, Benjamin Disraeli, Arthur Conan Doyle, Florence Nightingale, Winston Churchill etc.
+ there is a part where you play Jacob's granddaughter in a WWI-torn London which looks amazing
+ the Jack the Ripper and Dreadful Crimes DLCs are truly awesome if you discount the bugs

- collectibles, again, so many collectibles
- the collectible maps are locked behind a paywall (you get some currency but I was only able to get one)
- crafting is stupid, the order in which you get equipment has barely any linearity, and crafting blueprints are hidden around the map
- bugs everywhere: moving bugs, driving bugs, climbing bugs, mission start bugs, mission end bugs, combat bugs, dropping through the floor bugs, crashes as well
- the Jack the Ripper DLC was especially bug-riddled, I could barely finish any side mission because as soon as I initiated the final conversation, I would explode, or the carriage I'm driving would fly to the Moon or some shit like that
- game's mostly brown and grey, but that's London for you
- the final boss fight is beyond stupid, every single part of it

What a brilliant game Syndicate is. The grappling hook breathes a bit of fresh air in the old formula. The weapons (canes, kukri, and brass knuckles) are awesome, as is meeting so many cool people from history and getting a glimpse of Victorian and WWI-era London. However, what is most assuredly not awesome is collecting a bunch of damn collectibles, failing to do a side challenge because the game did not inform you of it, and fighting the control scheme more than actual enemies. That last one might have been my fault as I tried playing this one on mouse and keyboard.

In fact the layla trilogy is so bad it makes this game feel like a kenway saga title even a ezio trilogy game despite how far from the truth that is. This is the last AC worth your time and money. (Perhaps mirage can change that) That being said it is flawed as shit. There is too much repetitive side content that often you do have to do in order to level your character enough in order to stand a chance against the enemies as it is a leveled based game and not a skill game. 
          On top of that you do want to it because the best gear in the game is locked behind these loyalty levels. At least youll get most of the stuff from city takeover but things like the best gun or the best cane sword is locked behind extremely tedious missions that most people arent going to do enough of in order to max out (Ned and Robert).
       Performance is debatable. While I am able to run the game on 4k ultra 60 fps with no real issues the temperatures do get pretty hot despite this game's age and graphical fidelity. I have also been getting lots of crashing that has no real tell. Some days ill get a few crashes. Other days ill crash every 20 minutes no consistency YMMV.
       The gameplay loop is not bad but becomes extremely stale on replays as it basically uses a similar loop to ghost recon wildlands a terrible ass title. The parkour is a bit weird as it looks like they were trying to keep the unity formula but made it even more sticky (kinda like the kenway games with the magnetism) so its not exactly the best but it is workable and you do have the grappel hook to help you minimize and do some decent assassinations. Combat isn amazing considering how long it takes to drop someone and its always not responsive but once you are maxed out its somewhat fun and bearable. Stealth is interesting like the combat it improves over unity in every single aspect ( not saying much tbh ) but it has some issues. 
         While stealth is now much more viable especially for Evie there are some serious issues. Like a guard triggering an alert despite the meter not being full but at least if you kill them fast enough you can sometimes prevent everyone from detection. You can also now headshot with throwing knifes which is a honest Godsend. 
     The story is far from amazing but its actually decent and much better paced than unity. This game does a lot of callbacks to the original AC that were stripped from unity and it honestly gives some good brownie points to this title. Jacob and Evie are both really fun and interesting protags that are essential foils to each other and have great charisma with the rest of the cast. Evie is easily the best female protag in the series ( Also quite possibly the most attractive character in the franchise) and is actually her own character unlike what they did with odyssey and valhalla.
         Crawford Starrick is like a superior Cesare Borgia they are both very similar in they way they act and operate but he at least is a true templar as he seeks control for the templar ideal unlike Cesare who was just power hungry like his father. He is very intimidating and its honestly fun to see his reaction to whatever the hell Jacob or Evie just did to undermine another piece of his operation. The boss fight was actually pretty cool too unlike the previous title. 
        This game basically took all the new ideas unity produced and refined them enough to be tolerated or enjoyed to some extent. It is certainly worth a run if you are a fan of the series just make sure to buy on a heavy sale and to go to for the gold edition if its cheap enough as the jack the ripper dlc is pretty interesting.
       Also put Evie in Elise's outfit and go for a parkour run you'll thank me later ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)",1668227659,1668227659,False,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

This one has a decent but not too convoluted storyline, in the wonderful setting of Victorian London, innit?

Oh how I miss planning my stealth activities, using various techniques at my disposal for clearing an area of guards one by one while remaining inconspicuous - something sadly too rare in the latest title Valhalla, where the focus is on going a-Viking, with your little hoard of hairy Norsemen (and women) rather than being, you know, an actual assassin.

This AC game is truly one of the greatest i've played and it is clear it is the swan song to the gamestyle they've held onto since the 1st game and it shows just how far it has come in it's years. With just 1 year between it and Unity this game blows all other pre-origins games out of the water it is by far the best, The story is meh and nearly really focuses on who Evie and Jacob are or how they're any part of the Assassin's order or anything like that but the gameplay itself carries the game. 
They remove alot of elements from Unity and it helps improve this game alot I think by not having openly cluttered menu's spreading across your screen for your inventory selection, The combat rinses every AC game to bits before the restyle. The elements of the start of the Rpg era and recognised within this game and it was a strong step forward had I played this game at the time of it's release. 
THE BUROUGHS!!! - Now this made me wanna play the game more than getting 100% Synchronisation of the game, I loved the gang wars and all the Associate activities the game throws at you and it's not too much per borough either but still took a reasonable amount of time which I accept. 
The Combat is the biggest overhaul for me with it's Batman esque style fighting style but more casual and simpler and less overwhelming with certain enemies requiring equipment for follow-ups. 
The Free-running is sort of the same as Unity but you can feel the tweaks from the past and it feels like an improvement and I personally loved the Launcher for climbing buildings because I hate climbing I think it is boring and if there is a faster way I will take it!
The bugs - Now I only came across 2 in all my hours of playing so ill not say anything too critical. So the first was the Launcher when I would use it from Roof to Roof - Jacob would just fall and die almost like he missed the rope XD. Anyway and the second bug was Free-climbing down from a roof onto the ground to go into combat and just being frozen in place still taking damage until dying, however this only happened once so I am okay with it.

Overall - Brilliant game, I missed out picking this one up on release solid 8/10 good overall improvements, Story is lacking but the side-activities make the game.

Remember in other Assassin Creed games whereby you had to conquer Templar installations to recover areas of a city? Like Templar towers in Brotherhood and Revelations? That makes a return in this game, except, it doesn't at the same time.

I'm at Sequence 8, and the only way to make progress is to conquer 3 boroughs in London. In order to do this, there are red activities that are directly related to Templars and defeating them. After conquering the opening borough of the game, no red activities appeared. I thought it was by design and I would only be able to conquer more boroughs later. Well, it isn't. I'm currently soft locked from making any progress in the game because none of the red activities in every borough is showing up. I have searched for answers and apparently it's quite a common bug, red activities not showing up. Sometimes synchronising with every point in the zone makes them pop up. Not for me, as someone who has synched with every point of the game. I have been all over the map and I cannot unlock these activities. There are no other prerequisites, especially considering how far in the game I've already gotten,

I'm soft locked and so many hours of my time is wasted because of it. They will not fix it because they can't, and the game is too old for them to give a shit.

Anyway, the Victorian setting is a really good one and it works well with the parkour gameplay. You get a hookshot, which is a lot of fun and takes away some of the tedium of climbing walls for 40 hours. 

There are some great sidequests as well: I really like the Charles Dickens quests. The main quests are decent, and I like that they made a point to give you multiple ways to finished a ""dungeon."" What was disappointing, however, is that much of the game is spent clearing out boroughs, much like you did in Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood. That's fun, but it does get old. The other thing that bothered me is that the ""final"" dungeon, where you finally assassinate the big bad guy, is EXTREMELY basic. Really simple. There aren't any optional things you can do in the ""dungeon,"" and contrasted to the very first one you do, it seems like the developers simply ran out of steam by that point. 

Great setting, improved gameplay over Assassin's Creed: Unity, fun dungeons, and definitely worth playing . . . but be warned that the game does ""peter out"" as it goes on.

Really liked the world/ atmosphere that they created, The world was a big open world located in the industrial revolution in London. I found the world to be a bit to stretched out although Ubisoft did find a solution to the big world, The grappling hook. I didn't really like the Idea of being able to just stand next to a building and be to instantly fly to the top. It really destroyed the Element of park-our, that was at its best in Unity. The story was OK, the main characters Jacob and Evie Frye where great characters. I really liked the way that each character had its own exclusive skills which meant that you could quite easily swap between play styles. The game play was fun although I did found it to be quite repetitive towards the end of the game.

Conclusion: The game is basically a downgraded version of Unity(in my opinion), If you liked Unity you will most likely like this game as well.

Only Ubisoft is capable of taking so many steps forwards and backwards simultaneously. After learning all the wrong lessons from Unity, they doubled down once again on stripping Assassin's Creed of everything that made it fun.

Parkour is much more similar to the simple climbing that will comprise the RPG titles to follow. There is no sense of momentum or finding interesting ways to traverse the map. All of Arno's flourish is gone from the animations. They give you the rope launcher to compensate but even sliding down a zip-line just feels slow and boring in this game.

Combat is easy and repetitive. Social stealth is all but gone completely. ""Leveling up"" is a concept that should never have made its way into these games.

The only saving grace of this AC installment is the Frye twins, who are actually decent protagonists, but Unity set the bar low with Arno. The overall story, however, is still kinda just nothing that goes nowhere. Another plot-line that gets poorly resolved in a comic book somewhere.",1665756229,1665768929,False,2,0,0.504797518253326416,0,True,False,False

Assassin's Creed® Syndicate is the sequel to AC Unity, this time we have the opportunity to wander the streets of London during the Industrial Revolution (1868) as the Frye twins. I will not describe the game segment that allows us to play a few simple missions in London during the First World War. Apart from the appearance of one historical figure, the only thing that differs from the basic gameplay is the slightly different appearance of the city, uniforms, etc. Nothing special.
[h1]The Plot[/h1]
Traditionally, London is the seat of the Templars and we as the twins must liberate the city. The game, although it has a fairly basic concept, gives a lot, showing us many historical characters, and the threads from the previous games are explored (mainly from AC Black Flag, AC 3 and AC Rogue). The main antagonist, although from the first point of view he seems to be a stereotypical villain with a curly mustache (because that's what he looks like), is actually a very well-written character, although I believe that there was not enough time to develop him. Which cannot be said about the rest of the characters. Apart from the main characters and the antagonist (and historical figures), the side characters are just ordinary droids, that are to be avoided or eliminated. But aside from that, the story is really simple, but also very solid, and I liked the character conflicts here as well.
[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
You can immediately see that Ubisoft had experimented a lot here. In addition to the typical activities from the series, we now have access to more modern equipment, such as to grappling hook , which, although slightly destroyed the element of climbing, It was not the end of the world. What is dumb however, is that Ubisoft insisted that the grappling hook has to be the central element of the game, the game often places invisible walls while climbing the roofs of buildings, which forces us to use the hook to move. Returning to the characters, Jacob and Eve have slightly different ways of gameplay, you can improve their basic skills and slightly change their equipment. Our main goal apart from the main plot and various side quests (often in which we use a carriage in chases, or solve puzzles in the Sherlock Holmes style) is to unite London under our own gang by performing sabotages and eventually confronting enemy gangs during big street fights (and our main base of operations is our own train that traverses all of London from station to station, which is really great, not only do we have something new and fun to use here, but it also allows us to appreciate the views of the city). Speaking of London itself, I think it is the best-recreated city in the history of the series, the amount of details, historically interesting places and details of the architecture of the period are amazing, just looking around is a pleasure. The city is full of life, factories are working at full speed, people pour out on the streets, they use carriages, ships and trains to travel around. But before we close this thread, let's talk about hand-to-hand combat, something that's the most different from previous games, and I personally don't like these changes. While in previous games (especially in Unity) hand-to-hand combat was fast and dynamic, and the weapon had a noticeable weight, here our blows feel like wet farts in the autumn wind. Some opponents have to be punched for so long that by doing the same, I could punch my fists faster through a solid wall. It looks too comical and you don't feel any weight.
[h1]Technical Matters[/h1]
Graphically it is beautiful, and the game, fortunately, despite its scale, does not tire the hardware and everything works stably. The music is very good as always and It fits with the historical period. Likewise, the voice actors did a very good job.
[h1]Summary[/h1]
It is a very good game that has unfortunately not been appreciated enough. Without a doubt, the best London in gaming history.

Well for starters, this game is made by Activision, the same fools that created the abomination known as ""Cyberpunk 2077."" The story is absolutely garbage as well. For the first half of the game, you play as James Gordon, a popular journalist in the Spiderman comics. You attempt to hunt down the Batman so that you can gain control over Gotham City. However, near the end of the game, it is revealed that you are the Batman. What?!?

This game had a slight bug with cloth physics where they rendered at 30 fps or less. Fixed this with a slight change to the AC.ini document, plenty of guides out there to fix this. I honestly enjoyed most of the game. It looks extremely good, a lot like Unity's graphics. Syndicate runs relatively well other than being a CPU hog like Unity. The two main characters were relatively interesting, I liked Jacob a decent bit more than Eevie. Syndicate reminds me a lot of Shadow of Mordor, mainly the combat and skill trees appearance. The return of the gang system was pretty nice, I really enjoyed it, but I wish they had more of a set up than just two of four missions and automatically there's thousands of rooks waiting to die for you. They started restricting freerun movement in this game, which was slightly annoying. Freerunning and getting stuck dead in your tracks is not enjoyable. The specification of bonus objectives during quests were heavily restricted. A double air assassination is not a ""double assassination"".Air assassinations are not stealthy anymore, ""climb on the same cart"" does not mean hang off the side, ""steal something while undetected"" no longer includes looting the corpse. Two of the main Templar members were genuinely sort of interesting characters. The final one was effectively a Disney character, I really liked him but I hated that every cutscene you view, it seems like he's singing. Both the main game and DLC fell for the classic AC blunder of a gimmick boss fight. As for the DLC, I really enjoyed the way it started, there was nice Art and very nice hud elements. The main problem was the crippling of possibilities, what kind of psycho killer gets desynced for killing innocents? The blood of the innocents is a requirement for my rituals. The Jack the Ripper DLC was a rollercoaster, it had such a beautiful start, relatively good cutscenes and missions.

Syndicate continues to evolve and solve issues that have either always been there (the ubiquitous camera issues of all games) or massively jumped in for the awful awful AC3 - a game so badly programmed and bug ridden that it was unplayable. ""Why do you want to get on that horse and escape, when I can *lock* you into a poorly programmed animation and make you run round and round in circles until you get murdered by the guards finally catching up to you... oh and on the final part of this very long mission without any checkpoints so you'll have to restart from the beginning for the 5th time"". 
No AC3 - in the bin you go again. (Note: This was not the remastered version... i've not played it, I'm not wasting more money on what should have been a free upgrade for how poor the original was - but alas no matter the bug fixing it wasn't going to solve that the antagonist was an unlikeable whiney idiot and how bad the story was... both in past and current stories, actually destroying the entirety of the current storyline from 1 and 2s). All in all a catastrophically bad game. 

So, what are the ups and downs of AC:S or Serial Killer Simulator 9 as it probably should be called.
Before we being we should take a minute to honour all those Victims:
All the innocent people on the streets viciously mow down by a high speed carriage/cart.
The guards mercilessly stabbed, beaten, shot, executed. 
The poor fight club victims you cause actual bodily harm to, causing life changing damage 
(Think Arkham series Batman - you know, those life changing injuries where he pile drivers poor thugs onto their neck while opining that he shouldn't kill... the ones where you whince and go ""he's never walking again"" - we are not convinced this is a good alternative.)

Well, as seems to be tradition with AC games, the antagonists are quite unlikeable, and there's a point you just want to throw them in the river and watch them drown, or just let a line of people line up and shoot them in the skull. It must be an American or something thing that this level of smug arrogance is acceptable and they think it's how people should act. Urgh... in the UK we like tearing strips off bankers like this - or we used to... now we're not allowed to protest, stuck on this island paradise. Is it believable that they'd have a whole gang behind them? No... because they have zero leadership skills. But alas, since Ezio we've not had a antagonist to get behind. 

The continuing interruptions to jump forward so we can watch... er... Not Desmond do something we don't care about continues, Thankfully these are all skippable... skip them, they're rubbish. 
All this nonsense needs to get in the bin. Nobody actually cares. Rubbish. People want to sneak around and stab people. Modern Commando's or Thief with some of the ol ultraviolence, with a good bit of story to tie it together. Sure top and tail it, but really this whole nonsense should be shipped out to a different game. I'd happily play AC: Modern, and run around modern London scaling the Gerkin and running over modern Londoners. I'd feel a lot less guilty about that as well.

The travel controls introduced in Unity are refined here, I felt like I had a hell of a lot more control, and the character did not at the first opportunity leap into a hiding spot from 50 yards away, which often occured when you're running like hell away from things and it's the last thing you wanted to happen. 

The continued micro-reality ""fan-servicing"" where you get to meet all the famous people of the time continues. This obviously works for a lot of stupid people going ""Oooo it's the thing"", but it does a massive disservice, so tacky. 

The collecting is back - which here isn't too bad... film on one screen this on another, collect away: it's crap and massively/falsely bloats the game time, but whereas in previous this became an annoyance, Syndicate seems to have got something fairly right here with everything appearing on the map. 

What is not alright is having to pay real money for certain maps which when you've paid a substantial amount for the game is obviously a disgraceful money grabbing exercise - urgh. DO NOT PAY - lots of guides exist online. 

Missions in the main are pretty good - most of them being ""Sneak here, murder this person"", almost like they've remembered you're meant to be an Assassin and the best way to do that is by being sneaky. There's a few points where it's saying ""do this"" and doesn't give you a marker until you restart the checkpoint... and oh ""checkpoints"" how I love you so... no more going all the way back to the beginning when things go wrong.

As with one of the grandest crimes of AC3 apart from being awful, this continues the trend of no tomb puzzles. However, this is much more integrated into general mission play - hence skipping amongst the rafters of Parliament before picking the guards off one by one.

No return of Pirate rubbish boating. Thank god... get in the bin.
No micromanagement of boats. 
No micromanagement of gangs.
Some crafting, but it's pretty basic and doesn't require grinding for crap. 
Keep It Simple rewards this game massively by not bloating on the awful inclusion of many rubbish parts of flash in the pan games. 

So, as long as you can get through the fact the two leads of a pair of unlikeable spanners... the game itself is so far peak AC. 

Will I get through the next three in time to watch Ubisoft fail to grasp that their games don't need to be a Soulslike? I doubt it, some dumb business person is going to look at Elden Ring and go ""Moneys!"" and not understand that that game is not what Assassin's Creed is about...

You don't see often that combination. Overall the Map and its content offer an outstanding atmosphere to the game but at the same time, creepy texture glitches and bugs (random infinite triangles appearing, crazy rotating bodies, everything appearing green! etc.) -crazy stuff- weaken the experience. 

The mechanics are good and typical for assasins creed, so nothing new exept the grapple hook. Which adds more variety to the game and opens new possibilities approaching the objective or even the targets.

The Graphics are very good for a 2015 title but there is no HDR on this one. Also pop up Textures and the glitches mentioned are dissapointing.

The Story is so linear and only certain missions are giving a unique flavour to the game hence the bad recommendation. While the Free roam time is good is very repetitive and brings minor joy to the player, nothing can overtake a good unexpected evolvement in the story with extraordinary missions. 

Buy on sale. Propably you want to skip the DLCs. Since the main game isn't that good, DLCs won't save the title.

I was initially scared off of Syndicate and Unity after their notoriously buggy launches. I was attracted back to Syndicate due to its setting, London, but I don't think revisiting older AC games are worth it after playing the newer releases. 

First of all, the controls feel ultra clunky. It makes you appreciate how streamlined the movement of your character in newer games really has become since the climbing up and down in Syndicate just feels downright frustrating. I found myself on numerous occasions wanting my character to descend from heights, yet the process to do so cumbersome and slow. The zipline addition was nice, but it didn't available every time you wanted to use it (no prompt to fire it would be given). The amount of times your character end up doing the opposite of want you wanted was simply too frequent. 

The setting felt exciting at first, but ultimately the playground of the open world felt empty. Some landmarks of London were fun to see, but it didn't take long for the lustre to wear off before the repetition of menial tasks along with bustle of the environments to set in. The Thames really stood out as a unique area, but a lot of London just felt like more of the same winding streets with the same people doing the same programmed things. There's really no incentive to explore or collect items which is the worst part. Helix collecting felt super pointless and the music boxes hunt offered some riddles as hints, but the incentives to do this were not there. The flowers and artwork collections were more interesting as they offered some interesting historical snapshots in time. The beer bottles were the biggest squandered collectable item. I was excited to read up on various beers on the period as I work in the brewing industry, but instead Ubisoft thought it would be funny to offer cynical tasting notes with no real purpose other than to lambaste beer. Felt like a wasted opportunity and a slap in the face to those who put in the effort to collect the bottles. Without real motivation to explore the map other than the story missions, London just gets boring to traverse. 

Carriages are offered as a major mode of transportation in this game. The carriage chases sound good in theory, but most of the time these chaotic events on the streets just devolved into irritating wild goose chases. Your carriage understandly cannot manoeuvre like a car, but heaven forbid if you need to reverse. One crash basically means your target escapes as it takes forever to recover your carriage. The AI often has rogue carriages randomly run you over if you're on foot, or worse, the NPC you're supposed to protect. Some glitches have carriages flying all over the place. I just wish driving a carriage was more fun than it actually was.

Trains are another major presence in the game, and your home base itself is a roving steam engine. You'd think they would have found a seamless way to disembark the train when you were ready to move on. Jumping from the train can sometimes lead to awkward results (or just plain death) when you're supposedly an agile assassin who can climb Big Ben with your bare hands.

Combat feels good in this game. You're able to combine your dodges, counters, and finishers smoothly most of the time. The finishers involving multiple opponents don't always trigger when you want them to, but the overall combat feels satisfying. Stealth also works reasonably well. You can generally sneak around and pick off enemies one-by-one without disruption, and even if your silent assassin attack is spoiled, at least the combat is enjoyable enough that it probably won't upset you too much. The game is also pretty forgiving when escaping. Unlike past iterations were your enemies would relentlessly pursue you and their numbers multiplying like crazy, this game allows escapes after reasonable distances ran or out of sight for a period of time.

The database of the game was a disappointment for me. Reading about various landmarks and historical events is something I usually enjoy from these games, but this one inserted an inexplicable need to be facetious commentary. Perhaps Ubisoft felt the need to have their writers inject humour into the readings to attract more players to pause and have a look, but things just felt snide and trite to the point that it felt condescending to the reader. It also was marked that the writings were quite opinionated and snarky. Rather than offer an authentic historical perspective, the writers are determined to insert their own brand of humour and viewpoints which detract from any information included.

Finally, the game almost feels a bit like a revisionist history. The game being split between a male and female protagonist is great. What's not great is the game weirdly has almost half of the enemies portrayed as women. A suspension of belief is required when considering that ratio of women as London gang member during that time period. Representation does not make sense when now you can murder almost as many women as men during gameplay. Yay equality? Seems like Ubisoft is catering to the interests of modern day social justice rather than portraying the reality of a historical era in an accurate manner. 

In the end, skip this entry, even on sale, and play some of the newer AC games (Origins and onward) instead. The controls of this game are jarring for players of the newer versions in the series of Assassins Creed. Furthermore, the setting of London really isn't as rewarding as one might expect as Ubisoft fails to provide interesting tasks to do within the world and squanders opportunities to provide immersion.

If I were to describe this, the game is like a hurricane. It begins exciting and slowly becomes a disaster until everything is fine when it all ends. That's how I felt when I was playing this game to completion, I was glad it was over so I can uninstall it.

The idea of playing a AC game set in the Victorian Era of London was exciting, I was interested in learning London's history on child labors, numerous slangs, iconic figures (Karl Marx was definitely the shining highlight), and of course how the story illustrates two Frye twins are able to secure numerous sectors against numerous Templars and Blighters.

My biggest complaint of the game was it felt really boring around Sequence 3 - Sequence 7. And only near at the game was when I did enjoy playing assassination missions, side quests, etc. Sequence 9 was good, but it was a damn shame that i couldn't play more of the WWI era because the missions felt comfortable and required foresight to play the 5 missions. Zeppelin Raid is a fun mode, although I wish it had more planes to shoot down. To end things off, if you're looking for run of the mill AC game. Buy it, the gameplay carries the charm of Syndicate because the hookshot enables so much mobility and freedom on navigating areas. Kind of like Halo: Infinite campaign, the gameplay carries Syndicate a lot. The story? Not so enjoyable, there just isn't enough hype around the key figures to assassinate aside from final boss and the mid game boss.

If you are familiar with other Ubisoft titles, then it would not come as a surprise that this is also a collectathon with a lot of side activities. That is all well and good, but the way that I have been playing through the game made it so that I collected what I could as soon as I could. That was a slog to get through, and I think I would have enjoyed it more had I collected as I played instead of just collecting. I really enjoy collecting things in games, so I fizzle out when there is this much collecting to do, and the one playthrough that I have done have taken years to complete. I play it, enjoy it and then burn out for a while and repeat until I finally completed the game and all its DLC today.

The gameplay is not that different to other Assassin’s Creed titles, so if you are familiar with those then it is quite likely that you will find this a familiar experience. I enjoyed it for the most part, but sometimes I had to fight with the controls to get it to do what I want it to.

I really liked Evie and Jacob as protagonists. They were charming and had their differences, but was a good team and I liked their personalities. With Henry as support it made for some good fun. The story is also good, for the most part. I did not care for the present-day stuff, but I imagine that I am not in the minority there and found it a bit annoying whenever it shifted back to it. I wanted to spend time with Evie and Jacob, not someone else.

The optional WW1 section was a nice surprise. There you play as Lydia, [spoiler]Jacob’s granddaughter[/spoiler], as you help root out spies and help Winston Churchill with the war effort. It was a nice brake from the main story and was short enough to not overstay its welcome. One thing that I would have changed about the story is that [spoiler]Lydia should have been the granddaughter of Evie and Henry instead since they end up together, and Lydia already look very similar to Evie,[/spoiler] but except for that there is little to complain about.",1662415865,1662415865,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I'd just spent 59 hours in Unity, so usually I wouldn't jump into another game with very similar gameplay.  I think the idea was just to see what the game was like, as I had been unimpressed with Unity.

Within just a few hours of playing Syndicate, I knew that I was already having much more fun than at any point in Unity.  And now I've just completed playing Syndicate after another 61 hours of assassin creed-ing this summer.

Syndicate was made by a coalition of Ubisoft's B-team developers lead by Ubisoft Quebec, but I think they created a much better game than Ubisoft's premiere studio Ubisoft Montreal.  I think more work and resources probably went into Unity, much of which was able to be reused for Syndicate, but I believe it's a much better game.

[h1]Changes to the AssCreed formula[/h1]
Syndicate is currently the last main-series game with an action/adventure design.  The next three games are action RPGs.  We learned just this week that the next game will be called Assassin's Creed Mirage and returns to action/adventure.  Syndicate plays mostly the same as previous games, so I understand why the next game, Origins, changed up the formula in a big way.  Syndicate is just an evolution of the formula, but at least it does a lot more than Unity's stripped down gameplay.

Syndicate features a simplified version of the ""freeflow"" combat system from Batman: Arkham Asylum.  This combat system was incredibly popular for action/adventure games in the early-mid 2000s, so it's impressive that Assassin's Creed held out for six games before using it.  It's very easy, with at least 3 seconds to counter attacks and enemies very, very rarely attack more than one at a time.  There aren't many benefits to high combos and weaving in gadgets is limited.  In my opinion, this version of freeflow combat is too simplified to create the sense of joy from playing it well that I have felt in many other games, like Mad Max and Shadow of Mordor/War.

The other big change in Syndicate is addition of fast and effective traversal options.  Horse-drawn carriages can be driven and raced and there are some combat mechanics.  Ubisoft decided to allow us to freely run over civilians without causing the classic warning: ""This ancestor did not kill civilians.""  Having to avoiding people would make driving carriages less fun.

The rope launcher is a huge deal.  It's totally unrealistic but so fun.  Once I got it, I never longer manually climbed up the side of buildings like I have in so many Assassin's Creed games.  It also has a large horizontal range for crossing the huge gaps in the city layout from the roads that are much larger than in other AC cities for carriages.  The game's design elements come together well.

[h1]Story & characters[/h1]
As with Unity, the story is that you are an unknown individual experiencing genetic memories to find something for the Assassins.  In Unity it was the identity of a Sage, and now it's the location of a Piece of Eden known to be somewhere in London.  Unity barely had any interaction with the ""real world"" story, and Syndicate has even less!

Having a video game with two freely-changeable main characters is an idea that I think is genuinely innovative.  They should have both been males, but Ubisoft took the opportunity to have it both ways and also appease the people that think a female character should be portrayed doing the feats of speed, strength, and brutality that are done in these Assassin's Creed games.

Audiences are now so desensitized by impossible portrayals of women's comparative physical capabilities in big budget entertainment that it's got to the point where they can get away with this without alienating most gamers.  But I dare anyone to play the brawls with Evie, where the animations show her in a tank top, throwing around 250 pound muscled men like sacks of straw (her brother Jacob shares some animations), and not pee yourself laughing at how absurd it looks.

Another problem with a female character in an action game is the ideological expectations that comes along with it.  She has to be as good as, or better, than the men.  At no point can she be shown as less capable or unsuited to the task.  As a result, Evie is little miss perfect, who belittles her brother in almost every interaction they have.  I though Jacob was actually a pretty cool character, but Ubisoft's writers never let me enjoy him by constantly having Evie complaining or insulting him.  The only reason Jacob's actions had bad secondary consequences, while Evie's didn't, is because the writers wanted it that way.

In the end, the writers dunked on Evie by putting her into a romance with the completely unimpressive and lame Indian assassin, Henry Green.  Evie is way more manly than he is.  It happens at the literal end of the game, so the writers never have to show how the heck this relationship could possibly work.

If she constantly berated the very competent & masculine Jacob, imagine how bad wimpy Mr. Green is going to get it!

[h1]Let's cut this short[/h1]
This is getting too long, so I'll skip some stuff I made notes about, like the equipment system having the same problem as Unity: most of it goes unused.  I'll end with one more comparison to my experience playing Unity in July.  While Unity is the literal worst-performing game I've ever un on this PC, Syndicate was a freaking joy to play.  It ran mostly at 60fps at 2954x1662 (77% of 4K with Nvidia Image Scaling) with my outdated GTX 1080.  The game looks gorgeous at all times.  The ground textures, with the individual bricks and puddles and reflections, were so impressive.

Okay, I'll say one last thing: screw the Karl Marx missions.  He was not a kind old man walking the streets organizing The Workers© and dissuading violent anarchists.  That's total revisionism and I reject the attempt at propaganda.",1660502293,1662340597,True,2,0,0.486783474683761597,0,True,False,False

Its the closest thing we're going to get to an AC in the modern day with driving carriages basically like driving cars, and with automatic firearms at the end of the game. Also they returned to AC2's combat system which was neat, and like all the other games it looks good visually.

However, it retains its leveled enemies structure defeating the point of an open world map. And also there is only one singular map, meaning AC3, 4 and Rouge where bigger in map size than this one. Unlike the other installments there isn't a 'bigger picture' for this game. You're not fighting in a crusade, assassinating a pope, fighting in the american revolution, you're just fighting a generic a-historical industrial revolution capitalist. The plot boils down to a template for all post black flag AC games. Kill the antagonists underlings, and then kill the antagonist while he has an eldar artifact. There is nothing unique about this game's story. Also there are no parkour segments. You are given a grappling hook which allows you to instantly scale buildings defeating one of the key aspects of an AC game.

It's a good game worth playing, but not a good Assassin's Creed. Gameplay maintained the AC style, but there was no brotherhood bonds, codex, CREED. If it wasn't meant to be an AC game, then I'd say that the story was good. I fell in love with the Frye twins and enjoyed the character of Maxwell Roth. The new combat system felt refreshing and It's a first AC game that I finished on 100% synch. The gang wars were fun and the final missions of the game actually required some stealth and had me feeling like ""I am an assassin doing assassin stuff."" Lot of people like to compare Syndicate to Unity and I understand them. Unity still feels surperior in some ways, becouse there is so much Syndicate could've been. Coop that unity had,  some gang wars version of the old ac manhunts, multiplayer carriage racing. The choice of keeping Syndicate a singleplayer experience was a big mistake on Ubisoft's behalf. Even if you wouldn't like the story, coop could've brought people in to have fun together, which is exactly what Unity did and why is it still played today, even tho it had a rocky path.

I overall enjoyed playing it, but this game does not offer much for me to return and replay it.

The games pretty fun, you can run around assassinating people, liberate London, and you get grappling hook.
There are some bugs tho but you can hardly notice them so it doesn't really matter

The game feels like a downgrade from Unity. They took out everything great about Unity, the immersive environment, character customization, the murder mysteries, engaging side stories (there are some in Syndicate but they aren't as good), and a somewhat engaging story arc for the heroes of the game.

You don't feel as immersed in the Victorian setting. Both the protagonists and the antagonists feel very bland, and leave you with an overwhelming ""meh."" The ""charm"" of the Frye twins wears off fast since the main story feels diluted.

The WW1 side mission line isn't very engaging from my experience, but it was a good addition to the game!

The depiction of gang warfare and the bad guys as ""a rival gang"" is comical. It's like they were voiced by the same people behind LoTR's orcs and goblins. Some classic lines include:
- ""You killed my friends, now I will kill you!""
- ""I'll spill your guts!""
- and general grunting.

Now for the DLCs:

Jack The Ripper DLC however was quite enjoyable, it presents a more serious tone, there's a slight sense of mystery about Jack's Identity, the Fear Takedowns are excellent, and being able to play as Jack the Ripper was slightly unsettling cuz I don't want to control a serial killer but it presented some good moments of the narrative. Jacob and Evie are also a lot older and wiser and not clowns anymore which was great. The Sherlock Holmes Series-styled investigation sequences were also well made.

The Last Maharaja DLC is just terrible with the dumbest AI and some of the most terrible mission designs in the game.

The Dreadful Crimes is the 3rd and final DLC for the game and IS NOT included in the season pass. This DLC goes further into the Sherlock-type Investigations and TBH they are really interesting, it's nice overall but the fact that it isn't in the season pass is still quite bad.

The only way I can recommend this game is either you are a hardcore fan of this franchise like me or you want to have a virtual tour of London during the Victorian era.",1659368767,1660345775,True,8,1,0.588374316692352295,0,True,False,False

 Set in 19th century's London, you follow the Frye twins in their quest to end Templar domination. Having the chance to play as both Evie and Jacob was an incredibly innovative choice for the franchise that I welcomed with open arms. Both are different yet capable assassins and the customisation offers a wide variety of improvements, such as different weapons, skill sets and outfits. My favourite was the inclusion of Ezio's legendary robes. 
 The story is charming and fun and as a twin myself I can guarantee that the characterisation and relationships were marvellously achieved. The addition of a story set in World War I and the last couple of interactions with the Queen were also interesting and nice details.
 There are some bugs here and there that can be certainly annoying, but they usually don't interfere with the gameplay. The mechanics, stealth, combat and parkour were just what one can expect from a great Assassin's Creed installment. A gameplay system that is missed by many who have played the newest games.
 All in all, I'd say this was an enjoyable experience, with low difficulty and a fun set of characters and missions. It is not up to level of some of its tremendously grandiose predecessors, but it is quite a nice option for those who have already played them and want to expand their collection and continue to enjoy a game faithful to the saga's beginnings.",1658973055,1658973055,True,8,2,0.616749465465545654,0,True,False,False

The story line keeps you invested and the missions have a decent balance so it doesn't get boring and you don't feel you're doing the same type of missions over and over again. 

Is the game hard? Like all AC games, it depends on your play style, if you want to be a true assassin and be stealthy all the way through, then yes it can be a bit tricky and maybe test your patience, but if you're like me and not overly fussed if you get caught and fight your way through (unless a mission specifically asks you to be stealthy) then no, I wouldn't say its hard. As all AC games, it doesn't offer a difficulty mode, difficulty is simply based on level of yourself and the mission itself. 

Do I have any issues? Yes, but only one. I did find the controls rather clunky and annoying sometimes, mostly with climbing up and down objects which resulted in Jacob and Evie not either jumping when you wanted them too or not letting go/climbing down smoothly. Did this stop me enjoying the game? Nope.

Story is mediocre but serves its purpose in giving you a reason to beat up some Templars, and speaking of beating up Templars, the combat is serviceable and fun for the first few hours but gets pretty old, pretty quick. However stealth is great, many different ways to approach an encounter and has some decent AI as well. Parkour is good but isn't as relevant because of the grapple hook added to the game, which is fun but ultimately forces parkour to take the backseat. So if combat is decent, parkour is decent, and story is mediocre, what makes this game stand out? Well in my opinion, it's the world. The world has INCREDIBLE atmosphere and I rarely hear people talking about it.  Seeing all the horse carriages and factories emitting large clouds of smoke into the sky is so well done. Patrolling London at night has a sense of unpredictability and can feel quite dangerous. If there is one thing I am a sucker for in games, its the atmosphere, it adds to the immersion greatly and being immersed in a world is the main reason why I play so much single player games (and why I love the witcher 3, rdr2, and the ac series so much). You may not share my passion for the world in this game, but you should defiantly give it a try because I think it's the most underrated world in an AC game. But apart from that, it's just more AC with a few tweaks here and there.

As always, Fk the sci-fi element off! As for the story set in Victorian London, yeah, it works. Twin brother and sister working together as assassins... that's about all you need to know. I mean, like Unity this one looks stunning and is very cinematic, but nothing overly interesting in regards to the story. Just more of the same. Speaking of which, the game-play... more... of... the same. I don't know what to add, other than it's all running, climbing, counter-combat, map clutter exploration, sync ya view! Which will lead me to one criticism I have over these later titles. Unless the mission demands it, there really seems to be no penalty to breaking stealth and combat is very easy. Once you're used to it, the game-play offers very little challenge. To sum it all up, it is everything you would expect in a AC game for the 9th time. *sigh*

This whole saga I have been through with this series has left me extremely drained. I do not know how anyone could have gotten excited after so many games tho pretty much cover the same ground.

As you raised to be an assassin its up to you to clean the streets from “higher” class and give freedom for everyone else. 
The gameplay jumps around two amazing characters with their strengths and weaknesses. You can chose how to play the game as both characters are well suited for every job. Dynamic duo keeps gameplay fresh on many perspective. 
Exploring authentic London was a pleasure for my eyes. Traversal through out all city is easy enough with Victorian vehicle types. If you up for more par core jumping its always the option to jump on rooftops of the buildings. Getting faster from crowded places helps your trusty grapple hook+zip line. This contraption made the game ten times more fun. You literally felt like you are spider man from back of past century.

For me, Syndicate is more than a game. Back in 2016, a year after the game was released, I got the cracked version (before I realize cracked hurt the industry) and I was so excited to play it but my laptop was a junk it couldn't run it even on low settings. I remember the first mission where [spoiler] Jacob is at the factory and you need to get to the door on the next side[/spoiler] and it lagged so much I couldn't move. I felt bad, closed the game and totally forgot about it till a year ago when I saw it on steam. I added to my wishlist and every now and then I'd think of buying it and then I spend the money somewhere else till last summer sale when I finally got it.
The moment when I start playing and I see Jacob at the factory. That was enough for me ❤️️

So if this helps anyone instead of google results, here you go. Game is one of my favorites and I shall list some pluses for it and minuses that may be more minor!

Pluses:
- Got the game on sale with season pass so definitely worth it, have not seen any bugs ""yet"", as I said.
- The feel of London is priceless and I love it with the tone.
- Assassins creed story and not rpg for once back then
- Open-world 
- Good for 1060s and up easily for graphics cards, ram I have is 16gb and game is flawless at very high to max graphics

Minuses:
- Having to reinstall the game after verifying which I think is steams fault, but who knows its ubisofts disgusting creation at times.
- A little clonky at times how story goes, but still worth playing one time and everything gained
- Do not buy at full price as game is over 8 years old almost, wait for the sale as inteded!

-Not much to say about minuses, but I will say it is worth playing as an older assassins creed fan, there is some iffy stuff about ubisoft, but trying this out for a playthrough is not a bad as people put it. Good day m8!

Unlike AC: Unity, little effort was made to iron things out after release and it shows. It's actually strange to think this game released when it did because somehow the controls feel significantly worse than previous games. Pair that with the lack of optimization and frequent bugs and it starts to feel like you're swimming upstream. If poor performance is not something you're willing to tolerate, you probably won't make it through the main story.

And another thing: not that any of these games are difficult except maybe the later ones, but by God is this game easy. So much so that stealth is optional (e.g. you can single-handedly rob the Bank of England by just fighting all the guards at once). The only element of challenge comes from the poor controls which really just accentuates how poor they are.

With all that in mind, I can't help but appreciate what the game [i] does [/i] have to offer. The cityscape overall is very impressive, and there are some cool new ideas that work well here: I loved hearing trains and steamboats trudging through the city, simultaneously enhancing atmosphere and providing an immersive alternative to fast travel. The ability to switch protagonists GTA V style, and the implementation of drivable carriages (Grand Theft Pony style) are both pretty great. Having multiple ways to go about assassin missions feels almost like a simplified Hitman game and is another welcome change. It's really just a nicely crafted world and among it all, there's plenty to do and see. Activities like: a day in the life of Jack the Ripper, beating people to death with Charles Dickens' cane, and saving children from harsh labor factories then telling them they work for me now. I'm making it seem slightly more awesome than it is, but yeah... that actually about sums it up.

When it's all said and done, an open world game set in Victorian London is a lot to promise, and the potential here far exceeded the final product. If I'm gonna revisit any Assassin's Creed game, this is probably last on the list. Still, I can't help but cut it some slack as the game world is highly detailed. It's gritty, industrial mood is pretty much what I had hoped it would be.

The combat feels clunky and button mashing is here in full-force. Bullet sponge enemies are numerous and they are sometimes unfairly overpowered, hitting you without you even having the time to react. The leveling feels just like a chore and the player customization feels very lackluster when you compare it to the system in Unity.

Even AC Unity wasn't as buggy and unstable at launch (for me) as this one is which baffles me considering it came one year after Unity and it's been almost 7 years since the release.

With that being said, I like it very much and I still can recommend it, IF, you are a AC fan and don't mind the cookie cutter content included in the modern AC Formula. The characters are quirky and funny which feels out of place (in a good way) considering it's a AC game. The main characters are cool and the story (thus far) seems fine.

1868 London, right, featuring this creature that somehow has not been bullied into being part of half of the t r a n n y reality statistic.

Even besides this s h i t, I cannot, I tried, but I cannot get into this game. It's so shallow and unenjoyable, missing or has dumbed down features from previous games where everything was perfectly right (such as combat, parkour and free movement in general).

Most of the gameplay loop seems to be going through a checklist of objectives on the map that have none or very little depth, world building or anything worthwhile in them. For comparison, in the first Assassin's Creed game, although the missions also repeated in their main goals, but most of them gave more context towards your current greater objective, which is interesting. Here, as far as I have heard so far, some enemy characters in a mission might talk or hint towards why they are in this place and what they are doing, but ultimately nothing of interest and longer lasting and it is likely so for most of the missions. 

The combat is just a button mashing simulator. The fact they have added RPG mechanics to the combat is ruining the combat, because the enemies are damage sponges. It's a night and day difference in the joy of the combat from the first game and this. You can still insta-kill enemies in stealth at least.

I played only as little as I did at the time of writing, but I can hardly imagine this is going to get any better and I don't know if I will return to find out. Some reviews said the characters and story are good. I don't know about the story, having played so little, but so far it's not very engaging and the characters... nah. The only good thing the characters have is that Evie Frye is one of the prettiest female characters in gaming (worth mentioning today merely because it's turning into a trend in modern """"""triple-A"""""" game development to make disgusting foul creatures to pass for women), that's about it, but her, her brother's and everyone else's personality are like part of a [i]'mandatory checklist of characters to be included in your """"""triple-A"""""" game'[/i] and are just a bunch of people trying to be very cool and [i]""haha I'm a  fungi (fun guy), get it?""[/i] and [i]""haha here's a very witty comeback to your jest! Thou have been engulfed by flames by my recovery!""[/i] and the [i]""haha geeky smart characters, very clumsy!""[/i]. All these tropes are not necessarily bad to do, but when every single character feels like they are made to fill a checklist, all their performances are naturally hardly bearable in most cases. The characters have different names, looks, backgrounds, but yet in the end they are all the same and have been seen a million times over and hardly any of them memorable. Arguably, with so many characters created through all sorts of mediums, it's hard to create compelling characters – fair enough, but it feels like no one even tried or they merely did ""just enough"". I have just never felt in any other game so far to make such a comparison, that the characters feel merely like entries in a list.

[h1]It's a modern Ubisoft ""muh BIG oPeN wOrLd"" copy-pasta.[/h1]
How low they have fallen from their peak, from making innovations, new leaps, crossed boundaries and did it all authentically with pretty much every one of their games up until perhaps 2008, maybe even 2013 if we think about Black Flag, probably their last good Assassin's Creed game (although it should not have been named so and only was because of marketing purposes, I am sure. This has constrained the game in its own ways and had to follow certain rules of a certain franchise of theirs), and maybe 2015 with Siege, until it was ruined by appealing to e-spermers, funny weapon and character skin maniacs and hell knows what other creatures.

Haha! I love this game. It's also considered the last ""classic style"" AC game. Let's talk about the parkour. It's nowhere near as complex as in AC: Unity, even though it uses the same system. A lot of Unity's stylish animations were removed, and freedom of movement was also removed, such as allowing ""dangerous jumps"" to be performed. As in, jumping from heights that would kill you, but being able to save yourself by performing a manual ledge grab / breakfall. It's understandable that Victorian London's architecture and style doesn't allow for parkour as complex and satisfying as Paris. The buildings and streets are simply too spaced out. Yes, I live in UK, and yes, I used to do parkour as a kid. It was hard to find decent spots that weren't busy, corporate property where you'd likely get kicked out of LOL! xD For that, AC: Syndicate's solution was the Hidden Blade's latest attachment, the grappling hook, acting as a climbing tool or zip-line to get from point A to point B as fast as possible. It feels very satisfying to use, it looks cool, it fits the Steampunk vibe, but at the same time, it kinda removes the need for classic parkour. I enjoy the faster-paced combat and animation diversity. The combos, the multi-kill system, etc... with unique weapons such as deadly canes, kukris and brass-knuckles. Anyone complaining about having to hit an enemy 50 times before they die... do me a favour and buy yourself some higher quality gear, will you? And some perks that focus on bringing enemies down to ""Near-Death State"" quicker. It literally takes 1 or 2 hits to kill an enemy in hand-to-hand combat if you know the game's mechanics and progression system. And you can even insta-kill enemies with your first strike if the right conditions are met, taking down an entire group of enemies in seconds. Come on, people... first you complained that the classic, older AC games were too simple and repetitive, and the counter-kill system made everything too easy and automatic... 

Now, AC Syndicate's stealth and NPC AI works much better than Unity's. In Unity, the tools (smoke bombs, etc..) were your solution to everything. And I'm not complaining. It felt amazing. But in Syndicate, everything just feels snappier. I like the improvements a lot. I think the gameplay is one of the best things about Syndicate. Manually and silently aiming throwing knives at enemies' heads feels good. Zip-line assassinations bring a whole new dynamic to the gameplay and creativity of tackling a stealth situation. Kidnapping is introduced as both a stealth mechanic and mission objective. The former allows for any enemy not aware of Jacob/Evie, to be kidnapped and used as a form of social blending, allowing access to restricted areas. Whistling is back, and it's very useful. There's different methods of transportation (GTA-style) like horse-drawn carriages with a lot of variety in terms of size, durability, speed and control, which you can ram into other carriages to cause mayhem and destruction or hop onto the roof of your carriage to shoot your enemies, or to jump onto another enemy's carriage and hijack it. There's better side activities which aren't just you going around stealing items / killing dudes. The Murder Mysteries are genius work! They're much more complex and dynamic than AC Unity's, with new mechanics such as tracing the trajectory of a projectile that killed the victim back to its original, potential location, only to find a firearm hidden nearby, etc.. That sort of thing. There's gang allies that you can recruit and call for help, which is reminiscent of the early Ezio AC games, there's a bigger presence of kids than in any other AC game, so the world feels a bit more alive and believable, and whoever thought to make your hideout on a moving train that goes around the city is a genius. It feels so good to return there in between missions, collect income, etc.. and see your twin (which makes comments on your attire and weapons) as well as other side characters chilling about. So cozy.

Let's talk a bit about the narrative. The modern day. What's Abstergo up to this time?

In 2015, Bishop contacts the Helix Initiate to help herself and fellow Assassins Shaun Hastings and Rebecca Crane locate a Piece of Eden, apparently hidden in a vault, somewhere in London. Through camera drones, the Initiate watches the pair of Assassins conduct their field work and download the memories of the twins Jacob and Evie Frye. The artefact is The Shroud, actually teased back in AC2 (The truth puzzles, I believe) the very same piece of cloth that ""resurrected"" Jesus Christ. Cool lore. Abstergo plans to find it. Instead of cloning a member of the First Civilisation like they planned to in AC Unity, they intend to recreate one from scratch using the Shroud's cellular level healing ability inside their secret laboratories. Very disturbing, but very interesting. The Assassins must stop them before it's too late, because Juno is still out there after Desmond set her free back in 2012. Collect Helix Glitches in game and you will unlock new Present Day Assassin Intel and backstories related to The Shroud, that date back to the Italian Renaissance and the Auditore Villa. Nice throwbacks :) The present-day story, even though there's no gameplay unfortunately, is still pretty great. The action sequences during pre-rendered cutscenes are badass and very high quality, using the full CGI character models, and it's nice to see familiar faces such as Shaun and Rebecca reminiscing about Desmond and how they miss him. Real fan service. Master Assassin Galina Voronina also makes an appearance (she is known from the AC comic books) and helps them take the fight to the Templars, even saving their lives from Otso Berg's elite Sigma Team. Again, very, very badass, especially the end cinematic with that music.

The game has the player take on the role of an Initiate, same as in Unity, as they explore the story of the twin Assassin protagonists, Jacob and Evie Frye, both of whom are playable at any time during the open world exploration and side missions, but they both have their own unique missions too during the main story. Jacob, a brash and charismatic lad searching for glory and the spilling of Templar blood, much like a younger Ezio, and Evie, a smart, beautiful, by-the-book sort of lass who likes to apply knowledge and a more tactical approach to her mission assignments. There is a nice dynamic between the two, typical of twins, with Jacob getting slightly more screen time during main missions as he's the one that gets to cut down Templar after Templar in the best ""black-box"" style Assassin's Creed mission structures yet! While Evie searches for a Piece of Eden and cleans up after Jacob.. xD The two arrive in London in 1868, as the Industrial Revolution reaches its climax, bringing its lot of inequality and poverty in a city controlled by the Templars and Grandmaster Crawford Starrick, which is a very likeable antagonist, in my opinion. To stop their rule, the Fryes will take over the organised crime in an effort to gather an army, called The Rooks by Jacob, and free London while helping the working folk, such as eliminating forced child labour and liberating London's boroughs. The game can be pretty light-hearted at times, with Jacob making sarcastic comments in every sentence and Evie calling him out for being immature. I love it, and it was much needed, especially after Unity's rather tragic love story / Shakespearean-play kind of ending. I recommend!

Jack the Ripper DLC is excellent. A must play! A disturbing, almost horror-like, cinematic experience set 20 years after the main game. The Last Maharajah DLC is an abomination, though. While interesting in concept, it's extremely buggy and ""low-budget""..",1655645215,1656289260,True,17,0,0.686268270015716553,0,True,False,False

If you have played any Assassin's Creed titles before this, you more or less know what to expect. As is to be expected, the historical elements of Syndicate are exceptional; London is a lively and extraordinarily crafted location, and the addition of the zip-line is a necessity and expands on the parkour system. Jacob and Evie are nice leads; I personally like Evie a lot more, but Jacob (despite catching flack from the community) is a really charismatic lead. His naivety is frustrating at times, but that is his character! Evie is the one who is able to hold him accountable. A lot of the collectibles can feel like they are not worth it, and by the end of the game I had maxed out my levels and gotten the best gear possible, so doing the extra missions and leftover content did not feel worthwhile. The Jack the Ripper DLC has been cool so far—I am invested in the story and want to see how it ends.

As to the problems? The game is buggy, not ridiculously but enough that you’ll notice it, I fell through the ground at one point and another time when skipping a mission cutscene the game wouldn’t stop resetting the same cutscene, it wasn’t until I watched it when this stopped.

The game can also be a grind fest, the main missions don’t get affected by this, but the side content does; the side missions are fairly samey and the game is bloated, completely loaded with content to the point where I think most people would never even contemplate even coming close to finish the game 100% let alone getting the actual thing. There are upgrades, different weapons and skills but they all hinge on you getting different types of currency and materials, some of which can be very annoying to obtain. The big problem with this is also the reason as to why is it there, it’s not here because Ubisoft bad design choices but instead, because they want to ram other kinds of monetization down the players throat, mitrotranactions and the like.

Beyond that though, I am recommending it because of the story and main missions, the game is fun, just a bit buggy and a bit scummy with its monetization practices, these problems will mainly just affect you if you play through the side content though, so there’s that.

Quite honestly when I first started playing the game, at the beginning I though damn this AC is gonna be so boring, but luckily I decided to not give up on the game yet and boy was I glad that I did that. I was so happy that my original feeling was wrong and the game just feels better and better as you play it and even the characters who I though I would hate a lot started to impress me and I got attached to them, which is one more good thing in a game in general. The story is not the best there ever was, but it is good with a lot of interesting historic characters that existed in the real world (not gonna spoil it, don't worry). Sure some side-missions feel like pain, but I actually did all of them except the collectibles which I will leave for another time. The world in this game is something that simply amazed me as it is so large, diverse, tall and very enjoyable. London is simply amazing in this game. The one thing that I absolutely HATED in this game is that you could (spoiler alert) use real money in it and buy certain skills in the game, but overall a decent Assassin's Creed game that might not be even close to the original 4 parts but it is worth picking up. In the end try getting it on a sale as it would be a steal then because it usually goes for around 10 euros which is a great price for this game.",1652533518,1652533644,True,5,0,0.572259068489074707,0,True,False,False

The highlight of this game is the grappling hook and how hilariously mismatched the game's ""Template Situations"" can be to the story. Every character and NPC, and even the player character, will activate their generic response no matter the situation. Helping a drunk friend home? Well, that uses the Kidnap mechanic to escort him, so you have to whisper a death threat to him out of nowhere. Just murdered a crowd of Blighters with a gang member? He'll yell at you for robbing the corpses that he just helped you make.
The game also lacks extremely basic, simple, easy-to-implement Quality of Life. You can only place one map marker, and it's extremely finnicky to place on a landmark and feels shoddy overall. If you fast travel after marking a spot, it just completely removes it. Whistling while hanging off a dock will lure an enemy who walks over and immediately falls off and dies of their own accord. An entire boss sequence can be skipped by shooting them repeatedly. Duleep Singh can softlock the game on several occasions. Despite the game only being from 2015, all online services are discontinued. The Gold Edition includes all DLC, except it doesn't, because one DLC is just missing because they feel like it. The reward for finding 32 music boxes scattered around the city with no indicators is an ugly white dress with mediocre effects for Evie. The reward for finding only 20 bottles, which you can buy a map for, gives you the best belt in the game for Jacob.
Evie's voice acting is about as energetic as a dead turtle, and her entire personality is ""Do-gooder"" with the occasional uncharacteristic sarcasm thrown in out of nowhere.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.

When i play a new AC i usually set this game as an expectation which could be a off since this game isn't really like any other AC i mean it has the parkour it has the stealth but it also has Area capturing like Just Cause 3 which i really liked because it means you can do other stuff besides main story and side missions. i'm going to list a couple of things i did and didn't like about Syndicate

Donts:

-Side Content, I didn't really get a chance to do side content but thats because i didnt see myself doing it, i saw it more a way to level up your loyalty with certain people there were interesting side mission like the World War I mission where you shoot down incoming planes or missions for the queen after you beat the game but i really wasn't interested in the side content of Syndicate

-Bounty Hunt, Bounty hunt was a real lowpoint for me, if you failed to it stealthy you get chased by 3 to 6 carriages even if the guy you're transporting is dead you get tons of enemies after you which i kinda get because they want there boss back but sometimes i got carriages after me even if i did it stealthy but i forgot to kill everyone 

-Ending, SPOILER ALERT i will be talking about the ending in this section and how i didnt really get it or like it. So it ends pretty poorly the whole time you're busy finding this ""shroud"" and in the end you dont even get it at least in unity you get the sword of eden but here someone gets fucking shot and thats it. The boss fight with starrick is a meh for me it just involves dodging some walls of idk electricity and fighting starrick with the pretty simple combat.

-Combat, So the combat isn't something i really dislike but it could've been better it has this combo meter but you only use left click so whats the combo? It comes down to enemy angry you attack enemy, enemy dead, There are some brutal finishers which are pretty cool and overall it can be satisfying if you use the kukuri (Knife, Just a big Crooked Knife) but there are other weapons like a stick with an hidden scythe and sword but i didn't feel as satisfying as the knife there are also brass knuckles but it just feels like hitting someone with your bare fists 

Likes:

-London, Victorian London has been presented really well showing poverty, child labor and that anyone would do something just to earn a penny. You can see really well where areas are poor and which areas are rich. Monuments and iconic buildings look beautifull such as westminster castle, Big ben just westminster itself looks really pretty.

-Main Story Missions, Unlike unity AC syndicate had pretty good story mission of course you had the ""go kill this fellow"" missions but they weren't as frequent as in unity which i really enjoyed they also seemed to fit really well with the story itself, if you're playing mission with evie it most likely had to do with the piece of eden whilst mission with jacob were more chaotic and less stealthy so you could really pick a side.

-Characters, Jacob and Evie Frye are in my opinion really likeable characters one is trying to rile up a gang to save london from the blighters and templars whilst the other is focusing on the mission to find the piece of eden, it feels like the actions jacob and evie frye do really impact the story for example jacob assassinates one of londons very important bankers almost crashing the economy, its pretty simple to see what kind of people jacob and evie, overal there is nice character development like evie falling in love and jacob becoming les chaotic. There also side characters like Charles Darwin, Charles Dickens and The Queen which are really nice to see even though they dont stick that long and after 2-3 Missions dissapear

-Stealth, this game has really good stealth, The Whistling is a nice feature to lure enemies instead of waiting for them to see you like in unity.

Overall i really like Assassin's Creed Syndicate it has a good story, good characters and a good enviroment",1646127951,1646128244,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

LONDON is just glorious and comes alive in a lot of ways. I'm still marveled by the trains that never stop running. And that you can plop yourself on top of one and get a jolly ride with a view. Fortunately, I experienced zero bugs. The graphics were a hoot with some really beautiful lighting at dawn and dusk. And I keep thinking, why do I need an entire map of Greece when I can have ONE well laid-out city with a lot of hidden surprises and monuments to explore. 

AC:Syndicate really harkens back to what I call the controlled independence. You still can go everywhere and start certain quests at random, but there's no way to ""fail"" a quest. The Animus kicks you out and puts you back to the last checkpoint. There are no choices to make, only a illusion of them. Well you can choose how you want to approach an assassination, but that's about it. 

At this point, the present-day story is pretty much a dud and is just there because I think Ubisoft doesn't think it can throw it away entirely. What started out as a nice framing device with Desmond is now in a rubble. I was hoping something interesting might happen at the end but to no avail. All in all, get it if you really miss the Assassin's Creed of yore.

Both can use any weapons and brawl in fight clubs (I sincerely doubt a woman would be allowed to fight in a boxing match back in the 19th century, but hey, screw real history, right?).
On one hand, immersive weapons: brass knuckles, walking canes, kukri (exotic, but still bih knives), pistols. I mean, someone would look awkward walking around 19th century London with claymore, broad axe, or a crossbow, right?
On the other hand,  brass knuckles, walking canes, kukri and pistols are all you get. They could have added police clubs, various knives or daggers, sabres, etc. Give more variety.
On one hand, I like RPGs, so I was excited when I saw character levelling.
On the other hand, it looks so dumb when an enemy easily tanks several headshots, because he's couple of levels above you.
On one hand, fights are fast and dynamic.
On the other hand, they're fast because each attack animation loosk like if it had 3 or 5 frames. They look terrible. Especially hand to hand combat in fight clubs. Ubisoft devinately saved money on animators.
On one hand, optional tasks aren't too annoying and I completed them to get 100% sync.
On the other hand, I completed optional tasks to entertain myself and make missions more challenging and interesting.
On one hand, I liked that Evie and Jacob's outfits are immersive and they put hoods on only when sneaking. Altair and Ezio stood out too much. They had no chance to blend with the crowd in their robes.
On the other hand, there isn't much variety in customizing their outfits. Shame.
On one hand, they added grappling hook!
On the other hand, it's so hard to properly aim this thing. If you thing it works as good as in Batman games, forget it. It's not totally unusable, but aiming is terrible.
Story...well, Evie is all serious ""I mean business and do things right papa's daugher"", Jacob is an idiot. Jacob breaks things, Evie fixes them. The antagonist Crawford Starrick is boring ""I'm evil becuase I'm evil"" cliche. He killed his goon, because he interrupted Crawford playing the piano. So evil, I shake in fear.
All in all, I liked the game and completed it several times. And it's the only AC that I completed 100%, but only because it's very easy.

If you're someone like me who for some godsforsaken reason still likes the Assassin's Creed games despite how formulaic and bad they can be, I'd definitely recommend this game. I got immediately drawn in by the victorian setting, ended up liking the characters, and the soundtrack by Austin Wintory blew me away; I still listen to it once in a blue moon on it's own because I like it that much.

My favorite addition that was added in the past game is how the assassination's work, which unfortunately was dropped after this game until IIRC the DLC stories of Valhalla. In this game and Unity, you are told to kill a target. You aren't given explicit instructions unless you want to get a unique cinematic kill, or give yourself more opportunities to use in the pursuit of how you want to take out the target.

Unfortunately I can't really divulge any more about the game because I only beat the main story and a lot of the base game's content over a year ago, and I only now started playing again to finish the Jack the Ripper DLC, which I ended up dropping before because of burnout from the main game. I had a LOT of fun during the moments of the game where you actually control Jack as he's off in pursuit of his goals; it made me feel half like Scarecrow and half like Michael Myers. The final story mission was a nice take on a boss, too, and that's as much as I'm going to say on it.

Overall, I really liked it. But at the same time, this is VERY MUCH an Ubisoft Assassin's Creed game. The last one using the original formula until Origins changed things to the current formula, with a parkour system I really liked, and (at least in my opinion,) a slightly interesting rpg/perk system that could have been ironed out more. Honestly wished there was more to the game after beating the one DLC.

I'm a True Assassin's Creed fan, Assassin's Creed 1 was my first game I played. I started playing this series from the very beginning of it. finished games one by one from AC 1 all the way to AC Odyssey, enjoyed every single one of them, the stories were great and i was obsessed with this game series, but when it came to AC Syndicate, I missed this title so i skipped it, not that I never gave it a try, I played it back then when it was freshly released, played for an hour or so, it just didn't feel right.

AC Syndicate was kinda strange, i had this feeling from the start, I really loved AC Unity which came before it and AC Origins which came after, but this odd ball, nah. with that said, now that i'm actually writing this review, I've finished the main story and conquered all the cities. even now, I still don't like it.

Why i don't like it? it's not the graphics, to be honest graphics and visual effects got a huge upgrade since the Unity. i think it's the location and possibilities in it. London or England as a whole is a boring place for Assassin's Creed games. the city conquering missions were so trivial and repetitive, at the last missions i was pretty much sick of them, just wanted to finish them, get the Uplay points and just be done with them.

the character were alright, I liked Evie more she was lowkey cute, but again they didn't feel like any thing we ever seen before, they were like disconnected from the whole series.

the ending was ridiculous though, very low effort part. specially when Evie and her brother were in turn thrown out of the fight just to counter those funny lethal rays from piece of eden and make their ways back to the fight, again and again this happened. and finally he was killed, just like any other person. 

even funnier than that was the part after this, when the cut scenes began and it came to the current time, there was a girl with Assassin's outfit and using hidden blades and smokes against guns! so funny. and again the game kept us in limbo, no information about current time activities, like who is that invisible woman (Goddess?) that talked to that officer! it wasn't something new. I remember such voice and Goddess back in AC brotherhood and later in AC 3 as well.

So yeah, I don't know about this one, can't recommend this to any Assassin's Creed fans, but you try it, maybe you like it.

+ One of my favorite settings in the series

+ The city feels lively and all the moving pieces (carts, boats, etc.) create  fun obstacles and different ways to travel

+ I like the moving home base idea

+ Not an overwhelming amount of collectibles like some other games in  the series

+ Side activities were enjoyable and didn't feel like a grind

+ The twins made for interesting protagonists and I liked being able to play as both of them

+ Gang upgrade system was a nice bonus that makes you feel like your gang is really gaining territory


[h1]Negatives[/h1]
- Some graphical bugs and glitches

- Combat is too spammy and quick without a lot of impact

- Not enough weapon variety, each of the three weapon types feel very similar with the main differences being the finishing moves

- Combat is already easy because of the guard breaks and parry system; guns and throwing knives make it a joke

- Not a lot of enemy variation, and every enemy is dealt with in the same way

- Stealthing a mission is harder than killing everyone in the area

- Can't change between characters at will, it is story-driven

- Main plot felt weak and a bit disjointed

- Final boss was way too easy

- Gang upgrade system, again, makes the already easy combat system even easier by nerfing your enemies in disastrous ways (like making all of them spawn with less health???)

The gameplay is solid, the mission design does what it needs to, on the face of it this is the best AC game by far. The problem is the bugs. Even setting aside the animation and control bugs that Assassin's Creed seems to think aren't something we should be bothered about, there are missions that can't be finished if you're in the wrong type of cart, horses will teleport into the air, things spawn in places they shouldn't, sound drops out of headphones, It's a shitshow of bad QA and it strains my conscience to recommend you buy it.

That said, Evie and Jacob are just such great characters that missing this would be a shame. If only there were a way to play the game without rewarding Ubisoft for their insulting bug (non)fixing practices...",1643982776,1643982776,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Character in the game were great I really liked the twin assassin's the two main protagonists and I really liked they both were the same and very different at the same time. The story itself though wasn't that good it was average at best. The free running was a tiny bit ""janky"" sometimes I had trouble starting free running but it wasn't a big deal. When it comes to graphics I was not able to play the game at max settings but this game looked worse than AC Unity. Human faces and building interior as well as lighting did not look as good as the previous game did. Another thing that I didn't really like and what I missed because it is an AC game is that you can't get out of the animus I always enjoyed in the previous games exploring the ""real world"" which you can't do here.
So this is how I'm going to rate the game.

Graphics - 7/10
Gameplay - 7/10
Characters - 8/10

9/10, could've used more tea.

Ok, but in all seriousness, the game is fun. 
The open world is big, detailed and fun to run around in and [redacted to avoid spoilers] to the top of buildings. N O I C E .
The combat is well-designed, although confusing and chaotic sometimes (sometimes at good times, though.), and the 3 weapons you can use are really satisfying to bruise [insert British-sounding pronouns here] with. The amount of blood the sprays out is kind of unrealistic, but it's still kinda nice to look (I am not a dangerous person). 
The graphic are pretty, I am a simp for Evie Frye, low-key. And Jacob Frye. 

Anyway, the story is pretty cool the first time, but on my third playthrough, I found myself skipping every cutscene the game would let me so I could, ya know, play the game. (Also, the title sequence is unskippable.)

I heard a lot about this game , mostly negative stuff but I am personally a huge fan of Assassin's Creed series and did not want to miss this entry. Thankful that I did not. 
*SPOILERS* for late-comers like me 
I see it may not stand near the brotherhood and black flag entry but even if I do not want to I will still praise Ubisoft for Syndicate. 
I do not know how geographically/politically/historically correct they were in portraying london but whatever they did they did a good job.

There are a few sequences (6/7/8) where the story does not seem to connect very well. 

I did not like the little disputes between the fryes , Henry Greene just appears to be a very weak character and did not do justice for an Assassin. 

Jacob and Evie are fantastic protagonists and the other NPC like ""Freddy"", ""Pearl"",""Maddox"" are very well designed.

Villains are meh and some of them just feel like fillers to expand the overall story. 

Gameplay wise it is like any other Assassin's creed entry , good to see the grapple hook for easy traverse/escape between the buildings. 

I liked the Gang wars and Child liberation , although templar hunts and bounty hunts were repetitive. 

The game has a good balance between the 2 characters and you do not have to choose whom to level up , both have separate missions to allow them to fully unlock all the skills .

The ending was fantastic, although unlike previous games (except Unity I think)  you do not get to play the Abstergo events.

I also personally liked the World War 1 side mission but the Queen missions were absolutely unnecessary.

Overall happy with the story with little offtrack moments , some funny bugs here and there  ,and meh villains I would rate it a solid 7/10. 
Only Sad thing is I wont be able to see the Frye twins coming back again.

For a warning, I'm not a good gamer, or a gamer who will stick with a game and play it all the way through unless it pulls me in with its weird magic. Though this one was a thrill. I love the mechanic of the twins, how one is the aggressor and the other the typical sneaky assassin and how some mechanics were unlockable for one yet not the other. I like how there were skill (level) tiered places on the map, and how it affected how you played-though I am one for wandering around aimlessly sometimes and getting beat up for it. Still enjoyed every second of it. I love how the story makes you do those little things that are VERY important, yet also seem quite small. I like how there are gangs that you can beat or get beat up, it makes it more fun then just having the police that you have to watch out for. And I like how when you progress, you can have your gang buddies accompany you in beating up the other gang or other things, though unfortunately I didn't use the mechanic much with my first play-through, I'm planning on using it more in the future. I love the little bugs that it has, which makes it better and funny, at least in my opinion. Feeling like Spider-Man with the grapple-thing was a blast, going from building to building and climbing up quickly.

The movement is scuffed, its glitchy, its not fluent. The combat is always the same and is ridiculously unbalanced in certain scenarios. The game is very inconsistent in actions. Ie. The mission where you need to knock out guards instead of killing them. I get caught, I run in a circle for 5 minutes to get around him, I do, I can't knock him out so I kill him. Restarts the game, I go back and hide in a hay bail. I come out and hold E to knock him out. It doesnt say E until the guard turns around and alerts everyone else.

The travel system is actually asinine. The train, the carts, the way points. The way points are buggy some of them dont work, the carts just ram into everything making everyone fight you. You always spawn on the train for a mission and then have to go 2000 meters waiting in the train or in a cart to get to the destination in a district which is 4 + levels than you.

The leveling system is actual garbage, you have to level up two people at a time which creates inconsistencies within the game. There is no efficient form of travel so you are going through high level boroughs while there level 8 people fighting you at level 3 simply for existing.

The amount of enemy gang members is complete asinine, you can't do anything without unrelated gang members in the streets rushing over into a restricted area. So then are stuck in a 1v10 situation.

The good aspects:
- The city of London is BEAUTIFUL. very well made, and pretty historically accurate. 
- the dual protagonist thing is great; you can play 2 very different assassins (they are twins) which gives many options to how you wanna finish a quest. Jacob is a brute and Evie is sneaky. 
- the gang thing is very clever. How you make yours bigger and the enemy weaker (both from fighting and from sabotage through traits). 
-The story is rich with many side quests and missions and public actions to keep you occupied for hours. 
-the level system is easy, and it's not purely about equipment as it was in Unity, but about missions and killings etc. 
-WW 1 travel was very clever, and well made aspect to the game (even though too small).
-stealth is MAJESTIC. public stealth, hiding assassinations, and generally the movement of the assassins are fantastic and smooth. 

the bad aspects:
-the combat is average. The moves are too hasty they seem mechanical. The executions are brutal BUT that highlighted shit around your target, even when you re finishing him off is PATHETIC. And i coudlnt find how to disable it (possibly you cant).
-the combo finisher is broken. Or it's random. Many times i had 2 3 enemies ready for a chain execution, but Jacob was fininishing them one by one...
-side missions, even though plenty, are BORING... all the same things again and again. Nothing special and nothing unique. But you meet many historical figures that ""help"" the assassins... Queen Victoria, Karl Marx,Graham Bell etc
-the district gang fights/side missions to control it are BORING... literally 4 types all over again and again. 1)Kill the target.2)kill group of enemies.3)save the kids. 4) kidnap enemy, and then kill the Boss of district to name it yours. Thats it. 
-you cant quite keep up with the story. How you met this lady/man? why im helping him? why hes helping me? How i found out about this enemy base? It is supposed london assassins to be LITERALLY helpless, as the story began with, but you end up having friends almost anywhere for no reason and unlimited resources FROM START...

All in all, it is a decent ac. it can become boring if you try to achieve 100%, but for sure it can keep you occupied for more that 25 hours and have great fun with it. Roaming London and killing enemies and saving people is great.

I've played every Ac before this one, I wanted to get back to the series because from what I've played from odyssey I really liked it, but didnt want to skip titles so picked back from Unity and now this one, and boy what a mistake that was...

Unity had an interesting story and character development almost as AC2, didn't encounter many bugs when I played that one, But it had a lot of issues gameplaywise...

However this one is a new low...

- Whats the story really? 
- If I play one character is because I wanted to play the whole game with that one.
- Horrible controls and gameplay, I mean this really came out the same year the witcher 3 and arkham knight did? wtf they didn't improve (or should I say fix?) almost anything from unity.
- You never feel that you are making something that matters, since there are very few mission templates and they repeat a lot.
- Every area feels very copy paste and even reusing a lot of assets from Unity, which makes little sense to me.

The only things it has almost going for, are:

= The setting, I guess, but is so much wasted potential the way is presented here, as if it were a saturday morning cartoon.
= Good visuals for screenshots (because in motion it breaks apart)
= A not so bad grapling hook that makes every other mechanic from AC, meaningless.

I know what comes after gets better so this is not a hard pass on the series.

My advice? Even if you are a fan, skip it. And even if you don't like the current formula (origins, odyssey and valhala) dont't submit yourself to this one on the basis that it has the ""classic feel"" whatever that is, or because of the overarching story on present day that usally ties the games up, there are 4 cutscenes that don't lead up to anything and you might better watch em on YT.",1641111632,1641450653,False,2,0,0.47826087474822998,0,True,False,False

It says the male character (forgot the name sorry) is good at fighting, and the female is good assassin. But tbh, not to much difference between them just their personal skills are different.

Maybe that's why I never played this game in the first place, but seeing how cheap the game is now, I decided to aaaaaaaaaaand it's good but not great!

Admittedly, it's not as good as Unity or Origins but it sure as hell isn't a bad game. It's also not a perfect AC game because it got really boring by the time I was near the ending. There were A LOT of repetitive missions and overtaking sections of the map can get really tedious.

The gang system is cool and all but the AI can get really dumb at times and can break immersion - especially when you're doing stealth missions and your gang just randomly attacks EVERY SINGLE ENEMY ON THE MAP.

What makes this game great is the fight sequences, although once you reach the max level, there's probably no enemy who could stop you, and you get overpowered REALLY FAST.

Character wise, there were a lot of lazy writing on Ubisoft's part when it came to making Jacob and Evie. I don't know if it's because I played so much of the side missions that the main storyline became a bit disconnected - but what is an open world game if going sideways breaks the main line. There were a lot of moments that I just went ""Uhm, what?"" especially with Evie which I will not spoil, but to those who have played this game know exactly what I'm talking about.

I guess the bottom line is that this is a good game but not the best. It's great for the price but it's just that kind of game where you go ""meh"" after 10 hours.",1640926902,1640926902,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

In dept this game simply took everything that Unity tried to broaden and perfected it in my opinion. The combat is in depth and the weapons and character customization is on par with Unity in many ways. I found that I needed to level Jacob and Evie in sync to deal with the growing enemy strength. If you do not provide them with the best gear and skills, fighting enemies and completing missions becomes somewhat of a challenge. This game has the replay-ability of Assassins Creed Black Flag since the game play is crisp and the story is gripping. Between meeting famous people in history or the humor generated by the sibling relationship of our protagonists this game has it all. It did not disappoint me in the slightest.

ONLY issue I had was sometimes there was a SMALL glitch here and there and this only happened maybe 2 or 3 times and none of them were game breaking at all!",1640332022,1640332355,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

-The London setting looks and sounds great. Sometimes it's nice to just sit in a train and take in the scenery
-Solid parkour/stealth gameplay
-There is a nice territory progression system in place that you can work through at your own pace (the gang wars)
-Very convenient auto save system

[b]The Cons:[/b] 
-The characters are bland. Different characters show up, make a few quips, then disappear. Rinse and repeat. I don't care about any of these characters after 20 hrs of playtime, and couldn't provide a memorable quote from this game if my life depended on it
-The story is fragmented and there really isn't a sense of progression. You could mix up all the story beats and show them in a different order, and it's pretty much the same experience
-A host of new features make the gameplay way too easy. This game still has the parkour/stealth mechanics from the previous AC titles, but the addition of the things like the grappling hook sidesteps all of that and dumbs down the approach to stealth situations. The grappling hook itself feels fine, but is way too convenient of a tool for a game that still bases it's design around traditional AC mechanics
-Since the combat is so easy, there's no real risk, no reason for stealth beyond personal challenge. This breaks a few missions that are designed around using clever ways to reach the target (You can just walk in, kill a few enemies, then walk out with no consequence)
-Gameplay progression feels irrelevant. There's a whole system with skill trees, inventory upgrades, and gang upgrades, but honestly most of it is unnecessary since the gameplay never changes. It stays the same, it never evolves. You play one templar hunt, you've played them all. Easy to get open world fatigue
-The missions/sequences feel uninspired. Too many ways to cheese them, and conversely sometimes you can fail missions for obtuse reasons beyond your control. Also plenty of game-breaking bugs that require you to quit the game and come back to fix
-The previous AC games I've played are usually immersive in their historical setting, but I didn't get much of that with this one. Previous AC games would shed light on little nuggets of history and through playing you'd get to know more about historical figures, buildings, and moments etc, but you'll have to go out of your way to find that here
-The city is beautiful, but the game doesn't make an effort to make the locations unique so it's ultimately not very memorable

[b]Overall[/b], this game is a solid time waster if you want to shut your brain off and play something mindless without worrying about the game throwing a mental wrench at you. There isn't really much more beyond that though, and if you ask me for a recommendation for a game of this type, there are plenty of other similar games I'd recommend over this one. This is the weakest Assassin's Creed game I've played so far; I think the franchise made the right move to switch up their formula going forward.",1639649637,1639649637,False,52,0,0.67360985279083252,0,True,False,False

They said Syndicate took all the problems of Unity and fixed them, which was good, as Unity had a lot of problems. I could write a very lengthy review of all things Syndicate did wrong, it’s pretty fun to be honest, but it doesn’t matter really matter.

Is the game fun… sure, is the game worth the money… goes on sale for less than 10 so sure… is it worth the time… no, is it worth playing to keep up with the story… no, is it eye candy and a neat open world you can explore and get bored of in 2 hours, no to the former yes to the ladder?

I’m hesitant to call the game bad, because there aren’t enough frustrating elements, it’s just kind of inoffensively dull, eraser shavings are less disposable than this game. Syndicate is not something anyone should play, but it’s not a game that should be wiped from history.

368500,104599020,76561198321647999,0,34,6035,0,5857,1639315148,"Taking place closest in history to us, the game takes place in Victorian England following the Frye twins and their goal of taking back control of London from Templar hands, following the assassination of Edward Kenway years earlier. Having a unique opportunity to play as two different people, switching from one to another in a matter of a second, the game gives us two different perspectives from the same side, one that abides by the Creed and follows in her father's footsteps focusing on the Piece of Eden, and the other swaying away from his sister's goal to take matters into his brawling hands by forming a gang to take down Templar lieutenants, crippling their control. Gang members act in the similar way as Assassin recruits did in some previous games, helping protagonists in a more direct way rather than from the shadows.
The twins give a fresh approach to the otherwise single main charater, each with their own views of the world and how to approach and solve certain problems. Evie is charming, eager to help, while Jacob just as charming is more playful in his approach, not taking himself or the problems around him too seriously, but fully aware they are.

Traversing London's 4 to 5-story buildings is made easier by the new gadget, the rope launcher, making reaching the tops of buildings a breeze, as well as quickly ""hopping"" from one rooftop to the next. Another new gadget is the introduction of the voltaic bomb which, similar to the smoke bomb, incapacitates enemies but also damages them as well.
A welcome return to the franchise are the whistle and for PC players a mouse wheel as a method for cycling through weapons, both having been removed in Unity, with takedown opportunities continuing in Syndicate. The looting of bodies also gets a boost, having been severely nerfed in Unity, giving more consumables and reducing the need to shop after or during missions.
There are 3 different weapon types to use, kukri, cane-swords & knuckles, offering 3 different styles of combat to pick from, as well as firearms and Assassin gauntlets. There are plenty of styles to acquire, some requiring crafting, each offering different stats, most notably belts for Jacob and capes for Evie offering defense and stealth points, and their various outfits stat boosts. The cost of weapons and outfits is in the realm of affordability, yet another welcome change from Unity, and making money to purchase them comes in the form of pubs' income that needs to be unlocked under gang upgrades, which is then easily picked up from the train's vault, as well as various side missions generously providing another income.

The hideout this time around is a moving train that circles the entire playable London area that can be easily boarded and disembarked at any moment, climbed on top for a more adventurous travelling experience and even sight see from within the train with an option to change camera angles and view London from unique perspectives.

Similar to Unity's helix glitches that take place in different time periods, one of Syndicate's optional memories takes place during World World I, taking place years after the events of the main game, the short story following Jacob's granddaughter Lydia helping Winston Churchill with the enemy threat on home soil.

Syndicate DLCs offer more in term of extra missions, weapons and outfits, one of which brings back murder mysteries from Unity while playfully introducing the creator of one of the most famous detectives in The Dreadful Crimes DLC.
Jack the Ripper DLCs however, gives us an Assassin's Creed's take on the famous serial killer that terrorized Victorian London, by offering a connection between the Assassins and the Ripper. Taking place 20 years after the main story we once again get to play as Evie as she returns to London looking for her brother after his disappearance, but getting to play a few short missions as the Ripper himself as well. His perspective is so unusually different, fitting perfectly with his maniacal persona, and playing as him satisfies that dark parts of ourselves we sometimes like to peer into. The DLC also introduces the fear element into the story and combat, and although fun to use and play around with, it somewhat defeats the purpose of being an Assassin if taking down enemies is not by assassinating them. It's a fun, innovative way of subduing enemies and an ideal tactic that should've only be used by the Ripper himself.

As the last true Assassin's Creed game in the franchise it's nostalgic looking back at how far the franchise has come, accomplishing so much by each new title, expanding on the gameplay mechanics and the connecting story from the very first to this last game. Syndicate is a strong addition to the rest of the titles that by the ending of the Ripper DLC creates a sense of sadness as we say goodbye to a long journey where we followed so many Assassins throughout the game's history that helped shape the world and its future, unsure if we'll ever get to take similar journeys again. Even the modern day part ends in the same vein, leaving us on a cliffhanger not knowing what the future will bring. Regardless of the changes waiting down the line we'll always be able to go back to 9 games that made us all Assassins by the end.

Say what you like about Ubisoft's templated open-world design (and there's a lot to be said), but no one else can capture the ""Hollywood-historical"" aesthetic vibes the settings and particularly cities of its games exude, and they knock it out of the park with Victorian London. The fact this game was released almost 7 years ago and still looks as good as it does, is impressive.

As for the gameplay, you know the score. I'm not OCD enough to ever want to 100% one of these but its not to bad if you stick to the critical path. I play these games as side games when I want to kill some time, and in that respect, they're decent. That said, while the DLC are mainly alright, the Jack the Ripper DLC is the most janky, bug ridden, and content-thin release for an AC game I've experienced, next to King Washington for AC3. It's also a gigantic missed opportunity due to how they handle the eponumous murderer (i.e. it's comedically lame)

Everything about this game hits right, they removed the tedious parts of Unity's combat (the tracking bullets), the parkour is the same but this time with a grappling hook WHICH IS SUCH A FUN GIMMICK, there isn't as much customisation as Unity but the outfits they have look SO COOL!

The main protagonists are my favourite so far (especially Jacob), almost every cutscene Jacob is such a mood with his sarcasm being one of the best things in the game, Evie being the more cunning twin still has her moments of witty humour throughout the story too.

Now let's get to the story, the story is one of the best yet. Throughout the entire game I was getting a mix of AC1, Brotherhood and Unity all mashed into one. Instead of liberating a single base which liberates the whole area like in Brotherhood, instead you only liberate small parts of each area with each base you destroy. This makes you feel like the main villain is as powerful and influential as they say. The assassin missions are like Unity mixed with AC1, you plan your own route to the target and kill them however you please, then once the deed is done you get that AC1 style memory corridor where the dying target talks to you before you swipe a feather on their blood to show the deed is done (this time it's a handkerchief). The main villain is great, he's actually really threatening unlike previous villains (like let's be real here, as good a Templar as Haytham was, he wasn't all that threatening). Some quests are absolutely great too, there's a lot of them that have the same vibe as the comedic Yakuza substories (such as Freddy's old lady disguises or that one mission where you escort the Prime Minister's wife to the most dangerous pub in London), despite how goofy these scenes are, it doesn't ruin the tone of the game at all as I'd rather this than serious characters void of any personality (ahem, Connor).

I see a lot of people say this game is one of the worst AC games and I mean it's kind of clear to me that those people are the same who thinks the series died after Revelations (which is what I thought thanks to the awful mess that was AC3 until I actually played Black Flag onwards).",1637101737,1637101737,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This title is worth playing only If you are a real fan of the franchise or you have no good games left to play.

The story line is meh, characters are not really memorable, but not terrible as well. In the beginning I prefered Evie, but after several hours I realized that she is the one arrogant, egocentric and looks down on her brother, it's just all packed in a soft skin and false smile. To me, Jacob is the one with a truly kind heart and interesting personality. 
Syndicate is easy to get into it, there is almost nothing new to learn If you are used to playing Assassin's games. Main quest line along with the side activities struggle to keep the player involved or at least not bored from time to time.
Possibility to fast travel during the missions was removed again. It's important to mention, because sometimes you need to travel a fucking kilometer to your destination. Ubisoft shows again how annoying it can be for no fucking reason at all.
Be aware of bugs that can occur during the gameplay - less than in Unity but more serious eg. disappearing target or a mission that can't be pushed further, forcing you to load the game.
Also more enemies spawning out of nowhere and a bit more scripted events than in Unity, which makes this title the the most annoying AC game after AC III.

About the good things. Dreadfull Crimes are a bit harder than Murder Mysteries from AC Unity and even more entertaining but hidden behind a paywall, because it's a separate DLC (not included in season pass).
Rope launcher is great in my opinion. Folks say that it killed climbing mechanics, but for me it's a very nice tool to make the gameplay faster and smoother and also adds some new possibilities to your approach.
London is a beautiful environment. It's a living, believable, dense city and it's a pleasure to spend time there. It's not so overwhelmingly packed with hundreds of icons, which was pretty disturbing in AC Unity.

I finished the game and all the DLC's as well and I was really tired and had enough of it for the last several hours. I definitely didn't feel that way in the previous AC games (except AC III). It usually was the further the better, but in this title the peak of my enjoyment was somewhere in the middle.
Generally AC Syndicate is a waste of time unless you enjoy generic AC missions, story lines and seek for some more of well known game design.",1636894215,1636894572,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

But after Black Flag, it became a disappointment as the storytelling getting more and more sloppy due to frequent releases: the plots range from boring to unbelievable; characterizing is minimal and tasteless; moral standard just goes wherever is convenient to the plot like a child play, as they just made the antagonists do bad stuff for no reason and didn’t even bother to justify all the killings and damage the protagonists did. 

Assassin's Creed Syndicate is the same in these regards. The story is boring and predictable, following an uninteresting structure of “picking out every minion and then the boss”. This time they tried to make two protagonists likeable with cocky personalities, but that didn’t pan out because of the bad writing and the negligible effort in actual characterizing. And I don’t even want to go into the moral discussion since it is so convenient like it is for pupils. In short, the story department is expectedly bad.

As for gameplay, it really is a good example of what is called “fast food video game”: Ubisoft found some formulas that work, then just copied and pasted them to the entire game and even to other franchises. These gameplay are heavily repeated throughout the game and there is no meaningful story to keep them refreshed and interesting. As a result, it is fun at the beginning, but after some hours in you become very sick of it. 

Worse still, it is designed to be a long game deliberately and only some of the gameplay are interesting to begin with, among which are stealth and investigation. For investigation, it is mainly featured in Dreadful Crime DLC where you play detective to solve murders. It is fun and somewhat creative but eventually caused fatigue because this game has the problem of not knowing when is a good point to stop. For stealth, the game has some decent stealth levels I enjoyed, but these level designs were reused a lot. Additionally, stealth levels are generally quite short and straight-up combat tends to be the fastest and most efficient way to complete missions, making stealth kind of pointless and redundant.

Speaking of stealth, it is probably the most decent part of the game, and since Assassin's Creed games are categorized as stealth action games, stealth should be the core gameplay. However, you spend the majority of your time in this game doing all sorts of tedious and repetitive chores, not stealth. Therefore, I really think even the developer themselves didn’t figure out what sort of experience should the game provide, let alone know how to make it good. 

As for other aspects, this is a very glitchy game, some of which are straight-up game-breaking. The combat lacks lots of depth to be remotely interesting (basically just QTE). The control has the same kind of unresponsiveness that can trace back to the first Assassin's Creed in 2008, causing all sorts of unwanted action – in my experience, 90% of mistakes I made is because the control decided to do funny things instead of following my input correctly. The environmental building is probably the only thing I am satisfied with and has never disappointed me since the first Assassin's Creed - Victoria London is beautiful and detailed. It is unfortunate that the only good it did is aesthetic and to show off to your non-gamer friends, and it comes with poor optimization.

This game may have a bit of charm to new gamers and those who didn’t play any Assassin's Creed games, but for more experienced players, it is very boring with all the stunts you have already seen, and I don’t think it is worth your time and money because from what I have seen, it is full of lazy and sloppy designs, like the developer didn’t even care about the final product and just wanted to push it out to the market to make some quick bucks.

I am very happy that I did, I just got through the games opening, and I have to say really good so far. Very reminiscent of older AC games like AC2, combat while nothing like AC3 or AC4 it feels good. Especially considering both characters have their own proficiencies. Evie is geared more towards stealth, she's much more agile, and has more agility. Whereas her brother Jacob is more combat geared his combat feels heavier, and sluggish. I've personally come to prefer playing as Evie as her agility both in and outside combat gives her quite the edge.

The combat is excellent with plenty of sneaking and stabbing relieved by some moments of direct combat where you are still effective enough not to be embarrassed. Care and planning is rewarded without precluding players being able to just go in guns blazing. This makes the side activities a pleasure rather than the hassle they sometimes can be.

The setting is also a highpoint with an interesting and detailed environment that is both well inhabited and sparse enough not to be overwhelming. The game exploits the richness of the time and place without drowning itself in historical inanities.

Good:
Conquering territories is a nice way to level up your character. It's a grind but fun and has a purpose. It also relates to the plot which is nice.
The grappling gun works well and let's you traverse the city quickly.
Stealth is a bit better than previous games and can be used as a tactic.
They story is light on but enjoyable, it doesn't take itself too seriously. If you are looking for realism you're gonna have a bad time as you'll be on jaunty side missions protecting Karl Marx and Charles Darwin.
What I did like about this one is the story progresses at a good pace and doesn't feel like it drags. You don't get stuck grinding just to complete a mission.

The Bad:
Still doesn't have a fully realised stealth system, enemies are eagle eyed and there's not much cover you can utilise. Seems like a no brainer for assassin's Creed to have better stealth because you are assassinating people more often than not.
Lacks non lethal weapons or easy ways to knock out enemies. Often you're just killing everyone and everything.
Combat is more arcade like with combos and multipliers. It's smoother but a bit too simplistic and button mashy. I would have preferred something more like in unity where you engage with the combat by dodging, parrying and striking instead of mashing attack and dodging occasionally.
Too many high powered guns later in the game which you can exploit with the data reload skill. After a while you just start shooting everything.
The main characters are ok but could have been fleshed out a bit more, not much depth here.",1635628702,1635628702,True,4,0,0.573997020721435547,0,True,False,False

The general gist of the game follows the usual formula of the AC games, huge map and you free various areas by killing bosses and uniting a rebellious group to take over.

As someone who's spent the last 10 years photographing London, written a photo guidebook  ""Photographing London"" and won awards for my London photography this is a dream come true! What makes this extra special for me as a born and bred Londoner is that my great great grandfather was a photographer around the time period this game is set! Being able to wander the same streets and several landmarks as I do now is an incredible treat, the changing light and the wonderful atmospheric conditions especially at night, the rain soaked streets are a treat for me these days in the game they are dream come true. I have commend the game designers on making this incredibly accurate, sure some liberties have been taken in certain places but for the most part it's a pretty damned accurate representation in terms of scale, of the streets of London. What I love most is able to see how the 19th Century London has changed compared today. 

Enough gushing! What about the game? We'll no real surprises, you basically pick fights, climb around the city, beat the bad guys, collect goodies and save the day! No real surprises, fairly standard AC gameplay formula. It's good fun making stealth kills undetected but the missions are mostly quite similar with a few mini missions here and there like stopping a runaway train or solving crimes. 

There are some bits that do grate. They've taken some liberties like mixing some well known historical people like Alexander Graham Bell and Charles Darwin. One thing I have to commend the makers is on the accents on the key characters, so much voiced dialogue from the main characters and some of it is witty and that extra effort really pays off. 

However there's the general population's dialogue....hmmm. There's this idea that everyone in London, especially from the 19th Century, all sound like extras from Mary Poppins! Some of the voice acting is OK but other things like the some of the women's voices from the Blighter's ( what's that name about?! ) are way too ""Cor Blimey Guvnor!"" and as a Londoner it's quite cringy at times to hear those Dick Van Dyke, Mary Poppins accents *shudder*!

I'm not normally much of a fan of the AC games, I liked Black Flag but this one really has grabbed me probably because I can relate more to the location as the city of my birth. Overall I have to say I love this game and I can forgive the repetitive nature of the boss missions for each area as the graphics and slick gameplay, amazing locations are just a joy to behold. 

Being able to sit atop Nelson's statue right at the top of the column in Trafalgar Sq, just amazing experience I never knew I'd ever get a chance to do in a video game when i first started gaming back in 1982!

If Unity with all of its rather innovative approaches to gameplay and story alike, as well as its attempts to go back to the roots of the franchise in embracing the qualities that made Assassin’s Creed II such a good game, is seen as a general failure in the gaming world, then Syndicate can be seen as damage-reduction in response to that failure.

What this means is that I effectively feel like this game was streamlined to appeal to absolutely everyone. This is not necessarily a bad business practice and of course not unheard of amongst AAA titles, but Syndicate seems to have been sandblasted so thoroughly that the game’s potential character is effectively gone.


Stealth is optional for the vast majority of the game and the few times it is necessary barely poses any challenge. The same goes for parkour: Remember when you’d have to search for a way to climb some tower in the first Assassin’s Creeds for like five minutes? You get a grappling hook about two hours into the game now, which enables you to get to the top of Big Ben in like 5 seconds. Well, there goes your sense of achievement for those two disciplines.

The combat system doesn’t make up for that either. In a direct counteract to Unity’s challenging, yet flawed and slightly buggy combat system, Syndicate’s combat system went back to the easier combat systems of Unity’s predecessors but didn’t quite manage to replicate their appeal. Part of the reason why is the fact that they kept Unity’s level system, but replaced the rest of Unity’s combat system. The direct result of this is that you have to heavily rely on combo chains to beat stronger enemies if your equipment isn’t quite up to the task yet. That essentially results in having to stab an enemy like 30 times in the gut in rapid succession – and no, that isn’t overkill, this is merely what’s necessary to take down some street mugger that just happened to have a ridiculous HP pool because he spawned in a high-level territory. Otherwise, these high-level enemies don’t stand out compared to their low-level counterparts – they’re the same character model and use the same moves. The former scenario will be the case quite often as the equipment ends up being a bottleneck more often than your own skill, due to the generally low difficulty of the combat system.

Also, as this game plays in Victorian England you no longer get weapons like swords, spears, and axes. Instead, you get brass knuckles, kukris, and some weird dagger that’s hidden in a cane –none of which I enjoyed using, so I just ended up shooting everyone instead. That’s right, you also get guns, but they’re not nearly as fun as you might think at first – for instance, they scale with the level system as well, just like the melee weapons, so headshots only count as a damage multiplier. This means you’ll end up pumping several revolver rounds in some high-level enemies’ bare head and he’ll still walk away with merely a headache.


Now that’s the most important stuff concerning the gameplay, let’s get to the story. The story of Assassin’s Creed Syndicate runs on a very simple rule: The quality of a character is inversely proportional to their importance in the story.

The two protagonists of the story are both awful characters, each in their own way. On the positive side, they deserve each other. Jacob is impulsive and easy to provoke, so he likes solving every problem with brute force. Due to this he’s also quite easy to manipulate, listens to barely anybody at all, and doesn’t even think about possible consequences before doing something. Evie on the other hand is unbearably arrogant and likes to berate anyone and everyone on what they should do and what they shouldn’t, including her brother Jacob. Besides that, she’s is confident in her abilities, to the point where she can’t imagine herself failing a task, but heavily judges others for doing so. Needless to say that the twins don’t get along during the entire game at all, and when they do it appears to be rather forced. Both of them also have a rather childish view of what they’re doing which only deteriorates their characters further – the cliché one-liners they utter throughout the game only reinforce this impression. Though the worst thing about all of these character flaws is that they barely ever face repercussions for them and even if so, then these repercussions are quickly forgotten and they learn nothing from it. This is especially true for Evie, as Jacob becomes a little calmer and more thoughtful over time. Evie remains mostly the same, as she only ever sees herself proven right in her demeanor throughout the story. This is also partly thanks to the fact that your sidekick and Evie’s primary love interest is an absolute doormat and virtually useless without her help. Compare both of these aspects to the story of Ezio and Edward overcoming their flaws and finding wisdom and a new meaning in live or former sidekicks like Yusuf and Adewale, who could easily hold their own against hordes of enemies and you’ll find this game’s main cast to be rather lacking.

The Templar’s side doesn’t look any better, the grandmaster himself is more bland and generic than most of his subordinates, he doesn’t have any direct impact on the story until late in the game and you barely learn anything about him at all. He’s neither an overarching antagonist like the Borgia for example nor a cunning strategist controlling everything from the shadows like Torres. He doesn’t get a mysterious reveal like Germain either, he’s just kinda there and everybody knows it. Then you see him in person for the first time and he’s dead like five minutes later after the most boring boss-fight imaginable. Most of his subordinates are just doing their own thing as well, only a few of them are actually following a concrete scheme, and half of them are not even convinced Templars, but each of them still manages to be at least as interesting as their grandmaster.

So, due to the Frye twins doing everything their way and the Templars doing virtually the same the story also suffers. I often didn’t even remember what I did in the last chapter, as it had so little connection to the current one and no impact on the story or the characters whatsoever. Though, on the positive side of the character quality–importance law that I stated; the side characters are quite good, and their quests also add to the atmosphere of the game.


Despite all of my criticism, this still isn’t a bad game, you can have quite a lot of fun with it – just don’t expect too much. It’s good for killing some time, but don’t expect to remember much of the time you spend with it later.",1591568924,1635265353,False,0,0,0.47486037015914917,0,True,False,False

Game environment, character model & design is superb. London is beautifully rendered in this game.
However there are several major flaws to this game that is worrying. 

1. The stronghold mission where u have to free and protect captured rooks...? This bugs me (and noticeably a lot of other people also). The rooks themselves screws you up by suddenly freeing themselves & joining the fight without being asked to. And guess what, they'll be dead afterwards.
2. Replaying memory error, in looping cycles. When you're replaying memories, too often you will get the looping death screen while loading. Cross your fingers and hopes it would load properly.
3. Some other randoms bugs/glitches (explosives suddenly going off while being PLACED on the ground)

I am a huge AC brand fan and didn't miss a single game apart from Valhalla and Odyssey (which is next on my list). I grew up on rather depressing Altair story and lived through revered Ezio d'Auditore's life and yes, like many, this set a bar this brand is yet to reach again. AC3 was a shocking meh, Black Flag was probably 3rd best (although quite different), Unity was aight and Rogue was okay but a bit outdated by the time it got released. I also played Origins and that was - simply put - different. Obviously, this trend remained and AC is no longer the brand it used to be - whether it's influence of Witcher 3 or change in leadership at Ubisoft, I cannot say.. but it's fair to say that Syndicate is an epitaph (or epilogue if you like) to Assassin's Creed as we knew it.

And now finally to the game - how is it you may ask? Well, it's not as bad as I thought it would be. See, after terribly optimised Unity this game came up with a new feature - two heroes between whom you can freely choose (something I prefer over having to choose one permanently -> Odyssey). When I go back to dated reviews, claims were protagonists were boring / annoying and that game itself was pretty dull.

But no, these two new protagonists are not another Ratonhkake:ton (sorry for my spelling, lazy to google it and don't remember it that well). Yes, Jacob is a bit annoying with his rebelling nature at first, but Evie is sympathetic to me and I prefer to play for her during my free world wandering (this interestingly changed in the second half of the game where I switched and preferred Jacob). They both have their differences and they bicker a lot, something I wish I could change (just like when your parents are about to divorce and you cannot do anything but watch) but eventually all ends well to my satisfaction. Both of characters have slightly different skill trees you can fully unlock by the time you reach 50% of game (provided you collect treasures, do side activities and so on) and it makes you pretty bad ass early in the game.

Second new feature, which I personally enjoy since GTA: San Andreas times, are gangs of [strike]New York[/strike] London! Just like when you are liberating camps in Far Cry series and get random friendlies spawn around those territories, same was implemented here and I kinda like it. I don't like it to the point where I would have a gang follow me while I am ziplining through the city but they have their situational use and controlling 'rooks' is easy. 

These were big game changers for the brand but going forward in time, it was nothing in comparison to Origins. Now for the quick summary for those who don't like to read long sentences:

Pros: 
+ Industrial London
+ Two switchable protagonists
+ Gangs feature
+ Riding shotgun / stagecoaches!
+ Wide variety of historic figures (it's nothing new yet still entertaining)
+ Train base with memorabilias
+ Last 'true' Assassin's Creed
+ Less of Shaun and other ""present"" assassins (although you cannot escape them completely)
+ Boats and trains for you to travel on
+ Hook for slightly faster traversing through the city

Cons:
- Main story is slightly 'meh' and uninteresting
- additionally, the newest artifact from First Civ is BOOORING
- achievement for hitting 5k destructibles
- Jacob is occasionally really ignorant, their arguing is especially irritating mid-late game
- number of bugs and glitches including game breaking issues that were never fixed
- DLCs are atrocious, scenes do not trigger, bugs after bugs just terrible optimisation in comparison to main game
- Indian assassin Henry (sorry pal, you're lame)
- the fate of 'modern timeline' was never explained in following games, all the buildup since AC2 about Juno and sages was squashed in some comics - super FAIL
- WW1 timezone was too big and felt out of the place

Overall I can say that I have enjoyed playing this game (apart from seldom bugs) slightly more than I did Unity and I weep with a thought that from this point onwards, we'll just play poorly presented variation of Witcher 3 clones with typical Ubisoft features.


Ad: Jack the Ripper standalone DLC (will contain spoilers!)

This came up with a familiar territory in different colours (fall 1888) and a story about gruesome killer - Jack the Ripper. I have expected the return of investigative missions I so much enjoyed in Unity but nope, not at all. You get a lame-ass story about Jack being a former assassin who went nuts (I still don't understand what triggered his hatred for assassins when it was templars who killed his mother) and corrupted Rooks. You also get to play for him in a number of missions, something I have suffered through due to him being so annoying character. I'd rather play for Rodrigo Borgia or some other villain who had a bit of charisma!

Pros:
+ just about right in size and content
+ wide variety of side missions, including a number of new missions
+ limited option of gear, you are not flooded like you were in main game
+ economy is nonexistent, making gear upgrades super easy
+ investigative sections of main plot missions
+ Jacob survives

Cons: 
- You don't get to play for Jacob (which I intended to)
- Evie gets older and indian-ish but does not look the same!!
- Jack the Ripper character and his missions
- recycled dialogs,you often listen same lines / voice across - different missions
- recycled models (Arthur Weaversbrook is Benjamin Disraeli in a hat etc)
- what happened to Henry?? After marrying Evie, I'd expect him to come with his wife...
- still a large number of glitches (exploding stagecoaches, random resetting / insta-failing missions)
- absolutely atrocious fighting effects (Evie no longer kills, she stuns enemies with indian wristbands but no one bother to change animation for hidden blade fighting style)
- returning Rosetta Stone to rightful owners in Egypt in one side mission - what? Without English scientists we would know nothing what hieroglyphs are so bitch pls

I want to recommend playing all the main games in order of release date. I'll write more about the previous episodes below.

AC Syndicate was awesome. A great surprise, like AC Black Flag was a great surprise. I usually mostly focus on the main story, and not much on the side quests and stuff, but in Syndicate I completed a lot more optional content than usual. I put 51 hours into the game. I have not yet touch the post ending content. And I do not have the Jack the Ripper DLC. These would probably add another 10-20 hours.

Over 6 months ago I started with AC Unity because I wanted to learn more about the French revolution. I don't really care for the basic gameplay of stealth and killing, but I like the story and the historical context of all the AC games. Then I decided to start the AC series from the very beginning, so here are a few words about each game. Of course it's your choice whether you pick only a few of the AC games, but again I recommend playing them all, and in order.

For each game I'll list the main PROS and CONS, and mention the level of frustration I had. Some games are a bit glitchy, and the controls can be frustrating sometimes, where you're trying to run through the city chasing someone, and your character decide to hump a wall instead of running.

AC1: takes place around 1190 in Israel Palestine and Syria
PROS: A great way to start, the story is simple enough, and it's like an AC tutorial. Makes the later AC games a lot less confusing.
CONS: the game is a repetitive in the structure of its levels. It looks good for such an old game, but it's starting to show its age.
Frustration: low.

AC2: takes place in Italy in the late 1400's
PROS: Great story, charismatic characters. First of 3 games telling the story of Ezio. More content, richer game than AC1 by quite a lot, yet they did not add so much that the game became overwhelming. Really nice progression. Really cool to meet Da Vinci. Kinda cool to beat up the Pope...
CONS: also an old game.

AC Brotherhood: takes place mostly in Rome, Italy in the late 1400's
PROS: Great story, sequel to AC2, 2nd of 3 games telling the story of Ezio. Adds more content. Assassin recruits add a nice layer of gameplay.
CONS: also an old game. I think I found the ending a little weak and confusing.

AC Revelations: takes place in Turkey in the early 1500's
PROS: I loved the development of Ezio as he is older/more mature. I loved the connections to Altair (the hero of AC1).
CONS: it was a bit weird, not as attractive, to leave Italy for Turkey. The game felt darker, a little less exciting, in some way hard to describe.

Frustration: I remember the level of frustration going from low to medium in the AC2 trilogy, but I can't remember which game was better or worse.

AC3: takes place in the United States in the late 1700's
PROS: Still an old game, but the graphics are a step ahead of AC2. Great historical story. Interesting historical context.
CONS: Very glitchy. I think I had a game breaking glitch for the homestead content, which is optional but sounded interesting, and I didn't feel like going back or restarting the game to try and fix it. Some of the story/gameplay in the present time is plain stupid (ie. the level in Brazil, I found super lame).
Frustration: high.
I highly recommend buying AC Odyssey Gold Edition when it's on sale. It includes AC3 and AC Liberation, AC Odyssey and its DLC. Awesome deal.

AC3 DLC: Tyranny of King Washington: takes place in the United States in the late 1700's, in an alternate universe. It was ok, but feel free to skip, it doesn't add anything to the general AC story.

AC Liberation: takes place mostly in New Orleans, in the late 1700's, usually included with AC3, so don't buy it separately
PROS: different (female hero), short and simple but well made
CONS: I didn't care for the levels in the bayou
Frustration: medium

AC4 Black Flag: takes place in the Caribbeans in the early 1700's
PROS: awesome game, great surprise, being a pirate is actually very fun which I did not expect. Great graphics (even in 2021), makes you want to swim in the ocean.
CONS: can't think of any
Frustration: low

AC4 DLC: Freedom Cry: takes place in Haiti, in the early 1700's
PROS: story of a secondary character from Black Flag, taking place immediately after Black Flag. You liberate a lot of slaves (it felt weird that it's only when you play a black hero that you work hard to liberate slaves. In other AC games, you just express some sympathy and then you move on. I found it a bit uncomfortable, not in a bad way)
CONS: some dull moments, the story and the game were good, yet I did not feel grabbed like I was with Black Flag.

AC4 DLC: Aveline
PROS: none, sorry
CONS: super short story, they wanted to make people want to buy Liberation. Bad advertisement imho, because Aveline is a very empty DLC, while Liberation is actually a nice game. Feel free to skip this DLC. Does not add anything to the story.

AC Rogue: takes place in the United States and Quebec, in the late 1700's
PROS: good story in the sense that it connects a lot of dots between other games in the AC3 and AC4 series, and is a good lead into AC Unity. The ocean looks nice again, but very cold so it did not make me want to swim :)
CONS: Maybe it was the character(s), or maybe it's because this game had less new/original game mechanics compared to some other ACs, but I didn't feel as enthused by it.
Frustration: low/medium

AC Unity: takes place in Paris in the late 1700's
PROS: I loved visiting Paris during that time. A step up in the graphics from previous games.
CONS: a bit glitchy, sometimes felt too difficult for no good reason.
Frustration: medium

AC Unity DLC: Dead King (I think that's the name?), takes place right after Unity
PROS: satisfying weapon at the end. Nice to explore Saint Denis.
CONS: Same as Unity.
Frustration: medium

AC Syndicate: takes place in London in the late 1800's
PROS: polished, innovative, all around awesome game
CONS: none?
Frustration: very low",1635073833,1635073833,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I like Assassin's Creed games and stories in general BUT after playing soo many of them, it's different way how we looking at them when playing. 
  *Story is not bad with missions all over the city. Need to take brakes to not get bored of doing the same things over and over again. Well I don't take this as a big minus as this is big map to cover, yet it could be something new in that area. 
I like mechanics which let me climb buildings and move around much faster.    
  *Graphic is nice but not amazing. Some places, moments are done very well or even perfect but then we just go back to basics like with people which we fight with or friendly units which fight for us, they all look the same! Like a bunch of fk clones all over London. 
  *Adding scores to game trailers from Gamespot or IGN which are always overrated is just one more minus.

The open world of London is one of the best in the series and is only slightly worse than Unity’s Paris simply because of the lack of interiors and it feels a bit smaller because of the new movement additions of the grappling hook and horse-drawn carriages. The combat, however, feels like a poor man’s Arkham combat and almost all of the improvements seen in Unity’s combat have been simplified to the point of insanity.

1. When I first started the game, there was this blinding light. It was like walking into the sun. And then there were strange instances where I would enter a shadow, and it would be pitch black. This was completely unplayable, so I exited to desktop, and went back in. It was fixed, and it never happened again, but still.
2. Whenever I was on a fast vehicle, or there was just a lot of action, the game would stutter. Sort of like lagging.
3. Would sometimes freeze for about 5 seconds before resuming.
4. Sometimes just completely crashed to desktop.
5. Loading screens were absolute murder. I don't know if that can be considered as a glitch, but let's just say that you might want to pull up tic toc or something while you wait eons for it to load.
6. Textures wouldn't load quick enough.
7. A character model disappeared once, so there was just a floating book. (Kind of funny, but still.)
8. A character's dialogue would sometimes get cut off.
9. I sometimes couldn't fast travel.
10. Sometimes I couldn't attack.
11. I was escorting someone once, but they just randomly stopped moving. Had to reload objective.
12. I was tailing a carriage, and it got stuck. Had to reload objective.
13. There was this other time that's hard to explain. But still, I had to reload objective.
14. This one time, the game saved right before an essential character was shot. So when it kept reloading, that character would immediately get shot, and it was an endless loop. I don't even know how I fixed that one.
15. And on top of all that, the carriages drove on the wrong side of the road. ;)

This is just insane! I don't know how this can be the final product of something. And I'm sure there were other glitches waiting to happen that I just didn't discover. I have never seen this many bugs in any game ever.

But that being said, I finished the game. And if you pretend that those bugs don't exist, this is a really awesome game.

The setting is fantastic. It's set in old London, and it's a mix between steampunk and gothic culture. To be honest, I think I've discovered that steampunk and gothic are the best combination ever. The characters are great. You meet historical figures. The DLCs add some interesting stuff. It just a really interesting environment.

The gameplay was great. It has the Assassin's Creed touch, but it also has new mechanics. I think that this is the only game with the grappling hook, and let me tell you, that is fun. Building your gang can be strange at first, but you learn to like it. And I'll probably say this with every AC review, but YOU CAN CLIMB ANYTHING. That's just so cool.

So if there weren't the glitches, this might be in my top ten games of all time. But those glitches... [angry noises]. But, you can make it through the game. And maybe these won't happen to you, but I don't know. Just, keep what I've said into consideration.",1634515996,1634515996,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The two main characters are good in my opinion, Jacob Frye can seem pretty shallow however i feel he fits into the badass Assassin Dream really really well. This game is one of the best Assassin creed games in recent history, Its disappointing it was mostly overlooked. The Characters can often seem to overlook and set an off tone to the dark dark time of the Victorian Era; However i feel it fits fairly well, it is a nice contrast to it. Plus the dark moments of the game arent exactly too dark, Things most definitely couldve been done better but still, very good. The general combat of the game can feel button mashy but thats how its meant to be, the main point of the combat is to attack an enemy till another attacks and you must counter them and then you need to repeat until one either dies or blocks and then you just guard break. Fairly simple but it gets enjoyable when there are many enemies because of the amount of timing and precise reaction times you must have, it allows for an engaging combat style. However if you are looking for a more complex combat system it isnt here. The side content is generally good all around and leaves you wanting to do alot other than just the main story. Progressions feels good however maybe a bit too fast. 

TLDR Check out the game if you are into industrial revolution/victorian era london aesthetic and time period. Also for a good fair amount of side content thats interesting and a main story that will leave you plenty engaged. Get it on sale for under $15",1634353787,1634353787,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

TLDR: This game is a 6/10 for me and I'd recommend it only to a die hard AC fans and to anyone who want to experience London as a setting.

Now for the Pros: Victorian London looks great, it's gorgeous and well detailed overall. The rope launcher was a nice addition too. The game was decent enough customization (although less than unity) and most of the outfits look great on the characters. I did not experience any major bugs either. Recruiting gang members to infiltrate regions was also quite enjoyable. There are many tools in the game and the stealth aspect is quite strong.

Now for the Cons: The story is quite boring tbh, i never felt the need to know what would happen next. The protagonist Evie and Jacob Frye are just quite bad, Victorian London is a dark setting with child labour and poverty and people getting opressed but the Frye twins present this upbeat tone and act like clowns and the problem is.. their jokes don't really land. Its a weird choice overall. Also Evie and Jacob are pretty much the same, the only difference is at the end of the skill tree which you won't really unlock until the game is almost done which takes away from the point of having two different protagonist in the first place. The villain is a generic bad guy who wants to take over London and also wants the Shroud of Eden. The game looks graphically worse than Unity, the draw distance is super low due to an omnipresent fog, which also reduces performance, because if you remove the fog, you will get a performance boost and realize how bad the city looks at the far end. The combat is the worst I've ever seen, it's literally just button mashing and looks super cartoonish. The weapon types are pretty much none, there are some daggers, cane swords and knuckles. There's also a lack of proper animations and the whole game can start to feel a little repetitive. There are also 40 different side quests, which actually mean that there are 4, copy and pasted 10 times in different regions (cough *dunkey reviews* cough). The parkour is a huge step back from unity, in Unity where you could freely jump about and create cool paths, well now even with similar animation, Jacob lacks the agility, the game also just won't let you freely jump and will constantly try to hold our hands thus reducing player agency. The city although designed very well isn't one for parkour, the streets are super wide and you'd have to use the rope launcher which again being a cool gadget, just throws the parkour out of the windows and becomes a Batman game. The rope launcher also is just terribly under used, it would have been super cool to use it in combat and the kills could've been brutal, maybe even in stealth, even earlier games like Rogue have used rope darts to do similar stuff, why couldn't Syndicate do it too. The horse carriage are also just super weird to handle. The game also has super weird cutscenes in a few moments, and this is greatly magnified in the Last Maharaja DLC. Even GTA San Andreas, a game from 2004 had better cutscenes. The Season Pass of the game doesn't include all the DLCs. The game also has microtransactions.

Now for the DLCs: 
Do not buy the Last Maharaja DLC, its just terrible with the dumbest AI and some of the most terrible mission designs in the game. I'm an Indian and I still had no interest with this DLC. 
Jack The Ripper DLC however was quite enjoyable, its presents a more serious tone, there's a slight sense on mystery about Jack's Identity, the Fear Takedowns are really good, being able to play as Jack the Ripper was slightly unsettling cuz I don't really want to control a serial killer but it presented some good moments of the narrative. Jacob and Evie are also a lot older and wiser and not clowns anymore which was great. The Sherlock Holmes Series styled investigation sequences were also well made.
The Dreadful Crimes is the 3rd and final DLC for the game and *IS NOT* included in the season pass. This DLC goes further into the Sherlock type Investigations and tbh they are really interesting, its quite nice overall but the fact that it isn't in the season pass is still quite bad
The cosmetic items such as the outfits and stuff look nice, it depends on person to person if you like them, although almost all the outfits in the game look great",1633804399,1633804399,False,52,4,0.728303968906402588,0,True,False,False

People were getting tired with the AC formula, which is why they ended up soft-rebooting the series in the next game, Origins. But anyone who skipped this game totally missed out. In many ways it's the pinnacle of the original formula.

The game starts with a bang, with IMO the most exciting intro sequence in the series (although Black Flag is also pretty awesome). Keeping pace with the industrial revolution, your assassin's kit is more powerful than ever—the rope launcher lets you scale buildings even faster than you can descend—which gives a nice sense of ability progression to the overall series. The new abilities don't break the formula though, it's pretty much the same old gameplay you know and love.

Your hideout is on a moving train that travels the entire map. A freaking train! How cool is that? They didn't have to do that for the story or anything, it's really just for the cool factor. I can only imagine the poor programmers and how many bugs were discovered in the engine when you have a moving hideout.

The attention to detail is really good in this game. Case in point: horse-drawn wagons. Wagons in this series goes way back to ACII. Where they sucked. OK, maybe they weren't that bad, but they definitely felt clunky and the missions that had them were bottom tier. Wagons are in the next game after Syndicate too, Origins, where they also suck. You turn your control stick and the entire horse+wagon entity pivots on a dime. No sense of physics. But in this game, Syndicate, they actually took time to get it right. I mean, no one thinks GTA has realistic car handling, but it's close enough that you don't think about it in the moment, and I'd say the same is true for Syndicate.

In terms of historical roster, this game does not disappoint. Dickens, Darwn, Marx, Queen Victoria.

The gang system is a nice addition. It doesn't change all that much, but my favorite part is how it adds a more immediate sense of progression to taking over the map, since you now have buddies you can call in after you've taken over that part of town.

If there is one weakness of the game it's that the missions don't stand out when compared to the previous 8 game of the series. The hot air balloon chase of Unity. The Treasure Fleet of Black Flag. Castello Crasher of Brotherhood, etc.. It's not that the missions are bad—the assassination of [spoiler]Dr. Elliotson[/spoiler] is quite memorable—just that it's hard to stand out when the series has already done so much.

That being said, I'll give a short review. 
The game is fun, I personally love the grappling hook although others would consider it cheating and a shortcut, theres still plenty of parkour to do and explore. Stealth feels same as Unity but polished without the multiplayer aspect, and it feels really rewarding when you put the extra time into collecting resources to upgrade and activities as well as practicing combat. The soundtrack, while I love classical, does not seem to fit most times in chase sequences or cutscenes or even the main part, the fighting. The writing is pretty bad, Evie is okay a bit bland at times but Jacob feels really forced to be the funny guy and attempts to make witty one liners we've all heard before. The characters and villians in this game are really forgettable and stereotyped hard core except for obviously the main 3 characters Henry, Evie and Jacob. I actually like Starrick since he was at least shown more than one sequence. Graphics are GORGEOUS. I love the lighting and everything is beautiful in London. Story is alright. Sometimes really great and interesting and sometimes bland and just feels forced with filler like your typical anime. So all in all, gameplay, graphics are really fun and eye candy. I love it. The writing, story, and soundtrack really hold this game back.

No new mechanics for game play, and an unlikable cast of characters. This AC game took a great period of invention and literature, the Industrial Revolution, and was sadly unable to blend any of it into narrative smoothie. Tasted more like dog food wrapped in a redundant series of 10101.

The only shining moment was when you were transported into WWI via a ""memory"" which had a solid story line involving Winston Churchill and spy hunting.

Well, no. Performance issues aside, Unity was a great game with some real innovative elements (as far as Assassin’s Creed is concerned anyway) and gorgeous graphics. With Syndicate Ubisoft seemed to undo all of that, while also trying out some new things that would be used in the later sequels.
So gone were the beautiful graphics. Now they merely got the job done. Nothing groundbreaking, but at least it ran fine on most of the systems it released on.
Assassin’s Creed Syndicate is by no means a terrible or uninspired game, unlike Rogue, but just a decent one that seems to things mostly by the numbers.

Gone is the extremely detailed city of Paris, instead making room for the more plain, but bigger and higher city of London. I’m indifferent to this one, but I prefer a more detailed and smaller city for sure.
Gone are the more open ways to assassinate a target with it now focusing on a more linear approach instead. Terrible choice.
What has been added are the two playable characters Jacob and Evie, each with their own set of skills. Jacob is more focused on direct combat while Evie is more focused on stealth. A very good addition to the series!
A rope launcher has been added to the arsenal for quick traveling upwards and/or getting in and out (but mostly out) of conflict quickly. Also a good addition as it takes away some unnecessary or unwanted climbing; sometimes you just don’t feel like climbing up, especially with the higher buildings in London.
There are now gang territories that can be conquered. A fun addition that also fits the city of London, but not a very novel one.
Combat has been a little sped up and there are some other small, new features and changes. I think I’ve discussed the most noteworthy ones, but feel free to let me know if I missed out on important stuff.

Multiplayer hasn’t returned, but we didn’t expect it to. Co-op has also been removed instead focusing solely on the single player portion. A weird choice since a 2 player campaign co-op would be ideal. And especially now that you have two entirely different characters to play with.

Ubisoft has never managed to match the graphics of Unity ever again. Instead they opted for a style that would run on most of the systems, thereby steadily increasing the userbase I assume. The graphics absolutely suffice. London is a nice place to play in, but it was a little too dark for my own taste. I can’t really remember seeing any or a lot of sunshine. However, the animations and details of the buildings and environments were as beautiful as all of the other entries in the franchise.
Voice acting, music and effects were also strong as ever.

Assassin’s Creed Syndicate would be the last Assassin’s Creed game to do it by the numbers. This was a decent game, with a good story and a few innovations, but nothing that would blow your mind. I personally experienced it as a step back when compared to Unity.
Anyway, following this game would be a new take on the series and it would return two years later instead of the usual annual releases. Its name: Assassin’s Creed Origins. See you next time!

Edit: Now that ive' finished the game, I've decided to write a proper review. In short, it's fantastic, there are bugs here and there, and it crashes every so often but that didn't bother me all too much.

I loved playing as Evie, it was awesome to have a female Assassin to play as, and luckily she was an enjoyable character and not just pasted in for the SJW's.

The atmosphere is one of the best parts of the game.

In my opinion it's probably the best Assassin's creed game, as it feels like an assassin's creed game, it feels like Ubisoft have gone back to their roots, and made a game similar to the Ezio storyline.

Side note, I say this is the best because Black Flag, while a fantastic game, and probably better in some aspects, it didn't feel like an ""Assassin's Creed"" Game, the same goes for Origins.

I also recommend getting the season pass, as some of the gear you get not only looks amazing, can you give you a nice boost so you can more easily slay Blighter and Templar scum. The Jack the Ripper expansion is also incredible, and the Last Maharaja expansion, while not terrible, isn't great either, I think it's main selling point is the O.P Knife you get for finishing it. Finally, the Dreadful crimes pack is also fun, combine that with Jacob's Sherlock-like outfit, and you'll be having hours worth of fun.",1530333357,1631528568,True,1,1,0.503759443759918213,0,True,False,False

Relatively short for an Assassin's Creed game of such scales - London has to be one of the biggest locations in the entire series (before Origins, Odyssey and Valhalla), yet the story is too short for it. Starrick isn't as charismatic as other main antagonists of the series (compared to Germain and Haytham), and in this one we're playing as already trained assassins. Nonetheless, both Jacob and Evie have interesting personalities, and even if they have barely any character development, they're still interesting to play as and I didn't skip a single cutscene with them. The most boring character, unfortunately, has to be Henry. He's just... there.

WORLD

As I said, London is one of the biggest maps that Assassins ever Creeded. And it's interesting to traverse around it, I found myself just looking at the character walking around at a slow pace, or some dafties playing cricket in the backyard. London feels alive thanks to all the carriages and trains. And surprisingly, every region has its own taste to it. 

GAMEPLAY

Yes, ranking system exists. And yes, it works as a really good way of implementing difficulty. It's up to you if you want to make the game easier or keep it purposefully harder. Nonetheless, you still insta-kill if you use the hidden blade.
I've got no beef with Ubisoft Towers and I honestly wish they kept this gimmick, it really shows what you can do in the world and where you can go. 

COMBAT

Different weapons! Bet we won't see that again. 
For real, it's nice to see an assassin wield something other than a sword for once, and each weapon has its use. Throwing knives are still nice, but the lack of sleep darts makes the game a bit more difficult. Pistols are great for open combat. The combo system is also a nice touch, especially combined with some of the skills from the tree.

SOUND

The sound design is great. My only issue is the soundtrack itself - it's easily the weakest one on the series. Too much quick strings, mostly without any other instruments on the background. An interesting touch, but not fitting for Assassin's Creed game.

TECHNICAL

Surprisingly well-polished, compared to the previous game in the series. Granted, it still has some signature Ubisoft bugs related to NPC generation, but other than that - it's as smooth as an Ubisoft game can get.

CONCLUSION

Buy it when it's on discount. If you want to spend some free time walking around Victorian London - the game's for you.",1631054413,1631054413,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

[h1]Highlights-[/h1]

[b]A lived in world-[/b] I never got tired of observing NPCs, anywhere you stop you can listen in to random conversations. Got to see people playing cricket, bullying each other, conspiring, making sculptures and all kind of things. It's funny to see them react.

[b]Skill Tree-[/b] There is enough hints of upcoming AC games in the syndicate- Levelling up was fun as the skill tree implemented is good. Also, I really enjoyed clearing clearing map. 
Combat is easy since just spamming Parry key is enough, it was enjoyable.

[b]Jacob/Evie switch-[/b] Loved it. With the well implemented skill tree you get to make two characters side by side- Evie for stealth and Jacob for when you want to act first and think later. Aside from gameplay I liked how the duo was used in story as well.

[b]Grappling/Modes of travel-[/b] I liked London more than Paris, roads are often wide hence the need of grappling hook. Grappling also makes climbing a whole lot faster which I enjoyed. There are other modes of travel as well- carriages, trains and boats. Crossing Thames by hopping across boats is just so much fun.

[b]True Assassin's creed-[/b] It continues on with Unity's concept of various ways to do assassination- opportunities/assists. It's quite fun.


[h1]Overall-[/h1]
I would recommend it for sake of exploring Victorian London. The gameplay, skill tree and clearing enemy camps makes it worthwhile.
Buy it when discounted. I never got around to playing DLCs, so may be skip them?

-Stunning graphics
-Beautiful rendition of victorian London to traverse - the environments are very visually detailed and they picked a great setting for this game.
-Satisfying and engaging parkour
-Badass-looking outfits and combat animations
-A pretty fun combat system that lets you pull off cool things like multi-finishers.

[h1] Things I disliked [/h1]
-A boring story and protagonists with almost no personality. There characters consist of the ""rule follower"" sibling and the ""rule breaker"" sibling, and all of their conflict stems from that. The villain also has no personality other than being really evil and doing a lot of messed up things to show you how evil he is.
-If unity was AC 5, then this game is AC 5.5. Very little was done to improve upon the gameplay of the previous titles besides adding a few gimmicks like a grappling hook and character switching. Virtually every mechanic in this game besides the combat is identical to Unity.
-Arbitrary level gating that serves [b]no[/b] purpose other than to artificially stretch out your playtime. The higher level zones aren't meaningfully different than the lower level zones. They have the same kinds of environments, the same kinds of enemies, and the same side content. The only difference is enemy level. Oh and big surprise, you can buy level boosts with real money, because everybody loves buying a game and then paying even more money to skip of the redundant parts that were put there on purpose. 
-Side content is extremely repetitive and copy-pasted. There's like 5 different types of missions, which are mostly the same thing (kill a guy) but with different steps. All of the enemies use the exact same 3 character models. If it weren't for the quality and beauty of environment, playing this game would feel like a chore after a few hours of playtime.

[h1] Final Score: ★★☆☆☆ [/h1]
This game is not all bad, but it really feels like it doesn't need to exist. It's not a meaningful step forward for the franchise and feels more like a proof of concept than an actual game. If you're looking for a similar but more complete experience, I recommend Unity. I give it 2 out of 5 stars.

So I won't do a review of every Assassin's Creed game here and will just focus on the particularities of Syndicate.

As I had played Unity less than one year before, I feared I'd be too fed up with the formula to really enjoy Syndicate. Curiously, I did.

At first, it seemed far too similar to Unity, but in industrial London, which was dark and poor, and globaly less appealing. And the streets being broader and the buildings taller, the free-running took even more time than in Unity.
Then I unlocked the grappling hook.
It's incredible how a very simple gameplay device that lets you skip the more bothering aspects can change a game.

Basically, it's still AC, but faster. And here, faster rhymes with better.
We're back to a Brotherhood-style city with similar activities all around that lets you free the different boroughs. Yes, the activities lack diveristy, but they're really quick to play and so far less bothersome.
And actually, I found the gameplay more varied than usual. You still have the fights and the free-running and the stealth, but you now also have carriage pursuits, carriage fights, and kidnapping (which feels a lot like stealth, but still different).
For once since a very long time, I didn't feel like there were too many things to do (ok, maybe a bit, but not so much).

Story-wise, there's not much, but the characters are fun. Having two heroes to play doesn't add anything to the gameplay, but it creates a cool and original dynamics with funny dialogues. It feels far better that the usual super-human main character that does everything all by himself.
And for once, we see that assassinations actually have consequences, and though it's always easily fixed, it felt like a nice change.

Suddenly, Ubisoft tries to make themselves pass for feminists. Which is a big fail since victorian London was one of the most sexist time and having women in pants walk the street without raising eyebrows from the passerbys feel like a missed opportunity. Plus it's absolutely obvious that Evie was added as a playable character as an afterthought. At least, they didn't screw up her character.",1558261862,1627202057,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

My hours played reflect time spent while online only. Not the amount of time spent playing this game through 2 deployments and on two separate devices. This game is perfect. It was the first to bring in a female assassin, and the premise behind the utilization of character approach. You can actively swap between the Frye twins depending on what approach you prefer. A token to ts elements, the game plays like the older premise of leveled zones with an open world and linear story.  It added a unique method of upgrades, additions, and abilities that are a first for an AC game and was the first game to really trim the fat on the modern day lore (which I personally have always found rather boring).

Regarding ACS, I would recommend it fully. It's narrative is fun, it's gameplay unique, and the London street gang is such a surprising dynamic for AC but makes so much sense and they tied it in so well.

While the visuals are good and the setting within a huge industrious city is impressive, this game falls short in every other way of any previous game. Graphics and controls are better in unity. Story is better in literally any previous game. Weapons and combat are better in all the other games. Vehicles are terrible. Skills and levels are pointless and the gang system is incredibly expensive. This game feels more like a 'Beat 'em up' than an Assassins Creed game, and it is by far the biggest let down.
The Story is terrible - if there even was a story. You play as Jacob and Evie Frye, as they embark on a mission to track down a Precursor Artifact and free London from the Templars. That's it. For 18 hours. You accomplish this by playing many side missions and going on as many wild goose chases as possible, making gameplay incredibly boring. The area takeover missions are dull and repetitive, and in the end pointless. In the end the two characters run off into the distance and it feels like you haven't actually experienced a story at all... was  the whole story just a prologue? Sure felt like it. And the Characters have no development at all. Jacob stays a brash, thoughtless kid who runs around doing whatever he wants, and just feels empty, while Evie is always the caring one but never learns to take action sometimes.
Graphics are nice, but honestly feel like a downgrade from Unity. While London is much larger and far more dense, the cost of losing these visuals just don't seem worth it.
Gameplay has been massively simplified to the point where the game baby-feeds you all sorts of new gadgets and skills that you'll never end up using. The points-based skill system is interesting as it actually lets you develop as a player, but can be annoying if you just want to level up but placed the wrong points in another area. Combat is the worst it has ever been. Sure it changed in Unity, but this is ridiculous. The game has become more of a 'Punching Sim', where I can stab someone 6 times and they still somehow have enough willpower and blood to counter and and defend themselves? Yeah sure, thanks Ubisoft.
Overall, Assassins Creed Syndicate feels like its supposed to be a different game, with completely new combat and a bizarre story that feels like it was mangled just to fit the Assassins Creed overall story. The one good part of this game is the grapple. My god, it made the whole game at least enjoyable for climbing. To bad they downgraded the parcour system they perfected in Unity to make climbing buildings without the grapple pure pain.
Assassin's Creed Syndicate gets a 2/10.

Assassin's Creed Syndicate is the last installment of the Assassin's Creed franchise were the franchise follows it's classic Assassin's game feel. The game is very similar to Unity in many ways but unfortunately for me it is somewhat like a reskin of Unity with some slightly downgrades. 

Syndicate has basically the same parkour as Unity but it is somewhat slower and less fluid. I especially don't like that they changed the leap of faith control. The combat has become more simple and therefore less engaging. The gear system is also somewhat downgraded. On the plus side I do think that being able to switch between two characters were one is specialised in stealth and the other is specialised in combat is quite interesting. I enjoy that in Syndicate you get a skill tree that enhances your assassin's skill progression and that you get different approach methods in some missions. The murder mysteries are a bit more interactive.The main story is not the best one out there but its okay. The map, London is well constructed but it does not feel as alive as Unity's Paris. Neither does the graphics look as good. But honestly it makes this game a sort of AC game were for me it's neither a wonderful or horrible experience to play. 

My only complains that really bothers me is the absurd task that are needed to get all the perks Also the good old hidden treasure chest where some chest will not appear on the map unless you are near them made 100% completion somewhat harder. 

7/10

[h1] DLC: Jack The Ripper [/h1]
The story in Jack The Ripper DLC is somewhat interesting but playing as the Ripper is what shocked me the most. I really liked when I played as the Ripper because it felt somewhat different to the base game. I wouldn't say that the DLC is amazing but it was a nice change.

As someone who has played almost all of the mainline AC titles (except Unity), this was the most polarizing entry I have played so far. On the one hand, there are times where I get sucked into the world and get that classic assassin experience: stealthily taking out targets, exploring the secrets of the world, and bringing justice in the way only an assassin can. On the other hand, there are plenty of times when something would go wrong: usually either the free run mechanics would not work properly, or the graphics would glitch out and obscure my line of sight. 

Speaking of which, it was hard to tell which graphical problems were caused by the game itself (having come off the heels of Unity, I don't know how much was fixed for this game) and how much of it was the fact that I could only run the game on the lowest possible settings. Either way, there have been a lot of cases where the errors have blocked my view and I have to either navigate by the mini map or stumble forward blindly and hope I don't get spotted. Some missions were fine, while others had glitches galore; it felt like a matter of luck. The frame rate would also slow down significantly, causing most cutscenes to stagger the voice lines with their lip movement.

With those issues out of the way, I have still enjoyed the game. The setting is excellent, the missions are the right amount of challenge, and the characters work off of each other fairly well. The line launcher is an invaluable tool for navigating London rooftops, though I have not found a way to do a Leap of Faith off of one (needed for a side quest). I also really liked the weapon choices in this game; a cane sword is just the sort of tool that an assassin would use, particularly in this era of dapper dressers on the streets.

If you are not already a fan of Assassin's Creed, I do not recommend this as your first title; with the extra content to find, it can be overwhelming to newcomers.

If you are a fan of the series, and you have a gaming PC that can handle this beyond the minimum settings, give this a go. I can certainly agree that it feels like the last AC game that takes stealth seriously.

If you are a fan, but do not have a high quality gaming PC, I would recommend finding a console version. This is a good entry for fans of the series, but running it on minimum settings creates too many hassles.",1626202632,1626202632,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This is basically Assassin's Creed Unity + 
Same sprightly and fun parkour, same emphasis on action as much as stealth but stealth is NOT forgotten like in later games. You've got some customization for two different characters you can swap any time you want and they both have a shared treasury but their own skill sets and inventory. 
Intentionally Unity had an emphasis on grace in combat and Syndicate focuses on more of a brawl style with much more involved fights sometimes encompassing multiple gangs. The fun is the focus: more sneaking around and less SLOWLY walking through unskippable cutscenes. 

This game went all in on goofiness with mad scientists mustache twirling baddies, but that works for a series that started out pretty far-fetched and only looks worse when it tries to focus on the 'story' which doesn't make much moral or logical sense (Templars and Assassins are basically just two cadres of murderous cultists at this point). Instead Syndicate focuses more on the adventuresome characters, historical encounters, and outlandish scenarios and this works much better. 

I had a couple visual hiccups (T-poses and clipping errors) but no crashes. I greatly appreciate to option to 'free run down' which Unity did not have so that the Frye twins can vault down from rootops much faster and more efficiently with very few hang ups on architecture. 

The over all tone is simplified. When you get the grapnel any traversal is a breeze. Seems like less an emphasis on finding sync points as much as treasure which gives you less money that before but it does make for a slower and steadier sense of progression than being tossed a thousand gold right off the bat.

This is a much better game than the previous title and feels more like a traditional Assassin's Creed game even if it does feel smaller and shorter than the mainline numbered titles.

Things I like - 
Parkour has been improved but not fixed compared to the previous game where Arno felt like controlling a drunk the character controls in this game feel tighter. Perhaps a bit too tight as I found the 
 player character constantly stopping at the edge of a jump when I would want them to continue by jumping across the traversable gaps. Still, it's not bad.
Carriages - The carriages added a much needed break from running along the ground or parkour and they feel pretty good to drive but the area of London in the game is a bit too small.
The wire - Like Batman, the game adds a wire launcher for quick climbs and quick traversal across rooftops. There were parts when I felt that it would do things that I didn't want to like shoot me up a place instead of across a street, mostly when I was in a hurry, but it works well enough.
Removal of multiplayer - Thank you, that was a failed experiment that most of the time added nothing but frustration with missions designed for multiple people and AI that honestly didn't know how to handle it.
Unique assassinations - More unique assassinations are a great addition and something that I felt was under used in the previous game.
Music - The music and the way it's integrated into the game is amazing. I know it's very subjective but I loved that the music changed whenever you got high up. Combat music was also not grating.
The Thames - Playing Frogger with the ships and barges crossing the river was really cool. That's it.

Things I'm indifferent about - 
Combat - While I find it marginally better than the previous game it went too far in the wrong direction. Combat in the last game was slow, and I swear the game ignored button inputs to make sure you got hit if you were surrounded but here... In a word, it's too easy. In another word, it's too indulgent. Finishers are too long winded, especially the multi kills but you still can't instant counter kill like you could in the previous games.
Multiple Protagonists - Seems like a waste of the concept. The characters play too similarly to really differentiate them and while playing one the other is not even around except in cutscenes. They could have had the second character be back up or something and they could have made the characters play more differently. As it stands there are minor things like 3 skills each that the characters get that are unique but they don't do enough. Even then the game doesn't seem to know how to use them, the female character will get combat missions and the male character will get sneaking missions even if they're ""specialized"" for the opposite.
Experience gain - Not needed. Doesn't add anything to the game that just having better gear adds to the game. A level 1 character can also stealthily assassinate a max level character and if you're openly fighting then you're doing it wrong.
Story (modern and SIM) - The modern Initiates stuff is still cringey as Hell. Don't talk directly to the player like you're talking to a player character. Just don't do it. Add in a lackluster ending and it's just pointless. The SIM story is also fairly dull and outside of a few interesting missions it feels like a pointless side story. Add in another lackluster ending and it's just meh. The Penny Dreadful ones were great though. The Jack the Ripper DLC was also kind of meh with a crap ending.

Things I hated - 
Nothing really. Just minor annoyances that are too small or too petty to really bother with and a few politically biased eyerolls.

Controller I used to review this game: ASTRO C40

----

Assassin's Creed Unity pushed what Assassin's Creed can do with AI and that led to horrible performance issues. While this game cuts down on the AI a tad bit and gives you an amazing game.

Assassin’s Creed is a series that “I like,” I don’t love it (like a fanboy that buys each game on day one) or hate it (for how long the series is). But I like Assassin’s Creed for how in-depth the story is for both the Assassin and the character inside the Animus. One thing that I love the most about the Assassin’s Creed games is the places/city’s the game puts you in. Syndicate has a very 'Peaky Blinders' feel to the game and oh man, I loved every second of it.

First off lets state the obvious, the performance. It's fantastic on the 3900X with 16 GB of RAM and a 1070... it runs flawlessly. Thought it did an ""Ok"" job on my old i5-6600. The game is very CPU heavy so you've been warned. So with that being said I have nothing bad to say about it, the game rarely dips under 58 FPS, constant 59 - 60 FPS.

Gameplay, missions, cutscenes and in-game money. Gameplay, I love it honestly once you get introduced to the 'Grappling Hook,' the whole dynamic and mechanics of the game open up. For cut-scenes when you take over Gang Leaders territories, they're mostly the same with the same animations and dialogue, but in different locations of where the event(s) took place. Missions are widespread throughout the city, they give take advantage of using the whole map. In-game money is somewhat easy to come by, but at the same time it's hard to get if that makes any-sense. Unlike Unity, money can be earned when completing missions. If you are having a trouble time with money, you can spend real-life money (microtransactions) to get more in-game money (don't do this). You just have to experience the game in order to get the full understanding on how everything works, from upgrading your gang to upgrading your outfits/gear.

Where is the Animus by Abstergo? By Sequence 4, the Animus is 5% of this game whole game. No lore outside of the game, I'm kinda disappointed. The Animus is just cut-scenes, you can't wander around. Was I the only one that liked the whole in-real life thing they did where you can wander around the Abstergo company like in Assassin’s Creed 2 and Black Flag?

(I will update this review to include if the Animus is to be found anywhere else in the story.)

-----

Edit: After you complete the last sequence of the story mode a Abstergo scene plays, other than that. Nothing Animus related.

Putting olive trees and pantheons everywhere may look good from far away but cities felt the same and empty overall. However, this is not the case with Syndicate. I LOVED how the Victorian Era London felt alive with its NPCs and beautiful city design. It resembled the Dishonored universe a lot, which is a huge plus for me.

Combat system was not my favorite but oh boy, double assasination is so satisfying that I probably assasinated hundreds of Blighters while just walking in the street. One of my disappointments is actually the lack of variety in enemies. I have to say combat feels really repetitive after a few missions but the game compensates it with assasination missions. 

Overall, I would say Syndicate is a good game. It has its flaws but I can say that it holds up pretty well even in 2021.

[b]the BAD first :[/b]
[list]
    [*]If your level doesn't match minimum requirements, you're in for one hell of a losing battle even with decent reflexes, which shows either laziness or lack of funds (by [u]corporate[/u] over-charge)... and THAT is DEFINITELY not cool in my book. (more explained at [u][b]***[/b][/u] by the end)
    [*]No more jumping at will (except with a combo of keys), so forget jumping -quickly- to save your life or diving in water to avoid being seen... nope. I guess people feared getting wet in London in the 1800's... morphine, nicotine and alcohol were apparently not enough to cure the common cold, eh ?
    [*]No more picking up weapons from dead bodies.... I loved doing that in ""Black Flag"" :'(
    [*]Boring as fuck : do 4 or 5 kinds of missions, fight a gang, repeat...
    [*]Bland environment despite good textures and obvious work on era fidelity
    [*]Gang wars are annoying... where you [b]cannot[/b] aim at your enemy for a nice shot, but THEY can. And, why in THE HELL are your allies watching you fight multiple enemies on your own ???
    [*]You can't harm neutral civilians anymore... even ""by accident"". Boooooo!!! Do I really have to go back to GTA5 ??? Please don't make me :'(

[b]the DISCONCERTING stuff :[/b]
[list]
[*]""Stealth"" is quite different... you don't have to hide bodies anymore. In fact, they will be more like a distraction to the enemy. As if every one of them either became poets or detectives... (comments on regrets or trying to do an autopsy)
[*]I know Ezio was a badass of a character, but with twins... so much MORE could have been done
[*]When revolvers had already been invented by then (era in which Syndicate plays), shouldn't the main character be able to AT LEAST wield a musket ?? ;)
[*]Also, someone PLEASE explain to me why you cannot kill a simple guy in f2f combat with a  one-strike using a blade... I don't understand that (and never will in most video games).
[*]What good is a ""GPS"" when it can't tell that you need to drive ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE ROAD in England ???
[*] Also, I've had my share of supernatural stuff happening on the streets : dancing carriages, rocket-shot horses, Super-people (shooting straight to outer space)... lol

    [*]No more sticky hands, finally !!! (not talking about 詠春 here, but magnetic walls↔gloves)
    [*]You can dodge bullets again... yeah !! ^^
    [*]There is a good blend of former game mechanics with new ones, like ""driving"" horse carriages...
    [*]... which brings us to this new way of going around ""fast"". They are a really nice addition to the game. Travelling can be more fun depending on if you like to drive... like me ;)
    [*]It is graphically decent, with good textures and not too demanding in resources
    [*]The twin characters are somewhat likable, though Jacob can be annoying
    [*]Controller/KB&M support is flawless... but you probably should go with a controller on that one ;)

[u]On the EPIC meaning of this episode :[/u]
[i] The story kinda bothers me... it's basically a thug VS thug all out war... At least in [/i]Black Flag,[i] you could tell that there was a real power struggle, and that the ""hero"" of OUR story was having a hard time dealing with his emotions.
However, here, nonchalantly throwing ""big"" historical names in Literature and Science is not gonna make me change my mind on the ""depth"" of your tale.[/i]



[u][b]***[/b][/u][b] instead of[/b] making areas more complex, enemies harder to trick or making the player use different strategies... nope, [b]ALL areas[/b] are basically the same and grinding will helping you clear them all. This is so lazy and infuriating. [u]THIS GAME COULD HAVE BEEN GREAT...[/u] [b]but it isn't.[/b]

Assassin’s creed Syndicate brings 1800s Victorian London back to life in the eyes of the twin pair Jacob and Evie Frye. Both very likeble characters in my opinion. I think Ubisoft catched the ”sibling attitude” between them very well and Evie is honestly one of my favourite assassins up until this point (2021). She’s especially important to me, as a female gamer, since this was the introduction to a female leadcharacter to the assassin’s creed game series.

In terms of actual gameplay, I prefer this combatsystem over the new ”hitbox” system they introduced in the later games of the franchise. Yes, i know the gameplay can be a little bit repetetive at times but the main quests, that drives the story forward, is where the game truly shines (especially Evies missions).

So my final conclusion is that, if you haven’t been an assassin’s creed fan before, then this game won’t win you over. But if you are a fan of the franchise and wants to try out syndicate, then i don’t think you will be disappointed.

The game feels like a downgrade from Unity. They took out everything great about Unity, the immersive environment, the murder mysteries, engaging side stories (there are some in Syndicate but they aren't as good) and a somewhat engaging story arc for the heroes of the game.

You don't feel as immersed in the Victorian setting. Both the protagonists and the antagonists feel very bland, and leave you with an overwhelming ""meh."" The ""charm"" of the Frye twins wears off fast since the main story feels very diluted. 

The WW1 side mission line isn't very engaging from my experience, but was a nice addition to the game!

The depiction of gang warfare and the bad guys ""a rival gang"" is comical. It's like they were voiced by the same people behind LoTR's orcs and goblins. Some classic lines include:
- ""You killed my friend's, now I will kill you!""
- ""I'll spill your guts!""
- and general grunting.

I haven't played the DLC, just couldn't find myself having the energy to play anymore of this game. But, form what I saw, the Last Maharajah is a broken, badly written mess. While the Ripper seems to be fine, albeit awful writing. You never actually figure out what motivates Jack or get any insight worth the $ they are charging. 

The only way I can recommend this game is if you want to have a virtual tour of London during the Victorian era, or if you pick it up on sale.

Some fun items London architecture. This is always the high point of any AC series and this doesn't disappoint.

Another is the WWI subplot, no spoilers, it had a lot of fun elements and I loved the character's unique costume from it.

Great graphics here & there, útterly boring & frustratring gameplay. Grind, grind, grind to get level-ups needed to get at the heart of the game. It took me 13 hours of frustration and grinding to get at level 6 and get the story (simple as it is) rolling for a bit.

The Longer:

Point is, while the City is rendered in exquisite beauty in all its victorian splendor&squalor, it is álso crawling with clone baddies that are ESP-gifted, and are psionically linked to every other baddy in the vicinity. Meaning, when You attack one in a neighbourhood that isn't Yours, or one of them sees You, the game immediately spawns oodles of baddies, and cops with ""super-batons"" that kill in just a couple of blows. Which -in turn- leads to the standard tactics of : killing..get up to the roof, press ""c"" to go stealth, wait a bit, rinse & repeat ad infinitum. Gang strongholds can be cleared-out in the same manner. A fair bit of that carried-over into AC: digital world...ehh.. ""Watch Dogs 2"" grind, grind, grind. Stealth-kills fix that for a bit, but then the crazy of the ai comes bubbling-up: I tried to stash all bodies from stealth-kills out of sight. Well, I shouldn't have bothered. Stealth kill a baddie. Let the body laying around, and in most cases no-one sounds the alarm despite citizens making a ruckus.. weird.

All in all, the ""open world"" is a frustrating affair that can only be enjoyed from samey-samey-roofs. Get to street level to take-in ""The Sights"" the programmers have so lovingly crafted, and you're in for endless, boring assaults of cookie-cutter baddies.

What's álso seriously annoying is the utterly slów levelling. It feels like a purposely stunted levelling-system to make players spend áctual money on XP-Points. Sneaky, stinky CEO-Beancounter stuff.

On the rest of the game: 

When a neighbourhood is (FINALLY) Yours, only thén do You get to admire the work the programmers & builders put into the game. But, by then, a lot of players will have put-down the conroller for good.

Is the game ""hard""? No, not really. It's rather more like""artificially stunted"" to make it seem ""hard"" but the base-mechanics are all standard AC-fare -apart from the Grapple-Hook, which is a nice addition to shorten trips around The City- with a somewhat wonky stealth-system.

On a more positive note: The clothes of Evie and Jacob, are a Steampunk dream. The rich brocades, something inocuous, like the movement of Evie's cape (loathed by many, oddly enough), the lace, the buttons even, it all defines ""attention to detail"" from people that love to design stuf.

Shame that it has to live in such a mediocre, grindy game. I cannot really recommend it, unless it's in a weekend-sale for $10.- or something.

Edit: You know when it fínally starts to get fun? With a trainer. While only using ""infinite health"", the game became far more enjoyable (for me, at least)

Despite everything, I dó like just aimlessly walking around victorian London. The architecture is spot-on, the atmosphere too.  It also has a tiny bit of steam-punk here and there. Not realistic, and history-purists wil balk at it, but it's fun for me.   Shame that the actual 'gameplay' is mediocre, and grindy.",1491328475,1618437248,False,2,0,0.521383941173553467,0,True,False,False
368500,90307667,76561197986881985,0,19,3475,0,3475,1618399814,"I've played all of the main series (not counting the 2.5D spinoffs). After playing Origins, I decided to come back and play some I'd missed, like Unity (bought from Ubisoft directly) and Syndicate. Unity was not a good game, even setting aside performance issues. Boring story, bland characters, and really boring and repetitive gameplay. Syndicate, on the other hand, is a really quality entry into the series and I think the strongest one since AC2 or maybe Black Flag. It is obviously the last one of the series to retain the old formula of staying within a single city and lots and lots of parkour. I love the newest three games, but they are so wildly different in gameplay, that I won't consider them to be in the same family.

The good - 

Well-written protagonists and their varying abilities let you cater to whatever gameplay style you want. I generally preferred playing Evie due to stealth, but Jack definitely rocks fights.

""Attack the outpost"" missions are varied and enjoyable, more than other typical Ubisoft offerings that came before this one. While each type generally has a formula, they are still fun and provide some challenges at times.

The flavor and atmosphere of Victorian England is well-done. Smoky, rainy, crowded, dirty. The river traffic is fun to interact with, too, hopping from one boat to the next like Frogger.

Fights are well-done and visceral, particularly as your skills develop. NPCs do employ different fighting styles and fights can quickly go the wrong way if you're sloppy.

More environmental options for kills or stealth.

The zipline is a little immersion-breaking as well, but it makes getting around London a ton easier and is a great QOL improvment -  no more wasting time climbing up the side of something.

Using your gang as backup is fun, effective, and they can be upgraded in multiple ways.

The bad - 

The ""bosses"" are not that memorable, outside of the endgame boss and one of his lieutenants.

Carriage chases are annoying, because the streets are so crowded.

Fast travel always takes you to the top of a building and you wind up have to jump off, blah blah. Why not just take the player to the front door?

The camera locks to the player during certain sequences and it's annoying because you want to look down the street or your next objective, etc.

NPC levels feel a little odd in how they relate to player abilities. I never had a good sense of what they actually meant.

The ugly -

No ""choices matter"" in the game. This is jarring, because the characters often comment on the outcome of certain actions, but the player has no agency to choose a different path. The AC series has never really been known for that, but it's always been a glaring issue that really stands out in this game.

It doesn't really effect gameplay much, but the trains just seem odd in the game. They go around a loop like a model railroad. Some weird immersion-breaking moments there.

NPCs just react oddly to a dead body in their midst - ""Ah, you were a good soldier. Now back to pacing aimlessly."" You'd think they'd be a little more alarmed, call in help, something. Kind of immersion-breaking as well.

Overall, though, if you like the AC series, it's well worth getting, especially on a discount. I got my enjoyment out of it and am now moving on to Odyssey again, but don't have any regrets about playing this one unlike some others (looking at you, Rogue and Unity). If you've never played the AC series before, but like action games, it is maybe a good starting point as it is not as dated as the older entries from a technical perspective.",1618419665,1618419665,True,3,0,0.536127746105194092,0,True,False,False

I mainly used the game to do some virtual tourism around London, and that was great as it is typical in the Assassins Creed cities, even though it pales in comparison with revolutionary Paris. That city was one of the best I have ever visited in a game.

Ivy is a bit more interesting, but everyone else are just shallow characters with dull and childish dialogues. 

Unity was a lot more interesting compared to this part of the series, too bad it was buggy at launch.

The zip-line changed the whole dynamic and eliminated parkour as an element of the game. Now you can climb wherever you want or jump from one building to another without any effort, and the extraordinary distances it can get you erodes any realism from the game.

Regarding the inventory, Unity had a much large variety of weapons, now each character has to choose from 3 weapons, which makes fights boring and look all the same, not speaking about the animations which are shown real fast and lack realism. On the other hand, we have two nice skill trees, one for the characters, another for the Rooks, but by the end of the game I didn't need to make many improvements to the Rooks, as they don't seem to add a lot to the game anyway.

The whistle mechanism is back and is also oversimplifying the assassinations, I was so glad they got rid of it in Unity, good thing they didn't add all the stealth in bushes mechanism, which made stealth so easy.

They even tried to use the ""server bridges"" to jump in a different time period, which was played out really cool in Unity, it was a very dynamic and intense transition, a good way to shake things up a bit, here it was a meaningless series of side-quests with the same old story we know. Nothing new, nothing challenging. 

There are some bugs around, but not enough to bother the game play. 

I completed the game to make a full impression about it, but it's not worth it, nothing interesting happening from the story point of view. So there's nothing to see here, I would rather recommend Unity as it adheres to closer to traditional AC's principles.",1617312396,1617312396,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Frustrating that there's no in game map for helix glitches or secrets of London and requires purchasing through the Ubisoft store with helix credits - there's enough rewards from finishing up other collectibles to get ONE of the two maps. Suggest the helix glitches map. 

Zipline tool is very cool, and surprisingly, the carts weren’t bad either. Gang upgrades were pretty funny, and calling up carts with allies on command is great for the transportation and also some of the challenges on missions can be cheesed with the allies. Cart racing, though, was pretty frustrating. It's luck dependent since it's impossible to outrace the other racers; the AI will just speed the other racers' carts up. 

Story wise, the brother-sister pair of deuteragonists are great. It’s cool they both have some different master perks, different preferences for equipment, and different interests leading to different missions undertaken. Makes them a bit more distinct and less bland.

There's not really much to make you root for the characters other than their small story about their father but Evie and Jacob's charismatic and contrasting personalities sorta made up for that shortcoming. Now onto gameplay... well it gets hella repetitive especially later in the game which kinda makes the game a bore tbh. There was a point, more than halfway into the game, wherein i just kinda wanted it to end because the story didn't click for me and the gameplay was just the same thing after the same thing. (Also ngl the last boss fight and ending was pretty disappointing)

That said, the game was still fun especially whenever Evie and Jacob are interacting. The setting was good and the music was personally one of my faves of the whole series. Not the best AC game but definitely underrated.

Playability: 8.0

[b]Pro[/b]

+ A splendid digital London with a beautiful atmosphere and an amazing OST.
+ The first AC with two protagonists. Both unique in a very immersive story.
+ Captivating and frenetic,yet less technical, combat system
+ Lots of things to do in a more classic AC experience...

[b]Cons[/b]

- ...but the last one of the Desmond Arc
- Bugs and glitches here and there.
- It can be repetitive to certain players
- Despite trying for something new, it goes back to well know dynamics of the series.

[b]Overall Verdict[/b]

[b]7.9[/b]: The last true classic AC game of the series. Full of fanservice but in an overall well-designed game with an interesting story, for most of the fans of the saga this will not be a burden but rather a value. It deserves to be tried even just for the historical period in which it is set. The music and atmosphere manage to make the player live a unique experience. Absolutely recommended if on sale.

Good
- The visual design is great; it really looks like London in Victorian setting.

Bad
- Most of the side missions are generic and linear.
- It requires that Ubisoft launcher and account.

Ugly
- Controls. They feels a bit awkward when playing on a PC keyboard, especially on parkour parts.

Ultrawide works in Windowed mode, but is just 16:9 stretched to 21:9 in Fullscreen. This is frankly inexcusable. The game is also horribly unstable, with bursts of crashing every few minutes and occasional hours of stability. I never figured out why.

Quick note that the WW1 section is, imo, the best part of the game. It's vastly less irritating than most of the main game, feels like you're doing something truly essential, and holy shit that costume is stunning.

London is successfully London. It looks great and is suitably huge-feeling, though noticably less dense than previous games. You get around 50 hours of action not including DLC. Missions are split between the twins, and exp is shared so they always feel more or less equal. Skills are identical for most of the game. Evie eventually getting a few unique stealth skills, Jacob gets combat. The grappling hook is really nice. Yay!

Unfortunately the quest design is aimed very specifically at making everything as annoying as possible. There were very few that I rated above 2/5, which is painfully disappointing since all the characters are very well done. None of the region-unlocking minigames are remotely fun and most of the optional quests are just irritating busy-work. The story is pretty good, just mired in mediocre gameplay. There are a few utterly rage-inducing moments that almost made me give up completely.

The economy, so very nearly perfected in Unity, is here deeply unbalanced. Investment is stupidly expensive for very little return, to the extent I only felt the benefits in after maybe 40 hours - by which point I'd made vastly more money just opening chests and completing the wide variety of cash quests.

I've played all AC games from 3 up over the last couple of months. They've all had slightly iffy starts and consistent annoyances. This is by far the worst, and really does feel like it was made by a crew who were exhausted and out of ideas. The world and the characters in it deserve a much better game.",1615066527,1615923074,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[h1]📄 Review of Assassin's Creed® Syndicate [/h1]
[/quote]

[quote]
Assassin's Creed® Syndicate is a 2015 action-adventure video game developed and published by Ubisoft. The siblings Jacob and Evie Frye have to conquer the city of London which is ruled by the Templars and find the Piece of Eden hidden somewhere in the city. The graphics of the game are a bit lower in comparison with Assassin's Creed® Unity but the game itself works way better. There are but significantly less bugs than in the previous part. The Story is fine, but the missions to free London get very repetitive. Although I like the older combat system where counter is overpowered and you can instant assassinate this game still is below the newer parts of the series.

It's really rare I write a review about a game, but after playing this game all the way through I was compelled to act. Not only is this game an insult to the senses in every way imaginable, the gameplay, the story, the recycled characters most notably Jacob Fry who is just a mix of Edward Kenway and that guy from Watchdogs no one remembers. The creators with Ubisoft at the helm have seemingly grown tired of anything that resembles quality or joy in their products and rather is scarily close to turning into Stalin of the game world, a position currently inhabited by their self-proclaimed enemy and biggest competitor - EA. They shit all over their users with the most notable example with Unity in which they released an unfinished product at full price, and only offering compensation several months later after a massive backlash extremely rarely seen among consumers, but forcing customers wishing to accept the peace offering that they could not anytime in the future sue Ubisoft over Unity. 

And with this stinking pile of garbage they have not only put together a cliche-filled, gameplay-broken, lazy approach to gaming by taking the standard template they seem to just be recycling for every annual game, but they have more importantly completely ""forgot"" to optimise it after release since it after all was a much better release than Unity in that it was actually playable upon release. UBISOFT - this has been said way too many times already that it borders on customer service cliché, but I have a sincere hope that there is still some good people left at your companies who believe the magic and beauty in beautifully crafted games. That games are not only a way to pass the time and shoot some bad guys, but that can enlighten and broaden ones minds and transport oneself to a different world, a different time. I must believe that is what the creators of AC 2 were embodying when they created what is, in my opinion not only the finest AC game to be released, but one of the best sci-fi games of this generation. You got everything right: the location, the story, the gameplay, the sidemissions, the graphics, the music - and most importantly, you respected your audience in delivering something to be proud of, and something you felt your audience deserved. For those responsible for that piece of art - I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart. 

And to those who have become mindless robots churning out what has - UNFORTUNATELY - become a yearly tradition of shitting all over audiences, I will never forget, but I still have hope you will redeem yourself before this franchise finally runs out of steam. Finally, I just want direct my attention to the head of Ubisoft - Yvet Guillemot (or how its spelled). You sir are responsible for what have befallen this beloved and excellent franchise, and you will ultimately have to answer to all those fans you have dissapointed time and again, and who miracelously come back for more every single year, myself being one of them, because they still have hope that the franchise might one day be great again. Chances that you'll ever see this I release is close to none. But hopefully, when enough people complain and force your eyes open, you will see what you have become. 

I hope for that day.

Ok, first of, this game is beautiful. The settings, the character models, the lighting. And also, the combat mechanics are well made and the feeling that you get while travelling with the grappling hook is great. That was everything great and well done in this game. Now I´ll cover everything else.

1. The performance
While playing this piece of art (in terms of graphics), the game often started lagging and freezing, making me have to wait a large amount of time until I could move again. At some point, I found out that Whitechapel did´nt want me to uncover the rest of the map via viewpoint, freezing and closing the game every time I´m too close (less than 200 meters was the limit) and I had to set the game to the lowest graphics possible, making it a pain to look at and still lagging the game out as much as possible. There also was this mission called ´´Hullo Mr Gatling´´ where you had to use a gatling gun against loads of enemies (obviously). This mission made me stop playing this game as it made the game freeze. When I tried restarting/leaving the mission, I got sent into the room of infinite Blackscreen as punishment for me trying to get rid of a problem. But don´t get me wrong; the game lagged everywhere, that wasn´t the only place to freeze the game forever.

2. The parcour
The parcour in this game is one big mess. It´s in no way optimized for pc. It´s a pain watching Jacob and Evie struggle getting over a wall lower then their body height. The only thing well done in terms of parcours is the grappling hook. Which also doesn´t work every time. The parcour still works, it´s just not too good.

3. The combat system
The other thing well done in this game. While the weapon arsenal isn´t big, it´s unique and cool. The cane sword looks cool, the combat while using the brass knuckles looks amazing and the kukri knife somehow just fits in the game world. Throwing knifes are cool, the revolvers are a cooler looking and a  louder alternative, there are smoke bombs (well, they are there) And there are poison darts ( I didn´t use them). Sadly, you couldn´t use the grappling hook as a weapon, but that´s okay. 

4. Storyline
I played this game for 17 hours and I really wasn´t interrested in the story, but that´s just me. 

5. Summary

As said, the game looks amazing and the combat system is great, but the parcour is just not good, the glitches make it uncompletable and (for me) the storyline is not interresting.

Would I recommend this game?
-Yes
Would I recommend it on PC?
-No
Would I recommend it on console?
Definetly

If you want to play this game, then play it on console (if you have one), trust me.

After Unity (which I hated), I finally got to play Syndicate and visit a time period that interested me a lot more than the (first) French Revolution. And we have never been closer to the Modern Era in an AC game than in Syndicate which is set in Victorian London.

The game manages to improve almost all aspects of Unity, mostly by simplifying mechanics. This applies mostly to the combat, stealth, and parcouring. The addition of the grapple hook is totally nicked from Batman but it works and it's fun to use. With it and the carriages getting around London is not as much of a slog as navigating Paris could be. There is a lot less clunkiness and bugs overall.

The only aspect that is noticably weaker are the graphics. Coming from Unity, Syndicate will just look bad even on Ultra settings. It has its moments and it's certainly not an ugly game but Unity was leagues ahead. Of course it came with steep hardware requirements and a host of performance issues.

In London you will encounter a ton of historical figures such as Charles Dickens, Karl Marx, a young Fred Abberline (only a sergeant at the time) and someone very surprising after the final mission. There are also nods to Sherlock Holmes and you can find Lewis Carroll reading the Jabberwocky poem in a park.

Naturally the game suffers from the Ubisoft affliction of way too many map markers. The amount of *stuff* you can do is overwhelming. Collectibles and generic missions are around every corner. At some point, I just started watching Lindsay Ellis video essays on the side while exploring the city and it was surprisingly relaxing. There is also a completely split-off area of the map set in World War I London where you play as a descendant of the Fryes, doing basically the same missions as in the main game but with a slightly different touch. It's alright.

The main story is better than Unity which, to be fair, isn't saying much. There are some minor plot twists but on the whole you will probably not be surprised very often. The villains - Templar Grandmaster Starrick and his goons, the gangs controlling the boroughs of London - are cartoonishly evil with zero redeeming qualities. The grunts look like someone really liked the thugs from Dishonored but thought they'd be pretty in red and green, too. Seriously, even the physical proportions are reminiscent of Dishonored (which is weird because the overall realistic art style doesn't match that at all).

The protagonists - Frye twins Evie and Jacob - are genuinely funny at times. They are perhaps not brilliant, complex characters but they are alright and I enjoyed playing Evie. Yes, she is a bit of a Mary Sue but I was personally not that bothered by it. I liked her sass and being female myself, it was nice to finally play a woman in an AC game (no, I'm not counting Liberation). Her romance [spoiler]with Henry[/spoiler] is sweet and casual, and it's worlds better than Arno/Elise. Not that that's difficult.

The ending [spoiler]was basically the Unity ending, only this time the good guys all survived, yay.[/spoiler]

As far as the modern day plot goes, there is really nothing at all beyond some cut scenes featuring Shaun and Rebecca. I loved it because I love those two dorks to pieces, and don't you dare kill them off, Ubisoft. There were plenty of throwbacks in Victorian London as well (visiting Edward Kenway's manor is part of the main quest).

What I found hilarious is how badly the game tries to imitate AC II / Brotherhood. Retaking the city by claiming strongholds feels very much like those old games but it's also the interface (red / white again) and even the UI sound effects that are so very Brotherhood. The soundtrack is very different though, it fits the setting perfectly.

Overall, I can recommend Syndicate *but* primarily for fans of the AC series. If you strip out the nostalgia, it's probably not very engaging. I liked it mostly based on the fact that it's a huge improvement over Unity and because of my fascination for the time period. I don't think I'll replay it down the line but it was nice.

The art design of industrial London makes for a nice setting, however, that is where the good stuff ends. 
The story is very generic and boring. The villain is supposed to be this well collected and cunning Templar leader that also has bat-shit, psycho fits when something does not goes his way. He is lame.
The generic enemies are 90% just people wearing red coats. Early game they can very quickly kill you, but will a little bit of investment into skills or gear they are trivialized.
You get the most interesting gadget very early which is the Batman style grappling hook/zip line. It is nice because it allows you to skip over one of the worst parts of the game which is the movement. I've played a lot of other Assassin's Creed games and never have I had so much difficulty trying to get my character to do something as simply as walk up or down a 1 foot tall fence. The climbing/parkour is really bad and I am not sure why.
You get guns which can be fun to just aim and head shot enemies to quickly eliminate them but there are only three types of melee weapons; kukri, cane sword, and brass knuckles. They all feel virtually the same, disappointing. 
I struggled to finish this game and probably skipped most of the side quest memories and couldn't bring myself to play the Jack the Ripper DLC.

WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD. The story is about the two protagonists: Evie and Jacob Frye. Two assassins who kill the henchman of Crawford Starrick. One day they want to do better and ultimately defeat Starrick from getting the piece of eden. 
The combat is amazing to me, the combat is easy to get used to, but this doesn't mean that you will not die. The combat is actually more hard than easy, because some of the enemies have LITERAL ONE SHOT WEAPONS. 
The characters are extremely likable, the jokes mixed with the seriousness makes some amazing characters. You can even meet Charles Dickens to Queen Victoria!
The death scenes are absolutely amazing. I won't go into great detail but they have perfect lines, music that goes so well with the pure craziness in each villain, and so much more that just makes the death scenes perfect!
The assassination missions are the best things about the game though, the one that stands out the most is the assassination of Maxwell Roth. He will be a brief ally until he blows up a house with children in it (don't worry you save them). This leads on to you going to a show he is holding where, surprise surprise! You have to assassinate him! In the show  Everyone will have to wear theater masks which leads into a little trick Maxwell pulls on you. He will put out his henchmen in the exact same clothes that HE wears as a decoy. Once you kill all of them, he will show himself and burn the whole place down. This leads into the best assassination mission in the game, and the best death scene in the whole game.

Syndicate takes the gameplay of Unity and smooths some rough edges. It should've been better than Unity, but for me personally it wasn't.
The reasons are actually very simple:
1) While Syndicate adds a couple of new activities and a couple of new mechanics, it still felt to me more like a clone of Unity set in London rather than an original game.
2) Some of the secondary activities I enjoyed the most in Unity were either removed (the Nostradamus verses and Helix glitches) or transformed into a minor game mechanic (crime investigations).
The music is pretty lacklustre, although there are some rather nice pieces. But I really liked the work Austin Wintory did on the Banner Saga and that's why his work on this game is pretty disappointing.
The voice actors are pretty good, but not brilliant. I can't blame them, though, because sometimes the lines they were given are...
That's when we get to the Achilles Heel of the Assassin's Creed franchise: the story. Syndicate is not an exception to the rule as its story is bland and boring and the characters' personalities are left undeveloped. Even meeting some important historical figures, such as Charles Darwin, Charles Dickens, Karl Marx or even Queen Victoria herself, doesn't save the mediocre script.
The only reason I recommend this game was given in the first paragraph: I believe that the fans of the franchise won't mind the drawbacks I mentioned. If you are new to Assassin's Creed, though, there are better choices to start from (practically any other game in the franchise).
Assassin's Creed Syndicate is the proof that Assassin's Creed went into stagnation and needed some important changes. Luckily, the Ubisoft bosses recognized that fact and the newer games in the franchise go in a fresh direction.

This game is revolutionary, The semi RPG/Crafting and upgrading system can be a little bit of a   headache, but it was something new that the Guys at Ubi tried. And they nailed it perfectly in this game, unlike Odyssey, This game is an almost perfect balance of RPG (the crafting, stats with items you either buy or craft, multiple weapons and cloth choice which you can buy and need to have an level to even use it) with the plain old AC formula, added a little bit with the mechanics from AC Unity but a little bit Tweaked.


The parkour, was dissapointing, to say the least. The Parkour was tweaked and was in end killed, you cannot jump or fall to your death, because your own mistake, you can't also jump from somewhere low to land on the ground faster. You now have to use a Rope Launcher to move faster.


The new system with points could've been better, BUT it's great, if you are looking for a good ac which is balanced, you could try unity but this is Syndicate we are talking about. If you want to level up you need to spend your points on abilities which you only get only some skills. 


The game could've done better, but it's good as the last Balanced AC game. You should buy the game :))",1612870083,1612870083,True,1,0,0.515151500701904297,0,True,False,False

I have been playing Warframe recently, where the controls are fluid and extremely quick with a lot of fast paced action. Transitioning to this game, whew the controls feel heavy and awkward, especially those surrounding the use of carriages.

Besides that, game is good, and playing it in 2021 it feels a little aged, but the graphics, look and atmosphere of the game is still pretty good. You invade people's home they will appropriately respond by coming to shove you, you kill someone in the streets, and they will gather in a circle to admire your work. If they witness you killing, they will run shrieking from you, albeit not very fast. You can play this game stealth, or just come out and brawl, shoot and ram every enemy you meet.

The main problem I have with this game though, yes it is an assassin stealth game, but you have 2 characters 1 built for stealth and 1 built for brawling, but the story and side missions require you to use them for the other purpose and I feel the it makes the specific character trees useless if they are just going to ask you to use the brawler to stealth and the stealth to brawl, especially in the mid game where you need to be careful where you put your points into since you cant upgrade everything yet.

Fun game, excellent designs behind the NPCs, the outfits and levels, excellently written villains like Pearl and Maxwell, but the story is rather bland.

The sad thing is that UBIsoft could make better games if they just considered what players actually like. 

For example the the train fire mission was a pain and NOT fun at all. Easy enough to get to the train but putting out the fires was just stupid. It ruined the game and I stopped playing there. I would have continued if I could bail on the mission and do something else.

Limited weapon selection pretty much makes combat a variation on hack and slash - it's kind of silly actually. 

Also the AC franchise in general is stuck with this animus nonsense that few care about and most just frantically try and skip the insanely long and useless cut scenes. 

It is sad because UBIsoft has some of the best game developers around but in all their franchises they seem to lack good direction.

The writing and dialog are fine, but overall it's just delivered in a way that is frankly boring.  I've never felt more bored or in a hurry to finish an AC game.

I pretty much like every genres (the location, the time, the story, etc)s Assassin's Creed has been using so far.

So, what's the problem with this game? Many things unfortunately.

I'll start off with the positive:
-Really great music if you love classical/victorian era music, it makes the atmosphere way much more better, really, it is probably the best point of this game.
-A map that has the right size for an Assassin's Creed game.
-Nice graphics and textures but... See negative.
-Principal assassins (Jacob and Evie) looks pretty cool and promising enough, so does the other characters, such as Henry Green, perhaps not as much as Ezio and Altair but he looks pretty decent, not as much as Jacob and Evie though.
-Throwing knives

Here's the neutral points, depending on the whom, it could be a negative point, for me, it is but it's not that bad anyway:
-There are no swords in this game.
-Not every costumes from previous games are available, unfortunately, not a disaster, but would have been good to have them.

Now, the negative:
-Ugly textures not only from far but from close too, graphics are okay, they're not that great actually, textures are pretty good but depends of what and the lod (distance view) is kinda horrible considering the age of the game, plus it is nothing like in the E3 but that is to be excepted from Ubi isn't?

Now the even more negative that makes me hate this game more than liking it:
-Microtransactions, you've heard that right, optional? Hey kid, I don't care that it is optional or not, it's already an overpriced game, why should there be any cancerous crap like this in a game like this?
-Gameplay has been dumb down, there are some good things about it but it's too easy that it is too hard, get what I mean? Probably not, the gameplay is too basic, I don't know if it is me, but there are things you cannot do anymore.
Double air assassination? I don't know what's wrong with it but it seems like you have to be really close to the two persons otherwise it won't work like in the previous Assassin's Creed games, it's really bad.
Jumping and running, what the heck is this? Can't you just keep the formula of Assassin's Creed II: Brotherhood? That one was way better than the ones we are getting recently. I mean, you could jump anywhere and dies from it while in this game, it won't let you jump, like some kind of anti-noob measure? Yeah no, but thanks, no, I don't want that crap.
Running and jumping feels so simplified, if you want to drop off you have to repeatly click ""E"" (default keyboard key) instead of holding it once and dropping (and die if you're too high) like you could in the previous games.
I could be making a big paragraph about the gameplay that would take me 1 hour to write but I'll end it here, you get the idea of what I'm trying to say about the gameplay of this game.


In the end, I would suggest this game, but the gameplay is so simplified, I don't like it, I can't stand it, otherwise, it looks like a good game with flaws here and there.
Don't buy it for more than 15$.

If you are new to the series and or are a casual, you'll probably love this game if you love the steampunk/victorian era but if you are a previous Assassin's Creed players who likes the gameplay of the first games then this will be a downside to you.

Honestly, I would except the up-coming games to get more complexe and harder, but I was wrong, they really went mainstream, Assassin's Creed should not be an easy game, it should be an challenging game with a complexe gameplay, or at least, that's my opinion.


Music overall 9.5/10 - This is for the OST that has no singing, don't really care about the OST that has singing.
Characters overall 8.7/10 - Nothing more to say about that.
Graphics/textures 6.5/10 - Could and should have been way better than that, we are PC gamers after all, not console gamers.
Map design and size: 8.5/10 - It is pretty detailed and its size is just good for a game like this, would have been great to have more (small) maps than one though.
Microtransactions -10/10 - What are they doing here? Feeding Ubi greediness and incompetence? 
Gameplay and difficulty 4/10 - Try again next year.",1506969844,1610966137,False,6,1,0.554253339767456055,2,True,False,False

[b]Intro[/b]

Assassin's Creed Syndicate, set in Victorian Era London, you can play as two twin protagonists Evie Frye and Jacob Frye. 
Honestly I really enjoyed playing this Assassin title, again as they usually do, they carried a few mechanics and features from their previous game Unity and improved them here, such as the many ways to infiltrate an enemy base to assassinate your target and the investigation side quests felt more polished and interesting.

[b]PROS:[/b]

+ The many challenges the game has which keep giving you that sense of accomplishment;
+ Ubisoft achievements;
+ Game progression system will keep you hooked featuring an improved and better way to adquire and upgrade skills;
+ Crafting system to upgrade your gear for even more progression dopamine hits; 
+ Combat system is really smooth and fun to play;
+ New weapons to try;
+ Outfit customization and unique outfits;
+ ROPE LAUNCHER which at first it may seem weird in an Assassin Creed game but it's really fun and fast paced to use it!;
+ Recruit a Gang to run around with and help you - Also gang upgrades!;
+ Chariot Races;
+ Brawls;
+ Graphics still look great as of today;
+ London looks great, feels so good to play a game in this era and place, each Assassin Creed's game makes me feel like I've visited these places at that point and time;
+ Optimization is way better than Unity;
+ Your main base is a train;
+ The story is interesting enough to keep you going, though it's not ACII/Black Flag/Origins level imo;
+ You can switch between the twins to play and they are somewhat interesting characters, specially Evie;
+ The DLC Jack The Ripper was really fun to play;
+ No multiplayer achievements;
+ No bugs that I remember honestly.

[b]CONS:[/b]

- There isn't as much movement freedom as there was in Unity;
- Parkour also feels weaker compared to Unity;
- Turns out to be repetitive when you're collecting stuff;
- No steam achievements/cards.

[b]FINAL VERDICT[/b]

Honestly it's been a while since I played this game, I don't really remember having any major con that stopped/frustrate me from enjoying this game, it's a really good game and totally worth on sale to pick it up. Even if you already played Origins and Odyssey, this one still feels ""fresh"" not outdated and it's progression system will keep you hooked as those two games do as well.(not as much though) It's also not a bad starting point if you're unsure about older titles being outdated or not. (Though Black Flag doesn't feel outdated at all and really is a good outstanding AC/game to start on, storywise ACII is really a good starting point as well) You can check my other AC reviews if you want for PROS/CONS.",1610769658,1610820328,True,46,0,0.81274491548538208,0,True,False,False

I would consider the game a slight step down from Unity, but the characters are engaging and overall the game still captures the blend of history and fiction. The music in this game is amazing, which surprised me as I never found music to be a notable strength of the AC series. Advanced parkour mechanics from Unity are refined which is the best parkour mechanics in the series imo. Overall, I'd give it an 8/10, but I absolutely love the series until Odyssey so my review might be a little biased in favor of the game.

EDIT:
Having now completely 100% sync the main game I will say that this game sucks for completionists. Side characters such as Darwin and Dickens are great characters that should be more involved in the main campaign. But almost all associate activities are forgettable. The Duleep-signh activities are riddled with multiple breaking bugs i.e. quests completing before characters finish talking, getting GER'd into an infinite death loop until a reddit forum from 5 years ago told me how to exit this game breaking bug.

TLDR:
For a casual assassin's creed fan who enjoys the stories and characters this will be a great game. For a completionist that fights for every achievement and quest, this game will make you suffer more than any of the previous titles, it is just too oversaturated with mediocrity and grind.",1608605812,1610752159,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

I was biased to believe that it was bad, but it ended up improving on everything that Unity stood for.

This is the truest Assassin's Creed to date. Both side content and main story missions are filled with assassin sandbox objectives and it's a delight to be able to be a proper assassin, scoping the area, picking guards 1 by 1 and outgunned and outnumbered, but prevailing over the opposition. Child Labor, Templar Huts, Gang Strongholds, Cargo Steal - encourage you to be the best, to recon, to utilize tools, to be a badаss. You can kill gang leader before actual gang war. Ziplines are a welcome addition, the cover system is better.

The assassinations are better than Unity. All of the Assassination story missions present unique settings and opportunities, ""Unique Kill"" is great, there are barely any fail states. Lambeth Asylym, Buckingham Palace, Bank of England, Alhambra Music Hall - so many well designed missions.

The new combat system is tough to start getting used to, but once you level up and start using Multi Kills, it becomes very satisfying. I even completed fight clubs deliberately, to farm Quadra Kills.

The music is very good. Free exploration and stealth infiltration music - masterfully crafts the atmosphere, impressively interesting timbres and arrangements. The soundscape of industrial London, with all sorts of alarms, horns, whistles, metal and machines feels very inspired and a must to experience.

The story has it's bad moments and I was planning to rant about it a lot, but no, I ended up being completely satisfied, the framework in which it operated was very good. (kill 7 henchmen and the main bad guy after)

[h1]I really liked this game - but unfortunately it's not a good game. The game is bloated. This game is a slog and chore to grind up to 100% with zero payoff. MOST of the side content is amazing, plainly good - this game's problem is that there is just too much of it! By the 10th hour of going through only side content, there won't be anything new for you to see. The collectibles are as terrible as in every Assassin's Creed game.[/h1]

After I completed the final mission, the game has yet unlocked more side content for me to do - Queen Victoria missions. You really can't help, but need to all the hard work not to go to waste, can you Ubisoft?

Bell, Dickens, Darwin, Victoria, Nightingale - none of them are of any value to the actual plot, most of them are present for like 1 mission in the entire storyline. They couldn't shoe horn Karl Marx into the story missions, and so his side content is unlocked abruptly and without introduction. 

[h1]The game is designed around the idea of ""take famous person -> make protagonists run errands for them""[/h1]

The races are bad, probably the lowest point of the game. Need for Speed Underground levels of rubber-banding on opponents part.",1610484969,1610484969,True,3,0,0.527617216110229492,1,True,False,False

Overall feels empty and pointless and I struggle making myself complete the game.

The combat feels like im fighting cartoon characters (To be fair, that was probably the idea) and is incredibly slow. The parkour is the exact same as with unity, but buggy and clunky. The grappling hook ruins the point of parkour though, so it doesn't really matter. Oh and the grappling hook ruins the point of parkour, which completely tosses any motivation to climb anywhere right out the window.

Progressions sucks with both characters having different levels, because you have to constantly switch to keep them somewhat in sync. Otherwise you'll have a level 13 Jacob and a level 7 Evie. And at that point it's just awkward.

This is one of the best games in the entire Assassin's Creed Franchise. Lots of great new ideas like the grappling hook, horse carts (with ram ability to take out enemies in pursuit), and various in-game activities (like boat raids, cargo escorts/hijacks, templar hunts & gang strongholds etc.) keep the game ""fresh"" and give you tons of things to do to besides the excellent main missions. Especially liberating districts from enemy gangs is lots of fun, as you get to take out their operations by force (be it by liberating children from sweatshops, kidnapping leaders, taking out templars or rampaging through their strongholds). 
A true highlight of the series - I actually liked this one more than Unity & Origins, i.e. the predecessor/successor titles. If you love the AC franchise, this game is a must. If you don't like AC, you probably will change your mind once you've given this game a try. 
The only thing I dislike about the game is that it gives you a choice between two characters, but then goes on to disregard your choice for some specific missions (which can only be played as one of the two protagonists exclusively). But given the overall quality of the game, that minor flaw can be forgiven.
While the main game is set in 1868, you also get to see a small part of London (around Tower Bridge) in 1915 in a side mission storyline. The Jack the Ripper expansion is set shortly before the turn of the century, and is the best part of the game.
While the game itself is good, the Jack the Ripper expansion/DLC is close to a masterpiece. The lighting, the athmosphere, the special moves, the new activities - absolutely amazing. I just wish they hadn't ruined the story with a predictable ending that reversed daring choices earlier in the storyline (I would've preferred more open & unclear outcome, and thought the main game protagonist was made to look ineffective and weak in the storyline of the expansion), but that doesn't change the magnificent gameplay.",1600646398,1610238846,True,0,0,0.481049567461013794,0,True,False,False

The gang mechanic was interesting, although on multiple occasions gang members showed up (during missions even) when I did not call them and started randomly killing Templars or Blighters. This caused multiple mission failures and the impossibility of getting some mission challenges/side quests because of their antics.

I was not afraid of the antagonist. He seemed like a robber baron who just lost his chain of command.

The good: the setting is incredible. I love how they did Victoria-era London and was delightfully disgusted when I did the asylum quest. Carriages were also incredible. The city felt alive, it felt moody, it felt bustling and dirty and smelly - just I have read London was in the 19th Century.

I didn't give this game a fair shot when it first came out, I didn't have the patience then that  I now have for tackling certain lengthy stealth missions. The game is gorgeous, I mean they captured the dirty industrial age so It's not like mountains and fields of flowers gorgeous but it is so damn well designed. Evie and Jacob easily jumped up to being some of my favorite assassin's in the series. I know that's considered blasphemous in many fans eyes when Altair and Ezio exist but I was enthralled in my 30 hours of play. Having to level the two up separately forces you to spend time with the both of them and if you wanna be a powerhouse by the endgame then you'll most likely tackle all of the missions available. I wont spoil any interactions with certain figureheads, I know Syndicate sits at being around four games ago but this could still be a fresh experience for some. 

Taking place after Unity, I did feel a little bit restricted in terms of customization. Where's Unity allowed you to choose from single swords to heavy swords, axes to spears and even rifles as well as a wide variety of costuming options. Syndicate will let you choose from three weapon categories: Kukri Knives, Sword Canes, and Knuckle Dusters. Fortunately for me, I loved each of them and spent a lot of time playing with each of the weapon classes. You even get to choose from a variety of pistols which are surprisingly fun to use and you will use them often. Something that was interesting about Syndicate was that some of the rarer items could only be crafted by rare materials, rare materials that could only be received through doing certain missions thus incentivizing you to play through them all.

Another fun addition was forming your gang ""The Rooks"". I didn't use them nearly as much as I should have, once fully upgraded, you can even summon a carriage full of them to your aid and at max level they are just as powerful as the enemy AI late game. There are a variety of activities to do with them form carriage thefts to train robberies (damn, kind of want a Western Assassin's Creed now. Anyone else? Remember the ""secret project"" in Black Flag lol.) to turf wars and cargo escorts. As with plenty of the other Assassin's Creed titles, there is still some buggy AI and this will lead to some frustrations. Tailing missions are a plenty and in terms of the parkour mechanic, it felt like a slight step back from Unity. This lead to either Jacob or Evie going in directions that aren't exactly where you were pointed even if the path looked clear, quick fixes though. Just change your path.

Overall Assassin's Creed Syndicate was an awesome game and I'm glad I gave it a second chance. Now on my way to Origins, I start to get into what some have referred to as the Mythology series. I can only take this to mean that there is some Egyptian Mythology in Origins, and Greek for Odyssey. I have also heard that the next few are rather large installments in the franchise, I personally can't wait.

The story is weakest part of the game. Even though Evie and Jacob are interesting characters, the story doesn't have any emotional impact at all. Evie and Jacob just show up in London and are given a list of templars that they have to take out. Not much more to it than that.

Game play wise, this is very good and it plays much better than older Creed games. The combat has been reworked, so you are not just waiting for the enemies to strike so you can counter them. The parkour elements are much more fluid, with separate buttons for going up and going down. Also, you have a grappling hook this time, so you can get to the top of any structure in seconds. 

However, the real star here is the city of London itself. It just looks great and feels authentic to what the city would've looked and felt like in the 19th century.

Despite it looking pretty and feeling very Londonish, it just doesn't feel like there's much holding this game together.

But 3 hours in and I don't feel gripped by the narrative, or the combat, or the exploration or the gang management... or basically anything about this game. It all just feels very muted and disconnected, not enough to keep me actually entertained rather than just present. It's like they said to themselves ""I know all the stock parts of an Assassin's Creed game, let's do it again"" and that was it.

The integration of the narrative with the gameplay seems very half-arsed too. I started playing, I got to London after playing a couple of disjointed missions, then one character expresses an interest in being a gangleader and sooo... now they're a gang leader, with no particular preamble. I defeat a random gang boss by kicking him off a train and sooo... now I have a train with a load of management options and a bunch of other characterless characters thrown in, okay... how... entertaining... what relentless progress I am making by doing these otherwise boring tasks.

This just feels joyless and the whole game feels like a foreshadowing of the single player MMO direction that the games ultimately took.",1606753893,1609117119,False,31,4,0.631530404090881348,0,True,False,False

The one area that the game shows clear execution is in making sure that it takes up enough time to negate your refund period in order for you to get a bare glimpse at the open game world proper, thanks to their barrage of linear introductory missions through which they pretend to entice you with their immensely forgettable characters.

I've just hit 100% on both the main game and the Jack the Ripper DLC, so while it's still fresh on the memory. Some of it is in spoiler text. Look at these bits at your own peril.

[h1]What I really liked:[/h1]
- The world opened quickly and is, from that point on, fully accessible. There are conquest activities that are usually interesting and well made, and plenty of collectibles.
- Dreadful Crimes (DLC) was very well thought out and definitely recommended if you liked the murder mysteries in AC:U. They've improved by miles, I figured them all out from the clues and none of the solutions felt incredible farfetched.

[h1]What I liked:[/h1]
- I've played through the game as Evie, except when forced to play another character. This is because the game has implemented a smart system where either of the twins has a unique playstyle. Jacob favours combat and Evie favours stealth. I like being stealthy, so I picked Evie. Also, during the game, Jacob's only redeeming quality is his top hat and that's never a good thing.
- The main story is entertaining, but the end is super predictable if you've played any AC game before. It ends just like [b]all[/b] the other ones. No specific spoilers, but none are needed. I don't care very much for the 'witty' arguments Evie and Jacob seem to be continuously having, but I can see how others might enjoy that type of dialogue as well.
- Freerunning has definitely improved, but the characters still stick to the Arno school of never giving up on ledges. When you're trying to move fast and precise, the system seems to be fully intent on making the wrong calls when it comes to freerunning, but I suppose this is to be expected from the AC series by now.
- Jack the Ripper (DLC) introduces a mildly interesting new concept of using fear as a weapon. You play through brief sections of the game as the bad guy, which might be seen as enjoyable to some players (but not me, I just powered through to get back to enjoyable bits). The DLC also adds a serious amount of content, which will make it worth your money.

[h1]What I disliked:[/h1]
- Jack the Ripper (DLC) has an unsurprising story that harps on the concept that ""even assassins can be evil"", as if we didn't know. This is meant to further an arbitrary ""we're all the bad guy"" narrative that this series didn't need. The unfortunate bit is that the big plot twist is presented literal seconds after the DLC starts, nothing else is surprising.
- The Last Maharaja (DLC) is a poorly thought out section of the game with minigames that are unnecessary and an entire drunk section that is neither clever nor funny. Besides this, the whole side story will at the end feel like a complete waste of time. Would not recommend.
- Races are n o n e s e n s e - aren't required for 100%, so I skipped them all but one (to try it).
- Jack the Ripper (DLC): [spoiler]It's a little bit bull that the police officers turn against you midway through the DLC. Now - all of a sudden - the assassin's activities are a problem. Honestly? 20 years ago they openly ran a crime syndicate and that was all fine and dandy, but one murder now suddenly makes it that you 'should be arrested'. Ultimately, Abberline is still on your side, but feels like rather forced plot development.[/spoiler]

[h1]What I hated:[/h1]
- The Dickens and Darwin conspiracy DLC was immensely disappointing and frankly a waste of time and effort. Strongly do not recommend.
- I had several crashes and soft locks for no reason. I would have carriages drive off even though it had no driver. Dead guys would block mission progression by claiming they were alive (but are on the ground, quite dead, but alive, but unkillable). I had a random guy panic drive off with a carriage that had a mission vital corpse in it (as part of the mission). More crashes. I had audio glitches where suddenly no voice lines were spoken. All in all, I think during the time I played, I encounted 10 to 20 serious bugs and it's not a good look for a game with this type of budget.
- Huge downside for what I personally hate [b]the most[/b] in video games. Getting beaten in a cutscene. [spoiler]Lucy (an enemy) steals a necklace from Evie, despite having just lost a fight without putting a scratch on Evie. Hate it. Just have Evie be too late instead and Lucy already has the necklace and escapes the fight. Same result. Similarly, the plot ultimately didn't need Lucy to even have the necklace, so this was very pointless.[/spoiler]

[h1]Would recommend![/h1]

The mechanics are great, and are probably the best part of the game. Victorian London's urban sprawl is a natural setting for a game with plenty of parkour and gang wars.

Despite these charming frustrations, Syndicate brings a fun, new, and interesting mechanic to rooftop travel: the grappling hook. And we will probably never see it again because that's how Ubisoft works but to me it made prawling the city so much more fun and efficient. The ledge above you? Zip. That building across the street? Just spiderman that crap. 

Other than mechanics, Syndicate takes place in London which, of course, is beautiful and ugly in all of the most human ways. The thing about AC is that even if you don't care for the gameplay you can enjoy the scenery and worlds they build which are surprisingly accurate in design if not scale.

tl;dr I have many gripes about the AC series but I still play them.

It doesn't have anything unique to its name except for the Victorian setting, but I found the world to be lacking in detail, and sort of lifeless.

And yet for some reason I keep thinking that enjoyment is to be had somewhere in here, and I simply haven't found it yet.

The choice of having two main characters is very odd and it doesn't work at all. You end up becoming attached to one of them and swear as soon as you're forced to play as the other one.

You're stading on a ledge, looking down on an enemy and thinking: ""damn, this is a good spot to snipe with a throwing blade"". You aim at him and press the button to throw a dagger. However, your character jumps down and melee kills the enemy instead - alerting every guard in the entire area. The button to fire/throw is the same button as doing a jumping assassination. Countless times I've died because of this.

Oh and let's not forget the tailing missions. NO ONE LIKES THE TAILING MISSIONS. Yet Ubisoft keeps adding them to every AC game.",1487336439,1606756327,False,4,1,0.407557547092437744,2,True,False,False

TL;DR: Not bad, repetitive side missions, uninteresting main characters

Long version
Non-spoiler pros

+Multi-person finishers

Non-spoiler cons
-Kukri sucks in my opinion, its my favorite sword irl so definite minus
-City takeover missions are very repetitive
-Mr. green felt like a flaccid character
-Main characters felt very unimaginative (Jacob is a reckless brute and Evie is a careful stealth)
-World war one side mission thing felt unnessecary and flat
-Multiple times I would try to throw a knife and it would fire the grappling hook instead, also when driving the carraige it would randomly eject me to the roof, very annoying

Spoiler cons
-[spoiler]Meeting all the famous people got tiring, like a single person got in good with Karl marx, queen victoria, etc all within like 3 months[/spoiler]

This is actually one of my favourite ACs & I've played them all.

The twins are really cool with slightly different skill-sets for different jobs. Play as Evie with enhanced stealth skills or Jacob & his gang for a more direct approach. My favourite characters so far since Ezio

Be warned though that the main attraction is London during in my opinion it's greatest era. It's really aimed at the British gamer.  There's only one city all be it the greatest city on earth. It does get a little tired even for me after a long play through grabbing all the collectables.

If not or you came into Origins and beyond and like those, this one likely won't change your mind. I would recommend getting it on sale + [u] Jack the Ripper DLC [/u]. 

I happen to fall into the first camp. To be clear, I think Origins/Odyssey/Valhalla, what I call Nu-AC, are just barely okay as games but really awful Assassin's Creed games because they veer so far away from the formula and stealth and assassinations are a complete after thought it feels, so much so that they really should stop calling it Assassin's Creed and brand it as a spin off series of its own. 

That aside I think it's unfortunate that Syndicate was the last of the traditional formula because it introduces some neat ideas like the grapple launcher, although some people feel it takes away climbing puzzles which yeah I can see where they're coming from there, the gang system which did affect the world in a noticeable but largely inconsequential way, and with its setting being the one that takes us the closest to modern day without going into the bland Abstergo vs. Modern Assassins stuff, although there is still some of that sprinkled in. 

The main game is nothing special in the series. Towers, tons of collectibles which amount to not much, side activities, very bare bones RPG mechanics, a story that just drags along over a about 20 hours, and some crashes and bugs here and there that required a restart from time to time. You might think I'm weird for recommending the game after listing off those last points which would indicate a tepid or mediocre experience. That's because as of writing this I just finished the Jack the Ripper DLC 100% sync (99% for main game, can't be bothered with WW1 collectibles), and honestly that experience alone was worth it and what I consider the pinnacle of this game and the best Assassin's Creed content since Black Flag/Rogue. I'm dead serious. I would gladly trade Nu-AC for more content like Jack the Ripper DLC or full games modeled off of it. 

Here's why: When it comes to telling a story in a game, what you tell and how you tell it are pretty important pieces. The story itself isn't really special, pretty short compared to the main game as expected, and deals with how the Assassins are connected to an important historical figure. What really struck me was the dread and atmosphere, especially when playing as Jack the Ripper, it touches on the Assassin's relationship with greater society and how it's getting more and more difficult to be secret while maintaining a relationship with important figures or public institutions like the police, and the fear mechanic was the cherry on top. Like most/all Ubisoft titles, it has some great ideas but never quite reaches its potential and I feel like this DLC was the closest they've ever gotten to it since the very first game back in 2007, and leaves me wishing that they kept going in this direction to do so.",1604435635,1604435635,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Characters aren't that interesting, and their motivation for doing stuff seems forced, which results in a weak story. Jacob fun bouncer is the best character since Ezio. Evie is very beautiful, and sweet.
Combat is boring and feels weird.
The grappling hook is a fun addition at first, but is so effective that doing parkour around the city is comparatively ineffective, so you just end up grappling again and again to get around.

If you're looking to play an Assassin's Creed that feels like Assassin's Creed but not in a dated fashion— Syndicate and Unity are what you should go for.

While Syndicate offers the player the Assassin flair the latest or even some of the previous games in the series have failed to deliver, one of the only flaws I feel like worth mentioning is it's parkour system who's blander and whose sometimes feels inconsistent (moreso than even Unity under certain cases), and the depth and intricate skills you'd have from parkouring in Unity are barely transferrable to Syndicate's own parkour, even though they're the same system, while the map is Unity was built for intricate and skillful parkour, Syndicate's world has been stripped of parkour elements. Still, either way, it is a much more enjoyable freerunning experience than any of the games that came after, and I don't really feel like there are any other objective problems that don't stem from subjective point of views or biases.

I'd visit Revelations' Istanbul and Ezio's Italy once or twice if I had time, but I'd go back to Syndicate's London a thousand times.",1561821430,1604030544,True,16,1,0.644621014595031738,0,True,False,False

Terrible game design choices in terms of control schemes, difficulty, mission design, and so on. The only thing that keeps me coming back to finish the story is the world design. I do feel quite immersed into late 19th century London, so they nailed that. I just cannot stand failing a mission because my character jumped in the complete wrong direction, or dropped someone in front of a carriage instead of putting them inside one, or many of the other errors that could have easily been avoided in a better designed game.

AI behavior is extremely inconsistent. You can murder someone right in front of them and they won't ever see you. Other times you can fling a knife from a rooftop 20 meters away and they'll immediately initiate combat and bring the whole gang with them. Your own gang ally members can sometimes run into an area while you're sneaking around doing your assassin things, and initiate combat with enemies, sometimes causing you to fail optional objectives, or causing kidnap targets to run away. There is no way to tell your allies to stay away. You only get to watch as your targets are meddled with by a stupid AI.

Combat is extremely frustrating. You can attack lightning fast about 4 times in a row, and then suddenly your character refuses to move for a good 2 seconds to leave an opening for the enemy to hit back. If you're fighting a group of enemies, it will throw 3 different button queues at you at a time. You can not do anything in this situation because if you press 1, you miss the other 2 and take damage and most likely stagger as well, where another couple enemies might attack you again. Enemies have the ability to block, which requires a heavy attack to break their defense. If you hit them with a light attack, they will stagger you and hit you back. That's fine and fair, however it takes a million years to pull off a heavy attack, during which you can be attacked by other enemies. Also, enemies can start to block while you're in the middle of attacking them, so they get a cheap deflect since there's no way to cancel your attacks. There really should have been a dodge/roll button that can be used at any time in combat. During combat, your camera is locked down below a certain angle. If there is a sniper above the fight, you are simply NOT ALLOWED to look up at them to do something about it. Despite, you know, the main gimmick of this game being a GRAPPLE HOOK, and the fact that you have a gun for just such a thing. Speaking of which, you are completely unable to manually aim your gun during combat. The aim button isn't even used for anything else in combat!!! Why the hell can't you still aim if you want to???

Also, speaking of the grapple, it does make traversal much nicer than having to climb up and down repetitively. It's a little clunky, but it can be forgiven because you're not supposed to be Spiderman, you're supposed to be a 19th century assassin. The major problem with it is you cannot aim where you want to fire the grapple. You have to completely rely on the contextual auto-aim by looking around. I cannot tell you how many times I've looked straight forward at a roof in front of me, but Jacob or Evie TURN AROUND and grapple up onto the building behind me. That wouldn't have happened if I was allowed to manually aim to which ledge I wanted to go to.

I really wanted to like this game. Somewhere within, there is a really good game. It's just buried under the layers of terrible, contextual controls and shoddy AI. I am really hoping Origins improves upon these things.",1603867299,1603867299,False,10,2,0.602689266204833984,0,True,False,False

1. The game focuses more on Jacob than Evie, which sucks, because I think Evie's character is more fun to play as, especially during stealth missions
2. The game is more balanced for Jacob, due to Ubisoft's opinions on female protagonists at the time the game was made
3. Robert Topping's races are bullshit. The driving in the game isn't great
4. Getting off of the train hideout can be a pain
5. There's two different types of freerunning, Freerun Up and Freerun Down, which is nice, but it can get challenging when you just want to jump from pole to pole and you won't move due to the pole being on a slightly different altitude

The controls are almost perfect, and you actually feel like you are having full control of your movements, without jumping into your death. Although, I never got it to work well with a controller. So, this was with mouse and keyboard.

The atmosphere in this game is beyond stunning with really nice soundtrack. You really feel like walking around in the old London and if you have ever watched the Sharlock Holms movie with Robert Downey Jr., you will quickly see the same atmospheric feeling to this game. The idea of having two main characters to control with different main missions works quit well. My only complaint is that there are no ""outside"" world of the Animus and the storyline could have a little more depth. But besides all that, I really enjoyed this game!

But as an open world game, it's really good.. Play it and enjoy it.

This game is also the last Assassin's Creed before they changed the gameplay, so the game is as simple as those Assassin's Creed use to be.

The environment is this game looks clean. Victorian London and it's streets are big. The Architecture in this game in beautiful, spot on from historical standpoint, the world design itself is very good. Streets are filled with people & so many buildings have fully explorable interiors that makes this open world a must see. The scaling of everything in the massive.

The basic missions you embark on are pretty normal as far as ""Assassin's Creed"" games go with the usual objectives of tailing, killing and kidnapping. Parkour is as good as any assassin's creed game, driving carriages and rampaging on the streets of London with it is a lot of fun, hell, you can even drift with horse drawn carriages. Fighting enemies on train tops & carriage tops and kicking them off the running train & carriages gives a feeling of much satisfying finishing blow. Combat, Stealth and Ecosystem is also very good. Combat system a little different from other AC.

But many things in this game has upsides and downsides.
For example.. The scaling of everything in the massive, the roads. the buildings, the trains etc.. the sense of scale really adds a feeling to the game.. jumping from rooftops to assassinate your target etc feels great.. but then again, the buildings are so far apart that it creates issue with the free-running when you have to move from rooftops of one side of the road to the other side of the road or if you're chasing someone or avoiding someone who's chasing you, it takes so much time to often climb the building or get down from building bcoz the roads are way too wide which makes those buildings far from each other creating issue of not being able to jump directly to the rooftops of other side of the road.. that problem only gets solved when you get the grappling hook to easily glide from one side to the other side of the road. So everything has both it's upsides and downsides.

Overall a good open world game.",1601729276,1601729276,True,29,0,0.735791444778442383,2,True,False,False

Ironically, my controls didn't seem to work smoothly until AFTER the very last story mission. 
The story's interesting but a lot of the missions weren't. Conquering London quickly gets repetitive and often the only thing that kept me playing was the fact that I just loved moving through this city. It's gorgeous and feels very real, and ziplining along rooftops makes it very easy to travel long distances. I wish they'd added single horses as well as the carriages, it would often make it easier to navigate the streets.

I loved the location and recognising places was a blast. The gameplay was more of the same, the addition of the rope launcher was fun to help reach some of those locations a little quicker but ultimately didn't feel that necessary to me. Highjacking carriages and taking down locations and building up your gang was great and something i usually didn't care for. The gameplay and controls felt a lot more fluid that the previous incarnation.

The story was ok maybe a little shallow and the characters felt a little too obvious to me Some of the historic characters felt a little out of place, i also think the main characters outfits and style just didn't seem to be in line as much with being an assassin as previous games.

Overall it was a good enough game however i think that Unity is better in a lot of ways and that maybe syndicate was rushed or could have been bigger and better than it is.

Sadly there is no mission replay. Once I got the end game gear I already was stuck with having only hunting down collectibles or doing cargo missions. 

Controls are again a sore point for me as pc user. I was constantly fighting automatic actions like climbing walls or railings when bumping into them while sprinting.
Just a dedicated sprint and climb button would make movement a lot simpler.
World and character Interaction though.... E does it all: speak, pickpocket, knock out, takcle, pick up, loot, open chests and doors. I'm a bit surprised how I didn't knock out a pickpocket target more often.

The map while just a small part of London, seemed quite accurate as far as I could tell. However generic city blocks in Whitechapel and City felt a bit too much like copy-paste to me.

TL;DR - Hurr durr previously free and accessible collectible maps are now micro transaction bait hurr hurr.

TL;BRIA - You know the drill guys...its a Ubisoft sandbox third-person-action game. It looks pretty, well made albeit with the usual Ubisoft brand of bugs, you know, the small ones that annoy you persistently but not enough to raise a huge cry over?
We have all been here before. Many many times. Watch Dogs, Far Cry, Assassin's Creed..so many times...

But this time is different. Because this time, Ubisoft has finally done it. Locked the collectibles maps (thats right! MAPS! Plural! there are two sets of collectibles map!) behind a micro-transaction .And the cost has risen since Unity as well, the Helix Points needed this time is 1000 which doesn't come by often in this game.

In sum, Ubisoft has made sure that an active part of its already available content is made that much harder to find unless you cough up 10 euros for EACH map. Look, DLC's always been part of the Ubisoft package, but its always have been adding something extra or giving you access to some high level gear early in the game. In this case however, a DLC actively takes away your 100% unless you're willing to comb thru the huge open world for them or stream a video guide on the side. All of which actively takes away all the fun in a game.

Maybe this is an unfair gripe and some people might say ""yeah, you think all collectibles should appear as blazing neon icons on the map everytime? How privileged are you???"". All fair points. But this is a Ubisoft game. With their usual brand of collectibles which always have been accesible to those of us who think paying a fair price for a game is enough to enjoy its content.

the main characters haven't been developed past their initial stereotypes for like the last 5 sequences. the most im getting out of the story is ""mean templar owns everything in london, his faceless gang of repeated character models are all evil, jacob wants to make a better gang, and evie wants to find pieces of eden."" everything outside of that has either been jacob and evie rehashing their same argument about what to do over and over (someone explain to me how jacob can think pieces of eden are all nonsense stories after everything that's happened in this series), or shoehorned historical references and political intrigue that flies by at such a pace or at times when your attention is divided that absolutely none of it sticks. I couldn't tell you everything that happened in most ac games but at least i have some solid memories of characters and circumstances, while this game is just all over the place.

on top of that, it just isn't nearly as fun. london is huge, which seems like a good thing, but it kind of makes freerunning much less useful than it should be in an ac game. driving is boring and often terrible, especially when the game decides to spawn four carriages around you during a chase and physics are absolutely thrown out the window. the grappling hook is cool in theory but due to london's size it kind of replaces frerunning, and you end up on slow ziplines around london for the majority of your travel time. 

the two character system also seems cool but honestly evie's overpowered stealth skills are so much more useful than jacob's combat skills, which is especially annoying because they make so many of the jacob missions stealth based after making it clear he's the combat specialist. i can't remember a single memorable mission even from the story, and the district missions are all the same five missions copied and pasted about a dozen times with different amounts of guards, most of which are trivialized by evie's stealth and knife headshots. the game does like to make things difficult by spawning in enemies like in carriage chases, as well as shitty ai decisions that can completely ruin a mission through no fault of your own, especially if you're trying to get 100% synch, which i absolutely would not recommend.

the way people talk about unity is generally how i feel about this game. i didn't expect to love unity but it sucked me in with its simple love and revenge story, good satisfying combat, and beautiful sights. syndicate gave me shallow, unlikeable characters, weirdly fast but boring combat with a focus on excessively long and flashy executions, and a city, as detailed as it is, ends up feeling unvaried and boring, probably due to the repetitive missions. im looking forward to finally getting to origins more than ever now.

The point is here in this ↓
Why even make London here larger than a whole planet Earth if you couldn't handle other aspects? Like, book novel of this game is tremendous, it is gorgeous, it is better than sex to read it. Why couldn't I play what was and how was written in a book as I definitely would? Imagine, story in game would have that level of quality, while we all got typical British humour wank story. No offence for those who liked it, they just really, really overpushed in writing a bunch of interesting characters rather than develop them. That sucks but I know it could be better.
And a gameplay. The gameplay. Would call it an Assassin's Creed: Unity 0.5 and would be even right. Still, called it Assassin's Creed: GTA London 1868. With all that bloody similarities. With all that simplicity. Some missions are barely passable but not because they got Minesweeper Windows 98 Edition difficulty but because of bugs. Games's so easy it's BRAINLESS.
Still I would recommend it. With all that sins, bugs. underperformed story, ""GTA got a heecup"" vibes, with all that Johnny Sins, it's still have a gorgeous London, tremendous cast of historical personalities, probably the best DLC out of all franchise (Sorry, The Da Vinci Dissapearence, Dreadful Crimes took my Sherlock Holmes' inner fanboy's heart and ate it and I like it) and you definitely would get an unforgettable experience.",1599604687,1599604878,True,1,0,0.497780561447143555,0,True,False,False

As far as time sink experiences go, this is a pleasant one.

Victorian London's digital reconstruction is a marvel to behold and the true reason to buy this game - it is just breathtaking. Although somewhat anachronistic and revisionist for obvious reasons - e.g. no prostitutes in the streets of London for Jack to kill.

Speaking of anachronisms, the inclusion of historical celebrities like Marx & Darwin as quest givers is a joke that this franchise needs to let go. The writing of such characters makes my eyes and ears bleed. Just stop it.

Gameplay-wise, you know what you are getting, it is the usual Assassin's Creed bloated content. But this time it feels better curated and paced.

The story is just a formality but the characters are very likable with superb voice-acting.

The visuals are stunning the and combat is enjoyable, having played AC Origins this i believe was the last game before the combat mechanics update so it's a nice representation of that final ""ode to traditional style combat"" found in the original AC but with some tasteful updates and changes. 

The characters make for a memorable duo and quite honestly it was their personalities that brought me back to this game, in addition to the enjoyable story missions. The unique kills make for some pretty awesome cutscenes and there's quite enough extra content (even before expansions) to keep you satisfied. 

I'm at 22 hours currently and just approaching the tail end of the story now if that's any indicator. For the$19.99 you spend to get it at its current price, I'd say its well worth it.

I only really had one complaint.. 
*****heads up this is a spoiler if you haven't finished the first three games****

With the end of Desmonds journey I guess I would've liked to see more of a linear continuation of that story and plot pretense - however unfortunately it seems that the ""real world"" story has stepped into a more difficult-to-follow narrative (but for anyone who played AC4) this has been going on for a while.. 

All in all, I'd give it a solid 4.5/5 though - Great gameplay, beautiful graphics, rich story and memorable characters. It would've been sweet to have some PvP/Multiplayer like in brotherhood/unity - that would be an absolute blast. Maybe there will be something in Valhalla? 

For what it's worth, I do consider myself a tough judge. 

Game on!

Now that's not to say the game isn't good, I was just underwhelmed by how small the map was compared to previous titles and the new gameplay mechanics weren't for me - I was after all used to the original mechanics.

Skip a few years ahead and we see the release of Origins and Odyssey, both two games that use an altered version of Syndicates mechanics and I find myself really enjoying both games, though both weren't very ""Assassins Creed"" like. So I think I will revisit this game when I have time.

I was not expecting it to be as good as it is, but Ubisoft learned from their mistakes in previous games. Syndicate is the classic Assassin's Creed formula refined and perfected.

Evie and Jacob make a strong duo. Either one of them alone ranks higher than most of the other protagonists in the series for me. They're further held up by a strong cast of characters and many worthy foes. The story is intriguing, well-paced, with an ending as good as I've seen from this series. 

While the graphics quality feels like a downgrade from Unity, the aesthetic does Victorian-era London justice. 

The side missions were fun, although the bounty hunt missions were weak. The assassination missions were as strong as ever. I loved that they kept the ""Opportunities"" system from Unity. I also felt that the WWI side content was tremendous. It was shocking to me how much content was in this game that Ubisoft could have put behind a pay gate, but didn't.

The parkour and combat continue to evolve, even beyond the strong showing from Unity. The upgrade, gang, and gear systems were all well thought out too. As I played the game, my two characters were getting stronger. I felt that I could tailor them to my play style.

Syndicate serves to be a lovely ""farewell"" letter to the aging Assassin's Creed formula. I'm looking forward to seeing how Ubisoft shakes things up with Origins and Odyssey.",1598756745,1598870517,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It's no good. The last two paragraphs are just the problems I encountered with the Ubisoft support them. This game is a complete SCAM.

I lost count how many times I tried giving this game a chance, and no I'm not exaggerating in the least. On top of that, I spent 53 hours playing this game trying to get 100% synchronization but I was only able to get 88% percent due to the large amount of random bugs in this game. This is the first Assassin's Creed game I could not 100% complete and I'm going to tell you why. Here is a list of bugs I encountered while playing Assassin's Creed Syndicate in my last few hours of tossing this piece of garbage on my Number #2 list(get it?). 

     1. Allies not being able to move, or stuck in a standing position for seconds at a time
     2. There is a bug where you have to protect a certain character around Sequence 5, it was
         never fixed. I had to look it up on YouTube to get through it
     3. Like the first one on this list, sometimes characters don't move, forcing you to restart the 
         memory
     4. This game will do everything in its power to try and get your nerves acting up like 
         being snap inside a structure, causing you to restart from a checkpoint. Other examples
         include random objects going ape-#2 and bring you to a close death
     5. Or my favorite...there are two moments in the game where I desynchronize during the
         loading screen and I am unable to progress with the game. This happened to me once
         in Sequence 4 and another when I tried to replay one of the side red templar missions


This game ruined my experience with their crappy, unfinished games. The same thing happened in Far Cry 5 when I tried 100% completing that as well. It was that one mission where the ally with the hat(and glasses, I think) said there were enemies at his doorstep and he needed me to help him. I'm not PAYING for anymore of their games. I'll leave it at that :)




BROKEN. BROKEN. BROKEN. DO NOT BUY THIS pathetic excuse of a game! Ubisoft screwed me over multiple times with this garbage they call a ""game"". I lost $70 on this despite having call the useless customer support 10 times, all telling me the same thing. Verify the game, or leaving it to someone else in their building to come and fix it even though THERE WAS NOBODY WORKING ON MY CASE FOR WEEKS. Trust me when I tell you that the person calling them is most likely more qualified for the job than the actually employee. I put that on the people I love. Not only that but the amount of bugs in this game is outrageous! I eventually got stuck in a loading screen loop that wouldn't let me continue where I last left off. It drives me crazy enough to the point that I wish their company fails big time, and hopefully, soon enough.


I opened a case on July 17, 2020. I contacted Ubisoft's support team consistently, bugging them and venting my hate at them after weeks of my case being in ""progress"". They kept telling me the same thing....""We're working on it"". It wasn't until I called my bank around the middle of August(to try and issue me a refund) that Ubisoft finally updated my case and gave me all the helix credits I paid for. I also managed to fix the looping bug I had by going in to windowed mode and alt/tabbing until I was able to get out of the looping loading bug screen. If I had never called my bank, I still probably would've been left with this problem. Good game but the company is what ruined it for me.",1595632287,1597893873,False,1,0,0.476510077714920044,0,True,False,False

        [td]Gameplay[/td]
        [td]It's still stealth and parkour (and now you can drive a wagon/carriage/cart but I hate tapping spacebar just to increase speed). But from this series you""ll see that Assassin's Creed becomes more RPG than the predecessors (just like Far Cry franchise, seriously Ubisoft?). They implement SKILL TREE and EXPERIENCE POINT. For every 1000 Exp you will get 1 skill tree point and you will be leveled up based on how many skill tree points you've spent. You also need to collect various materials to craft weapons or armors. You can conquer boroughs and do some side missions. Not only skill tree, you also can upgrade your gang. Do you need grinding? Yes. Will it take you much time? I think no, just a little bit. If you conquer London before completing the main mission, I bet you will unlock all skills, gang upgrades and most of the weapons, armors, & outfits. Yes, they give you many choices of weapons, armors, and outfits that you can upgrade once too. Uniquely, you can play as 2 character with different specialties : The Frye Twins, Evie and Jacob. Evie favored for stealth and Jacob for straight fighting. But after you unlock all the skills, I feel that both of them can do both stealth and straight fighting (h2h combat). But for some of main missions require you to play with the selected character (they have different logos on map). Another part that I like is Rope Launcher (or Grappling Hook) which will make traversing and killing much more efficient. IMO, the downside is there is no sleeping dart. But overall, fresh gameplay, not very RPG, you still can use hidden blade, going stealth, and kill templars. After playing AC Black Flag, AC Rogue, and AC Unity, I ranked AC Syndicate as 2nd after Black Flag. Rogue imitates Black Flag and Unity a little bland but still enjoyable.[/td]

    [tr]
        [td]Story[/td]
        [td]Set in the Victorian Era in London. So you""ll see coal mining, child labor, driving machinery, steam trains, steam ships. The main story is good, not very ""Assassination"" thing like in the AC : Unity but also included some political agendas. But I think the best villain here is Maxwell Roth, not Crawford Starrick. I love the main characters especially Evie because she is woman and mature. Jacob is funny. Both have different personalities, and having siblings can sometimes make you fight. [/td]

[Likes]
* Interesting time period
* Ability to switch between the two protagonists via the menu
* The liberating of the boroughs reminds me of when I liberated the areas in Assassin's Creed 3. Ah, the memories! This one is slightly better, though.
* The Stealth, Assistance, and Infiltration opportunities first introduced in Assassin's Creed: Unity. A real treat to see those opportunities in this, shall we say, interesting game!
*Beautiful historic landmarks!

[Dislikes]
* The combat system is, well, bullocks. I prefer the Ezio trilogy's take on the combat system.
* Lack of historical figures as Templars. I know, beggars can't be choosers, but, hey, AC3 had the closest one had to a list of ACTUAL historical people as Templars. The heck, Ubisoft Quebec!
* The player is forced to spectate during the modern day portion. What the actual f--k, Ubisoft Quebec! AC: Black Flag's may have been faceless, but, at least we DID something during the modern day portion!

Pretty solid game. 
Not my favourite due to no swords and 19th century England not looking too beautiful... 

The story was pretty decent, I like the dynamic between the siblings.
The liberating of London makes sense and feels good.
Each target is not just a bad guy, they are the leader of a different sector (e.g. Banking, Manufacturing) so it makes sense freeing all the sectors that were all under control of the Templar order.

Also the Modern Day story is much better than the previous few, but still not back to the levels of the first 4 games.

You can play with Jacob or Evie Frye with great combat, improve skills and improve your own gang.
New mechanics and an useful one (Grappling hook).
Good story and music too. Very good main characters. 
Cons:
Found some bugs 
Could be more optimized, sometimes game freeze

Highly recommend, especially if you like Assassin's Creed

Silly me, Ubisoft doesn't make games better they just make the same game 10,000 times yet never get the basics right.
The difference in weapons and the grappling hook were very nice but that is where it ends.
-Good graphics don't mean donkey when you got nothing else right
-The two character are only barely different in play style but now you get to spend 2x as long leveling up both characters.
-You are now FORCED to do all the monotonous time waster collectathons because now they give the xp you need to level up which you have to do because enemies will be impossible to kill if they are several levels above you.
-The story is utter twattle and comes to a load of nothing.
-Both characters are muppets and unlikable, who don't get along and won't work together despite being 2 people against an entire organization that has been in london for hundreds of years and controls it.
-Enemies all know you despite never seeing you before and will call you out on the street and just attack you.
-The parkor system seems to have been made worse and I found myself getting caught, killed, or loosing targets because the characters won't climb down something unless you go through a 10 step program.
-Simple actions take way long in what I guess is yet another time waster attempt.
-Killing takes longer and it is combined with a worse dodge and block system.
-Ubisoft proves yet again that they are utterly incompetent at optimizing anything they make, as my game despite being on optimal settings with a top of the line pc was glitching and lagging all over the place.
-Yet another example of the trash that comes out when a company just vomits games out every year and doesn't give the teams time to make something great.

I only got this because it was a couple bucks and even with that I want my money back.

The world is pretty immersive and while I do wish the map was larger , there is still a lot of cool areas to explore and discover. The Victorian/industrial era vision has been beautifully captured by the developers and you really get into the environment as time passes.

- Amazing Graphics
- The facts, histories and the good view of the London
- New items: Grappling hook and throwing knife
- The combat and item upgrades
- The real Assassin's Creed game that has no naval ship battles in the whole game

Cons
- A lot of bugs encountered
- The story is not quite interesting than the previous games
- The story line is quite a bit short
- Other side quests are not also interesting
- The fighting mechanics is good or bad, still prefer the AC3 mechanics

The AC Syndicate's story is kind a boring and nothing memorable. It's like the creators set the Assassins as the good people and the Templars are bad people with nothing deep reason why they turned. Comparing this to AC3 story line and its side quest is far more interesting as you will know the real purpose of the Templars. What really interesting on this game is the future events after the World War 1 in London and the aftermath of the Frye twins.

Also, the long gameplay of this game might get you bored and not quite enjoyable. Compared to AC3 gameplay on side quest and forest biomes.

The open world is pretty good and feels alive. It is a lot of fun to just look at the while riding the train or to walk trough the streets.
This game also had one of the most creative hideouts - a train.
It also looks pretty good in terms of graphics but has the same render distance issues that Unity had.
The parkour looks almost as good as in Unity but not quite as good.
Having two main characters was also a interesting but the way the playtime was split between them is bad.
Assassination missions were the best type of mission in this game since you had multiple ways to approach the mission, it was similar to Unity but felt a lot more refined and finished.
The Kenway mansion was the most interesting place to explore in the game and it was just really cool going there.

But well, now to the bad points.

First of there is Jacob. He ruined most serious moments with his bad jokes. They tried making him a goddamn comedian but man his jokes are really bad most of the time, I mean Evies Ezio reference was funnier than most of his jokes. Evie would have actually been an alright character but she just didn't have enough ""screen time"". The story was alright when Jacob wouldn't ruin it with his first grader humor.
The modern day was better than in Unity, which isn't hard to pull off, but it was still bad. I mean they kept talking about a modern day story that would have actually been interesting but no we get like 10 minutes over the whole game and we don't even get to play it.....
While the open world did look good that was all it did. The open world was terrible when it came to parkour opportunities, it was so bad in fact that they had too add a rope launcher which felt ridiculous and unbelievable as hell, I mean it felt like someone went: "" hey how about we make it spider-man"" and then someone reminded them that they can't do that so they did this. And to top that the parkour was just buggy as hell at times. I mean I tried free running on a tree and suddenly the char I was playing as would just stop and when I tried to continue they would either just walk on the spot or fucking fly away.
The combat was also not much better. It looked ""cartoonish"" and just ridiculous. All you had to do was spam X and occasionally press either B or A so yeah and in terms of weapon variety the game offered you three weapon types or rather one weapon type but three types of skin either the knife the stick or the fist and they all played the exact same. The combat was also inconsistent at times cause sometimes enemies can't damage you when you are in a finisher animation but other times they can......
Even more inconsistent was the stealth. It was alright except for the times where enemies detect you through walls or instantly see you even though you were 10m away from them and they saw you for a second. It just got annoying pretty quickly.
The game also isn't the most stable. I had a lot of crashes but luckily not to the point where I could become unplayable like with Unity.

Overall this is one of the worst Assassin's Creed games. The gameplay was alright but the story was just not that good and didn't even take itself serious at times. I would say that this game isn't worth it at all.",1595618263,1595618263,False,1,0,0.500320315361022949,0,True,False,False

+ Having started playing this game the day after I finished Unity, this game craps all over Unity from the very first few minutes of play and shows up Unity for the massive turd that it is.

+ The main characters have much more personality. The Frye twins play off each other brilliantly. In general, the writing is much better.
+ Proper side characters are back. Say hello to people like Charles Darwin and Charles Dickens.
+ As someone who lives close to London, it feels like a very believable rendition of London in the 19th century.
+ This is the closest Assassin's Creed ever gets to the brilliant AC2 trilogy. Not that I don't like the subsequent games (in fact I love Origins), but they take a different path. Syndicate is the closest feeling of fun you get from the AC2 trilogy.

= I'm not a big fan of the weapon and armour system in Syndicate (which is an extension of Unity's). It feels in between the more or less straight ""worst to best"" systems in the older games and the more full-on RPG system in later games, but the worst of both worlds. It feels limiting. However, it's a relatively minor gripe in the context of some of the worst element of the last few games in the series (like the awful parkour in the previous few games.

- Can't really think of any outright negatives to be honest, Syndicate is one of the best games in the AC series.",1595542626,1595542626,True,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

This is the first Assassin’s Creed game I have properly enjoyed since Black Flag. They’ve fixed all the problems from Unity so no parts of this game felt like a chore, it’s all fun. 

[b]Full Review[/b] 
Most of the good things I have to say about this game are really just a list of all the things wrong with Unity that have been fixed for this game.

For a start this is the first Assassin’s Creed game to run properly in widescreen. The graphics look better and run smoother than Unity. The Victorian setting is great, having familiar UK historical figures makes it so much more engaging than previous games. For example when I tripped over Florence Nightingale and dropped Darwin down the stairs it was so much more entertaining than if had just been some random characters that I knew nothing about.

The biggest problem with Unity was there was too many tedious things to do and thankfully they’ve stripped all of those things out. The annoying multiplayer is gone, the terrible enigma missions are gone. The annoying lockpick mini game is gone, you now just hold down E to pick locks. There are also significantly fewer locked chests and you can get the lock pick skills very early on in the game so they are not a source of frustration. The treasure maps are back (the good ones from II not the rubbish ones from Black Flag) so finding all the collectibles is no longer so tedious. The incongruous and boring investigations have been relegated to a DLC that you can just ignore.

The confusing different currencies have been improved, you now just buy equipment and upgrades with money and get experience to unlock new skills.

The clunky free running and combat mechanics have been refined and are much smoother and satisfying.

It is not just fixing things from Unity, there are other good things worthy of mentioning. The new kidnap ability add a bit of variety rather than just always killing people.  The grappling hook is a nice new mechanic, it means there is no need for all those random cables between buildings in previous games which were only there for assassins to run across. The carriages too are a nice way to get about quickly. I like how the map was split up into segments similar to how Black Flag was split up into islands which made it much more satisfying to systematically collect everything and complete the side missions. I like the music, it fitted the atmosphere of the game well. The series has flipped between medicine and regenerating health but this is the first game to combine the two which I think works well. You can use medicine if you get overwhelmed by enemies but you don’t have to go off and find a doctor between every mission to heal yourself back up. Another nice little touch is some of the enemies have has which can get knocked off during combat.

Having 2 different assassins, the stealthy one and the confrontational one, is a nice idea. Each character has a few unique skills but you can still use whichever approach you like with each character.

After the atrocities committed against the Irish accent in Rogue I was worried that this game was going to have everyone talking in the way American’s think British people talk like Dick Van Dyke in Mary Poppins. However in actual fact the voice acting is very good.

The game is by no means perfect though. There are still the annoying Helix credits for in app purchases and some of the treasure maps are only available through this. The grappling hook aiming is very pernickety about what you can actually fire it at, you can’t directly aim at where you want to go it just picks somewhere near the middle of the screen where it thinks you want to go. Once you get used to it movement can be very fluid but it takes a while. The carriages are very unrealistic your horse can smash through cast iron street furniture with little impediment and you can throw your whole carriage from side to side to ram people. The aggravated me at the start but then I remembered all the other wildly unrealistic things in the game and just started to enjoy the mechanics of driving even if they didn’t make sense. The writing and characters are a bit formulaic, the plot is once again relive the memories of an assassin to find the dohicky of the week. The historical cameos feel a bit forced in places. There were these items that appear on the map which when you collect them just give a message saying that the social glitch service is unavailable. I’m not sure what they were supposed to do but I’m guessing it was on some server that Ubisoft no longer maintains. There is still only one save game so you need to mess around with save files for different people to play. The game features perks which unlock after you have done something an arbitrary number of times. Some are fine like assassinate X number of people but some of them are ridiculously grindy like the one for drifting a carriage round 5 corners in a row. I never managed this once let alone 75 times.

None of the above really bothered me as the game as a whole is solid enjoyable experience, all of the things to do in the game are fun and working your way through them all is very satisfying.",1595495234,1595495234,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

London looks good, but most of it looks the same, so you'll get a bit bored repeating the same things over and over again, while the game isn't very long, it'll take close to 50 hours to 100% it.

Story wise it's a boring and shallow, doesn't add much to the AC lore, while both main characters are good, Evie is by far better & more charismatic.

What i enjoyed the most is the fighting, 3 different weapons, with brutal and nice finishes.

This game is only playable if you download the nvidia game ready driver 446.14.
When I installed the driver the game became playable (there were frequent game freezes + crashes every 2 minutes).

Now for the actual game...
I give it a 7/10. The main reason is because of the driver issue which should've been adressed to the players when starting the game or simply on the page!
 Gameplay wise I think it's not as good as other AC games. I enjoyed the combat but it takes so long to actually kill anyone until you reach the higher skill levels.

Apparently they decided to not add certain elements of the game until well into the storyline quests. SUPER FU CKING STUPID CHOICE.

I haven't done any fixes, just to test these crashes, and they happen about once every 3-4 hours or so (if they happen more often, its clearly something wrong with your system, or maybe just a faulty download). Its actually a nice reminder to get off the PC for a bit and move my legs.

There are also a lot of random freezing in the game. [b][u]THIS IS NO FAULT WITH THE GAME AT ALL[/u][/b]. This is caused by the new Nvidia drivers (there have been other games reporting this issue too). Just roll back or reinstall the 446 update one and it will be fixed.

This game is arguably the last ""assassin"" game. After this, they do feel more like an RPG than the unique style of games that Ubisoft produced (not that its a bad thing). If you're a fan of Assassin's Creed, there is no reason to not get this game. If you are looking to get into the Assassin's Creed franchise, go get Assassin's Creed 1 and work your way from there.

Pros:
Graphics are great.
Realistic Stealth
Not so much of an insane grind like Odyssey. You can go straight through the story without stopping for side quests.
Combat that doesn't let you go up against 100's of enemies and still win... (I'm looking at you black flag)
Cons:
The only bugs that do appear are quite annoying, like having to reset the game due to glitches. OR getting stuck in a barrel.
Guns don't really make a lot of sense. Like somehow a level 2 blighter can shoot you perfectly while driving a carriage and you're driving a carriage and there is a tiny portion of your head visible. 
Crafting is repetitive and annoying. ""Why do I need hide to invest in a shop???""

[b]Tip:[/b] There's a big amount of content that is kinda hidden but you definitely wanna play. Look for a new icon around the east end of the Thames midway through the story.

[b]Stuff Syndicate did great:[/b]

+ Stealth is much better. We can whistle again!
+ I enjoyed the story much more. There's a lot more character development and cutscenes are more prominent. Note that this story is much lighter than past AC games, but I welcomed that change of pace. Note that some [i]major[/i] revelations are hidden away as assassin intel in the database.
+ Villains are much better. Given more personality and I never had any moments of ""why am I killing this guy again?""
+ Assassination missions are even better than before since every one has an optional unique assassination. They're extremely fun.
+ The game has you play as twins, which makes the story and gameplay more diverse and lets us play as a woman for only the second time ever (and Liberation was kinda a side game, anyway).
+ Eagle vision isn't so annoying anymore. Though we can't use it while running.
+ Horse drawn carriages are a thing now and are a fun means to get around.
+ Modern day story is much more substantiative now. It's still all cutscenes and you are an anonymous, voiceless protagonist, but Unity set the bar reaaaally low.
+ Entering windows actually works consistently now.

[b]Stuff with trade-offs:[/b]

* London is quite nice, but it's not as lively as Paris.
* Combat is less frustrating. Unity was so heavily pushing me to smoke bomb every encounter. Syndicate's combat is more fast paced and has fewer enemies who block every normal attack. The downside is that it gets too easy very fast.
* The game adds a grappling hook, which is really great for getting around London's tall buildings and wide streets. Unfortunately, aiming it is a pain (it's not really manually aimed).
* The game has a district liberation mechanic and it's quite fun (lots of different activities to do), but it gets tiresome eventually. Arguably too many activities.
* Seems to be the least historically accurate AC game to date. Most villains are fictional. Buuut, it's not actually too bad because it let them write stronger villains.

[b]Stuff Syndicate did badly:[/b]

- Seriously, the game gets really easy. XP gain is too fast, I'd say. You can hit level 10 about halfway through the content.
- While most collectibles aren't too bad, helix glitches are terrible. Super hard to see, often difficult to reach, and just too many. But they at least offer story now instead of nothing.
- The game has terrible races added in. They're all optional and just for money, XP, and loyalty (which leads to a few unique items). They're fiendishly difficult and not fun.
- Very few buildings can be entered now. That was one of my favourite new features in Unity. I'm told it's for performance reasons, but I sure wish they could have made it optional for non-quest related buildings, then.
- Parkour is more restrictive. Characters stubbornly refuse to jump when I tell them to.

[b]DLC notes:[/b]

* Dreadful Crimes is amazing and the best of the DLC by far. Annoyingly it's not in the season pass.
* Last Maharaja is a buggy, poorly produced mess with merely an okay story (and very predictable).
* Jack the Ripper is fun, but the side content in it is meh.",1593988640,1593988640,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It's been a while since I've been unable to put down a game, usually I'll get distracted and end up forgetting to finish it. But with Syndicate, I played it full to the ending and I'm working on the collectible and optional missions now. 
Story: All the conflict felt genuine, Evie and Jacob's clashing personalities but love for each other felt authentic. The overall story of taking down each of the Templar's was well executed, it had a nice pacing. Evie and Jacob's stories were weaved together neatly and it felt like you were spending a balanced amount of time between them. 
Gameplay: Dear god I wish the rope launcher was standard fare for all AC games. I'm playing Unity now and I keep running off ledges while hitting R. The rope launcher was incredibly helpful for navigating the map, especially before you get the gang upgrade for the blighters to stop bothering you in the street. 
As for combat, it was well balanced, it wasn't too hard and it left you at a good pace where you could focus on leveling up in certain boroughs or you could jump into the next main mission a little early. 

I'd definitely recommend giving this a good go!",1593876982,1593876982,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

* Good graphics, great Victorian-era environments.
* OK Music and sound, but not great.
* Supports 21:9 ultrawidescreen.
* No bugs encountered.
* No FPS issues on tested high-end hardware.

* No first-person camera switch option.
* Controls via Mouse and keyboard are somewhat clunky.
* Climbing/jumping onto things is often frustrating. Sometimes you trigger wall climbs/jumps at corners accidentally, sometimes you have to move around to be in the right position to do a jump, etc.
* Story and plot feel somehow naive and sometimes childish. Lots of ass-pull plot devices.
* Lot's of cut-scenes and no-interaction sequences. If I want to watch a movie I go to a theater.

The ugly:

* You have to install the Uplay Cancer on your system.
* Ubisoft thinks it's necessary to rub their virtue signaling under everyone's nose at every start to pander to the easily-offended minorities.

I really liked AC Unity (I played it in 2019, so almost no bugs) and I didn't have many expectations about this game because of what I said above. But from the start, I've been really really hooked on this game and I [b][u]DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THIS GAME[/u]!!![/b].

I think the presentation of the story is marvelous, a few sequences to get how to control the characters and then boom, London! You can do whatever you want there. Personally, I liberated most of the city on sequence 4, and then Westminster on sequence 5 because of a necessary upgrade to achieve 100% on that mission. The story focus on one or two targets every sequence, which every one has its own perks to assassinate. I loved getting the unique kill opportunities. Also, the secondary objectives are really achievable. To me, that's positive, because it means I wouldn't get frustrated at every mission lol.

You also control 2 characters [spoiler](3 if you count WW1)[/spoiler], and they have their own missions. I love them both, I feel they are very charismatic in their own way, and I like their story though the game. Jacob is more carefree and decides to liberate London while Evie is more thoughtful and decides to look for the piece of Eden there in London. I know some people have complained about the leveling system, but I think it's pretty good, I was at level 10 really early on the story and if you do every mission, you'll most likely get to level 10 very fast.

The only negative thing I've encountered is that I can't get into the cooperative missions, or whatever they are called, it always displayed an error message.

Overall, this game is sooo good in my opinion. I had low expectations because ""meh, London"", but I'm so in love with the city and the story that now I'm really curious and willing to travel there one day!",1593299091,1593299091,True,1,1,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Here's the thing. Nothing in the game is truly memorable. There are only two missions I really remember, the Intro tutorial mission because everything was new and I was excited to be playing Assassins Creed again (I used to be a fan in the good old Ezio times), and the first real assassination mission because I learned some new game mechanics. It's unfortunate really because the story has potential and the main characters are interesting. But the game doesn't capitalise on it and instead you find yourself with an underwhelming feeling of meaninglessness every time you finish a mission. There were a couple of great plot twists that kept me going but even then, as soon as the cut scene finishes you're back in town, earned another few experience points and unlocked a new weapon without any significant impact on gameplay. No real sense of reward. No 60 seconds to get out of the place before it explodes, or being trapped until you find the secret exit, or anything like that, which makes you feel disconnected from the mission as soon as it's done. 
The cut scenes are short and repetitive and they fail to build up tension. I think maybe this is the biggest problem here. If you don't care much for the story and just enjoy climbing walls and killing targets from above, then this game is great! the free running flows (thanks to the infamous grappling hook) and the fighting mechanics are not bad. You can do combo hits and if you time your strikes you do more damage which is always satisfying.
But the assassinations don't give you that sense of achievement or reward, they are not challenging, they lack a sense of progress. The story is clumsy and the missions feel disconnected. There are too many characters and you don't really feel drawn to them. 

Some side missions however are quite fun, where the only way to do them is by not getting detected, which to me has always been the heart of the game. Stealth mechanics are decent and stealth kills do feel rewarding.

Only play it if you're a fan of the saga and if it's on sale for less than a fiver",1592937561,1592937561,False,49,2,0.645326197147369385,0,True,False,False

I have a real love-hate relationship with the AC games (well all the ones blag flag and after anyway). I tend to love the setting of them. But man the story themselves are downright boring, uninspiring, with some of the most aggravating pc controls I've ever had to deal with. And Syndicate is no different. 

1860's London is a great setting. You meet historical figures cause AC loves shoving that in your face. You get to see these absolute beautiful environments, and explore the large city of London, the voice acting is great...But that's about the only good thing from this game. 

One of the protagonist Evie was really interesting. I liked just how passionate she was for the Assassin order and was excited to see where it goes...Too bad it feels like the game makes her take the back seat to Jacob, her brother and other protagonist. Essentially the stereotype over-confident, thinks he's smug character.

The Controls in this game on K+M are some of the worst controls ever. Which is shocking cause AC on PC has always had awful controls so the fact there even worse here is a achievement alright. Too many actions are binded to the same keys which make for some frustrating moments (i.e E is tied to counter and also carrying bodies and looting them, making for some aggravating moments in the middle of combat). Add in AC's notorious parkour where your character refuses to do the simplest fucking things like letting go of a building edge, or refusing to hop over this tiny little fence. 

The game does introduce a grappling rope that you can use to get from rooftop to rooftop. This is cool at first until you start to realize the controls for that as well are also awful. Trying to swing to a specific spot? That's ok. The grappling hook will lock onto a different location at the last second so that it takes you longer to get to your definition.

The Carriage gameplay here literally makes me want to punch a wall. Any mission where I was required to drive a carriage I ended my game session upon completion. Streets are crowded with way too many carriages making it a nightmare to get around. Enemies chasing you in carriage pursuits are not fun in the slightest. You'll get fucking sandwiched in the middle of a dozen carriages from both enemies and passerby npc's. Trying to do attacks with your pistol on carriage is broken as hell as sometimes your character won't register that you're spamming the F key a thousand times to get them to shoot. Then when they do, they outright refuse to reload their guns so you're stuck getting shot up the ass by enemies while you're unable to defend yourself. There's a mechanic that allows you to ram your carriage into other carriage's but that's as useful as tapping someone on the hand telling them to stop. 

Story like I said at the beginning is very boring. No interesting characters aside from Evie, missions feel like added on chores with no real purpose. (Although there is one mission that has to do with Edward Kenway which was brief but cool). The villains are generic. 
But Holy Hell am I glad there were no Present Day abstergo bullshit. Ok there are cutscenes that you can't skip, but almost 20 hours in and I haven't been ripped out from the London setting to go hack some computer so that's good atleast. 

Overall probably play with a controller, and if you can deal with the same ole same ole formula of the AC franchise then you might enjoy this.",1592459809,1592459809,False,0,0,0.496550023555755615,0,True,False,False

I just recently watched a video by Gameranx about the most lived in worlds in video games and Syndicate was on that list. I initially didn't even give this game a second look because it just looked like another European version of Assassin's Creed which seemed to have been done before. What sold me in the video is that this was the closest to modern day that the franchise has ever gotten. That is what I have been waiting for and thought the series was originally headed for story-wise with a modern day game with Desmond as the protagonist. I am still waiting for a modern day AC game and hopefully even a futuristic version at some point.

The mechanics are roughly the same as previous entries in the series with a few notable exceptions, for example the new grappling hook allows you to instantly climb tall buildings, escape combat, and traverse between roof-tops - however it kinda removes the ""parkour across the rooftops"" which depending on your point of view was either an enjoyable hallmark of the franchise or really tedious - don't get me wrong you can still climb things the old way but it's slower so why would you. This doesn’t contribute to whether this view is negative or positive just that veterans of the series so far might be interested in knowing this beforehand.

The main story missions are the decent however the main characters a bit too stereotypical to believe. It was interesting getting to interact with famous characters [spoiler] like Alexander Graham Bell or Florence Nightingale, Charles Darwin, etc. And I really enjoyed the WW2 blitz sequence.[/spoiler]

As someone who lived in London for years, I was impressed how accurately parts of London were recreated and there were lots of ‘take a screen-shot’ moments!

Sadly, the game play loop of clearing areas gets tedious once you’ve done one of the same 3 types of side-missions about 9 times each, and the main story is not interesting enough to keep slogging through. I stopped playing at about 25hrs.
There were no technical problems or crashes.

The Bad:
- The story itself sounds sophisticated but in reality lacks excitement. It is boring and after some hours it seems like creativity was over.
- The game after some hours becomes so repetitive, kind of the same challenges over and over. At some point i wanted just to finish the game so i didn't care of stealth or bring people alive.

The customization is less than that of Unity, but what we're given is serviceable.

A little too easy to level up and gain all the items / upgrades imho.

Pro's
- I really like the sarcasm between the two main characters, Jacob and Evie.
- The addition of famous historical figures like [spoiler] Charles Darwin [/spoiler]
- ADORED the grappling hook.
- The carts make for a nice travel system in the game if you haven't synchronized a Viewing point near your destination
- Evie

Cons
- The addition of set famous historical figures didn't have a big part in the main story. 
- The side characters are just cast aways in the main story. An example is one of them, for whom you do some missions after one another and then never see or hear from him again. Guess he did a Hoodini? 
- You can kidnap a guard in front of another one and just walk away like it's just a normal thing. Oh nevermind me just taking this fella to the back lolxd
- Some minor awkward situations in the home train. One being that you have to climb on top of one specific part sometimes because there are people in the way inside the train part. Like what the hell just get out of my way. 
- Flat story.
[b] SPOILER [/b] filled explanation of the con above: 
[spoiler] The story was [b] very [/b] flat. It was all just a big happy ending. I also couldn't live into the characters. They're twins. Well, great! But give me something to relate to other than 'oh their father was a great man bla bla'. Also the fact that they decided to keep Henry alive in the end dissappointed me. Of course it is the choice of the writers, but I think the ending was very [b] VERY [/b] Disney like if I can say so. To me this just doesn't fit. [/spoiler]

I was born and lived in London for over 40 years, so I am intimately familiar with the streets and landmarks, particularly in the Westminster area. The developers have done a fantastic job on the detail, and you can compare buildings like Westminster Abbey, the Houses of Parliament, St Paul's Cathedral etc. with the real thing, and see what a stunning recreation this game is. A few liberties have been taken with layout, but what is there is correctly reproduced, and it makes a huge difference to me to be exploring a real city that I love and know well.

Regarding gameplay and overall plot, I don't really like the 'game within a game' idea, I don't see why I can't just be playing the actual characters, instead of playing modern people playing a video game of the characters. It just seems overly complex and unnecessary when I get ripped out of the Victorian setting for some modern cutscene that in no way affects gameplay. However it doesn't happen often, and I can mostly ignore and forget this aspect. 

I play using an XBox 360 controller for almost everything, as this is much more comfortable for me than keyboard. This works well for sneaking, fighting and driving carriages, and I enjoy the gameplay. It reminds me of Tenchu, an old Playstation game of Ninja in Feudal era Japan. 

The game develops nicely offering both freeplay activities around London and set missions. I found the first boss battle (in Whitechapel) to be the hardest of all the boss battles, probably because I took the wrong character (use Jacob for the bosses), and because I didn't know what to expect. Like Tenchu, these bosses require straight up fights, when you've been sneaking around trying to avoid straight up fights most of the time. 

Overall I am enjoying the game and will be getting others in the series, even though they won't have the London setting that makes this one particularly special for me. I have bought the pirate-themed one (Black Flag) and played a little, and several others look interesting. Hopefully they'll add a WW2 theme and a Feudal Japan theme eventually.",1590159695,1590159695,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

You use the same letter keys for multiple things, and if you hold them slightly too long, or hit them too quickly, you end up doing something completely different than you want to. 

Although there are fast-travel points, you can't actually use them any time you're in the middle of a mission/quest. Which is ridiculous. Your hideout is a train, which moves very slowly and if you've got a mission across the city, it takes forever to get there, no matter which travel method you use.

The carriage driving is also terrible. The controls are too sensitive and there's no way to modulate speed in a reasonable way, so you end up smashing into things and taking corners far too fast, without being able to easily navigate around obstacles or NPCs. 

And speaking of NPCs... Many, many missions have an insanely high amount of NPC characters, all of whom you have to overcome to achieve your goal or goals. And many of those NPCs are able to (and do) kill you in seconds, even when you stay within zones that are appropriate for your character skill limits. Redoing quests/missions over and over, simply because the leveling system is very badly done, is extremely frustrating. 

The sneak option is really poorly implemented too. In other AC games, things like high shrubs and grass, or even a stack of crates, are usually decent places to hide. Not in this game. There's basically nowhere except roof-tops to hide, and even when you do, NPC characters climb up right after you in excessively large numbers. Which breaks the immersion of the game, because if you're crouched and hiding on a roof, how the hell can characters hundreds of feet below you, spot you and climb up to you instantaneously? 

As well, I found the game to be very, very glitchy. Lots of stuttering, freezing, crashing. My hardware is more than capable of running it, but I had constant problems just getting the game to keep running. 

I really like quite a few games in the AC franchise, but this one is awful. Repetitive game-play, unimaginative storylines, terrible keymapping, terrible in-game navigation, terrible NPC leveling.

Pros: 
- Characters: I love Jacob and Evie Frye. Their charisma, sarcasm and wit always made me smile.
- Location: Beautiful location. My dad used to live in London so it was amazing to feel such familiar environments. 
- Good Story: The story is really well done. I didn't find any missions tedious or pointless at all (apart from maybe one of Evie's where you taxi politicians from A to B) I enjoyed all the options you were given during assassination missions. The idea of following 3 routes to a kill really livens up the game for me. 
-Freerunning: Usually, in my reviews of AC you'll find this in the Cons. But I believe they redid it all in Unity but I've yet to play that. But the Freerunning compared to past games is so so so sexy. No more climbing buildings randomly when trying to chase or run from someone. 
- Very few tail missions!!!: compared to previous games where you tail someone every 6 seconds. 
- the cosmetics are also v sexy.
- WW1 Missions!: FUCK YES. Having read the emails in AC:Black Flag where Abstergo literally say 'they are not going to do WW1 etc because it's too recent.' the fact that they slipped a few small missions in the London themed game really pleased me. 

Cons: 
- Liberating the areas is far too time consuming and dull (thankfully it's optional for the most part)
- Towards the end of my game, around 70%/80% through the campaign my game randomly began freezing frequently. Oftentimes even crashing to desktop and being unable to play without launching it 3 times. But for the first 70% it worked beautifully.

Well, that was disappointing. This entry to Assassins Creed felt like the developers were feeling pressured to make a new game to keep eager, edgy little 12 year olds interesting in their franchise. 
Remember how in the first game, even up to the third one, there was hefty storytelling and cutscenes before the real game actually started? Like you’d play some levels as your guy in the real world before you started reliving memories and doing all the cool Assassin Creed-y stuff? Yeah well, that doesn't happen here. You get about 50 seconds of a super minimized movie-like trailer that supposedly explains the ENTIRE plot in one go, that tells you who all the bad guys are, what all the key points of the story are  that honestly looks more like an E3 tech demo than it does an actual story mechanism. To top things off, the trailer doesn't even cover anything that’s happening in the real world - it's all about the memories you'd be reliving and the world that contains them. Remember in Red Faction Guerrilla when you get past the Town of Parker and the world opens up to you and there this short sequence that plays? It tells you about OOOHH COOL SIDE QUESTS and OOOHH BAD GUYS and OOOHHH UNLOCKABLE THIGNS THAT YOU SHOULD FIND and its super overdramatized? Well that’s EXACTLY, and I mean EXACTLY what happens here in this game, but the difference is that the one in Assassins Creed is meant to substitute any and all interactive introductory story telling. 
You know what we call that in the real world?

When I saw that, it made the first level and, honestly, the entirety of what I played feel rushed and not thought out. Probably because it was rushed and not thought out. 

When you finally get into the game, surprise, surprise - nothing has changed at all. BUT HEY GAMERS YOU GET TO PLAY AS TWO CHARACTERS AND ONE OF THEM IS A GRYLL!! 
Yeah, that'd be great if you gave me any motivation to actually play the game at all. It felt like Assassins Creed 3, just in watered-down Steam Punk London. You ""meet"" Charles Dickens in this game and other notable people of the time the same way - same exact way, in some case - as you did Benjamin Franklin and other notable persons from American history in AC 3. It felt like all they did was replace the skin and the voice actor but leave the sequence, the animations, and the circumstances basically the same. 

Again, what is that kids?

Oh, and let’s not forget the ultimate and sanguine experience of consequence free gaming. I guess that shit was cool when you were 12 and still said ""Frigg"" instead of more colorful words, but I'm a big boi now. I want big boi things. Big boi things are usually associated to high risk/high reward. 
In this game, Assassins Creed: Lazy Tech Demo, you can literally stab someone in their fucking neck in front of a huge crowd of people and NOT ONE OF THEM WILL EVEN FLINCH. 
You can simply get up and walk away without being followed. Enemies were about to be an exception except for the fact that combat is joke and gives you a 3 second window to parry attacks, all while instagibbing all enemies with your super cool, London-Victorian fighting style that make zero sense. 
If you haven't pieced it together yet, all of that is not high risk/high reward. 
It's negative risk/high reward. You'd have to be a drooling retard to enjoy a game this stupidly simple and unfinished. 
Some of the less relevant but equally annoying gripes are: 

The mantling system is painfully inaccurate. Want to climb that wall? Too bad! Looks like youll be jumping into the out-of-bounds body of water next to it and drowning! Thanks for playing!

The voice acting is too good. I know, I know, I'm complementing this shitty game. Let me ask you this: what’s worse than a game that could be cool falling flat on it's face? Doing the same thing but falling even harder because of how cool some parts of the game could have made the rest of them. The voice acting was top notch, especially between the main characters. The facial expressions were great and they had believable and human banter back and forth and I really liked it. 

And then the rest of the game happened. 

Imagine this. You're told that you're getting handgun as a birthday present. Oh how exciting! Oh joy! You go out and buy the most expensive, clean and efficient ammo you can find for, lets just say, 9mm in this case. .43 cents a round? PFFT. More like $1.35 per round! All 200 of them! That's right baby, you got the good stuff. Gonna make this gun a polished and streamlined workhorse with these badboys. All the salty boomers at the range are gonna be jealous of you!

Your birthday rolls around. You run downstairs, almost tripping and falling over the feeties on your puppy-dog onesie pajamas. You plop your fatass down in the chair in front of the birthday cake, it's numerical candles, one in the shape of ""4"" and the other, ""0"". They flicker, casting bright orange slivers across your greasy face. Your mom or dad come out from the kitchen but you can't tell who cause youre so focused on the table in front of you, desperately awaiting your present. 

It's here. The moment you've been waiting for. You dragged your case of ammo with you and now its resting on the table, heavy and expensive. The parental unit slides the small, sleek, plastic box in front of you and immediately attack it with your disgusting fingers. You break the tape, almost crying with excitement and open the latches. The clam-shell opens, slowly. There it is!
THERE IT IS!

ITS-

ITS A-

IT'S A.......it's a.....Hipoint?

What??
What the fuck??



Being half retarded and knowing nothing about guns, you think, ""Well that's oddly disappointing but how bad could it be?"". You take it to the range and get summarily laughed off the firing line after a disastrous series of misfires, misfeeds and just not being able to maintain a sight picture because the disgusting abomination is so fucking heavy. Afterwards, boogery and crying, you decided to just use it as a door stop because not even the gun exchange will take returns for that model and GunBroker banned your IP after you put it up for sale.

If you followed all of that, that is basically what playing this game felt like. It was like they rushed through it, marketing it as ""OH HEY DONT WORRY GUYS ITS STILL AN ASSASSINS CREED! sAVe ThE pEIcEs Of EdeN AMIRITE?!!?!?! ;;;;;))))))"" just to keep people satiated until they took their fists out of their assholes and make an actual game. 

Obviously, I don't recommend this. Save your money, literally do not even buy this on sale. It was such a disappointment after playing the better titles in the franchise. 

Overall, be smart and Buy CZ or Glock/10

There are still bugs here but I suppose they have become a default for AC games now. The game does have a good story to dwell into and the brother-sister combo is pretty good. I did not find the game that challenging as it had grind mechanics which you can use to get levels ahead of what is required for story missions mostly.

The combat is more versatile than previous games, when it plays out well it plays out well but sometimes it can get frustratingly weird, if you got bonked on your head by the cops you'll know what I mean.

Graphics are impressive but do keep in mind of the quite common stutter bug this game has, to fix that add the code to turn of nvidia hariworks framerate thingy(just google how to do it) and that smoothens the game out, also you can turn off the fog for more clarity.

I would rate the game 3.5/5, it is still a decent game for the fans but not as good as Black Flag or the initial games in the sense of story. As far as mechanics go it is more fun to play out than the older games but at the cost of some annoying glitches and cheesy story points.

Loved:
-The gorgeous London recreated with sights to see, probably one of my top favorite settings in an open world game.
-The train hideout system.
-The multiple ways you can assassinate your final targets.
-Costume design.
-Free run is more fun with the grapple mechanic.
-Cart driving was also fun, I still don't understand how you make a horse ram :p but fun none the less.
-Good story for the most part, especially the DLC for Jack.
-The precursor object they are in the game seems to be an interesting one.

Hated:
-The additional objectives of missions don't grant you half the bonus if you complete half of them, you need to complete all of them which sometimes is annoyingly hard due to bugs with freerunning or weird detection glitches. Like in the strong hold conquests sometimes a rook would die for no apparent reason and I won't ge the extra bonus.
-The love story between eevie and henry just seems shite, like hes the damsel in distress and his intrusion in the game feels forced and unnecessary. Kinda annoying character to be an assassin. For how much I loved Jacob and Eevies as the protagonists, I hated Henry as a whiney b****.
-Nothing unlocks if you conquest all of London, it would be amazing if you got a side mission or atleast a cutscene for conquering the whole city, I got none. This grind brought me back to another game I hated, Mafia 3, for doing useless conquering stuff with no end result or gift to the player. Atleast a cutscene would be good.

I would rate the game 3.5/5, it is still a decent game for the fans but not as good as Black Flag or the initial games in the sense of story. As far as mechanics go it is more fun to play out than the older games but at the cost of some annoying glitches and cheesy story points.

Technically recommended, although it’s defenitely not the best Assassin’s Creed game.

First, the good...

Gameplay - 9/10
A lot of fun and makes the game actually worth playing. It has enough variety for a truly assassin oriented game, in order to not feel excessively repetitive. I honestly didn’t feel that the controls during combat and free-running/parkour were any clunkier than they usually are in an Assassin’s Creed game - although this has always annoyed me. The combat system is not the best in the franchise, but also not the worst, and it’s very easy to master. It is, at times, pretty frustrating because it can be unresponsive - more so than in previous installments. For some reason triggering finishers, especially group finishers, is hard to achieve. The movements are very fast, which I like, but the combat animations themselves as well as the ragdoll physics aren’t the best, and there is almost no blood. The stealth system is fun and easy. The parkour system is also excellent, even better with the ability to zipline between the enormous buildings, making exploration both fun and immersive. The rope launcher also adds a really cool stealth mechanic with the ability to return to rooftops extremely quickly after swooping down for stealthy air assassinations.

Graphics - 8/10
Although not as high quality as Unity, I still found the graphics of this game to be really nice for a 2015 game (excluding Witcher 3).

Performance - 8/10
Decent performance given the quality of the graphics, with occasional frame drops and very short, temporary freezes only in demanding combat situations. However, my graphics card being six years old, this was actually surprisingly better than expected. I think the game has been decently optimized but it could be better.

Setting/Time Period - 7/10
Victorian England, from the surroundings to the people all around, felt extremely immersive. London is an absolute pleasure to explore, with realistically sized buildings that really make you feel you are there. However, the time period itself is not exactly the most exciting one in the franchise and also the somber looking city, accurately portrayed for its time period, is not the most beautiful to look at.

Soundtrack - 9/10
Beautiful and appropriate for the setting. Unlike other assassin’s creed games, the songs are actually new instead of being recycled versions of the same Assassin’s Creed II melody.

And now the really, really bad...

Plot - 0/10
Probably the worst plot in the entire assassin’s creed franchise. Contrived, predictable, illogical and boring. Throughout the story, the male protagonist is demeaned as much as possible in order to exalt the female protagonist as much as possible in exchange, with very forced, obvious tropes all over. The entire story felt more like a parody or a mockery of the franchise, especially of its own main character featured in the game’s cinematic trailer. There were numerous missed opportunities to improve his character development. Having dual protagonists was terribly executed. Greatly disappointing.

Characters - 4/10
The male protagonist, Jacob Frye, is a deeply flawed, relatable, fun assassin, with an amazing sense of humor, sharp wit, upbeat attitude and really badass, lore friendly skills. Overall, he is a breath of fresh air among too many uptight, serious, boring characters. He is also young, reckless, immature, brash, cocky, rebellious and appears to be the black sheep of his family. He has serious father issues. Like all trained assassins, Jacob is adept at stealth, but he doesn’t actually excel at it - he does, however, excel greatly in combat. He is thrilled at being an assassin and is very enthusiastic about it, unlike many other assassin’s creed protagonists. Jacob’s voice actor is amazing. As a character, Jacob Frye is on par with Edward Kenway of Assasin’s Creed IV Black Flag due to having very similar personality traits and character flaws. However, in this story he is portrayed horribly, unfortunately, and because the plot and the writing in general were so bad, his character development was seriously hampered. He is portrayed as the cliched “dumb little brother” of the female protagonist, Evie Frye, who in turn is portrayed as the cliched know-it-all “wise older sister” - and they’re twins. In contrast to Jacob, Evie has absolutely NO character flaws whatsoever and is the “best” at everything. She has the wisdom of an assassin Mentor when she’s just as young as Jacob, who she treats like garbage constantly. She has a ridiculously overpowered invisibility skill that is totally anti-lore and unexplained. She has no personality and is constantly getting highly praised by tons of characters and is liked by everyone that isn’t an antagonist - in other words, she’s a Mary Sue. All the flaws went to the male and none to the female. As a woman who strongly believes in gender equality, I was very disappointed. The assassin’s creed franchise needs realistic and believable female protagonists with flaws, complexity, and a personality. Lastly, in this game there is also a complete absence of interesting and memorable side characters and villains. The main villain, Crawford Starrick, was very generic. Only Jacob Frye contrasted all the boring, contrived, one-dimensional characters.

So, in conclusion...

If you play Assassin’s Creed games for the gameplay and immersion and NOT for the story or characters, by all means, play this game - it’s a lot of fun! But if you need a well written story that actually makes sense, doesn’t put you to sleep, and has memorable characters, play Black Flag or the Ezio trilogy instead.",1513029570,1589300971,True,4,2,0.514783859252929688,0,True,False,False

- Uplay deleted my save file: 18 hours into the game. Determined it to be one of the better AC games. Then had an internet issue so started Uplay in offline mode.

Overall amazing game. While it's not as memorable as AC 4,3 or the Ezio chronic's, it's definitely amazing. The Evie and Jacob duo was absolutely beautiful. Both interesting and developing characters, without any character persona plot holes, they do as they are meant to, they do as they seem. Very nice screenplay on them. The game conquering system is a bit boring, but I found it quite relaxing while watching smnth at the same time. Leveling and combat system both mediocre. The grappling hook really did it for me, saved me from being tortured by climbing everything, it was really fun to use as well, a really nice solution to the horrible mechanics of Unity. Animation and graphics were both really good, the weather and mood of London was definitely easy to feel and understand. Animation of individuals, while a bit stiff, they were nice to look at, fluent and such. Incomparable to Unity, which had so little time put into that. The side quests were while amusing due to the story of old London, like Jack the Ripper and stuff, it was mundane af. Basically ""catch, take, kidnap, tackle, kill"". The stories were good, but did not feel very, or any really, interactive scenes or anything. Even with me catching Jack the ripper sooner than the game planed, so I have to wait for him to run to a different point while I just wait from him to run away, as I was faster than him. Didn't feel very planned out on the side missions. Weapons and armory in general were really boring. While it made sense considering it was at that time in a big city, it was really boring with the same weapons, just +1 +1 damage or whatnot, while I did not feel any difference in combat by having any of the weapons. The recruit gang stuff was in a way interesting, but kind of useless to me as they were generally weak and not really needed since the game itself was quite easy. The main story, Jacob and Evie, graphics, voice acting, interesting personas and history of London was really, really amusing and definitely worth the price of the game.

There are minor issues like carriages or people spawning in out of nowhere, but it's a big game and not everything can be perfect all the time.

Unfortunately, I am not recommending this game. First, I don't like the idea which some misc items to be collected are hidden and we got to buy it, with real money if you want a shortcut. The story was not that good, in my opinion. Including side missions like Charles Darwin, Queen Victoria, etc. I think Ubisoft could've squeezed them into one mission instead of making 3-4 short missions. The graphics, however, I'm impressed, especially at night. It looks beautiful but not day time. The lighting feels and looks off. The next turnoff is the freaking glitch. There was once where I fell out from the map trying to open chests (check my screenshot). Another occasion was when I glitched into a building. Not to mention the soundtrack. The soundtrack was bloody good but it was not put up to good use. I felt boring exploring the city without the soundtrack playing in the background, in contrast to Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag. Even on killing the enemies and sneaking into a hostile base. In my opinion, the cons outweigh the pros.",1588862474,1588862524,False,19,2,0.586886405944824219,3,True,False,False

This was the last AC game to really feel like an AC game before Ubisoft went RPG in Origins and Odyssey.

The gang mechanic is neat and harkins back to AC brotherhood. The grappling hook harkins back to the hook blade in AC Revelations but is now upgraded and makes traversal a blast.

It's certainly a different experience from other AC games, combat is much more of a brawl/beat'em up style rather than quickly dispatching several enemies immediately after combat starts, and the dual-protagonist mechanic is a very different breed from any other AC game. That said, it's a great game so far, characters are fun and all seem pretty genuine, if a bit on the nose, but the dialogue between siblings is genuine, and the little pokes and competitions they have together are pretty spot on for actual siblings, the combat flow is smooth and much faster paced than other games, it actually requires proper timing to parry and counter enemies, not at all like the heavily broadcasted attacks from enemies that you can instantly parry and kill them with. Movement is wonderful, holding space while freerunning automatically climbs up, holding E automatically runs down, makes for a much less frustrating parkour element than past installments. All in all, its a different experience having 2 characters with separate skill trees and playstyles (Evie is smart and cunning, much better at stealth, while Jacob is better at direct combat and loud approaches). Characters are well put together, combat and movement is smooth, and the story seems really fun so far, but thats 100 minutes of gameplay so who knows.

-Good set of character upgrades and customization
-Traversing the game world is much easier. You can use Rope Launcher to zipline across big gaps from building to building both horizontally and vertically
-You get to hire gangs around the streets who'll aid and fight for you
-Audio and music is authentic to the 1800 era
-You'll get to meet and interact with lots of historical characters
-Some fun side activities like fist fighting, racing, robberies

Cons
-Story is meh. Nothing to write home about. Just your generic assassin vs templar plot set in yet another country. Only the main characters held the story together
-Gameplay loop while fun does get very repetitive with the same basic busywork of killing, tailing, capturing, infiltrating, conquering etc on different districts

You'll mainly be playing Assassin's Creed Syndicate for the strong main characters and exploring the visually appealing, beautifully crafted city of London. Its a fun game while it lasts but not a game you'd go back and play all over again. Buy it on discount. You'll get your money's worth then.

I tried the workaround in the thread, and it didn't fix the issue for me. It should have been fixed by now in a patch, but clearly Ubisoft don't care because they already have my money, and they have moved on to develop and sell other poorly tested games.
I was trying to work my way through the whole series (100% completed all of the previous titles) to finally get to Origin and Odyssey, and was blocked by a bug that is in the game from either pure incompetence or indifference from the developers. The game is not very good, and I was really just going through the motions since I'm a completionist; so I'll just move on to better games. Thanks Ubisoft!

unfortunatly the combat becomes easy towards the mid-end and most times not even worth the trouble when you gain access to so many tools that allow you to clear out entire factories without even using your main weapon

for me the game would crash after every large portion of the game for example after you kill a main figure the they would talk a bit then boom the game would completely freeze

i had to use the save that was on the cloud and hope it didnt overwrite it with the corrupted one good thing i didnt have an internet connection

Technically recommended, although it’s defenitely not the best Assassin’s Creed game.

I have been a huge Assassin’s Creed fan since 2009 after playing the masterpiece that is Assassin’s Creed II. However, due to the bad reputation of this game, it was not until 2020 that I finally played it for the first time. Now I understand why it has such mixed reactions... because mine is one of them.

First, the good... 

Gameplay - 9/10
A lot of fun and makes the game actually worth playing. It has enough variety for a truly assassin oriented game, in order to not feel excessively repetitive. I honestly didn’t feel that the controls during combat and free-running/parkour were any clunkier than they usually are in an Assassin’s Creed game - although this has always annoyed me. The combat system is not the best in the franchise, but also not the worst, and it’s very easy to master. It is, at times, pretty frustrating because it can be unresponsive - more so than in previous installments. For some reason triggering finishers, especially group finishers, is hard to achieve. The movements are very fast, which I like, but the combat animations themselves as well as the ragdoll physics aren’t the best, and there is almost no blood. The stealth system is fun and easy. The parkour system is also excellent, even better with the ability to zipline between the enormous buildings, making exploration both fun and immersive. The rope launcher also adds a really cool stealth mechanic with the ability to return to rooftops extremely quickly after swooping down for stealthy air assassinations.

Graphics - 8/10
Although not as high quality as Unity, I still found the graphics of this game to be really nice for a 2015 game (excluding Witcher 3).

Performance - 8/10
Decent performance given the quality of the graphics, with occasional frame drops and very short, temporary freezes only in demanding combat situations. However, my graphics card being six years old, this was actually surprisingly better than expected. I think the game has been decently optimized but it could be better.

Setting/Time Period - 7/10
Victorian England, from the surroundings to the people all around, felt extremely immersive. London is an absolute pleasure to explore, with realistically sized buildings that really make you feel you are there. However, the time period itself is not exactly the most exciting one in the franchise and also the somber looking city, accurately portrayed for its time period, is not the most beautiful to look at.

Soundtrack - 9/10
Beautiful and appropriate for the setting. Unlike other assassin’s creed games, the songs are actually new instead of being recycled versions of the same Assassin’s Creed II melody.

And now the really, really bad...

Plot - 0/10
Probably the worst plot in the entire assassin’s creed franchise. Contrived, predictable, illogical and boring. Throughout the story, the male protagonist is demeaned as much as possible in order to exalt the female protagonist as much as possible in exchange, with very forced, obvious tropes all over. The entire story felt more like a parody or a mockery of the franchise, especially of its own main character featured in the game’s cinematic trailer. There were numerous missed opportunities to improve his character development. Having dual protagonists was terribly executed. Greatly disappointing.

Characters - 4/10
The male protagonist, Jacob Frye, is a deeply flawed, relatable, fun assassin, with an amazing sense of humor, sharp wit, upbeat attitude and really badass, lore friendly skills. Overall, he is a breath of fresh air among too many uptight, serious, boring characters. He is also young, reckless, immature, brash, cocky, rebellious and appears to be the black sheep of his family. He has serious father issues. Like all trained assassins, Jacob is adept at stealth, but he doesn’t actually excel at it - he does, however, excel greatly in combat. He is thrilled at being an assassin and is very enthusiastic about it, unlike many other assassin’s creed protagonists. Jacob’s voice actor is amazing. As a character, Jacob Frye is on par with Edward Kenway of Assasin’s Creed IV Black Flag due to having very similar personality traits and character flaws. However, in this story he is portrayed horribly, unfortunately, and because the plot and the writing in general were so bad, his character development was seriously hampered. He is portrayed as the cliched “dumb little brother” of the female protagonist, Evie Frye, who in turn is portrayed as the cliched know-it-all “wise older sister” - and they’re twins. In contrast to Jacob, Evie has absolutely NO character flaws whatsoever and is the “best” at everything. She has the wisdom of an assassin Mentor when she’s just as young as Jacob, who she treats like garbage constantly. She has a ridiculously overpowered invisibility skill that is totally anti-lore and unexplained. She has no personality and is constantly getting highly praised by tons of characters and is liked by everyone that isn’t an antagonist - in other words, she’s a Mary Sue. All the flaws went to the male and none to the female. As a woman who strongly believes in gender equality, I was very disappointed. The assassin’s creed franchise needs realistic and believable female protagonists with flaws, complexity, and a personality. Lastly, in this game there is also a complete absence of interesting and memorable side characters and villains. The main villain, Crawford Starrick, was very generic. Only Jacob Frye contrasted all the boring, contrived, one-dimensional characters.

So, in conclusion...

If you play Assassin’s Creed games for the gameplay and immersion and NOT for the story or characters, by all means, play this game - it’s a lot of fun! But if you need a well written story that actually makes sense, doesn’t put you to sleep, and has memorable characters, play Black Flag or the Ezio trilogy instead.",1587334341,1587334341,True,28,4,0.638348400592803955,0,True,False,False

Cool. With it I can quickly grapple my way to rooftops and create ziplines between buildings to slide across. It's fairly clunky and somewhat limited—I often find myself staring at a nearby roof and wondering why the hell I'm not allowed to sling over to it when I've reached smokestacks twice as far away—but it's still fun and gives me a way to escape, Batman-like, from a brawl I'm badly losing. It also provides an alternative to freerunning across rooftops, which feels the same as it does in other Assassin's Creed games: fun and dynamic at first, but ultimately a bit routine, and sometimes even exasperating. That's not a bad way to describe Assassin's Creed: Syndicate itself. There's a good first half where almost everything is fun and exciting, and slowly but surely it begins to drag. 

As in past Assassin’s Creed games, you're once again inhabiting the bodies and memories of heroic assassins via a futuristic (magic, really) virtual reality machine. There's a sprawling open-world you can explore by free-running and climbing. The streets are cluttered with innocent bystanders, angry policemen, and vicious members of an enemy faction. The map is covered with icons signifying collectibles, side and story missions, and vantage points: tall buildings you can scale to reveal even more locations of interest. Stealth is your primary tool, and missions typically involve careful infiltration, lurking above enemies, and taking them out before they know you're there. There are also a few tailing missions, where you must follow a target without being spotted, though I found them considerably more forgiving than I have in the past. 

Syndicate offers up some other new toys and features, mostly cribbed from other open-world games but still enjoyable enough to freshen up the proceedings, at least for a while. There are horse-drawn carriages all over London, allowing for GTA-esque hijacking, high-speed driving, and the comical bowling over of bowler-hatted Londoners. As you battle the Blighters, the gang that's taken control of London, you can employ thugs from your own gang, a la Saint's Row, to do some of your fighting for you. Combat is Arkham-style as you take on huge crowds with counter-attacks, combos, and finishing moves. These things are initially fun—I really did enjoy my first handful of hours with the game—but by mid-Creed they mostly begin to feel like a chore. A late-game carriage-based story mission might have been bracing if you hadn't already taken dozens of carriage rides. Battling a half-dozen enemies is initially exciting, but hours in it becomes just another exercise in patient (or impatient) clicking. 

I felt at odds with myself, when I started my journey with Jacob and Evie I loved every bit of the world, but the longer I played the more of a chore everything became. The ripper DLC along with Dreadful crimes was a saving grace. But after finishing Syndicate I think an extended break is needed from the franchise. Let me be clear, I didn't hate the game, in fact I quite enjoyed it, but the game falls short with too much of the ""same"" events filling the world and an extremely anticlimactic end. Overall I'd give it a 6 out of 10.",1587158414,1587158414,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

However... for me this is the best instalment in the franchise. I know that almost every AC fan will disagree with me but as a person who played almost every AC game, this is the only one where you actually have a little bit fun. Here's why:

First of all, the story doesn't take itself serious. This made AC fans angry as the story in Syndicate is just not taking itself serious at all. You have so many ridiculous moments throughout the game that you stop taking the game serious anymore. But I am not a fan of the franchise, even though I played a lot of them. For me this was the only game where you can actually have somewhat fun. The interactions between Jacob, Evie, Henry and other historical figures are very ridiculous and make it seem like the whole story is just a joke, but that's all I want personally from a game and this game delivers it. I do hate the assassins lore and all the fight for pieces of Eden, and in this game, that lore was absent 99% of the time, except for the final boss fight, which was just horrible. That was undoubtedly the worst part in the entire game. The game also fails to show any character development throughout the whole story, but to be honest, it's not even needed. The characters are just having fun and the small conflicts between the twins during the story are enough for the serious part.

The graphics are great, the environment is more colourful and a little bit more cartoonish, but it has its charm. The 19th century London is beautiful and I love just casually walking around the map ad just enjoying the atmosphere of the industrial era. It being my favourite era in history makes this game even more pleasurable for me to play and explore. The music fits the story and the environment perfectly. The animations are great, they are done better than Origins, at least the people here have emotions on their face.

Gameplay is... well AC, nothing really changed. They added the grappling hook and the carriages which makes it easier to travel. The fighting animations are not very interesting and are buggy, but well, every single AC game has buggy controls so nothing surprising. But in general it is has the most boring fighting animations and this is the weakest link in the whole game. They also added the levels system which wasn't really that annoying. You still need to grind xp to progress in story, but personally that is not a big issue in the game.

The dlc's are good. Well the dreadful crimes missions were great, I loved those missions as it actually felt great being a detective. The issue is that you don't really face any consequences from accusing a wrong person except for a little bit of money loss, but I think it would've been better if the game made the player try to get deeper into the case and actually try and solve it. The last Maharaja story was just bad. It was boring and not fun at all. I don't know what was the point of it at all and honestly I haven't even payed attention to it but I don't think I missed anything serious. And finally the Jack the Ripper storyline which was pretty good. You get to play as the Ripper a little but even though it's not a lot, you still can enjoy Ubisofts take on the Ripper. You also get to see older Jacob and Evie which eventually shows some character development, as they seem more mature.

Concerning the bugs, it has a lot of course, it's an AC game it can't be without bugs. The climbing bugs that made Unity such an annoying game to play were mostly gone, so you could finally enjoy parkour without getting stuck every five minute.

In conclusion, for an AC game I rate it as 4/10. It is a bad AC game just because it is somewhat disconnected from most of the lore. You can skip Syndicate after Unity and play Origins and it still wouldn't change anything. But as a game that is just fun to play, I rate it 7/10. It has a flaws and ignoring them is impossible, however I played the game for over 100 hours, I finished every mission perfectly and got every single achievement on this game, and I honestly don't regret a single minute spent in this game, no matter how repetitive it was sometimes. So i recommend this to those who just want to play a game with a light story and no deep lore from previous games.",1573640784,1586827359,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The gameplay felt slightly different from all of the games before Syndicate and enjoyed it very much. The setting of London was done very well and felt like a city come to life, something I've always enjoyed in AC games. However after about hour 20 of cleaning up boroughs and picking up collectibles the games repetition started to sink which is the series' greatest flaw. You can see the start of what Origins become in this game and I welcome the changes that Ubisoft is bringing to the series. I hope they continue to change the game in ways that keep the players wanting to come back for more, not leave because it's the same game reskinned over and over.",1586747237,1586747237,True,1,0,0.525862038135528564,0,True,False,False

TL:DR; The story is a bit lame, especially the ending, but the gameplay and overall feel more than makes up for it.

I guess I should begin by saying I think this is probably all-round the best Assassin's Creed game Ubisoft have made, but it does have some flaws too.

As alluded to in the TLDR the story leaves quite a bit to be desired. I know by now we've established the general principle ""Templars are bad, Assassin's are good. You're an Assassin so go poke the bad guys with pointy things"" but in this case that seems to be literally the only motivation you have. They don't even seem to be doing anything *that* morally wrong in this case, other than wanting to control stuff (but I mean who doesn't??).

**SPOILER ALERT**
There are also a couple of continuity issues in the missions that have frustrated me... there's a particular mission where Evie gets hypnotized and as the player you have to steal from some civilians for him. For me that broke my flow a bit in terms of connection with the character... but more perhaps more significantly as soon as I got control back I naturally pulled out my gun and shot him in his stupid face with his annoying fake a** accent. Imagine my elation when he went down like a sack of the proverbial. Alas I still had to complete the mission and he was miraculously alive again at the next step of the sequence. There are a couple of instances like that and it's just a bit frustrating.

The ending is also kinda rubbish. The final boss fight is pretty weak and Evie ends up in some half-assed romance with a hapless Assassin. For the record Ubisoft, the world has never and will never need hapless Assassins. All Assassins should be bad-asses, that's how this works. This is at the end of a conflict between Jacob and Evie that seems randomly forced and unnecessary, every 'mistake' of Jacobs that Evie clears up seems to have been completely unforeseeable/outside of his control and happens purely because 'reasons'.

** END OF SPOILERS **

Really though I'm just quibbling. The story could be better and the armour you get for Evie as a result of unlocking Reuge's Vault looks really lame, but these are just trivial things. Call me a loser but even just going through and finding the 'Secrets of London' music boxes from the picture clues was quite fun.

Overall the gameplay is really well done and smooth. The world-building and feel of London is awesome, especially speaking as a Brit. I especially love the grappling hook and carriage mechanics, they make moving through the city a lot of fun as opposed to just getting from A to B. 

The borough control system is awesome too, wresting control of London from the 'Blighters' (ok, ok that is a dumb name) piece by piece all the while levelling up your characters was great. Investing in your gang and watching them grow over time is very satisfying.

I know people have complained over the twin system and the addition of Evie because it's seen as bowing to PC brigade but honestly I feel like it adds quite a lot. Having two playable characters, one with a combat specialty and one with a stealth specialty kept the gameplay feeling fresh from beginning to end. I'll admit I took it a little far and some 'assassinations' with Jacob became a case of summoning a carriage of Rooks alongside my normal complement of 5 bodyguards and storming the location with fire and fury... but IMHO the ability to do that broke things up nicely in a game series which has historically been a bit 'samey'.

This has been quite the ramble but hopefully this helps someone :). Bought this on sale for £15 and it's honestly the best value for money I've had in a while.",1586371914,1586557474,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

AC Syndicate, In my opinion i think everything in this game is making this easy to play. such as rooks or the gang [whatever] u can give them order to kill ur target or use them to protect u. and many activities such as cargo hijack, boat raid, child liberation etc.is better than boring side quests of AC unity [Murder Mysteries, Paris story, Nostradamus enigma]  And moreover  u can easily climbing to viewpoint by using rope launcher to reach the top of the building instead of climbing normally.

However, after 14 hours of gameplay and completing the main storyline, I can safely say this is one of my favorite games in the series. I didn't realize how much fun it would be to play as an Assassin during the industrial revolution. I loved every bit of it. There were a couple of things that annoyed me of course.

1st Con:

Since Unity, Ubisoft has the removed the counter kill feature.. I dont know what the exact name for it is, but it's extremely polished in AC 1 and the Kenway series. Basically allowing you to destroy groups of enemies by correctly reacting to each type of unit, kill,throw,disarm,stun, etc etc. It's in the Ezio Trilogy, but it's so weird and complex. The kenway series perfected it and it makes being the assassin so much fun. Even though were suppose to be sneaky SnEaKy, assassins are living breathing weapons, and the Kenway series shows how cool this system is. I hope one day they bring this back. Imagine how much cooler combat would have been with this system in Syndicate.

2nd con:
We are on PC, so were not usually using joysticks. when kidnapping somebody, to keep yourself from looking suspicious, you have to walk very slowly. If you don't have a controller, you have to gently tap the wasd buttons so that you don't attract too much attention, which I found annoying. PLEASE FIX THIS UBISOFT...or don't this game old anyways whatever. 

3rd Con: 
The Modern storyline from what I've seen after playing Origins and Odyssey 100% completion as well, is absolutely pointless. I mean, wtf happens to the shroud???? Who knows, and I guess who cares. The modern storyline has seemed to be pointless since Black Flag until recently in Odyssey which seems to be taking a new route with this Layla chick. But yea....pointless

Yes the story was cheezy, but all Ubisoft's stories are cheezy. And I really enjoyed playing as Jacob and Evie back and forth, which was way better than in Odyssey where they just flipped the two motherfuckers around which is so stupid but ok....

Get this game..You won't regret it. It is freaking awesome. BTW, as of today at 11:58pm, I have played and beaten every single Assassins Creed game. Hooray!!!!

Sadly, another rather forgettable saga in the Assassins Creed series. 
In many ways, Syndicate is the best version in the series up to this point.  Unfortunately it falls flat in one of the most important parts of an Assassins Creed game - the main story.  The game feels like a huge missed opportunity. 

The good: 
 - Best controls of any Assassins Creed game up to this point.  The run-up and run-down commands work very well.  Carts and the rope launcher are amazing.  And combat is smooth without any difficulty focusing on an enemy. 
 - The mini missions are quite enjoyable.  Unfortunately there are to many of them. 
 - Evy and and Jacob are quite likable characters. And for a change the main characters actually look like they could be assassins, not pretty boys. 
 - New ways to navigate (carts and rope launcher) cuts down considerably on time wastage. This made a huge difference to the game experience.  
 
The bad:  
 - The game is still far to long.  There is way too many mini missions and pointless generic crap to collect.  It is better than most games in the series.  But the game really starts to drag towards the end. 
 - Unfortunately, the main missions are a real letdown.  Most Assassins Creed games get this part right, but Syndicate doesn't.  The main missions are too short, too easy and show little of London's splendor.  
 - London feels really bland - most of it could have been any generic location.  You see too little of the grand historic sites in London - towards the end when the game starts to drag.  Assassins Creed Unity may have been a mess; but at least Paris looked and felt amazing. 
 - The game is too easy.  You can use the brute force approach 90%+ of the time. There is little need for stealth.  That is sad, because the stealth is the most fun in my opinion.  
 - The script writing is bad.  You start with two very likable characters, who fall out in the middle and make up in the end. It is so cheesy it hurts. 

The ugly: 
 - Horrible bug mess.  Crashess galore. 
 - The multi-kill action selection is hopeless.",1586280303,1586280303,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I set out to play them in chronological order and it wasn't going well at first. I liked the concept but had to force my way through the earlier games. Brotherhood and Black Flag were about the only ones I enjoyed for the most part with others either being more annoying than entertaining or just flat out bad.

This one is INCREDIBLY impressive.

Positives:
While it still retains the (mostly) awful parkour mechanics where the character does all the work and you just point in the direction you wanna go, they refined it quite a bit. In the previous game actually, they added a separate free run down key. I struggled to get used to it after so many years of playing the other games but the previous title just wasn't good enough to really hook me so I never got a chance to really come to grips with it.
Well now with this one I think they polished everything rather nice and once you get used to it, it is SO MUCH easier to safely get down, in fact I haven't fallen and taken damage once.
As usual for an AC game, the animations, voice acting and sound effects are all very well done. The characters are quite likable so far and the introduction of the grappling hook, which I thought would put a sour taste in my mouth, is actually super useful. Not only does it speed up climbing huge buildings but it makes for much faster escapes. And of course...you don't HAVE to use it if you don't want to.
The fighting is much improved! It is the most well done 'melee' combat of a ""fighting"" game like this I have played. (Comparing to stuff like Mad Max and Batman etc). I say melee loosely because there are various weapon strikes here and there but I won't compare it to the might of the legendary Witcher 3.
Most importantly, the annoying bits like constantly de-synchronizing because you didn't do something exactly right is mostly gone. There is very little repetition with this one. Most missions, though not all, will have a fail-safe so to speak in that you can attempt to do it the 'right' way but then when things go haywire, you can fight through it and proceed with plan B.
I almost forgot to mention the leveling system whereby you can upgrade your characters. This makes things so much smoother as you start fighting harder enemies. It is fairly balanced and nicely laid out.
Lastly, the map is astounding and this is big coming from me because as much as I love European history, I have never found interest in 19th century Europe. This London map is incredibly alive and performs so smoothly on my computer which is far from the top of notches.

Cons:
For once, I have very little negative to say about an AC game. It isn't perfect, I have still gotten killed because my character wouldn't climb exactly as I wanted or wouldn't drop down to where I wanted. It can get frustrating at times and I occasionally wish they would just make it 1st person and give it Mirror's Edge controls but whatever.

Firstly, The controls are complete crap. Why they had to change them opposed to previous games is beyond me. There was nothing wrong with them. As a matter of fact, they are now worse. To incorporate stealth in this game (as with all previous AC games are meant to include) it's nearly impossible to with the poor control mechanics. I cant tell you how many instances I tried to avoid being detected and the game controls ended up making me randomly jumping rather than escaping detection in time.

Secondly, the spawning system. I cannot even count how many times this game has respawned me after a death directly in the sight of enemy npcs. I mean come on... At least give the player a fighting chance to recoup after they spawned and not have to initiate a fight right off the bat.

Thirdly, in addition to the spawning system, Why is it every time I kill a certain enemy during the side missions they ended up immediately respawning? This happens with at least 1 enemy npc during every side mission I play. I will be playing stealth and crouched behind an object, whistle for an enemy to come near, perform an assassination, and then as soon as I assassinate them that same enemy respawns a couple meters back where they initially were patrolling causing me to be spotted.

I'm highly disappointed in this game. The open world is great, the missions would be fun if it weren't for these issues & the livelihood environment makes it more immersing. But these gameplay flaws cause this game to be complete trash. 

I highly doubt there is going to be any updates to fix this for as long as the game has already been out.

It's fast, it's fun, and it's a breath of fresh air from the normal AC formula that honestly got stale back in AC 3. The art has gotten a little more cartoony and the script a bit more comedic, so personal preference if you're in to that or not, but I'm having a blast. Would def recommend for both returning and new AC players. Just, you know, you won't have any idea what's going on with the ""modern day"" stuff unless you've stuck with the series.

It had enough Assassin's Creed to keep me going but at the same time it was the most disjointed and odd package I've ever played out of any of the series.

There are so many bugs that pull you out of the experience just as it starts getting going and you can't look past it, and yet there's still that compulsive need to keep going, if not to see where the story is going but to unlock some more things so that you can unlock more things. 

I must be a masochist because I spent at least three hours combing the WW1 map looking for all the crates and helix glitches. Speaking of glitches, the 'Social Glitch Service' or whatever they call it has never worked for me, it always says it's down.. it is my understanind that you can get (very) minimal amounts of Helix Credits(TM) from this, but who knows.

This is the first Assassin's Creed game that I really felt they were taking the piss with real money transactions to 'speed up' single player gameplay by selling xp boosters, weapon and gear pack unlocks etc. It is quite disgusting. Unity had some of these as well, but they weren't really pushed so hard and there weren't whole maps (to show where the collectibles are) locked behind real money transactions like this. 

The story in this game was so disjointed - at times I wished they just had a set narrative mission structure they forced you through, Jacob's missions, then Evie's missions in each memory sequence one after the other but the whole game feels like they just cut it up and threw bits here and there - possibly to distract which bits were cut out for sale as dlc etc. It was so bizarre (probably because I had the season pass and all the DLC and stuff was unlocking based on player level rather than story progression etc. and it was just all a big ol' mess. 

Hands down the most disjointed narrative I've ever played (which I don't think was the intention).. explains the need for the fresh start that came after with Origins and Odyssey since this one because damn, a veritable pile of random crap scooped up together and then thrown about the room  only to be scooped up together again and each piece handed out to multiple people at different times with the expectation that somehow everyone will know which piece of crap was shat out first.

Good times. I still had fun playing it - it hits me in my OCD needs to feel like I'm achieving something even though ultimately it's all just a waste of time. Thank you gaming! But yeah - be prepared for what you're getting into.

Oooh.. P.S - the best piece of DLC that I enjoyed the most was the Dreadful Crimes, the only piece of DLC that is positively rated on Steam and the only piece of DLC that isn't a part of the Season Pass/Gold editions etc.",1584531020,1584531020,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

A couple of years before AC Origins hit the shelves and buried the classical AC formula forever, Syndicate showed that Unity's failure was nothing inherent to the decade-old formula: it was a journey that took us to unexpected depths of fun, challenge, depth and allure like those that made the franchise great in its heyday.

You play as Jacob and Evie Fry, a couple of twins who are members of the Assasin's Brotherhood. Tasked with the by now all-too familiar mission of bringing down a templar conspiracy in the midst of society, they set forth on an against all odds mission to prevail upon tyranny and oppression.  This time instead of Renaissance Italy or colonial North America, you take the fight to mid 19th Century London.

What is remarkable about this game is that no matter how repetitive this storyline may seem to veteran AC players, it delivers, and delivers soundly: enemies are memorable, gameplay is bombastic, the game is a thrill to play from start to finish and no menial task feels ever like a chore. It helps immensely to have the likes of Charles Dickens, Alexander Graham Bell, Charles Darwin and even Karl Marx provide you with some of the side quests... whereas you encounter Disraeli and HRH Queen Victoria herself during the course of the main story.

As befits an Asasssin's Creed game, it will have you ruthlessly assassinate foes (stealth has been perfectly implemented in this iteration), battle it out for control of London various suburbs, steal carriages, hijack trains, etc. Asassinations are probably the best the series have to offer, offering a blend of AC Unity's ""opportunities"" system with the traditional stealth formula of AC games (in other words, what Unity so painstakingly tried but failed dismally to implement). Then, there are the gang wars, which pits what begins as ragtag band of ne'er-do-wells against an entrenched, corrupt criminal organisation that runs the London underworld. Finally, hijack missions provide a nice distraction from the constant fighting, offering a nice blend of parkour and hit-and-run that is so properly implemented in the game.

Should you feel that there is so much one can do in 19th-Century London, you need not fear, for there is a nice caveat to it all: about halfway into the game you will be able to access a rift of sorts that will let you switch between the aforementioned reality... and a London during the darkest days of WWI. Then, there are the DLC to spice things up all the more: the first one has you aid an exiled indian prince in his quest for redemption. The other one is more like an autonomous expansion, if you will, and has you track down the infamous Jack the Ripper as he wreaks havoc in late 19th-Century London. While the setting is roughly the same as in the base game, the tone has radically changed and its markedly depressing. It sometimes feels more as an horror game rather than an AC game and it ended up getting on my nerves. I enjoyed it thoroughly, but I found it somewhat unsettling and disturbing, so no qualms getting it over with.

Next, the graphics department is to be commended: for a game that came out in 2015, it is quite the looker. Optimisation is also worthy of praise, as I ran the game on an AMD Phenom IIx6 1100t Black Edition and a GTX 660 on medium, never getting less than 40 FPS. Sound is also remarkably good, the voice acting deserving a special mention on this regard, as the Fry twins come to life before our eyes with seamless ease; same goes for the main villain, Starrick, whose evil baritone voice will stick with you long after you finish the game.

My only qualms with this game is that it ended. While I enjoyed Origins, this was Assassin's Creed done right. I do hope someday they will take up this path yet again and give the classic formula a chance.

The game itself stands out from the previous Assassin's Creed games because it introduces close combat and eliminates any swords.

A lot of people complained that Syndicate does not feel like previous Assassin's Creed because they introduced the Grappling Hook which made climbing so much more easier and rooftops are so much efficiently climbed. I honestly didn't think I will like it, but taking into consideration the setting and the period the game happened I honestly loved it.

The attention to details in buildings is just amazing. I got to visit London once more in a video game and that was amazing. I honestly thought I will be having the entire map, but it only contained the centralized areas and it was rich and amazing in history. I loved it.

Now the story was different from previous ones, the focus was not as much as before from both characters on the Items of Eden, only Evie that focused on them, but it had some really fun and interesting missions with Jacob. Not many like him because he was so careless, but that's what really made me love him a lot. He was silly and full of himself but was damn good at it.

The DLC, Jack The Ripper was just as amazing and I wish I was able to play with Jacob more on it or at least have a separate DLC where you play as him. Was a nice story and left me a bit confused and I honestly recommend playing that one too, to close the game.

Overall I'd score this game at: 8/10

The gameplay would be fun if you weren't at odds with the controls. Want to scale down a building slowly? NOT AN OPTION. I honestly want to slap those idiots who said the old system of parkour felt too 'easy' or 'basic' It was functional. When you don't aim your jumps and you leave every climbing decision to the computer instead of the player; You get an imprecise mess of a movement system. 

Parkour up and forward seem to be the same thing 90% of the time and then 10% they will be completely different from eachother. Parkour down is just dogshit. IT IS DOGSHIT. It doesn't work.  you want to scale down to a window and take someone out but you'll just jump off the building completely or freeze in place like a brick with limbs. Not to mention sometimes the autoclimb crap is so bad it will ignore both your inputs AND the camera angle and keep moving you along a wall in the complete wrong direction. For a game with all this vertical space to use, you will have a better time forgetting about it altogether. The old assassins creed engine wanted you to be precise where you pointed your camera before moving or jumping and occasionally there would be an object in the way you jumped to instead by accident. This game says 'Don't worry about aiming where you are going, we will just decide a random spot for you and stick you there like a magnet.' I have never had to think so hard about moving in a direction before jumping in my 22 years of gaming. It is a chore. It may look kinda cool when it works but I play the game terrified of WHEN (not if) my character will soon leap off in some nonesense direction getting detected immediately.

 The combat also suffers the issue of spamming towards an enemy for 20 hours with the same 1-2 punch until they fall over, the animations for fighting are missing frames or are just too fast. THEY LOOK RIDICULOUS. It looks like those mid air punch flurries from dragon ball Z. The stun feature is a must and they only have 1 animation for it. So every fight ends up with you pulling on both ears of every single enemy npc in the game. The old games had better controls and the fights looked cool. You didn't have to worry about the number above goon's head meaning they could knock you ever despite being the same as every goon you had killed at level 1. Level gating the areas of the map is limiting the freedom expected in an open world game. Just have enemy TYPES and have the combat difficulty consistent to those TYPES of enemy. WHAT the actual hell is so hard about that ubisoft!?

The stealth is also broken. I never had a clue how far away I could be seen by guards. Sometimes 20 meters, sometimes I cannot be seen 1 ft away from an enemy. BECAUSE EVERY ASPECT OF THIS MONSTROSITY IS BROKEN.

Frankly I was quite disappointed, when I played AC3 back then, after playing Revelations, so I skipped Ubisoft and AC games altogether for a looong time until there was a special sale, so here we are. First off I played Origins (was curious about the story), but finishing the game I came to the conclusion: it sucked. So I thought how worse can it get and jumped to Syndicate and, lo and behold, I was impressed. All the Elements I got used to and missed so much over the years were all again united in this game, so to shorten it:

+ Story (amazing, if you haven't played it yet, you're going to love it, at the latest, when you come to Seq 3-4)

+ Music (not the masterpieces of 2 and Brotherhood, but still beats the hell out of everything else)

+ Skill-Features (simple, yet efficient)

+ Gear (Finally something crafty to tinker with)

+ Upgrades (Boy, weapons, tools and Gang Upgrades really pushed the bar)

But of course you have to lower your sights, when it comes to

- Controls

- Game stability

[h1]Introduction[/h1]
The story is set in Victorian era in London (1868, to be specific) during the great industrial revolution. This time, you play as two twin assassins, the calculating and stealthy Evie, and the hot-blooded and straight-to-battle Jacob Frye. The mission is simple, stop the ruling hand of Templars in London and defeat the crew pulling the strings.

[h1]Personal view[/h1]
The story itself was pretty mediocre, not great, but not necessarily bad, it was the typical - climb the villain ladder and kill off the atagonist. There was really no character development, although the characters themselves were interesting, nothing too generic and common. The origin of characters are also missing, I do not know anything about Evie or Jacob, only that their father was an assassin and he liked to give wise quotes.

Apart from story, what really caught my attention is, of course, the enviroment and ""atmosphere"". In-game London was immersive and I really felt like I was roaming the 19th century. It is my first expirience to actually see children in a video game (especially PG-18™ rated one), which adds to the immersion, because sadly, child labor was very common in this era - working in factories under unacceptable conditions for long hours. But except for this depressing fact, the population is very lively and active, they react to what you do. The map is very huge (I believe about 30% bigger than Unity’s Paris), so thankfully, they added horses and carriages to drive you around faster.

As for equipments. you have various revolvers to choose from as firearms, and as for melee - Kukri, Cane-Sword and Knuckles. Other than that you have throwing knifes, voltaic bombs, smoke bombs and med-kits. You are also equiped with a grappling hook (made by the great A. G. Bell), which has made traveling from roof-to-roof much easier! 

As Evie and Jacob arrive to London, Jacob gets the great idea of creating a gang called ""The Rooks"". There are enemy gangs all around the London, the more boroughs you conquer, the safer the streets to travel. Your gang members always greet you, and offer you help, by getting recruited. You can recruit up to 5 gang members.

In conclusion, if you are looking for an Assassins Creed game set in 19th century, which has an amazing map and enviroment to interact with, and don’t mind a more or less cliché story - it is a game just for you.

[h1]Pros & Cons[/h1]
+ Characters, not developed, but interesting (Evie, Jacob, Starrick, love ’em).
+ Enviroment, the city is beautiful!
+ Graphics
+ Optimization - Medium settings; 30-50 fps (avg. 48, 1% of time bellow 30); on a Intel Core i5 
   4460; NVIDIA GeForce GTX 960 (2GB VRAM); 8GB RAM. 
   So if you have a newer budget rig, you should not worry.
+ Awesome combat combos.
+ Traveling methods (horses and the grappling hook).

- Story, it was not bad, but there was alot of unused potentional for such rich historic era.
- Climbing, not entirely, but there were moments when the game decided doing the opposite of what I was doing, and it was frustrating.

[h1]Additional info[/h1]
Finishing the story, with minimal side-questing = ~ 21 hours

[b]This is not really a spoiler, but it is a nice addition to the game. I will still mark it as spoiler just in case, because I sure was surprised to discover this feature.[/b] [spoiler]A World War I sequence - You play as Lydia Frye, the granddaughter of Jacob Frye. Shes an assassin operating in London. You have an area around the London Bridge available, and you are basically doing missions for Winston Churchill. You finish the missions by killing Sage, who is the leader of German spies.[/spoiler]

Just so you are not confused - With every 1,000 epx, you get a skill point, and to level up your character, you have to spend those points. The higher the level you are, the more skill points you have to spend.

Conquer 3 boroughs (basically neighborhoods) to unlock senquence 9.

Story is alright but it just feels like im playing minigames within a game when I have to conquer boroughs. Id actually recommend games like blackflag or rogue.

now I have beef with Ubisoft and they're not the only gaming company that does this so I am not just getting at them but they have given this game away for free on another online store, similar to steam and it really annoys me when devs give games for free when I actually bought this game full whack! those that dont understand it , clearly have money to burn or dont understand how frustrating it is when my hard earned money goes to waste just so others can get the game for FREE?! what the hell is wrong with people. 

other than that, im O.K with ubisoft. I dont even recommend unity although the graphics is far better than this and syndicate is suppose to be an upgrade but it isn't.  I only like this game because of the graphics, even tho the buildings can look like fortnite sprites, huge map tho! and I do like the two characters that you play, interesting personality but it certainly isnt the best game out of the franchise.  Go for Black Flag, Rogue and maybe the latest editions. Im reluctant to get origins.

So in short. do I think this game is for me? eh not really. For others , obviously since at the time of typing this, majority are recommending it. Its just one of those games that is completely over-rated. 

best thing about this game is that you can do a special mission and go through a portal to world war 1 london. I enjoyed that the most so far.  I may update this review because I havent fully completed the story. Im taking my time, at least this game takes a bit longer than the other assassin creed games, at least for me anyway. So its enough to get my attention, just enough but im finding it very difficult to trust companies like ubisoft and literally making us use uplay. I really hate that aspect so im starting to think if I should stop buying their games to send a message that we really dont want certain things. Its just a cash grab and I lose respect to companies that do it.",1582102395,1582102395,True,1,0,0.495822995901107788,0,True,False,False

The graphics are pretty, but soon as you stop to look at things everything falls apart, npcs have trouble navigating the streets, carriages always clog intersections, four different directions of those carriages waiting forever for each other to get out of the way.
The only good things here are the music and Evie's thighs. Not worth the price tag.
I played this game twice before to 100%, now I'm playing it for the third time, third time I'm trying to give it a fair chance and it's as disappointing as I remember.
Talked about this game with my friends recently after playing it some more to pad out time and it's time to add to the bitching.
Alexander Graham Bell was the inventor of the telephone, photophone (first machine that moved data using light, kinda like an optical cable), a man who helped build one of the first hydroplanes and spent his life improving sign language. This game depicts him like a child overdosed on sugar.
Sir Arthur Conan Doyle was a medical professional, the diagnosis itself - observing symptoms and using them to figure out the cause - was a concept he found interesting and used the concept to write detective stories about Sherlock Holmes. In this game you meet him as a child and he watches you solve crimes which are about slowly following big arrows to the end. So in this game Sherlock Holmes is all about good assassins saving the world.
Before the game was even out I saw someone complain about some company logo on the trains not actually existing until the 1960s, but honestly why care about one small texture everybody's going to miss anyway when people like Bell and Doyle are being butchered before your very eyes?",1539047243,1581914162,False,8,7,0.530469179153442383,0,True,False,False

The game is so rushed, Ubisoft didn't even have time to remove obvious bugs in the trailers. The skill preview clips have bugs and spazzing out npcs. But to be honest, it's not all surprising when Ubisoft have to race against the clock every year to release a new AC game.

This was for a long time the worst AC game, but then our lord and saviour Odyssey came along and dethroned it. The level system for the enemies makes this game a slog, the combat feels horrible and the two protagonist setup is not clever or good for this game at all. 

The parkour is wonderful, but HEY let's make a zipline tool so you can skip all that jazz. Whatever, Victorian era London looks like how it must have been to live there during the period: like a sewer. Does not lend itself well to the gameplay. The train is annoying as well, since it moves about, you can't ever use it as a reliable fast-travel point.

What even are those?) and I've loved the story from the beginning, but honestly speaking it took me a while to get to this one after playing Black Flag since [spoiler]I was honestly hoping for some sort of continuation to Desmond's story after III, and then I realized they were probably more than likely gonna leave him dead and focus on the other assassins and templars.[/spoiler] Nothing against it, since I feel like they did do Rogue pretty decently. But. Well. 

[b]Pros[/b]
- Decent setting and characters, [i]lovely[/i] soundtrack and unique atmospheres, but that's par for the course at this point. It's always interesting to see which historical figures they're going to drag into the game and how they're going to tie into the plot (though I feel they were a [i]highly[/i] underused). 

- Pretty much your standard AC game of running around an area collecting glitches and treasure while unraveling plots. 

[b]Cons[/b]
- A little wonky and buggy at some points. Crashed a few times, which is irritating because it takes almost forever to start up sometimes. Hit some branches while on the rope launcher and it either flings me into the air or sends me plummeting into the middle of enemies that shouldn't be alerted. Trying to make my controlled character move to peek into a corner kill was like trying to thread a needle using a pair of pliers. 

- The mechanics of the controls for the free running were... not as intuitive as they could've been, and the animations made the movements lag as all hell. 

- The Social Glitches are really, really annoying. Please, just let me get all the collectibles in my playthrough without the need for some [i]omg super cool social activity[/i], Ubisoft, it's driving me insane. I'm a completionist and I don't have friends. 

- The skill tree felt. Slightly out of place? It worked fine, no glitches here, but I'm slightly irritated by the fact that it felt like general skills an assassin character would h a v e was just used to bulk it up. Spending skill points to learn how to loot automatically after a kill? Hm. 

- I hesitate to truly call any AC game [i]boring[/i] because that's just patently untrue, but there was a certain charm to their earlier games that made it easier to care about what happens to the main characters that was just sort of missing in Syndicate. While the twins are witty and sassy, [spoiler]Jacob spends most of the main game bring a brat and Evie was just constantly exasperated and there was no real resolution other than oh well, we love each other because we're family and daddy dearest was wrong because trauma (: also haha love I guess.[/spoiler] Evie says [i]requiescat in pace[/i] to a [i]dress[/i], which you know, haha throwback but also sighs (though in hindsight it was probably long enough that any real meaning to those words when Ezio used them would have been lost to younger generations of recklessly youthful Assassins). Plot feels a little offbeat, and also very skin deep. Sometimes it goes from plot point A to plot point B while leaving me reeling because what on EARTH happened between them and thinking I missed some sort of mission that explained it. There's no real beefiness to it to make up for the general m e h of the handling. They went right back to the whole Assassins are Good, Templars are Bad, black and white bs after this was made clear it wasn't the case in III and Rogue. Was half expecting something to happen in the end because the twin weren't supposed to be in London at all. Henry didn't even know they were going against orders to be there. Nothing happened, wholly disappointed. Could've had a much more engaging plot if the third act conflict hadn't just been another rehash of [i]oh no we had the thing but now the enemy has the thing and now we need to get it back from them/get to where the plot needs us before the enemy does[/i]. 

- Definitely feels like they could've made Crawfard Starrick a more interesting antagonist, like they did with Haytham Kenway. We don't get to fight him until the very end, literally just assassinating Templars off a checklist. The entire game felt like going through a big checklist of murder and treasure hunting. 

- While combat was fine in the main game, the combat + fear thing for the DLC while also trying to juggle counter/breaking defense/the game's automated targeting was just [i]attrocious[/i]. 

- The carriages. Don't even get me started on how the [i]carriages[/i] handled. 

- Minor nitpick but the voice acting for civillians and minor characters [i]grated[/i] at my nerves, especially when they're put on repeat and they wouldn't just [i]shut up[/i]. Can't even abandon them sometimes for certain side quests like the slow carriage ones, and it's the same set of dialogue by the same voice actor. 

- Even if you get the game just. Don't even bother with the Jack the Ripper DLC. I'm begging you. Don't do that to yourself. 


[b]TL;DR[/b]
Completed the main game at 98% and the Jack the Ripper DLC at 99%. Negative review because there isn't much new going on here compared to older AC games without feeling like the collectibles were a bit of a slog, though I will honestly say buy it if you'd like to complete the collection. But if you're looking for an AC game to get, might as well get your money's worth with Origins.",1580820114,1580820306,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

So why the negative review? 

I hate that Ubisoft continues to push their launcher even though I bought the game through Steam. It's a whole extra added layer that is really not needed. And then, on top of that, there's all kinds of microtransactions being pushed your way to pay money for boosts and gear or what have you. 

I just want a single player Assassin's Creed experience. 

Now lets talk about Syndicate specifically. This was Ubisoft's version of Saint's Row in my opinion minus all the ridiculousness. And it worked great. 

No story spoilers, but this section has info about different things you get to do in the game. Skip this section if you don't want to know. Basically, you're fighting for territory in London and the main character Jacob is a gang boss. It's fantastic, and the game play for this is a ton of fun. Also, the side missions are actually meaningful in this game unlike Unity. Lastly, it was really cool having two playable characters one for traditional stealth game play and another to Rambo in like a savage. I've always wanted to play an Assassin's Creed game in this manor and it was executed perfectly here.

Combat in this game is fluid and rewarding. It just works. And thank freakin Jesus there is a counter to guns. In Unity you'd just get wrecked by guns, but here, you have a counter to dodge or shoot back. It's so nice to be able to do that. 

The RPG elements in this are only a small part, but it's really cool to have the skill trees and be able to customize your character. 

London, the city is fantastic. It's so alive and bustling. In Unity I loved the running through houses and all that. Unforunately, that is gone. However, you get a batman grappling hook which helps you get around and eases the burden of getting to objectives.

On that note, the Parkour here is not as good as Unity. The animations and moves just aren't. What did get better though is the controls. Much much better. More often than not I was able to make the character do the thing that I wanted them to do when I wanted them to do it. Climb, jump, slide whatever. But it still was not perfect. For example, climb through window and grappling hook are the same freakin key. So you run up to a window and try to hop through and you end up flying up onto the roof. I still don't get why we have to be limited on mouse and keyboard. I have 61 keys on my keyboard, just give me a separate entry in keybinds for every action. That way I can just map that thing out. And if people are too lazy then they can use a controller and be limited to having buttons do multiple things.

So, my final thoughts. This game was fantastic. Loved it thoroughly. Just wish the Ubisoft club would leave me alone.",1580788075,1580788075,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

AC Syndicate, based in London during the mid to late 1800's about two twins raised by a father who was an assassin that was unfortunately killed and not able to finish his mission take his place and to end what he had started. You play as Jacob and Evie Frye who aim to take down Crawford Starrick, the Templar Grand Master who aims to take over London in his complete control. 

The story is much better than it's previous titles but then again the AC franchise tend to have the same concept for every one of their games. The feature of being able to play as either twin (Jacob & Evie) is a very cool and different feature added but some missions force you to play one of the twins even though you want to change them. Graphics are gorgeous, you can form gangs by taking over boroughs around London which is also new. 

Overall, Syndicate was a great success!",1580225860,1580225860,True,2,0,0.506271719932556152,0,True,False,False

[i]Really good, although repetitive[/i]

I Really like this game. Most of it is acctually preety good. Okay, I confess that the last AC i played was Black Flag, back when it came out, and I had a blast, although I didn't finish it. This one, however, amde me go all the way to the end: I loved the activities, I liked the story and I really liked our main protagonists, Jacob and Evie. However, by the end of it, after I had already conquered everything, I just wanted the story to move along and be done with it already

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
Standard assassin's creed. In missions, you have set objectives and can approach them however you like, although you are pointed a certain direction through the bonus objectives. Parkour feels a little... Weird, at least initially. The whole ""Free run up"" and ""down"" took a thile to get used in my head, but given the landscape and the obstacles you're required to traverse, it get a lot easier when jacob doesn't jump a gap he was supposed to drop from like Ezio and Altair did. Combat feels allright, even though it's oh so easy.

[h1]Story[/h1]
Meh. Don't expect much. just let it take you along for the ride and you'll be fine. Also, they kept the ""Present part"" of the story to a minimum this time (HALLELUJAH)

[h1]Atmosphere[/h1]
Well, ubisoft did it again, surprising a total of zero people. Everything is recreated with the most details taken in consideration. Flawless. Only flaw is I couldn't buy ice cream from the poor lady selling it on a square. She was trying so hard, and everyone was ignoring her. Poor thing. Then, I went to a pub and people were dancing and having a great time! But I couldn't get a beer. It's a shame! These meaningless activities, like buying a newspaper, having some ice cream or being able to buy a ticket to acctually go in a passenger train could have enriched the experience a lot, but what is there is really cool

[h1]Final score[/h1]
7.5/10. Pretty good, had a fun time, but by the end of it I already really wanted to move on to something else.

THE DLC:

[h1]Last Maharajah:[/h1]
Didn't touch it. The ""king"" is a prick and I want him to die in a fire. [strike]Long live Britannia![/strike]

[h1]Jack the Ripper:[/h1]
I tried to get into it RIGHT after I finished the main story. At first, it felt AWESOME. You're Jack the effin Reaper, man! You're seeing scribbles on your screen like the voices in your head, and you're chasing none other than JACOB! ""Oh man, this is going to be SO COOL"", I thought to myself, right as I was introduced to the fear system. And then, in the middle of the chase, I decide to kill a civilian because, well, i'm jack the ripper going on a rampage, duh, and I get the message: ""Jack the ripper didn't compromise his plans by killing random civilians"". Uh... WHAT? 

Okay, I can power through this. Allright, cutscene with jacob, but i'll still go around instilling fear in London. Let's see the next memory and... It's Evie. In a boring invstigative mission. When I wanted to be bashing skulls. I put it down after that and don't intend on touching it anytime soon. Maybe when I reinstall this

Pros:
There is a LOT of content (~55 hours).
This is a very good looking game and full of texture.
Most of the offered activities are fun to do and succeed at.
Pretty good villains and general story.
The city exudes personality and although I have never been to London, assume that it captures the city relatively well.
The ""Secrets of London"" was really enjoyable for me and once I realized I could rotate the map to view buildings better it became even more enjoyable.

Cons:
Various performance issues.  Specifically when driving the carriage.
No map can be purchased to find all of the collectible glitches.  I am not a through and through 100%er for games but would have fetched all of them if it were easier to find them.  There are too many to go through a walkthrough and call it ""having fun"".
Traveling from point A to point B can be extremely tedious.
I expected more collaborative gameplay considering there are two main characters.  This only happens rarely.

Nitpicky criticism:
There was some injected conflict between the two main characters that occurred.  There was no build up to the conflict and the resolution of the conflict was meaningless.

Advice:
If a waypoint is over 200 meters away take a carriage.  Running or going across rooftops will add hours to gameplay if you don't heed my advice.
Do not let NVIDIA Experience set any graphical settings if you are using a TV as a monitor.  It seems to prioritize resolution over textures.

The problems with it are petty, but add to the general feel of a Ubisoft game.  I'm not sure whether to applaud them for trying new things and failing, or to tell them to stick to what they do well.  I lean towards the former, though.  I suppose if I have an option between ""more of the same"" and ""something new, but it might not work"" then new is better than not.  Still not as good as just not screwing up at all.

So, for the downsides - in this game they're actually relatively few.  Though I'm tough on Ubisoft games, understand, I think at their core, they're (usually) good games.  There's a reason I keep playing them.  Lemme list some of the issues that range from slightly irritating up to rage-inducing.

If you try and steal a cart with two on the bench, the second will ALWAYS throw you off.  Not tip you backwards - you'll roll off, no matter what.  And knowing this, you have no option (at least that I found, short of shooting one of them before kicking the other off) to prevent it.

Speaking of carts, the area on them is small.  With ""E"" being your contextual action button, you will vary between hijacking the cart, getting IN the cart, and jumping off the cart, no matter which of the three you actually intend.  Usually it'll just do whatever's the least helpful at any given time.

Some of the buggier quests that end in conversation will result in things like your character never actually exiting the conversation.  The pause menu, when in conversation, only has two options:  resume, or disable subtitles.  Or, presumably, enable them if they're already disabled.  None of those options help.  At that point you've got no choice but to shut it down.  This generally happens after it saves the fact that you DID complete the quest, so that's not a huge hardship.  Except it means I have to sit through 2 minutes of unskippable introductory horsecrap again when I start it up.

Also, a recurring issue, sometimes you'll just be detected by someone with no line of sight, faaar away, who realistically has no way of knowing you're there.  Again, that's recurring, and to be entirely fair, it seemed to happen a LOT less here.

The challenges for each level were actually usually pretty easy to spot, and they didn't disappear if you failed them, so if you noticed you just failed something but don't know what, you can check.  That was a great improvement, honestly.

Also, you can tailor your abilities through choosing your own equipment, with some shared between Jacob and Evie, and some specific to each.  That was fun to do, and I liked the different options you had with each.

Don't think, though, that it escaped my notice that crafting materials were distributed randomly and in tiny quantities, forcing you to farm them to craft useful accessories, or (the obvious intent) to buy them.  Look devs, if you're acknowleging that people would rather spend money to NOT play your game, maybe make a better game.

Scratch that, I think I just found the modern AAA game dev's business model.

Snark aside, the assassination missions were the best they've been in a long time.  They really gave you a lot of options to get it done and then let you do what you want.  They started that in Unity, but they've definitely honed it here.

And Dreadful Crimes was great.  The gameplay was fine, it was a nice change of pace, but the actual story of it.  I actually noticed the thread running through them and just idly thought, ""Oh, that's just world-building, they're just mentioning this in a lot of these stories because they're painting a picture of a real, living world.""  But NOPE it actually all comes together with a puzzle that's not TOO hard if you've been following, but it's just hard enough to feel rewarding if you get it right with no mistakes.  I could put this review on the Dreadful Crimes page, but really, I think it's practically a necessity if you're considering the game itself.  Well done, Ubisoft.  Sit, Ubi, sit.  Good dog.  *woof!*

I'd say that I wish that the friction between the characters was a little more believable - it seems like when you make your characters siblings, it's an excuse to have them behave towards each other however you want, then you can just wave vaguely at the implied backstory between the two and go, ""No, it totally makes sense, everyone.""  But for the most part it wasn't too grating.  I just didn't like Jacob too much.  Though he did have his moments.  He WAS charming.

All in all, it was a good one.  I mean, skip the collectibles, obviously, but other than that, a good game.  A good addition to the series.  Honestly, if it'd been Arno and Evie it might've been more fun.  Arno > Jacob.  Just sayin'.

Anyway, on to the modern . . . wait, what?  FREAKIN' EGYPT?  *sigh*  Well, alright then.  Back into the Animus we go.",1580024748,1580024748,True,0,0,0.469208210706710815,0,True,False,False

After Unity (which for me left a slightly sour taste in my mouth although its a good game) AC:Syndicate feels fresh and new, The rope hook, The new darts and grenades and the focus on historic figures, its really something else. ofcourse, it does not come without its flaws. It has a number of spawn bugs and NPC reaction bugs. but they can make the experience hilarious. If you love RPG elements but want the feel of an AC1/2/3 vibe. This and Unity are games for you. 

This game is really good, Worth a buy Full and Sale.",1579651586,1579651586,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

London in the middle of the Industrial revolution is quite impressive. You've got a mix of the slums and factories to the rich aristocratic areas around westminster and monuments recognizable to a lot of people like Big Ben and Buckingham palace. The Thames splits the city almost down the middle and is a hive of activity with steamboats chugging up and down the river. It really is one of the more impressive cities that has been recreated in an Assassins Creed game.

It being Victorian London you also have access to horse and carriages which you can use to get around. And with a new grappling hook item for quick climbing it is a lot faster and easier to get around the city in this game. You can also even hop onto one of the trains that move around London. Even your home base in this game is a train that moves around London.

Another first for the series is that you get to play with two main characters, twins Jacob and Evie Frye who set off for London to take down a high ranking Templar who is basically controlling the city. Jacob and Evie are quite likeable actually and probably equal Ezio as being the most likeable main characters for the AC series. Both characters generally play the exact same even though the game tells you Evie is better at stealth and Jacob at fighting. They both do have three unique skills each to unlock but as the rest of their skill tree is the same it doesn't make a huge difference.

One of the ways Evie and Jacob fight to control London is through creating and expanding their own gang. You can do side missions to expand your gangs territory some of which are fun but theirs not a huge variety of them. Your gang members can be upgraded and recruited to help you fight enemies which is useful.

The games story in general is ok. The main missions arent too bad but the best ones are the assassination missions you do at the culmination of each chapter. These follow on from the formula used in AC Unity where you are given a lot of freedom to go about the assassination but this game introduces unique kills which can be achieved by for example kidnapping an important NPC. 

The game does have a few negatives. It has the occasional bugs. I had the game freeze and crash a couple of times. A character was invisible in one cutscene which was one of the funnier bugs I saw. Also I bought the Gold edition of the game but found most of the DLC to be lacking. The exception was the Jack the Ripper DLC which is probably the only one worth getting. I was actually quite impressed with it as it introduces some new fear mechanics to terrorise enemies and that was quite fun. I would go as far to say if is probably the best DLC for an Assassins Creed game even though generally they have been quite poor.

Overall I feel this is a pretty good Assassins Creed game and I found that I quite enjoyed it. I've played every AC game up to Syndicate and I would say Black Flag is the only one I liked better than this one. It's not good enough to convert anyone who doesn't like Assassins Creed, games but it is worth a try if you have enjoyed any of them before.

The soundtracks and atmosphere in the game involuntarily send you to London in the XIX centuries. About the plot and additional tasks, I generally keep quiet. The gameplay, physics and animation are redone in some places and refined almost to the ideal. But the most important thing in the game is the hook cat (Aye. Spiderman) and the nature of the characters! Yes, it is the attitude of the characters to each other that make this game one of the best games in history. Why? Because every gesture, text, expression of faces and emotions make me get great satisfaction from the game. It's like watching a 66 hour Hollywood movie. About additional content, I can say that buy without looking back, they are worth the money. Additional content from this game I can safely compare with the additional content of The Witcher 3. Well, what can I write more? I strongly advise you to buy this game and play even if you have not played in the AC series of games before.

Доброго тебе дня дорогой читатель! Т.к я не давно прошёл эту игру почти на все 100%, то я подумал почему бы мне не написать обзор для этой великолепной игре. Сразу скажу что это самая лучшая игра из серии КУ до 2017-го года. Графика, Детализация окружения, модели персонажей и транспорта и конечно одежды просто великолепно сделаны. Особенно детали одежд и арсенала. Сундтреки и атмосфера в игре невольно отправляют вас в Лондон XIX веков. Про сюжет и доп.заданий я вообще молчу. Геймплей, Физика и анимация переделаны в некоторых местах и доработаны практически до идеала. Но самое главное в игре это крюк кошка (аля. человек паук) и характеры персонажей! Да именно отношение персонажей друг к другу делают эту игру одной из самых лучших игр в истории. Почему? Потому что каждые жесты, текст, выражение лиц и эмоций заставляют меня получать огромное удовлетворение от игры. Я как будто смотрю 66 часовое Голливудское кино. Про доп.контент могу сказать что покупайте без оглядки, они стоят своих денег. Доп.контент с этой игры я могу смело сравнить с доп.контентом Ведьмака 3. Ну что я могу написать ещё? Я вам очень советую купить эту игру и поиграть даже если вы до этого не играл в серии игр КУ.

It's sad because this game had so much potential and I really, really want to like it but they messed it up. I mean, if you really like the Victorian Era then sure, maybe you'll like the game. But if you're a big fan of the AC franchise and/or hate extremely grindy games, don't waste your money -- you'll get bored faster than you can ask for a refund on Steam. 

The setting is perfect, but that's about it. It's a pretty game with pretty graphics set on a very well made map based on the Victorian Era city of London. However, the story is boring and almost irrelevant to the AC franchise, and while the gameplay itself is rather decent, it becomes extremely tedious when you realize how slow you actually level up. Indeed, it's one of those games that forces you to buy XP boosters if you don't want to complete the 20 thousand repetitive side-missions and activities scattered all over the map. No, there aren't 20 thousand side-missions and activities, but it'll sure as hell feel like there are. So if you value your pockets and your time then don't waste any of them with this game.

To make it easier I have split the good and the bad and i'll make a conclusion at the end: 


The Good: 

- Decent graphics 

- Fairly good story-line with, finally a further story line in the 'modern' day. 

- Good character development (Especially considering in this game it has two protagonists)

- Very good 'villain' development, especially some of the 'Henchmen' Very good!

- Great depiction of Victorian London, all the little details and NPC dialog is a great touch

- A nice mix between historical figures with fictional one's (Quest givers ect) 

The bad:

- Some the 'Capes' and 'Outfits' do seem rushed and copies of previous games and of themselves. 

- The 'Rooks' - Now hear me out, it's great having them around when you're say... level 5 or 6 however once you have upgraded them to level 9 and have all the 'Gang upgrades' the game becomes VERY easy. Seriously. 

- I appreciate the wealth of missions the devs have to make and that it's an AC game however, a good 40% of the missions are simply *Steal this* or *Capture this*. Now, this is fun for a good few hours however, after hour 20 you get very fatigued by these. 

- The map. Although this is a 2015 game the map is tiny. Especially in comparison with games such as 'The Witcher 3'and 'Fallout 4'. The map is big enough for the game itself however, I've hit the invisible wall way too many times. 


Conclusion: 

This is a great game, especially for price I paid for it (I think it was around £10.00), I have spent a good 40 hours on the game and honestly i really enjoyed it. I still think i have another 10 hours out of it before it becomes boring so for £10.00 50 hours of game play is very good. 

The game is not the most polished game I have every played, some missions are very lazily made with a clear cut and paste from previous missions. The story overall is interesting and i enjoyed it, it is a refreshing change to be able to play as two people instead of one. 

This isn't AC Brotherhood good nor AC 2 ect however for a more modern AC its a solid 7/10. I wouldn't pay the £30 they have it at now however £20 is a fair price, if any cheap than its a steal. 

Hopefully this helps some of you dudes out :)

Performance - 6/10
          There are some pretty major problems with stuttering while in carriages, but otherwise it runs rather well on my computer.

Music - 10/10
          Utterly gorgeous. Enough said.

Visuals - 9.5/10
          Really nice, but the Thames is as disgusting as I'd imagine it was during the Industrial Revolution.

Gameplay - 8.5/10
          It's what you'd expect from AC, but with only one egregious tailing mission. The addition of a grappling hook was bloody incredible, though. Conquering London felt pretty cool, too.

Writing - 7/10
          Meh. If you've liked the others, this one is nice. If not, you'll survive by just skipping the cutscenes.

Jank Factor - 9/10
          Assassin's Creed is no stranger to glitches, and some may see this as a negative, but it's fucking hilarious to see NPCs straight up walking into walls, look confused and upset, and then do the same thing for like 30 minutes.

I still recommend this entry in the franchise, but a more complete playthrough has somewhat lessened my esteem of it in some places. My largest complaint at this point would be the repetitiveness of the gameplay. Though there is variety in the objectives and action of the main story missions, they generally follow a consistent structure across the game - Jacob investigates the target, then assassinates them, while Evie cleans up the mess left in the wake of Jacob's last kill. Access to the last two of the game's nine sequences is locked behind liberation goals - to access sequence 8, you have to liberate 3 districts, and to access sequence 9, you have to have liberated the entire city. This means that to complete the story, you have to play every single liberation activity; kill every Templar, kidnap every gang leader, free every child labourer. It's exhausting. Here, there is no variety beyond variation in level design and optional objectives. 

The assassinations are still a highlight, carrying over the 'black box' sandboxes from Unity. Hunting a mad doctor in Lambeth Asylum; infiltrating an armoured carriage in Waterloo Station; stopping a robbery at the Bank of England; sneaking into Parliament; outmatching theatrics at the Alhambra. They are awesome. A large area within which to hunt your target, explore your options, create opportunities for yourself. And while the repeating structure of it does make it somewhat lose its appeal, it is interesting to see from Evie's perspective the consequences of each of these kills. It's always interesting when Assassin's Creed explores these angles instead of overly romanticising the Assassins as they did in AC2. It's simultaneously good lore-building while also adding depth to the portrayal of the group in Syndicate; Jacob's relentless pursuit of the London Templars gives rise to snake-oil medicine merchants, destabilises the transport sector, collapses the economy, and drives a stake through the heart of Whitehall. 

The characters are a standout as well. Jacob and Evie Fyre, our twin protagonists, present a somewhat engaging duality to the story, with Jacob being a brutish young man who's desperate to make a name for himself both in the Brotherhood and in the wider city, while Evie wants to stop the Templars in a more long-term way, preferring stealth to combat. This duality is sadly not extended to the gameplay, where they are identical with identical animations and movesets, having only 1-2 unique abilities each that are of little impact. 

The music by Austin Wintory is also a standout, something I have changed my tune on. It's lively, energetic, and perfect in tone for the setting. And it is so unlike anything that has come in Assassin's Creed before. 'A Gauntlet Scherzo', 'Bloody Presto con Brio' and 'The Assassin Two-Step' are highlights for me. The only complaint I have music-wise is that for some unfathomable reason, Ubisoft decided to leave 5 'murder ballads' written by Wintory out of the game. 'Give me the Cure', 'The Late Pearl Attaway', 'The Tale of Twopenny', 'Feasting on a Lord', and 'Jokes Jokes Jokes' all have lyrics lamenting the deaths of Jacob's 5 main targets, and they are absolutely brilliant, but they aren't in the game. 

1868 London is an interesting open world. Like all AC open worlds, it lacks the ways you can interact with it to make it feel more 'real', however, it is visually arresting and enjoyable to explore. As I mentioned in the original version of this review, the variety in the level design across the map, from the tight valleys of Whitechapel to the slums and factories of Southwark and the churning waters of the Thames, is interesting. The addition of driving allowing you to speed across the city is welcome. 

----------

I would strongly recommend Jack the Ripper and The Dreadful Crimes. The former takes the tone in a fittingly darker direction than the light humour of Quebec's Syndicate. There is still an element of repetition, as it asks you to do revised versions of the Liberation activities from the main game, but the story is much more focused and divorced from world progress, and tells a very interesting tale of Evie hunting the eponymous killer and asking 'what differentiates an Assassin from a serial killer?'. The addition of non-lethal fear attacks reinforces that philosophy, and though it took me a while to grasp it, it did a lot to enhance the more stealthy gameplay aspects. As for the Dreadful Crimes, they play very similarly to the murder mysteries in Unity, with a few improvements. You'll be introduced to a murder scene, and asked to figure out who did the killing. There's clues to examine, suspects to interrogate, and i found it actually tested my logic capabilities. A lot of fun.",1573493609,1577646317,True,26,1,0.750640034675598145,0,True,False,False

Eu pessoalmente gostei bastante desse pois se passa na revolução industrial e gosto da história dessa época, e o fato de podermos jogar com dois personagens diferentes é bem legal também, eles são diferentes mas iguais ao mesmo tempo, já que eles tem habilidades únicas mas ao mesmo tempo nada impede de jogar as mesmas missões com o outro personagem (tirando momentos da história principal que precisam ser feitas com um deles respectivamente). Sem falar que adorei a dinâmica e depois tensão entre os irmãos, foi um respiro de algo novo na saga :D

You learn a little more about the universe and get to run around Victorian London.. and a little bit in WW1 London. The Ubi-verse starts expanding around this point chronologically as ""Watch_Dogs"" exists in the same world as Abstergo. So keep that in mind when playing both franchises. Far Cry games seem to only exists as things made my Abstergo, along with Tom Clancy games.

Have they given you freedom this time? Short answer no.  Tropes like the following are still holding the series back:
-- You can't do this until you become anon. . From cutting bells, to opening doors. or reaching way-points (You have a solution for this one called ""Escape enemies"" that works without making me feel silly)
-- Grapple cam not be used from moving vehicles. Don't expect any fun ""Just cause"" stuff here.  
-- 100% completion of missions still requires you complete side objectives in a specific way (Why not just reward us for being creative). 
-- Mission goals are not open enough in many cases and take creative choices out of your hands.
-- You can't choose the time of day when doing story missions, these seem to happen based on the missions design. So there is no use waiting for nightfall to do those. The Open World targets on the other hand can be done this way.
-- Weather is largely cosmetic, there is little or no difference in detection when approaching a target in the rain.

New Mechanics:
- New parkour transitions (A for up and B for down). However, quite frequently the B would be needed when crossing walls and gates and it would slow your momentum down substantially. . There are plenty of ways to improve parkour control in AC and this is not one of them.
- Evie and Jacob, you play as two characters, one stealthy and one more like a brute,
- grapple  / ip line, this almost feels like a super power and must save you from over 5 hours of climbing- If only it had more intuitive/ / consistent  targeting.
- Horse and Cart
- Trains (on rails you can't control)
- Steam Boats (on rails and sadly you can't control them)
- Gangs are back in a new way (not quite Brotherhood)
- Mini boses in each District. Not quite like crackdown, as they appear part way through your sacking of that district. If you run them down and defeat them at that point they die.
- Assassinations: Like Unity, but a bit more cinematic and forced. It feels like you are doing actions rather than making choices. Hopefully they learn to embrace systemic gaming in the future titles and rely more on mechanics and world design and give player multiple ways to assassinate (Hitman, still rules here)
- Outfits now give benefits, but are not able to be used as disguises like in ""AC Liberation"" -- Though some outfits detract from the charms of the characters.

Premium Content
- Some maps for collectibles are premium purchases now, so get those guides ready if you want to 

Economy
- Upgrade the train/gang and you earn more funds. I'm not sure if it is tied to the 
- Don't go collecting until you find the grapple
- Once you have finished the  Open World missions (mostly available at sequence 3), you will be able to max out your character and start earning enough money that it is not a problem for the rest of the game. 
- You will find yourself assassinating every thug in the street to get ammo, rather than buying it. 

Little Things that bothered me
-- Maps in WW1 England included floating pathways, whilst maps in the main game do not (This would have made going to the Thames a lot less daunting)
-- No Chest map available in WW1
-- That zip line to dive from London bridge to get that helix.
-- Helixes that seemed out of reach only to find out later that you needed the grapple to get them (Hence why you should wait to get that before you go collecting)
-- Non-sticky targeting during combat. You need to keep an eye on the white outlined enemy. Your character may counter punches in one direction and follow up with a combo but immediately after that they will switch back to a previously outlined target instead of remaining stuck on that new target. This felt unintuitive to me and often led my follow up combos to be landed on a blocking enemy who then punishes you. Most noticed in encounters of 4 or more. 
-- CPU hungry. I needed to lock my unlocked i5 processor so that the game would not over-use it. There was no impact to gameplay when doing this.  But unless you have some freezer to put your PC in, I recommend that you do this. Otherwise there will be the odd time your CPU will reach stupid temperatures.
