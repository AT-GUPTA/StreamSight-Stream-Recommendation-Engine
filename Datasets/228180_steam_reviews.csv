Gameplay Recording and Streaming Software may not be the first name that comes to mind when you think of game capture and streaming tools, but it has its own unique set of features that make it worth considering. Let's dive into what sets Action! apart from the competition and why it's more than just another option in the crowded field.

First, let's address the ""elephant in the room"" – the fact that there are free alternatives like OBS (Open Broadcaster Software) readily available. Yes, OBS is a fantastic software, but Action! brings its own strengths to the table. One of the standout features of Action! is its user-friendly interface. Unlike OBS, which can be somewhat overwhelming for beginners, Action! offers a clean and intuitive UI that's easy to navigate.

However, no software is without its quirks, and Action! had a compatibility issue with Windows 10 that I encountered. The software incorrectly claimed it was incompatible, causing some initial frustration. However, what sets Action! apart is their excellent customer support. When I reached out to them, they were not only responsive but also guided me through the problem and later resolved it with an update.

[h2]Rating: ★★★★★[/h2]

Using Action! is like being your own director in the blockbuster movie of your digital adventures. It's a screen capture tool that turns your gaming triumphs and hilarious fails into Oscar-worthy moments. Forget Spielberg; your gameplay is now the star of the show, and Action! is your trusty behind-the-scenes wizard.

[h3]Pros:[/h3]

1. [b]User-Friendly Interface:[/b] Action! boasts an interface so user-friendly, even your grandma could record her epic Minesweeper victories. It's like a director's chair designed for gamers of all skill levels.

2. [b]High-Quality Recording:[/b] The recording quality is like capturing your screen in 4K glory. Your gameplay shines brighter than a supernova, making those headshots and epic escapes look even more impressive.

3. [b]Real-Time Streaming:[/b] With real-time streaming capabilities, Action! turns your gaming sessions into live performances. It's like having your own virtual theater where your audience cheers for every triumph and chuckles at every mishap.

4. [b]Rich Editing Features:[/b] The editing features are like a digital Swiss Army knife. Cut, splice, add effects—Action! lets you turn your raw footage into a cinematic masterpiece without needing a degree in film production.

5. [b]Broad Format Support:[/b] Action! supports more formats than a Netflix binge-watching marathon. Whether you're into MP4, AVI, or the more exotic formats, this tool has you covered.

[h3]Cons:[/h3]

1. [b]Premium Features at a Cost:[/b] The full suite of features comes with a price tag. While the free version offers a taste, serious content creators may find themselves reaching for their wallets for the full experience.

2. [b]Resource Intensive:[/b] Action! can be a bit of a diva when it comes to system resources. Older rigs might struggle to keep up, leading to potential frame drops and lag.

3. [b]Learning Curve for Advanced Features:[/b] Unlocking the full potential of Action! requires a bit of tutorial time. Delving into the more advanced features is like entering the director's cut, and it might take some experimenting.

4. [b]Occasional Bugs:[/b] Like any production, Action! has its occasional blooper reel. Users might encounter bugs or glitches, though frequent updates aim to keep the show running smoothly.

5. [b]Limited Audio Editing:[/b] While the video editing is robust, the audio editing capabilities are more like a supporting actor than the leading star. Advanced audio editing enthusiasts might crave a bit more functionality.

[h3]Conclusion:[/h3]

Action! is the Spielberg of screen recording, turning your gaming moments into blockbuster hits. With its user-friendly interface and powerful features, it's a must-have tool for anyone looking to elevate their gaming content creation.

With an unquenchable thirst for anime, movies, series, and manga since the neon-infused '80s, gaming has always been the beating heart of my winterland. Let me drop a furry-style review, breaking the ice on a software that has become an inseparable part of my gaming den - the Action! gameplay recorder.

To kick things off with an old anime quote, ""Life is like a pencil that will surely run out, but will leave the beautiful writing of life."" And Action! has proven itself to be that perfect pencil for me, leaving the beautiful writing of my gaming life in crisp HD and 4K records. It’s not just the visual feast that the software offers, but its outstanding performance, sleek design, and seamless user interface that really pushes the boundaries of what we can expect from a real-time gameplay recording and streaming software.

After crunching 900 hours of recording and almost 200 snow-touched videos on YouTube, I've come to realize that Action! is, by far, the most reliable and comprehensive recording software I've ever had the privilege to use. As a pup of the '80s, I've seen my fair share of recording tools, but nothing has ever been this efficient and powerful. Action! is the stuff of legends, my fellow furries!

One of the most striking features that caught my interest was the encoding in MP4. It's like a snowflake lightly resting on your CPU, almost using none of its resources. Whether you're an adventurous lone wolf like me or a playful pack, Action! guarantees you can record any game you desire with utmost convenience. And it’s not just the ease of recording, the software enables you to upload your gameplay directly to your YouTube channel. Now that's what I call a two-birds-with-one-stone solution!

Let's also howl at the moon about its groundbreaking Time Shift system! It's like that magical portal in those animes that takes you back in time. This feature allows you to record only the action you wish to highlight without having to record the entire sequence, thereby saving a lot of storage space and effort. A button press and poof - you've saved the last few seconds of your heroics.

Having said that, not everything in life is perfect, not even a wolf's howl. Action! is not a freeware and there are occasional issues with the HUD supporting some games in windowed mode. But even with these minor quirks, it's still the best software to have in your pack.

The software's ease of use, light resource usage, and innovative features like live streaming, direct MP4 recording, and 4K support, make it a go-to option for any gamer. Also, the Action! team is as reliable as a trusty sled dog, always active and ready to fix any potential bug or issue, ensuring the software stays up-to-date with the latest gaming trends.

You know, as a furry Ice Wolf, I love to chill. And Action! does just that by providing a 'chill' experience to the users. It's packed with smart features, including the option to remove the background from a webcam recording, creating that clean 'green screen' effect. What a cool trick! Makes you feel like a celebrity wolf with a professional production team!

To wrap up my snowy review, let me borrow from a classic movie quote, ""The things you own end up owning you."" But with Action!, it's the other way around. It never feels like the software owns you, instead, you own the software, and it dances to your howls. It's a tool, a friend, a companion on your gaming journey, never in the way, but always at hand when you need it.

So, my fellow furry friends, if you are on the hunt for the alpha wolf of gameplay recording and streaming software, look no further! As an experienced Ice Wolf who has roamed the wild world of gaming for more than three decades, I give my hearty howl of approval for Action! It's a tool worth every frozen fish in your stash.

My advice is to say that instead of buying it, take time and then make a idea on what you want to do cause it is a lot of money. This app also is great for 4k 60 FPS But again that would be laggy for a low end PC.

1，录制的mp4，文件大小过大，半小时6个G，远大于WIN，对于普通玩家想记录游戏来说没必要，

3，WIN自带的还能识别游戏，使用方便无敌，清晰度足够，不占用性能，还免费。为什么不用呢？
再说一下优点吧
1，不局限于游戏，win自带的只能录游戏
2，清晰度很足，甚至还有4k什么的。

It is also pretty simple to use and you could get set up without knowing anything about recording softwares.

The issues I have with Action however are that some games don't show up at all for recording in game capture (such as Destiny 2) and you will need to use the screen capture instead. Another problem I only noticed recently is that the recordings will randomly freeze pretty frequently even though nothing has changed since when I started using the program. I don't know if there is a fix, but I could not find any fix for it online and I don't think my pc has any issues with it because my drivers etc are fully updated. 

Other than that, it's pretty convenient for most games and can get you pretty good recordings for a cheap price. Definitely worth picking up if you are just getting into YouTube or streaming and you need a good recording software.

With multiple reinstalls and reinstalling Steam (Which took a long time, with dozens of large games) it still does not work. I have seen some people suggest reinstalling Windows and tbh, I do not really wish to resort to such means to get one app to work.

The HUD is super helpful, a feature OBS does not have. I have lost countless hours in OBS when it would simply fail to capture a game without me knowing it and recording stuff, then at the end only to find out that the OBS failed to capture anything in game mode... also, sometimes OBS can lose game capture when you alt-tab to check if it's recording, then you go back to game and OBS stops recording it, really frustrating but can't expect much from a free product can we ^^

No such thing with Action! The software always shows you when it's ready within in-game HUD for capture or streaming, it has nice sound indicators helping to optimize system volume and microphone. The FPS indicator as well as livestreaming stats if you log in on the streaming platform from within the app.

One downside compared to OBS is the lack of scene transitions. I heard they may introduce scenes in the next big update (Action 5) but who knows... I do not use them so the app works great for me as is.

I had used this many years ago to create some Youtube Content. I have just under 700hrs on an old account, and I am hoping to add many more hours.

Lately, this software has proved to have the leading edge, when it comes to recording and uploading content in either 1080p, 1440p to 2160p at 60fps. If your a bit on the edge with wanting to purchase this product, I can assure you it is worth every penny. When it comes to the Full Price of $42.50 AUD - it is worth it - although you can get it on sale for quite cheap (Currently $10.73 AUD at the time of this Review).

Allows real-time recording and streaming, all in high definition. Action! It allows users to record smooth, high frame rate videos of any desktop and action, add audio commentary and even create easy-to-follow tutorials without any hassle. With an intuitive user interface and integration with popular streaming services, Action! is one of the easiest to use screen recorders available.

Action! It is compatible with Windows Vista, 7, 8, 8.1 and Windows 10 and 11, making it available to the vast majority of gamers and other performance users. Videos recorded with Action! are saved as AVI 2.0 or MP4 using H.264 or H.265 codecs. This means users get the best of both worlds: smaller file size and better quality. On a single screen, Action! can record video in any quality up to 4K. Three-dimensional gameplay, however, can be recorded in AVI format up to 8192x8192, surpassing most modern video recording qualities. When recording video in AVI format, Action! can capture up to 120 frames per second. In the highest quality MP4 format, Action! can record up to 60 frames per second.

Action! it's packed with features. It uses your GPU in the most optimized way to ensure smooth recording of high-definition games and can display your current and average frame rate while playing to save your benchmark results. Action! Perhaps player-centric, but it didn't leave other users behind. With high definition and smooth recording of any action performed on the screen, this powerful program can help any user to record high quality tutorials with ease. Even if you switch windows, Action! will continue to record to a solid clip. You can also add live mic audio commentary for complete ease of use.

Action! it is also very adept at live streaming and is integrated with popular streaming services like Twitch, Facebook Live, YouTube and Hitbox. If you're not live streaming but would like to share your clips, Action! has several preset profiles that allow you to simply push a button and instantly export your clips to the format that will work for your media platform of choice.
The “Games and Applications” recording mode is designed to capture video from any DirectX 9/10/11 or OpenGL game or application. The HUD will be displayed in the upper right corner of your game. The blue color of the frame rate numbers indicates the game is active and Action! is ready to record.

The default hotkey to start game recording is F9. Hit this once you're ready to record and play as you normally would. You can tell the game is being recorded because of the HUD changes. When you're ready to stop recording, press F9 again. Your recording will end and the HUD will return to its normal state. If you don't want the HUD to show up in your recordings, make sure you join Action! HUD Options and select “Do not record HUD in games and apps”. To play videos you've recorded, you can use Action's built-in player! to select game recording. For more playback options, consider downloading Splash, also made by Mirillis. With Splash, you get access to powerful features like SmartSeek, DetailBoost, LightBoost and AudioBoost.

Conclusion:

While it may not be without its shortcomings, Action! is one of the best screen capture software available for game recording/streaming or general screen capture. The user interface is intuitive and the recording tools are powerful. It offers smoother recordings than others on the market and is reasonably priced. I recommend its purchase, for those who are interested in recording their gameplays, I was very satisfied recording my gameplays. I recommend!

""Maybe It's time to buy a legit version."" for a quick open-up fraps replacement type. This software is recommended. It looks like what FRAPS should do if it doesn't stop developing. 

It could be better than OBS because when you're using OBS. You'll need to select the game, go to setting, change the bitrate, make a new scene, bla bla bla. I just don't want to spend time with that when I'm trying to just ""record"" not ""streaming""

But then the problems of this software hit the fan.

Here's the list that I've faced the problem with it
- Admin/ UAC issue 
I get it if the software requires UAC for recording the screen/games. But OBS can do that without UAC. Why do you need to ""Run as admin"" When you're trying to do the same as OBS?

- Incompatibility issue 
If the screen recording software can cause the game to crash or freeze while I try to record. That's the BIG issue. I have to run the software in the background before I run my game, over wise It might crash your game. (Minecraft rendering freeze, VRchat crashed, Gmod freeze, more on the list.)

- If you're using Parsec (Remote Access software that lets you play games or use your pc remotely.) You're going to have a bad time on this. 
As I said, if it can crash your game, That's mean it can crash your other software and parsec is one of them. Just imagine you're using your pc remotely and want to record something. So, you open Action, and Parsec just crashed. The fact is Parsec has the service for keeping its process alive when crashes or something happens. Action just makes it crash again and again. (crash loop)

Overall, the cracked version of mine works better (and it's the old version). I'm so disappointed.

[5/23/2017] ummmm...i only got one problem with action if you want seperated audio tracks (aka microphone and computer sound seperated) then look some where else action has horible split audio.In like 5 min. my voice and the game play are off by 5 sec. and it gets worse the longer you record. And this hasn't only been happing to me, a lot of ppl have the same problem. i tried making the game play faster so it fits with my mic. and well it works? but for a littel the video is okay but then when it hits the mid point it gose back to being a bit off. 

[7/14/2017] i've been with this software for a long time but it lacks polish in the avi section.
i expected more but now im wondering to change to a other software...
i use to recommend this but now im mix. if they fix the avi. section i would come back
now imma save money to buy a other recording software

[9/15/2017] probbly will compair action with a other screen recording. im trying to help the people who really wanna make there videos shine i still use action but still think it needs work done in the .avi if you just dont care about ""split audio"" then its fine to use .mp4

[1/10/2022] OBS is my to go now. I tested the performance impact on both. OBS looks better and uses less resources. Split audio still shit and OBS has split audio with .mp4 (need a editor to hear all tracks but is fantastic to edit). I only use action when I'm on a new pc and just need a quick dirty recording/ lazy to install OBS. Quick rundown since i think this is my last edit.
OBS
-less bit crunch
-no audio delay after long recording ses.
-deals with darker scene better
-split audio easier to set up

This app has some useful features and so I tried using it again. However, I keep discovering more and new ways it screws me over.

Time Shift allows me to always record the last 5 minutes of my game and lets me save whenever, GREAT; I love it!
BUT, there is no ""exclude FOLDER"" option or ""only INCLUDE folder"" option of which .exe´s are allowed to be recorded. So Action! starts recording ALL THE BLOODY thing I have open and NOT the game I was to record.

So I close Action! down while not in use. When later playing I game I am reminded that Action! is not running and I tab down just to run Action! in the background.
B U T OF COURSE ACTION! needs STEAM to run in the background, so it will launch this shit, THEN STEAM STARTS AUTO-UPDATING and hogging ALL MY RESOURCES.
ALL WHILE ACTION! START LAUNCHING with its bloody splash-screen THAT SO URGENTLY needs to steal my attention and minimizes my game.

ALL THIS causes my game to TAB DOWN because of the extremely retarded way Steam works OR EVEN MORE HOW disgusting Action! works.

Dra åt helvete,  this app grinds my gears...

___________________________
Cannot be launched without steam which means it ticks time just by having it in the background, it stops STEAM from auto-updating certain stuff and it forces me to have Steam open at all times....

46 hours played... well lord knows that aint me using it, its in the background just if I need it.
This also broke my refund ability, thank lord Thor almighty that I did not pay full price.

Audio can be seperated from Microphone and  Applikations , your Camera can be recorded for something like Facecam or whatever you do with it, and the best part, which I not used (bad PC) is streaming.

Does the job, most of the time... I mean, if you are not expecting some top-notch quality/experience.

I'd like to recommend it more frequently, but all I can say is that [u]you can only solve simple tasks[/u] using Action, like recording a video tutorial, work presentation, etc... Now talking about games, definitely not the best option.

There are some really serious UI experience problems, not to mention the 'hook' compatibility that doesn't work properly half of the time, randomly hooking small windows instead of the main applications. The quality is very questionable, speaking about YouTube (where I use it the most obviously) things become very sad. Even in the most higher options, you can still see A LOT of pixels in the final result (before throwing it into any video editing software), and if it's a fast pacing/moving scene makes things even worse. I mean, if you are supposed to upload it on YouTube, you have to find the best quality possible because you also have to worry about the auto-compression after the upload is complete so you don't lose that much quality overall. 

Now imagine a poor quality raw video, compressed by software after rendering and then auto-compressed by YouTube when the upload is done... I've been using it for different scenarios and as I said above, it's fine if you are planning to capture the screen and nothing else. Forget the word 'Loseless' when playing with color settings, because you can see the lack of colors in the preview.

Last but not least, get ready for some audio desync issues and here you can expect it VERY frequently.

I'm not sure if its worth its price tag so definitely get it on sale/promotions


(EDIT: after sometime using the software i noticed it lacks some features that other newer softwares may present better, but that doesnt take away from this softwares functionality - still works well: but a update for some newer features would be nice)

(EDIT: They are adding more and more features and the app is still very well optimised for streaming very happy with this, on one note though - ive noticed the action RCU the mobile app for panel control doesnt work for mobile hotspot but works perfectly with wifi as the local network)


(EDIT: DISCUSSION 

Action Vs OBS LIVE (STREAMING/RECORDING)

Action is much more ui friendly compared to obs live and is simple set up for the on the go streamer, as well as that has partial stream element widget/overlay compatibility.

OBS Live has many more options, and may require you to tweak many options manually that Action would do for you automatically, in order to get your stream up successfully - however OBS live has full compatibility with streamelements and streamlabs widgets/overlays. 

Most people would recommend OBS Live however both of these are good alternatives to each other with the addition of using streamelements & other streaming tools to help enhance the quality of your stream or video. 

As such i recommend, Action for normal gameplay recording and other use - whereas OBS live is more fit for live streaming.",1602222762,1621271919,True,3,0,0.534959375858306885,0,True,True,False

The very strong point, which I consider a lot, is the optimization of it. I was able to record several games, on Steam itself, and off, and the loss of Frames per Second was absurdly low (3-7) FPS, And the only time he took the 7 Frames, it was precisely because the game was in a quality excellent, in 1920x1080.

I saw a lot of negative reviews regarding live streaming, but I believe it goes from ""internet to internet"". I believe that weaker connections will not be able to support the broadcasts, but I think that if you bought Action, it is much more for video recording than for streaming, since there is a lot of free software for this purpose.

In conclusion, the program is high, the price to be paid is fair, but I believe it varies from region to region.

J'ai vu beaucoup de critiques négatives concernant la diffusion en direct, mais je pense que cela va de ""Internet à Internet"". Je pense que des connexions plus faibles ne pourront pas supporter les diffusions, mais je pense que si vous avez acheté Action, c'est beaucoup plus pour l'enregistrement vidéo que pour le streaming, car il existe beaucoup de logiciels libres à cet effet.

I've used everything from fraps, OBS, ShadowPlay, Bandicam, Dxtory and more.. And for some reason they never really recorded high quality video's without handing me a bunch of lag and not producing the best video possible.. (Not sure why, possibly it came down to my PC specs? but in all honesty my computer is near high-end, so it bugged me. 

Then i came accross Action!, and i never knew steam had recording software for sale, so i was intrigued about this.. I wen't on to read reviews and watched some video's about it, and nearly everyone was giving it positive vibes. Sooo.. i thought, let's give this one a try, and let's fork out some money and actually pay a little extra and hope for something good. So i sold some items and bought it. 

I will say, this is the best money i have spent on anything related to recording and creating videos.. Honestly i am blown away at the quality it produces & allows me to record in, and it doesn't play heavy on my PC, i don't lose frames and my video's turn out just like i would be playing the game. I can actually record in 1080/60fps! It's just amazing..

Livestreaming is also now possible on here, it let's you stream to YouTube, Twitch, HitBox, etc.. Supports video, audio, facecam & BM recording, the file size of your video's are very small, Start recording from your phone and so much more.

It's also very user friendly, you can just about change anything to how you like it. And it's extremely easy to set up! Takes no time at all, click away and your done. 

I really hope this also works for many others, as i know the pain it is finding a good recording software for your PC. Best of luck.

Simple to remember: High resolution video needs a lot of disk space
and low resolution video needs less disk space. So everyone can choose
that recording settings that will support the personal ambitions.
Plus: Supports audio recording, screenshots and broadcast.
A little minus point for sometimes breaking down, but after two or three dozens
of recording softwares I used over the years, this is just to annotate it, because 
none of the other ones had been 100 percent reliable, this one too has the same problem.
So, if one can live with a program that sometimes 'crashes' it is all in all okay.

This software can not only record, it can also stream and capture audio! You can even use it to record footage on consoles!

I heavily recommend buying this product, especially if you're a Youtuber that just started recording, because it has one of the best, if not, the BEST user interface to record. It's SUPER simple to use and you can even bind your own keys to perform certain actions such as time-shift, which has been a BLESSING for me! What's more, this software even offers you the ability to record your own webcam footage in a SEPARATE file WHILE recording your gaming footage. If you want to know how to do this, you can watch my tutorial, which is very easy to understand: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tM7CBP4DmLk

Also, it's important to note that this software works on almost all PCs, yes even the low end ones! ( I tested this on my old laptop a year ago and it totally worked) A bonus to getting this software is the fact that you only need to buy it once, whereas on other apps, you need to get a subscription.

[*]FREE  livestreaming. Yup. As of update 1.22.0 you can stream to YouTube, Twitch, HitBox, etc. for free so that's nice
[*]Hardly any lag on your system
[*]Allows for microphone audio to be recorded louder than the game. Even Fraps doesn't do that.
[*]Even gives you a weird way to record those little media players on the internet you see occasionally
[*]Almost every popular YouTuber I've seen uses it

[b] CONS [/b]
[list]
[*]Expensive. $50!!!!! Buy it on sale.
[*]Kinda confusing to learn. YouTube is your friend...ironically
[*]Its's on Steam; forcing you to have the Steam client on all the time
[*]Don't try recording Minecraft. Trust me. It freaks out.

Action! was often compared to Bandicam, except Action! was also on Steam, and being on Steam means there will be sales. At that exact moment, Action! was on sale, and a (good) decision has been made.

I cannot express how much I love Action!. It records stuff flawlessly without being suspected by the antivirus as a Trojan or something. It has a nice interface and plenty of options - you can't get lost if you know what you're doing. It can record from desktop, in-game, or both. There is YouTube and Twitch integration, of course. The framerate never drops during recording, and the videos are in MP4 as opposed to huge AVIs that Fraps does. All you have to worry about is the HUDs placement, as it can hide a small chunk of screen from you. Sometimes it says ""failed to upload video"" but uploads it anyway, sometimes it actually fails. There is a ton more unexplored possibilties Action! has, but I'm sure they won't disappoint when needed.",1587894989,1587894989,True,11,0,0.658005058765411377,2,True,False,False

The ever evolving video standards, hardware and software configuration, driver technology, and etc. I have followed Action! for a good number of years. What I can confidently say is that (1) they have the tech know-how to get things to work, (2) the tech team is responsive (write to them if you have an issue, not through the forum), (3) it does the job well. That is to say, they have a good track record.

Because I have spent so much time working with Action!, I do have some feedback and it may be relevant to you.

1. There is no game profile setup, still. Meaning, every time you record another game with your webcam on, you have to manually set up the volume and the positioning of the webcam window.

2. Chroma key set up can be too basic, especially if you don't have a green screen. It doesn't allow the editing of RBG delta, nor the definition of shape, edge, and slope. This means, you may need to record the webcam output on another video file and edit that into the video with a more advance software.

3. Video recording seems to freeze when toggle back and forth between Chrome browser and game while audio recording continues. It is not really a deal breaker. You just need to record your videos in segments before you toggle and merge them back through an editing software.

My PC set-up is Win 10 16GB of memory and a CPU that is i7-6700 @ 3.4GHz. My video card is AMD R9 200 Series 4GB GDDR5. I run my games in both SSD and HDD. I record with my webcam overlaying the game and desktop. Typical setting is 1920x1080 60fps.

If you are interested to see the results, they are in my YouTube channel.

I finish but when I put it in my editing software i seen it was 30 fps. That cant be right so i change it to 60 in the editing software and it still looks like 30 fps on the playback. so i go into action and all my settings were messed up still 1080p but at 25FPS and a couple of other things were changed to.

First, I'll go against the grind and do the cons first.

[h1] The Bad Stuff [/h1]

For one, there's a small, possibly non-fixable gripe I have with the software myself; it's honestly something that should be the LAST priority on the dev team's list. There's simply a limit on the 'area' recording, that makes recording specific parts of a video hard to do. But, that's a VERY easy fix with an editing software; remember, if you buy this, you bought a recording software, not an editing tool.

Another gripe of mine is that every once in a while, there's a very serious bug that tends to break specific parts of the software. This is not often, but I used to not be able to record in the first place with AVI, and it used to throttle my video recording, or speed it up far too much. This has happened 3-5 times. I won't lie, one time, my entire software was broken, and it's my duty to tell you I had to download the beta in order to fix it.

Another potential problem with the software, is it's massive AVI video sizes. As stated by someone else, about 5 minutes of footage on an AVI video is about 1 gig, give or take. However, that might just be normal, as I don't understand enough in that field to know, and on that record, it can be fixed by switching to MP4 instead.

[h1] The Gray Area [/h1]

A rather gray area is that the developers don't update quite as much as they used to. But that COULD mean there's less bugs, but I don't entirely know. It could also mean they depend on the community to fix it; it's a gray area since I haven't done proper research and have only really noticed this through my downloads.

As you can tell, I haven't mentioned anything about streaming; I myself am not a streamer, and cannot speak on it.

Now we get into the fun part; the good stuff! The stuff that really sells the software!

[h1] The Good Stuff [/h1]

For one, it's far more reliable than it has been in years, at least for me. Over the time, as said before, it has been pretty hectic. But it seems pretty stable nowadays. Though, to tie in with the gray area, I have not done my research on whether others have lots of problems with it.

For one, the software has a 'preview mode', so you can see how the screen and your webcam look before you record, so you don't look like a doofus like me when you start recording.

Now, this may seem like an essential, and I'm sure it is, but for a long time, they didn't even have this feature. but you can now adjust the size of your webcam picture, in the previously stated menu. This can make it worse quality, I'm sure, but in the end, at least people will be able to see your features.

Recording files are generally nice to look at, at least in my case. They're never too small, or difficult to view, as long as the graphics on your screen and game are okay; it records directly from your screen, so usually whatever you see, they see. It can also be set to 1080p, 720p, 480p, 360p, and 240p.

The FPS can be set to these lengths, individually going down.

15 fps
20 fps
24 fps
25 fps
30 fps
50 fps
60 fps
120 fps
144 fps.

I've never used this, but it can record 'additional audio' (pretty sure that's the mic) into a different audio file as well, in case you need to do that.

[h1] Additional Facts and Thoughts [/h1]

Now, that's definitely not all the bad, and all the good, but that's some of both. In all my usage of the software, I've come to enjoy myself, most of the time, but it CAN be VERY frustrating. Keep that in mind.

The actual UI in game is as simple as F9 to start and stop recording, with other options for screenshots and such. I don't feel like it really compresses the recording file well on the front end, and transferring videos from here to YT or wherever does take a bit longer than would be optimal, but it does do a decent job of compressing the files during transfer.

There are quite a few options for how you prefer to record, at different resolutions and formats, and provides a lot of support for people who prefer to dive in more deeply, offering plenty of options to really dial in and fine tune your recordings.

I don't live stream, so I can't speak to that, but it is an option as well.

All in all, I tend to feel like most capture programs are a bit overrated and overpriced, but I had no issues paying what was then half price for this one. I'd definitely recommend this program while it's on sale, although I do think the base asking price is steep. For me, it's the primary capture program I use though, and as you can see from my hours put into it, it definitely has provided excellent value.

I can record 1080P video by simply hitting F9 ... or record a separate audio track with F10 .... maybe a quick screenshot just hit F12 .... or do all three (depending on your hardware capabilities).  It isn't able to record/export in H.264 (MPEG-4 AVC) ... but 1080P is good enough for me.  I have recommended this to several friends, and all have reported back happy with the software's performance and ease of use.  There is a streaming feature built in, but I haven't tried it... if I do I will update this review.  I would recommend this to anyone who is looking to be able to record high quality videos and audio via a very user friendly interface. 

11.25.2018 - the biggest issue with this now is that updates usually break your setup and you have to go through all of the settings again and again.

Till i started to get raged because there is so much stuff you cant do with it. So i decided to install this Software which was in my library for about one year without usage. I was fascinated by all the settings you can choose on your own. Different Audio-tracks (one for Teamspeak to cut them out for example). Bit settings etc. Save and easy Stream tool too. After i discovered this program i regret that i dont used it earlier :D

Boys and Girls.. If you want to:
> Stream
> Record gameplay in background and just save the best scenes all the time
> Record desktop (for tutorials etc)
> Record browser videos (which blocked for other programms like youtube)
> Record internet radio or any other audio
> Record webcam or micro
> Record just a part of the screen(s) or just one window
> Screenshots from desktop or ingame (much more easier then with other ones)

Some features dont sound like a big benefit, but there still a lot of locks at youtube or other pages which dont allow you (and yea spec programms cant help you without realtime record) to download or record stuff. There is also a big benefit if you make a lot of high quality videos with programms like Adobe Primiere Pro.. sometimes you have problems to import stuff.. easy now.. just a litle high quality record with Action. Before i decided to test this programm i freaked out everytime i got problems by saving or import stuff for cut.


+ dont take many ressources
+ best quality i ever seen
+ individual settings
+ seperate audio tracks
+ ALL features (u can imagine)

However, once you switch it to record active screen, it works amazingly! I was wrong about this program. It's a minor misunderstanding, so try to get this program for yourselves. With the ability to record video and audio separately or together, live streaming, taking screenshots, or recording your webcam, there's no limit to what you can do. Here's my personal preference, but you may like these, too:

-720p or 1080p
-60fps
-record active screen
-mic on ""always record"" (if you want)
-use the ""avi"" file format

However for anyone with an Nvidia GPU Shadowplay is simply better in everyway.

Great to have a screen recorder that hardly limits your pc preformance! if theres one thing everybody seems to love now its 60fps which any pc that would normally get 60fps should still be get the same buttery smooth game preformance while recording!

Action is a good game capture AND screen recording program. I can't emphasize on the screen recording, as some of the game capture programs cannot capture other windows or desktop (Fraps for instance). You can save the file either in MP4 where the file size is small as it compresses it, but you might have game performance suffer a bit from it. If you don't want any game performance issues, you can also record on AVI which saves the uncompressed version (which means large file size but helps a lot when video editing).

The quality fo the video can be determined well. From 15 to 120 FPS, from 360p to 1080p... You have a lot of options to choose from. The sound quality is good, too, though I do remind people that ify ou pick up multiple track recording, you can't hear multiple audio channels normally in media players. You have to video edit it in Adobe Premiere Pro to see all tracks. This is one of my suggestions to the developers: Make it an option that the audio tracks are saved as their own files.

I haven't tried the streaming function as I find it obsolete since I have OBS. I don't think they can get to OBS's levels of stream functions unless they really want to try to focus on it.

Overall, from many game capture programs I've tried (Dxtory, D3DGear, Bandicam, Radeon ReLive, OBS, Fraps) Action is my go-to program, for its quality, and if recording uncompressed, has little to no impact on the game's performance.


+ Little to no impact on gameplay if uncompressed
+ Little file size if recording compressed
+ Streaming function
+ Multiple audio track
+ Can capture desktop or any window.

- No option to save audio separately
- Compressed recording might have impact on game performance

Over the years I've tried almost all the game recording software out there and have been using the trial version of Action! on and off for a long while until I saw it on sale with 30% off here on Steam.
For me, it does exactly what it says on the tin and I particularly like the compression with the AMD/Nvidia APP's.
Other Steam reviewers have slammed the software for a raft of different reasons and all I can say is that I haven't suffered any of the problems mentioned in other reviews and would recommend Action! to anyone wanting the very best in game recording software.
It really is that good!

Update to my original review:
Quite simply the best recording software you can buy and worth every penny.
The interface is slick and intuitive with a myriad of options, which are kept simple and easy to understand and it´s constantly being kept up to date. Version 2 is even better.
Mirillis are quick to release patches and they respond to all technical issues in a timely manner, although there are still some compatibility issues with one or two games which are being addressed.
Highly recommended if you´re serious about game recording.",1455199804,1479988406,True,0,0,0,1,True,False,False

The layout is simple and easy to use, while still having everything you would want in a screen recorder. It has 3 modes: ""Gaming mode"", which, as the title would suggest, is best for recording gaming videos. ""Active Screen"" or ""Windowed mode"" which records your entire desktop screen, unlike Gaming Mode which only records the game window. And then ""Active Desktop Region."" This mode is mainly used if you want to target and record a specific area on your screen.

This screen recorder also has built in audio recording and snapshotting abilities, which can come in handy.

This screen recorder isn't perfect, so let's get into some of its cons. 

1. Sometimes while trying to record a specific game, (Minecraft for instance) the big red ""record"" button is greyed out and you are unable to click on it. So you are forced to just use the hotkey ""F9"" to start and stop the recording. However, this can become tedious, at least for me. I for one have had a few experiences where I accidently pressed the wrong button and I didn't record. And although a lot of people don't think being forced to use the hotkey is a bad thing, I personally wish I could press the button instead for certain situations. I'm not sure if this is for all games or not, but this has happened for quite a few games before. 

2. Sometimes the start and stop recording hotkey is unresponsive. Often when you start a recording then stop it, then start it again, it won't start the second time and you are left talking to yourself in your house and you gained no recording. Its really a let down when you have been recording for an hour and then you look back and it hasn't been recording at all. This is another reason I wish I could just press the red button to start the recordings and that it wasn't all greyed out for some reason. 

3. If your game crashes while you are recording, that video file becomes corrupted and you cannot view it. This really blows and is one of the main reasons I stopped using bandicam and switched to Action, because bandicam did the same thing. However, it appears Action has the same problem. I really wish when the game crashed the recording would continue on, but be a black screen instead, or perhaps would just stop the recording. But instead if your game crashes you lose that recording, which is very dissapointing. 

4. The price. I know this isn't exactly a strong con, but I should mention that this recorder costs $49.99. Not a terrible price to pay for a screen recorder, but still pretty expensive. I'd recommend waiting until there's a sale and pick it up for maybe $40 or $35.  

And that's all I can really think of for cons at the moment. 

So:

Cons: 
1. Can't click the starting and stopping button on some games.
2. Start and stop recording hotkey is sometimes unresponsive. 
3. If your game crashes while you are recording, you lose that recording. 
4. Its a bit pricey. 

Pros: 
1. Stylish Interface that is easy to use while still providing all the necessary settings you would need for a screen recorder.
2. High quality videos.
3. Multiple recording options 
4. Audio and snapshotting abilities.
5. Stable.

Overall I would definitely recommend this software, especially if you are a youtuber like myself. Its easy to use and really doesn't dissapoint too much. It has its problems, but personally I feel the pros outweigh the cons. 
Its a very handy application that you should get even if you are not a youtuber. However, i'd advise picking it up during a sale. 

Thanks for reading! :)

The product Action! is decent for a software only based recorder. The quality of the videos are great the sound recorded sounds amazing. I have had the program since it came out roughly and the one thing i never actually recored was the Microphone or Cam sections. That was my own choice not because of any type of flaw that i had or anything like that.

It does take a few minutes to go through the various settings and what not. Once you fully configure it to your desired settings i would say it takes a few uses to become fully comfortable with it.

Uploading directly to Youtube is not a great option, yes it does work, however its shotty at times. I have never had any issues tho exporting into other formats, any other format works flawlessly. Just slight issues with exporting direct to Youtube, idk if thats due to cookies or anything of that nature.

I would recommend this to people who have good computers and/or laptops. Seriously if your not pushing a decent i7 or comperable AMD you won't enjoy this product or any game recording products for that matter.

The only issue is that there is a few games that won't record properly for example Titanfall had a few issues. If your having this always make sure to start Action! first before the game, if you start the game then Action! it sometimes glitches out and will record a black screen or just doesn't record.

I've had mine for over 3 years now and never had any problems. This may be do to the fact I used the steam version and not the actual Action Game Play sites version. I have record over hour long games plays with it and never once had the system crash on me or auto cut scenes while doing so. It manages to record my voice and in game sound amazingly and supports all my software I use on my PC. I just wish the price wasn't so high when I bought it. I have over 300 hours on record using this recording software and plan to use for a very long time. The people of Action know what there doing and for any problem you have I recommend just uninstalling the software and reinstalling it that worked for me when I first got it those bugs are gone for me now and I love it. So if I was to recommend this product I'd do with a 10/10 star rating.,1452616792,1452616792,True,0,0,0.453959226608276367,0,True,False,False

Not having used any other recording program I can only comment on this one as a novice I guess, but that is why I can give a positive review through the eyes of a newcomer to the process.

As far as I am concerned it is great, once you have decided on the right settings that suit you everything just falls into place and the results are very good. Not only that but you can take screenshots and desktop vids as well with this software which is handy if you wanted to make a recording of something you are working on at the time on your computer. The file can be uploaded or shared privately if you wish to a 3rd party via email YT or FB and I am sure others as well and of course attached to your Steam Profile page.

There are many explanitory files available on YT referring specifically to this program and you just need to try some to see which suits you and your system for the best results. I purchased my copy on Steam and you can purchase it online as well depending on your preference.

Only small cons are the fact you cannot edit and occasionally after uploading to YT, you need to re-boot to close the program. It will not lock up your system, so normal functionality doesn't seem to be effected just the Action program itself which is a minor inconvenience.

Do I recommend, yes I do and with the extra keys I have on the left hand end of my keyboard, operation is a breeze. Even using your standard function keys, operation is simple. I would rate this program 9.5/10.",1451536511,1451536648,True,5,0,0.576923072338104248,0,True,False,False

The issues began on a smaller scale such as the camera having difficulties connecting or the program won't open initially. Whenever the program would update I would see more and more issues occur.

Here are the issues I have had, and many others before me have had too:

1. Program crashes for no reason
2. Individual programs on software may crash or render unusable until restart
3. Settings will not save unless you close the program after changing them
4. Settings may change without your knowledge or input
5. 50/50 chance game sound will not record, (able to record me and my friend separately on skips just fine)
6. Unable to use the entire program after initial crash unless you restart the computer
7. If program crashes the video it was recording, the video will be rendered useless
8. Program/recording provides no notification if the program/video has crashed
9. The program doesn't always launch when you open the program, (nothing shows up in task manager)

Here is my major question;
What is making me want to continue using this program when there are other programs out there that are either cheaper or free?

1.) HIDDEN SUBSCRIPTION FEE, yes i said it, hidden subscription fee.
The subscription is basically something that removes ""this was recorded with (inset recording program here)!"" then expect you to pay $50 on top of it to expect you to be satisfied to have a recording device... Also, it requires Subscription for other things, like streaming and other small detailed items.
2.) requiring a seperate log in while having to be connected to steam to even use it...
To even has accessible to streaming or any other good features you have to be logged into the account connected to your key and signed into steam...
3.) The login for the 2nd time around is longer then usual...
4.) unusual lagging while non-recording.
It basically uses more resources to NOT record then it is recording... how stupid is that?
5.) I can get a Free recorder to do just as much if no better then the recorder here without a subscription fee and less time consumed on having to relog in on everything everytime...

I got a refund for this product once i found out all this stuff that i believed to be wrong with it, honestly...

For a 30 minutes Video at 60 FPS recording i only had a  6GB Video File  or less, it all depends of what the game you are recording.
With the New Time Shift system you can record only the last action you made without recording the whole sequence by pressing a simple button that saves the last recorded seconds.

Pros 
-------
-User Friendly Interface
-Easy to use
-Doesn't use much memory , so your gameplay isn't lagging 
-Cheap
-Easy Upload to your YouTube Channel
-Time Shift System is awesome for recording only your best moments/actions
-Streaming is free since a few patches, no more monthly subscribing
-Recording in MP4 so no more 100GB files any more
-720p or 1080p of 4k support
-30, 60 or even 120 FPS recording available

The app now works perfectly with opengl games, even opengl 5 games like The Old Blood

ingame HUD and all!

even more lag free than shadowplay... at least 30% faster. I've recorded hours not even noticing it was on.



This application is great!

Pros:
-absolutely lag free, buttery smooth in both recording and ingame. I seriously cannot tell if I am recording sometimes, I use a PNY Optima 120gb ssd that only has 150 mb/s write speed and even then the recorded file doesn't have any lag.
-twitch streaming is now free and subscription services are no longer a thing
-mp4 and avi format
-built in encoder
-webcam and benchmark support
-high quality recordings that upload to youtube wonderfully when using x264vfw at medium/high/8000 constant bitrate with zero-latency checked
-even less lag than shadowplay
-audio stream mixing with volume control
-detailed overlay that has a timer so you can see how long your video is
-overlay includes the currently running gpi, such as opengl or dx11, to check your tweaks
-Has NVENC, Intel Quicksync, AMD, and software support
-Very high video framerate support
-best overall for 1080p+ resolution recording

cons:
-overlay doesn't work when playing a statically-compiled opengl game such as GZDoom, Wolfenstein: The New Order, or Darkplaces engine. It does record though... I just use the light on my webcam.
-Videos may not work on Handbrake
-Overlay can be a bit small
-AVI is the best option for lag free files but can be a bit of a space hog
-MP4 has a bitrate option that can be finely adjusted but is less quality overall compared to AVI
-only one codec and no lossless support, files can however get up to 250 mbps or more on high avi setting
-occassionally your friends will not be able to join your game if you have action running, as it shows that as the game you are currently in. You will have to alt-tab and start after you launch your game, for example.

Conclusion:
Check out this video to see the quality I got when converting to x264vfw, 8000kbps to youtube:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGAXhMn12O8
You cannot beat this software in terms of raw speed. I have recieved absolutely no lag on my external ssd, and even on hdd speeds I cannot tell the difference. it's pricey and only has one codec, and there's no overlay for most opengl titles, but this recorder is absolutely amazing.",1428794230,1437533638,True,1,0,0.5,0,True,False,False

It does have some issues recording Star Citizen which I was really hoping I could record with this. But in all honesty Its probably just SC's Fault since its still in Alpha and a lot of the optimization hasn't been done yet. 

Pros 

+ Has minimal impact on my system.

+ Very EASY to use UI or user Interface.

+ Records audio and Video Seperate yet maintains the correct timing sequence. (For those that don't know what I am talking about. Have you ever seen some video that you see their lips move and like a split second later sound. Or maybe Vice Versa.) This Program does a very good job about keeping that from happening.

+ I bought it on sale I think but even then I would still highly recommend it. I just wanted to try a program other than fraps for recording my Youtube vids and this works really great for that. It can even prerecord in the correct format for youtube. (VERY EASY TO UPLOAD)

+ It has Built in utilities to upload and format directly to youtube for editing or straight publishing

Cons 

- Sometimes decides it doesnt want to upload to youtube. (However I did just recently move and DON't have as good of internet as I did) IDK if that has something to do with it or not but you can always just go onto the Youtube website and upload it manually.

- No editing Utility at all

- Did I say you couldnt edit because you can't and need other software to do so.

- For Streamers. It cost some sort of fee but I don't worry about that because I do not stream. ""shrugs""

^ So IDK about this one but I think I just read that they allow you to stream for free now. ""shrugs more"" lol

- hmmm idk it seems to do what I want it to do very well. 

Overall I would give this program a 8/10 which is very good imo. Really the only things that could improve this program is some basic editing software. Like even the ability to crop and cut the clips up and repaste them would be a huge improvement and I would then be forced to give a 9/10. 

I don't see myself able to give a 10/10 since I have only reserved that for things like the Oculus Rift and other really impressive technologies like that.

I edited this to say I read something about streaming.

Second Edit I decided to add a list of stuff I have recorded.

Star Citizen

BF4

It can record games at 1080p if you want (and can). I will mention that there is an original option in the quality options, which is for recording at a resolution that isn't 1080p, 720p, 480p, 360p or 240p. It will not record higher than 1080p though. If you are playing a game at 1080p, and you set it to record at 720p, it will only record at that resolution. This is a fantastic feature because, while it may look a bit blurry (and i mean a TINY bit), it will come out as a much smaller file. Which is good if you don't own a very big hard drive or want to upload something to Youtube in your lifetime. This recording option can be done in any of the listed resolutions. This feature is lacking in several big recording softwares, which force people to manually compress the files. 

The UI is fantastic, and way more straight forward than most recorders that I have used before. The recording options are easy to reach, and yet they seem to do a lot without being confusing. There are SO many features that I love about this software that I can't find in most recorders. There's a window option, where you can record a certain part of your screen, which is very handy for windowed games. There's a facecam option if you have a camera. And of course, it has the usual voice recording options.You can choose for it to limit your frame rate while you are recording, which is good if you don't want lag or just simply want to record at a certain FPS. Action also performs WAAAAYYY better than FRAPS. The recording quality is definitely grainy, but it's worth it for the better framerate, and while some people may want to go for the recorder that records a tiny bit better, Action won't dive on the frame rate.

When I used FRAPS to play a retro game, I got about 5 FPS, and the game even FROZE at times. Even when I wasn't recording, having it open slowed the game down.  With Action, the game ran like it did when I wasn't recording. It was incredible how fast it ran. One complaint I have, is the FPS options I mentioned earlier. You can chose to limit your frame rate at 60, 50, 30, 25, 24 (yes 24), 20, 15, and 120. Why are the options so random? Why is there a 25 and 24 option? There's no difference! And yet there's no 40 FPS option. I actually really like limiting my frame rate at 40. So why am I stuck with using 25, 24 and 15? Get rid of 24, as a single frame difference is NOTHING, and add 40.

EDIT: After a long time of use, I have noticed how much of a lottery it is when it comes to audio. Sometimes the recording has tinny, echoing sound, which really sticks out like a nose unless if you mask it with music in editing. Other times, however, it records perfectly fine.

IMPORTANT: To do live streams, you need a subscription. It comes with a free subscription when you buy it, but I can't remember how long it is. I have never streamed using Action, so don't ask me how it performs. I really want to emphasise that there are programs like OBS (Open Broadcaster Software) that can not only record games, but also stream them FOR FREE. Not to mention you can also add on screen pictures and messages in real time on OBS. So if you want to do live streams, seriously consider something else.

Action! - Gameplay Recording and Streaming Software is a fantastic peice of software and does a great job at what it does.

Options: 
First off, the option to go with two different versions of the sofware depending on what you're using it for (available on the website) is a nice touch for those who know what they need and don't want any extra expenses. Of course the only difference is the licence, so the features are consistent between versions.

Customisation: 
Action! comes with a plethera of options compared to many recording softwares out there. A breif overview is this: What you record/the recorded region of the screen, what format you use, audio and visual type and quality controls, save destination, live streaming options, webcam recording and/or previewing, keyboard shortcuts and remote options, benchmarking, screenshots (and any related settings), launch options, language settings, HUD adjustments, exporting options, auto splitting, and optimisation settings for Action! itself. Each of those has a more in-depth explanation as well, which I will go over in the future on my channel and post a link to below when it's ready.

Quality:
The overall quality is outstanding to begin with, even on slightly lower quality settings; and the hardware acceleration options are a nice touch for decreasing framerate loss in game. The audio is also good quality for both system sound and optional microphone settings, although that really depends on your microphone if you have a mic set to record, and also has hardware accelerated options. Another thing with the audio is that you have the option to record the mic to a separate audio track, making it easier to edit later on.

Usability:
One problem a lot of payed recording softwares have is that they are too complicated or confusing for most new-comers to the software. Action! does not have that problem, as it is very easy to use despite all the settings you're given to play around with. Everything has a clear name or description available to you, and they are catagorised in the menus of the program in a logical and easy to find way, accompanied by fitting icons as well. They also provide plenty of helpful information on the website if you do get stuck and need the help.

Overall I cannot recommend this software more if you are looking into making high quality videos. I hope this review helped you make a decision.

Para quem deseja começar a gravar e produzir conteúdo em boa qualidade para o youtube, Action! é o programa definitivo. 
Entretanto, outras utilidades como stream e gravação de audio deixam a desejar.

Pros:
-Fácil e prático, não requer ser um mestre;
-É possível gravar o som do jogo/tudo e da sua voz com precisão;
-Você decide como melhor armazenar e gravar seus vídeos.
-É detectado imediatamente em 99% dos meus jogos.
-1080p 60 fps, mas varia de pc para pc e de jogo para jogo.

Contra:
-As vezes sobrecarrega o seu PC; gravar direto mais de uma hora pode travar o aplicativo e fazer você perder muito.
-O HUD some as vezes durante o jogo, o que pode atrapalhar no momento em que você estiver gravando.
-Games mais antigos e que funcionam somente em janela muitas vezes não são capazes de detectar o software, então você terá que gravar a tela do seu pc. Aqui a qualidade pode se perder um pouco.

É isso, vale apena se você levar conteúdo para o youtube, não mais que isso.

-Intel Quick Sync (you won't lose Fps while recording your game.)
-1080P 60Fps recording with Mp4
-You can also record your facecam during the video recording and place it anywhere you want at the screen
-You can place your overlay graphic (your logo maybe ?)
-You can also record specific area on your desktop anytime you want
-In-Built Youtube Upload option, let's you configure several settings
-Live Stream
-RCU, let's you watch over your software with information on your Android device also remote control for record(start/stop)
-120Fps function for slow motion

Cons:
-Steam version does not let you use the software without logging to Steam
-Sometimes software just freeze and you have to restart it (probably you gonna lose your last record )
-Remote Screen requires monthly sub (that's not a must)

Conclusion:I have used Fraps, Bandicam, OBS and Dxtory for capturing videos.OBS is far better than most of the recording/streaming softwares on the market but sometimes it just kills your Cpu while recording;however Action! records your game smoothly with almost no peak cpu usage (Intel Quick Sync recommended for Intel users)

Free Live streaming as of a recent update 1.22.0 I believe
Allows for separate system audio and microphone audio
Hi-Def recording - 1920x1080 @ 60fps (Beautiful!)
I have yet to find a game or program that this program won't record
Option to use MP4 or AVI depending on how much space you have available as AVI's are large file sizes
Have the options to record anything on your computer, games, desktop, regular programs, anything.

Cons -
I would say the price is a little high but now that live streaming is free personally I think the $50 tag is well worth it, so I would honestly say there is not a single true con to using this.

Conclusion -
A must buy to anyone looking to record anything on a computer.",1426283592,1426283592,True,0,0,0.497287511825561523,0,True,False,False

-high quality like 1920x1080 or 720x480
-works good with a nice GPU (mine is GTX 750 Ti Strix :) and I'm very proud of having this software :)

I have no experience or interest in using it for any other purpose, except streaming in the future.

Keep that in mind if you are reading this review but care about other features of the application!
I did include a section on my experience with Streaming but know that I lack a lot of technical knowledge in that department :)

So, let's keep moving  then :)

I'm a heavy Fraps user and spend countless hours watching Sony Movie Studio render my videos from hundreds of GB to 3-4GB.

I was skeptical at first, thinking how could anything record in compressed MP4 and not impact gaming performance.
Skeptical most likely due to my lack of technical knowledge when it comes to media recording :)

However, after downloading the DEMO from their website I quickly realized that for my personal needs, [b]Action! is the dog's bollox![/b]

Needless to say I did no hesitate to immediately purchase the streaming edition of this application. 

--------------------------------------------------
Gameplay video quality
--------------------------------------------------
Not only does it compress into [b]ready-to-upload MP4[/b], YouTube compatible format, it also records in [b]perfect 1080p[/b], high quality with [b]high bitrate[/b] and [b]great sound[/b] in expected FPS with [b]no impact on performance.[/b]

Keep in mind, just like when using FRAPS or similar you have to be recording on to a separate dedicated drive or the read/write to/from the HD while playing the game interfere with the read/write instructions of the recording application.

My setup, OS installed on HD1, STEAM games run on HD2 and Recording Software records to HD3.

P.s: Don't take my sounds quality from my videos on my profile as a good example as I still use a crappy old headset and I'm awaiting my standalone mic delivery :)

--------------------------------------------------
Streaming (noob point of view)
--------------------------------------------------
Streaming is something I'm planning on doing in the future but the small test already shown me the improved stability over Raptr Twitch streaming and OBS.

Mind you, I have limited experience using other streaming software but with my limited knowledge I found Action! ready to use out of the box with no extra config needed to get a 1080p quality stable Stream up, while with the others I found myself tinkering to much and giving up.

YES, that could be unique to my situation as I'm a noob when it comes to streaming :)

Edit - 04-October-2014
--------------------------------------------------

Throughout the below update I will not mention AVI as it had the exact same issues as MP4 with AMD APP and also, if I have to record in AVI with large file sizes I might as well stick with FRAPS!!

After now using the application for 2 weeks on a daily base and over 150hours I have come across a of new information.

I found the application working amazingly great with 7 Days to Die and that is what my original review was based on.

The only issue I had was that recording just stopped during the loading sequence when loading a new or saved game. So I simply started recording after I loaded the map and had no issues.

I was recording using MP4 with AMD APP on 1080p, recording microphone and game sound in separate channels for editing later.

For this, Mirillis Action!, was amazing.

Then Middle-Earth came out and I'm now, since it's release trying to record the gameplay but have one issue after the next.

Basically the game is loading one sequence after the next, switching from scenes to action combat all the time.

That cause my recording to crash over and over and over as that was the issue I had with the initial loading screen in 7 Days to Die too but unlike Shadow or Mordor, 7DTD does not have any more loading screens during the game so I never realised the bigger picture of the problem.

So, what have I tried?

[b]With MP4 without AMD APP on 720p[/b]

I choose to only record in MP4 and not AVI or MP4 with AMD APP it doesn't crash during the loading screens then but I can only record in 720p but hey,..better than crashing..

This looked great at first as now the recording didn't crash.....

[b]However[/b], the recording quality then was just awful, the sound goes all over the shop. The sound peaks go up and down randomly and random crackling in the sound channel is to hear while recording as well as on replay. Speed changes of the sound track and you end up with a clip where the video channel is longer than the sound channels due to the speed changes. All the awesome voice acting changes into Alvin and the Chipmunks!

The FPS is also awful, the image stutters and FPS jumps around like a dog in heat., even though it is only recording then at 720p.

Now, what next....?

I switch back to MP4 with AMD APP and 1080p and worked out that when I un-check ""use multicore recording"" that it also doesn't crash any more during loading sequences. 

Awesome. 1080p no crash and back to normal.

...NO now I also get the same problem with the sound, which changes speed and the quality is pure rubbish.

[b]With MP4 with AMD APP on 1080p and multicore unchecked[/b]

When I record in MP4 with AMD APP on 1080p [b]with ""use multicore recording"" checked[/b] the quality of the sound is brilliant and the video quality is too but then I get the issue that the application stops recording when ever any type of loading sequence occurs.

[b]Summary[/b]
So, to that end it seems that I either record with perfect sound and image quality and all the bells and whistle work amazingly well [b]but[/b] have to manually re-start recording between loading screens which is a pain in the a$$, specially if you have a dynamic game like Shadow of Mordor I can record in rubbish quality with loads of sound issues but don't crash.

When I went back to my old way, recording with fraps for video and audacity for sound I might have huge file sizes but at least everything is perfect and nothing crashes.

--------------------------------------------------
Edit - 06-February-2015
--------------------------------------------------

Since my last edit I have come across several other users who have no issues using Action! but noticed their PCs much more powerful.

It seems the more powerful your PC is the less of the issues I described above you will see, which would lead me to believe that the application is not very well optimized for mid-range PCs even if FPS is consistently above 30FPS during recording.

I have since switched to DXTory which for me personally on a mid-range PC worked out a lot better.

I can do the same as with Action!, splitting sound channels, etc.. + much more. I can have numerous sound inputs all being recorded in separate channels which is great for virtual audio channels running TS3 or similar through it.

I still would recommend the application to anyone with a good PC as it is an application with a low learning curve and easy to get into if you are new to recording your gameplay.",1411124569,1423224828,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This is looking more and more like a software still very much in development and by no means a product for which you should pay your hard earned cash.  There are other more stable software that don't just flip the switch on you, although a bit more complex and resource hogs, at least they work.

I have this in my library and I'll keep it there until Mirillis lot figure out how to make this work consistently, because it would be a crying shame for such an approachable and brilliant (when working) software to go to waste.

I've recorded over 40 videos using this software & every one comes out brilliant. This software produces 1080 HD quality videos every time. Its really simple to use. Select what resolution you want to record at, select the FPS & hit record. Simple as that. You can adjust the game to mic volume with a simple slider. Set up a web cam to work in ay of the corners & also how big you want the webcam video to be. 

You can also purchase Live time to stream to Twitch etc. It comes with 14 days Live time but costs $7.99 a month on subscription after that. This also works really well & like the recording side is very simple to set up with just selecting a few options then hit record & off you go streaming to your hearts content.

Video quality is not blurry and you do not need to hide the framerate indicator instead just select the option to hide it during recording.

Very nice software definately recommend it.

As of 7/13/2014
Pros 
Easy to use.
Has many features and settings. Inlcuding live stream which i believe you might have to pay/subscribe to I am not sure.
Multiple resolutions and other standard features like hide hud / control framerate.
Multiple channel audio recording.

Cons
Seem to be restricted to avi and mp4? No complains from my side though.
Video seems bit blurry as if there was some sort of mild gaussian blur applied to it. *Only tested this on heartstone.


Other -
Before you start to record hit F6 first to hide the hud and then record otherwise it did not work for me - everytime the hud frame rate was visible even though it was hidden during gameplay.

As a sidenote, before this, I used FRAPS to record most of everything I did, which tanks my framerate for one reason or annother, and always seems to output massive files.

It has a very clean and easy to use UI, and it's actually quite attractive.  It was incredibly easy to use straight out of the box, which is important to me because I really hate messing around with programs for months until I finally figure them out fully.  Even rebinding controls is fairly extensive while remaining simple to use.

It outputs in either AVI or MP4, and can record in 1080p without losing many frames at all, which is amazing, but it still has the filesize issue which could just be considered an issue with recording anything in HD.  It also has a framerate counter in the corner.

Now for what I didn't find so good...
I'm not a streamer and have no interest in doing so, but they lure you in with the promise of a streaming software and then only give you 14 days until you have to pay a monthly subscription, something that makes little to no sense beyond greed considering many cheaper programs do it for free.  That's a no-no.

You cannot use active desktop or specified area recording without having Windows Aero theme enabled.  This was incredibly frustrating for me because I hate the Aero theme and yet it still gives the recording UI making you think you're doing something when you're not even outputting a file.  I spent quite a while re-shooting a single 2 minute section until I finally closed it down, changed my Windows theme, and started up and it *finally* worked.  This NEEDS to be fixed, either disable the ""ghost"" UI or allow us to record without Aero on, I don't care which, I just know it needs fixing.

All in all I'll give it a 7/10, it would be an 8, but there's also a fake review I recall seeing on here (you can tell since it's written like a disclaimer,) so there's annother point gone.

1) It can not broadcast my game.  I have to use full screen, or set up a selection window around the Windowed instance of the game.  The latter doesn't work, as the controls get permanently attached beneath the selection area, rather than staying in the seperated interface the controls began in.  Since my game is the hieght of my screen, it kicks the controls off screen, rendering them inaccessable.  There is no work-around short of short-cut keys.

2) There is no preview.  It appears that there will be one, but when streaming, there in fact is none.

3) It can not handle overlays with transparencies.  It can only use straight-up square images as they are.  No Chroma.

4) It can not handle audio intelligently.  I have Game Sounds, TeamSpeak, Media-Monkey, and a microphone.  Ideally, you could have each on a fader in a mixer with a side-chain compressor dynamically lowering all sounds but TeamSpeak and Mic when they are creating sound above a set threshold.  This can't do anything but select an audio source and/or a mic - period.

5) This software actually performed worse than Open Broadcast in my testing.  I run a modest game (DC Universe) on a Core i7 3770, 16GB RAM, Creative Labs X-Fi HD Titanium, AMD HD6890 and I have 18Mb d/l and 11Mb u/p speeds from my ISP.  Open Broadcast reliably, and repeatably, outperformed this software.

6) This software sells as though it were a ""buy this and then use it all you want"" title, when in fact it is actually a subscription model.  I find the sales presentation of this title deceptive.  Period.  I had no idea it was subscription based until I had already purchased, downloaded, installed, and run the program for the first time.  Once you run it, the Subscription Model is the very first thing it talks about.  Keyword = DECEPTIVE.

Summary:

If there was any semblance of a Help->Contact Us within the program, and they could be reached with this feedback and all of the above issues were resolved, it would be worth the money to buy - not to subscribe - to buy.

As it is - totally wasted my time and money on this and will have to return to OBS just to broadcast properly - which it did for free in the first place.",1400292229,1400292412,False,75,2,0.557709634304046631,19,True,False,False

(aka, all of my bullet hell titles i enjoy, and many indie games). A paper thin help system doesn't help. I've tried on multible PCs with this item and it either flat out refuses to record or records, records at a insanely laggy space (1 frame per 4 seconds anybody?) or just doesn't do the job it was stated that it was able to do.

It is also VASTLY overpriced for such ineffective, poorly featured software. I've payed $20 or less for recording software that's far more effective than this such as bandicam, fraps and a few others (only reason i brought this was because i really needed a recorder that was portable to different PCs, since steam handles the licencing for you then it was ideal).

Save your money and wait for another recording software to come out on the steam software section.. trust me.. your just throwing your money away with this product.

The only thing that I dont like so far is when  I use my 7.1 USB headset while gaming with friends it picks up the the chat from them. I havent been able to find a work around other then dont have your friends on when you record, or buy a seperate program for splitting sound. This seems to be a reocurring theme with capture sftware and hardware. To all devs. Please add sound split tech to your software. Any real gamer wants to hear from there 7.1 and be able to record while having the ability to not pick up chat.
