overall it is a really fun game, if you have friends to play with in custom matches or just creating customs then it is an absolute blast to play around with

if you're playing just for the random quick matches then yes you will encounter a literal handful of bugs, the biggest bug I've discovered is that since this is a port of a PS3 game the graphics lag is horrendous, your mouse cursor feels more like a joystick than anything because when you move your mouse you have to wait for the actual cursor to catch up",1689429472,1689429472,True,0,0,0.433070838451385498,0,True,False,False

1. it takes about 7 minutes to play a match about 15-30 minutes finding one depending on how many times the matchmaking fails. 

2. No ability to type to teammates you have to use premade messages that people have to interpret in a tactical slow paced game like this. thats pretty bad. 

3. The invulnerability mechanic is absolute dog water and ruins the pacing of a match. I understand if you have it when a MS is getting up but being able to get up and just ride away is a horrible mechanic. 

4. Idk if you all have heard but, the servers are absolutely broken. 


I was so excited for this game, i still like playing it when im actually in a game. But holy crap man how do you mess up a port this bad for such an amazing IP. I love gundam and had been waiting a while for this. Oh well.

Even being able to play is a gamble in itself, as GBO2 feels like it is constantly taken offline every other day for impromptu maintenance. And yet while the game is up actually getting into a match usually devolves into queuing and repeatedly being kicked by nebulous 'FAILED MATCHMAKING' or 'FAILED TO FORM TEAMS' errors that prematurely shut down the lobby. This is easily the worst part of experience and completely drains the momentum out of your gaming session; at its worst this can put 15 minute delays between matches.

Playing with friends also sucks. There is no permanent party option and you are forced to re-invite your friends through the Steam overlay after each and every match you play. 

There are an impressive amount of mobile suits from basically every Gundam series on tap, and this has been monetized to the max with gacha mechanics and loot boxes. You are given free currency and some free suits as a new player thankfully, but I highly suggest avoiding any match with above 500 unit cost as they will be filled with paypigs using overpowered suits.

Also, true to scammy gacha fashion, all suits have an arbitrary ""rarity"" denoted by its stars. This means even if you own the same suit as someone, their suit might have arbitrarily better stats and perks due to having more stars.

The movement feels decently weighty, as it should, you are piloting a giant robot. The novelty of the combat wears off once you realize it is mostly based on stunlocking and melee scrubbery. The optimal strategy at higher levels involves strafing back and forth around corners with powerful single-shot weapons such as beam rifles to repeatedly chain-stagger enemies until they can be easily finished off.

All the animations are infuriatingly slow and it takes your suit about 20 seconds to get up when knocked on its ass. The customization and some of the shooting gameplay can be fun, there's just too much else negative for me to recommend it.

It's free so try it if you want, you might have fun until you are arbitrarily kicked from a match due to a server error or matched with a team who collectively have no hands.

[b]Bonus Edit: I queued into a ranked match with a hacker who somehow forced me and my teammates to sortie into battle using low cost suits during a 500 point cost match. I got a black GM1 with only a Vulcan Head Cannon equipped! I didn't even know there were hackers in this game, but I can't say I'm surprised!

Real nice of you, real nice. 

Also might not recommend this game if you're allergic to spending money on gacha games.

the 20% of the time that the game works as intended it is everything I loved about GBO2 on the PS4 I just Cannot recommend it in its current state.

Gameplay:
8/10
Perhaps a little slow, but once you learn the ebb and flow of combat its a really nice Gundam game.

Performance:
1/10
Matchmaking is broken, matches tend to lock up and it boots you out of matchmaking 60% of the time.

Network:
7/10
Laggy, manageable, but laggy.
