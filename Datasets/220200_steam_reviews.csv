Yet we were wrong, as we could see those gleaming worlds up there, and if we could see them, than there must be light, and if light could cross between us and those glittering worlds, than so could we. And so we reached our tender hands to the stars, and so the stars beckoned us forth, tempting us so. And so we plunged our unknowing hands into the merciless pool of the cosmos, blissfully unaware of its unforgiving depths, and grabbing at the beautiful worlds suspended there in its clear waters. And so the cosmos grabbed back, and ripped us down into the icy ocean of inhumanity-intending to drown us in it, keeping us from paddling our way to these other worlds prohibited by god. We did not drown, however; rather we dove, and changed in an instant into something so great, and so terrible. We became as gods in our cruelty: Innocent Kerbals doomed to orbit the sun eternally, unable to die, and condemned to a ceaseless torment-so undeserved. More Kerbals still thrust forth into the dim and horrific depths of deep space, ungraced by even the light of our sun, much less its comforting pull. Kerbals slammed into celestial bodies in terrible time manipulation accidents, eviscerated in completion without even a moment to register their fate; or beg for mercy. And so as gods we dove deeper into the pool of the stars, weighed down by the corpses and pleas of those Kerbals we tormented so, and when we reached its cold, barren depth, we stood not in the garden of knowledge which we sought and sacrificed so many in the name of -  But rather upon a meaningless altar of sin, and before laid before us; the universe, all of it; every inch perceived. And so in this moment something came to us upon the altar, be it god - or something else; it did not love us - for it spoke unto us but three words:
""Feel, and understand"" 
And immediately god was gone - and immediately we felt. We felt every single plea, every bargain made by each poor tormented Kerbal soul, confined in their hells wrought of silicates, battery, and steel. Every single prayer for saving which fell upon deaf, merciless ears. Every microcosm of pain inflicted upon those fortunate enough to be treated to death in a failed launch or time accident. Every sob and agonized moment of aching and longing felt by the families of those brutalized and abandoned Kerbonauts. Every ounce of sin we had wrent from the wet cloth of our tangible realm; we felt - and we understood, in an instant. And so it was understood that we were not as gods in our actions, but as devils; That what we had wrought in the face of that something more, that true deity, was unforgivable, and irreparable. We were forced to perceive the torment we had brought down upon every Kerbal we sent beyond our world: And it was too much. We cried out then, from the pain of our punishment, in its magnitude, and our incapability to bear it any longer. We cried out then but two words; 
""Be not""
And so all was not. For the only way to atone for our egregious miscarriage of godhood was annihilation. Suffering cannot be born out of an abyss, and so our everything became just that; abyssal. The light of the cosmos was snuffed out in an instant as we uttered those pitiful words from our black altar, deep in our ocean of sin, buried beneath another mountain yet of viscera, and glittering beneath a blackened sun. And so all matter too was stripped away; nothingness in absolution; an end. Peaceful lethargy be put upon us, an end to the disorder which hath been brought down upon the sweet, innocent world. Now, nothing may happen, and nothing may keep happening - forever.

2500+ hours? I'm just getting started. Vanilla is excellent and the mod community is beyond outstanding and exemplary. 

Want mods? download the CKAN mod manager. The 'Real Solar System' mod and associated extras are the shiznit. Seriously. Literally life-sized solar system. LEO at 7.7 kilomerters per second, zoooooooooom. Not as fast as the Parker Solar Probe but it could be with the right design and mission profile.

I came into this game knowing nothing about it and years later I've done things like land, deploy and operate a submersible automated amphibious rover on Jupiter's moon Titan and dived the hydrocarbon lakes (admitedly not without Mechjeb). I've assembled large ships that took 12 launches for all the parts to assemble in LEO (low earth orbit). And I'm still a noob, you should see what more capable people have done on YouTube, just amazing. You start simple and work your way up in complexity so it is really quite manageable. It's one of those games that you can learn in a day but take a lifetime to master, kind of like chess but waaaaaay more interesting :P

When you put vanilla plus the immense modding community together you end up with a massive amount of content to enjoy. Literally thousands of hours to be had over many years for a decent price if not more. Yeah there are quirks and you will be devoured by the 'Kraken' at some points when the physics maths go bonkers under the hood but hey it might just be a cosmic ray smacking through the RAM or something for all I know. So there's immense bang for the buck for buck to be had here and tons of adventure to go with it. Also a person can learn all kinds of cool things about orbital mechanics and how rockets work and how systems come together to say the least. 

And if you REALLY want to learn check out Scott Manley's KSP videos on YouTube, the guy is a genius and is pretty easy to understand (most of the time). He is vastly knowledgeable on KSP and there are hundreds of videos by him on it. (not affiliated, just a fan).
 
Also here's a rock-music video I made with KSP showing a capsule on re-entry to Earth: https://youtu.be/YGlTRxfGz7g

You can just use your imagination and build pretty much anything. Also the Breaking Ground DLC has robotic parts so you can make morphing vehicles.

With that said. Everything promised with a Career mode has been hot garbage. 
- In Career mode you can take missions, these are semi-random based on progress you've made. Once you fly by the Mun you unlock 'Tourists' who want to fly by the Mun and orbit Kerbin (87k per tourist). An excellent deal. But once you land on the Mun, every tourist wants to go there. The price rises to 117k, but the cost of landing that tourist (safely and returning) on Mun rises. In fact it rises disproportionately to the value. A 'Flyby' will likely cost you 40k in parts - but a landing and return will likely set you back 150k. Essentially a penalty for progress...
- Another mission asks that you setup a 'Base' somewhere. Mostly this appears reasonable. Until you realize they want an absurdly high quantity of fuel. Even with maximum efficiency and high research points you'll likely spend twice as much on achieving this 'Base' as you get for a reward. 
- The re-entry friction seems tragically glitchy. Pieces of the ship, unexposed, burn off. Wiggling your ship seems to 'suddenly reset the heat bar' which makes no sense. 

Career mode feels like a rushed patch just to say 'We did it! Mission Accomplished.' (I imagine 'Mission Accomplished' will incite memories in those 30 years or older... and for good, ironic, reasons).

There's been some odd 'improvements' in the last year or two. Such as when you hit an acceleration and it no-longer locks your radial in place. Instead you often spin wildly out of control and get the Kraken... Like the goal was to take 5 steps backwards in development...

For a game that started a craze and inspired so many, the bells and whistles added to get us to 1.0! are reminiscent of what I'm watching folks experience in Kerbal Spaceprogram 2... 

*sigh*  I think this is the last time I'll load it up. I just hate where it's going/gone.",1430442261,1707957599,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Good game btw, it's as advertised. Tons of parts; physics are subpar at times, but I usually have a good laugh at it now and again.

Keeping it short and sweet. This game is great if you like making things and seeing what happens. And it's even greater if you'd like to learn a bit about rockets and how things work in space. You don't need to be a physicist to play the game, and it has a smooth learning curve that basically lets you do whatever you want, and are capable, of doing.

I've used tons of quality of life mods and graphical mods to further enhance the experience. The style of the game and soundtrack are fun.  

The actual space simulation is great. Educational even. The orbital mechanics work great. The atmosphere simulation for airplanes is decent but do not expect Microsoft Flight Simulator. This game can really be as simple or complicated as you want. I find that the more complicated things like building a space station may start to cause the game mechanics to break down (ie. the infamous Kraken bug). Essentially the simulation gyrates the spacecraft until it falls apart.

Beyond that, it is a great game that I highly recommend experiencing. I've sunk tons of hours into it, so it's worth a try for anyone else!",1706869413,1706869501,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Basically, this game is (of course) a space sim, but it's also much more than that. You can do lots of things, from upgrading your space program, to building a space station, to discovering secrets of the Kerbollar system, and more! The possibilities are insane! With things like docking ports and RCS thrusters, you can build an entire rocket in orbit. Or, maybe you want to land on another planet, which is %100 possible.

You may be able to figure it out yourself or you might be like me and look up websites to explain how to enter orbit and how how to do various maneuvers. You will probably end up learning a tiny bit of real physics in the process. There is so much to learn and so many designs you can imagine and try out. Take a look at the Steam workshop mods to see what people have created and shared for you.

If you like the idea of designing realistic or wacky space vehicles, give it a try! There is even a mode where you also run the business of a space-exploration company, upgrade buildings, take jobs for money and design ships to reach deep into space, including unmanned probes, tourist shuttles, breakaway landers, and satellites to increase your communication network's reach.

The game can actually be quite hard, so you should be a patient person that is okay with seeing your first attempts end up in flames. Doing orbital maneuvers can be tricky to learn. The graphics of the places could probably be better. Surfaces of the planets up close are kind of boring but it all looks good enough from the sky and more of your focus will be on controlling your ship during a mission.

Despite the difficulty and the plain-looking planet surfaces, the game is a completely unique and fun masterpiece that may keep you entertained for hundreds of hours. Highly recommended!",1705759900,1705759900,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

My original review below.

[spoiler]Broken Physics.

Recently I decided to play this again but seem to have an issue where on re-entry my craft does not seem to experience much, if any air resistance or drag to help me slow down, even with the chute partially deployed, I just continue to pick up speed while plummeting to the ground, destroying the chute in the process, even in the first basic flight tutorial in the hopper.

I played this over a year ago & it was fine then, on chute deployment a small craft like the hopper would flick around & begin to slow, even before the chute fully opened, now however that doesn't happen for me anymore.

After almost a whole day of trouble shooting, I give up.

Unlike other titles that tend to lose their charm after a hundred or so hours, KSP keeps me engaged and excited for every spacefaring adventure.

Comparing it to Minecraft, a game that once held me captivated for a staggering 5000 hours across multiple platforms, speaks volumes about the longevity and appeal of KSP. The intricate design and the limitless possibilities of space exploration in KSP make it feel like a dynamic, ever-evolving universe. The sheer joy of planning and executing missions, coupled with the unpredictable nature of space travel, ensures that boredom remains an alien concept in this game.

Kerbal Space Program is not just a game; it's a playground for the imagination, where the sky is not the limit, but only the beginning of your cosmic endeavors. It's a testament to the developers' commitment to crafting an experience that transcends the usual gaming lifespan. Strap in, fellow gamers, for a journey that promises to keep you enthralled long after other titles have faded into the gaming archives.

If you want a game you can just play around in and watch rockets blow up in the atmosphere in sandbox mode, or if you want to set down and grind your way through a tech tree while balancing a budget for your space program in career mode. KSP offers a unique look in to the world of rocketry and space exploration. Join Jebediah, Valentina, and the rest of the Kerman family as you learn some basic principles of aerodynamics and astrophysics in a easy and enjoyable way. This game does lack a proper tutorial leaving the player to explore the world primarily through trial and error, but with a little experimentation even the most inexperienced rocket enthusiasts can quickly learn how to lift off a rocket. with the recent developments from the devs on Kerbal Space Program 2, KSP is starting to be less of a valid game. Where KSP shines over KSP 2 is performance, if you have an older PC or struggle with more modern graphics KSP is much easier to play on older machines. Overall Kerbal Space Program is a great game that can help you learn some new principles of aerodynamics and orbital mechanics, while at the same time being one of the most fun space flight games on the market. To top it all off KSP has an amazing community from the modders on curse, to the legions of fans on the official discord, and some very well established youtubers. you will never be left without the resources you need to make your KSP experience fantastic. My final thought on KSP is that i have owned this game for years at this point and out of all the hundreds of games i have access to I find KSP to be one of the games i return to most often. at the point i wrote this steam says i have 226 hours in KSP but i have atleast that many more hours playing KSP offline. you can easily get a good $/HR from KSP and a lot of it is highly enjoyable.

Once upon a time, on the distant planet of Kerbin, a group of adventurous and curious green humanoid aliens known as Kerbals dreamt of exploring the cosmos. They gazed up at the night sky, wondering what mysteries lay beyond their home planet. The Kerbals decided it was time to embark on a grand journey into space, and so they established the Kerbal Space Program (KSP).

The KSP headquarters buzzed with excitement as Kerbals worked tirelessly to build their first spacecraft. The lead engineer, Jebediah Kerman, was the most enthusiastic of them all. He had a reputation for being daring and always seeking out new challenges. With a twinkle in his eye, Jebediah exclaimed, ""Today, we begin our journey to the stars!""

The Kerbal engineers designed a spacecraft called the ""Mun Explorer 1,"" equipped with powerful engines, navigation systems, and a capsule to safely carry Kerbal astronauts. The first crew members selected for this historic mission were Jebediah Kerman himself, along with Bill Kerman as the pilot and Bob Kerman as the engineer.

As the Mun Explorer 1 lifted off from the launchpad, the excitement was palpable. The Kerbals watched nervously from the control room as the rocket soared into the sky. The orbital physics engine worked its magic, allowing the spacecraft to achieve a stable orbit around Kerbin.

With each successful maneuver, the Kerbals gained confidence. They practiced Hohmann transfer orbits, orbital rendezvous, and other complex maneuvers needed for interplanetary travel. The KSP team faced challenges, learned from failures, and celebrated triumphs.

One day, Jebediah Kerman proposed an ambitious mission to land on the Mun, Kerbin's moon. The engineers designed the Mun Lander, a spacecraft capable of landing on and returning from the Mun's surface. Jebediah, Bill, and Bob eagerly volunteered for the mission.

The Mun Lander blasted off from Kerbin, headed for the Mun. The Kerbals expertly executed a precise landing, collecting valuable data and planting the Kerbal flag on the Mun's surface. As the Mun Lander returned to Kerbin, the atmosphere held its breath. The re-entry was successful, and the capsule splashed down safely in the ocean.

The success of the Mun mission marked a turning point for the Kerbal Space Program. News of their achievements spread across Kerbin, inspiring more Kerbals to join the space program. The KSP team continued to push the boundaries of space exploration, visiting distant planets, constructing space stations, and unlocking the secrets of the universe.

As the Kerbals looked back at their home planet from the vastness of space, they marveled at the wonders they had discovered and the challenges they had overcome. The Kerbal Space Program had become a beacon of inspiration, proving that even the smallest creatures could reach for the stars and achieve the extraordinary. And so, the adventurous green explorers continued their cosmic journey, fueled by curiosity and the endless possibilities of the cosmos.",1704030166,1704030166,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

The graphics hold up, even in 2023, and it has potential of hundreds of hours of gameplay, consisting either screwing around, recreating in real life spacecraft, or creating your own missions. It has its flaws, for instance, when speeding up time in atmosphere with a large enough craft, it will warp and twist it to the point that when you get out of the time warp, your ship blows up. There are ways of minimizing the probability of this happening by using the ""auto-strut"" feature, but this does not prevent it from happening 100% of the time.

I keep coming back to it. Kerbal Space Program lets you design realistic(ish) spacecraft that you can then fly around the solar system, all while you learn about orbital mechanics. And that's just the base game. With mods, you can add custom parts, game mechanics, gorgeous visual effects, different physics models, planets, and even entirely new star systems! For the mega-nerds like myself, you can even go so far as doing the calculations for things like transfer windows and delta V. I cannot understate how well KSP demonstrates the difficulties of spaceflight. And it's a blast! You will either burst into laughter or tears when your first lunar lander crashes horribly into the surface of the moon. Then you'll try again. And again. And one of those times it will work. Then you can fly to duna (the in-game analog of mars). And then different planets' moons. Then you can install mods that expand the base game. You can add antimatter engines and fusion reactors, gigantic antennas and enormous solar arrays. You can create self-sustaining colonies on other planets. You can fly to another star system!

Kerbal Space Program is a love letter to science, creativity, and the inherent hilarity of launching green dudes into space with questionable contraptions. Its deep yet accessible simulation, endless potential for experimentation, and the ever-present threat of catastrophic failure offer a unique and endlessly rewarding experience. Just remember, even the greatest minds of rocket science started with a few dozen explosions – so embrace the green goo, strap on your goggles, and prepare to conquer the final frontier one Kerbal explosion at a time.

Note: Don't just play the base game, delve into the incredible world of KSP mods. Download new parts, career modes, and even entire solar systems, ensuring your space program reaches dizzying heights of complexity and (often hilarious) chaos.

-={ GAMEPLAY }=-
Deep yet accessible physics simulation: Master orbital mechanics, overcome atmospheric resistance, and understand the delicate balance of thrust and gravity to achieve glorious (or hilarious) spaceflight.
Endless creativity potential: Design rockets of all shapes and sizes, strap on ridiculous contraptions, and customize your Kerbals with silly hats – the sky (and beyond) is the limit.
Hysterically funny physics mishaps: Witness wobbly rockets spiral out of control, Kerbals flung into orbit by miscalculated explosions, and the endless parade of creative (and disastrous) ways your space program can go wrong.
Strong modding community: Expand your universe with custom parts, challenges, and game modes, thanks to a dedicated and creative community.

Steep learning curve: Mastering the intricacies of spaceflight takes time, patience, and likely a few dozen fiery demises.
Frustrating failures: Sometimes, the universe conspires against you, and your carefully crafted rocket will meet a glorious, fiery end for seemingly no reason.
Repetitive tasks: Grinding resources and completing contracts can feel monotonous after a while.

If you like the thought of going into space with a rocket that you build yourself this is the game for you. But there's a twist... It's challenging to be able to get a rocket to make it to space to start with. Then to get one that can get into orbit is a bit more challenging. After you get those 2 two things down you feel pretty good about yourself so you need to go to the Mun. All together getting there is tough but then add in the fact that you might want to get back home to brag about it. This is just barely scraping the surface. You still have multiple planets, asteroids and moons to get to then come home with out running out of fuel or exploding into little green and red pieces of Kerbal spacemen.

It's had multiple copycat attempts.
Sparked 2D mobile game versions.
A decade of development love.
This is the original.

This game is probably tied for my favorite game, right alongside Skyrim.
I was essentially raised playing KSP and Skyrim.
This game teaches you math, physics, a little chemistry, and ultimately fuels a love for the stars.

Just buy it. If you need to wait for a sale, sure, do so. But buy it.

An added plus, this game has (in my opinion) the nicest and most helpful community alongside the most dedicated modding community. The modding community rivals that of Skyrim.

This is similar to Skyrim in that you can spend 500 hours playing the game vanilla, and still have more to do. Then you discover the modding potential, and realize you can turn this game into 5 different games just with mods. 
Want to have a silly game where you taught small green men into the void? You got it. Want a dedicated space sim that could literally, and has actually, teach people at NASA? Done. Want to explore the stars with fusion drives? Easy. Want to make your own star trek ships and warp to new galaxies? You'll need a beefy computer, but you can do it.
This game has infinite possibilities. 

I have a few hours logged through steam, but I would hazard a fairly confident guess that my real playtime is about double what steam has recorded because of modding and needing a copied game file to keep Steam from updating and ruining all the carefully selected and balanced mods.

With the original devs all gone and the studio now owned by a completely different company, I can not recommend this game or its sequel Kerbal 2.  The current state is extremely unsatisfactory.

(Old Review)

For an early access game this gem is already quite playable and thoroughly enjoyable.  With the recent addition of the Asteroid Redirect Mission update patch, which was designed in cooperation with NASA, Squad has taken the game to new heights.  It really is hard to believe that so much more is still to come and this is only early access.  

 Kerbal Space Program already has a great community base, excellent rapport with the developers and an huge community of modders as well as a large number of demos, play-alongs and tutorials available in video on the web.

 Don't hesitate!  This game is already great and just gets better with each new feature as the game develops.  Explore the Kerbin system with all the part available in sandbox mode or start off with just the basics in career mode and do science missions to research more and better parts as you explore outward from Kerbin to the other planets around the sun, Kerbol.  Watch your Kerbalnauts grin in joy and excitement or scream in adject terror as you launch them into space.  There is no other game quite like Kerbal Space Program.",1396636364,1701185965,False,0,0,0.522555530071258545,0,True,False,True

It can be complex sometimes (specially when doing long-distance flights. I remember struggling just to get to Mar...I mean Duna).
but it still is very accessible, even for those who are unfamilliar with the Flight Simulation genre.

The best way to play this game is to make [b]YOUR OWN[/b] experimentation.
The first time you will boot KSP, you may build a rocket that will fly... but it won't fly far...and that's totally fine because it's all part of the learning process. Each time you launch a rocket, you learn something new (heck, even with my 450 Hours of play, I have yet to land a rocket on Eeloo...).

Want more parts for your vessels? well, here's the best part of KSP: [b]MODS![/b]
and believe me, there are a TONS of them.
And Since KSP's last major update was released in 2021, you don't need to worry about mods not working anymore due to Obsolescence.

The launcher still doesn't launch the game, and there have been no more updates.  I did contact Squad/Private Division support, and their did reply quickly and told me to just bypass the launcher and included a linked me to a Steam guide on how to bypass the launcher.

[h1]Update 2022[/h1]
It pains me to say this, but I can no longer recommend this game, or anything from 2K/Take-Two/Private Division.  Over the past year and a half, 2K has been updating new and old games to add a ""launcher"" in order to serve ads and collect data from users.  It also fails to launch games.  I could describe what it does, or I can show you in this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsO-Zn-r82I

The launcher also does not work at all on Linux or the Steam Deck, but they still advertise their games as supported on Linux and Steam Deck.  2K knows about this and instead of fixing it, they continue to add it to more games.

Now 2K's launcher is being re-skinned and added to games published by Private Division, which includes Kerbal Space Program, and the upcoming Kerbal Space Program 2.

[h1]Original Review[/h1]
I've had this game since early access (version 0.20) when it was just a sandbox game.  You can still play in pure sandbox mode, or play two types of career modes.  There is a basic science career in which you just basically do what you want, collect science and unlock newer technology without having to worry about money.  Then there is the full career mode where you have to manage your entire space program.  You must earn money by taking contracts like putting satellites in orbit, setting up space stations and bases in and around other planets and moons or even ferrying tourists.  The full career mode is customizable to make it as easy or hard as you want.  It has presets for normal, medium and hard, or you can adjust it to your liking.  The game is no longer being updated, but there is still an active modding community that continue to improve the game.",1384474871,1700817068,False,1,0,0.520547926425933838,0,True,False,False

We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.--That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, --That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.--Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.

He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.

He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.

He has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only.

He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.

He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.

He has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected; whereby the Legislative powers, incapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large for their exercise; the State remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within.

He has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands.

He has obstructed the Administration of Justice, by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary powers.

He has made Judges dependent on his Will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.

He has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of Officers to harrass our people, and eat out their substance.

He has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the Consent of our legislatures.

He has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil power.

He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislation:

For Quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:

For protecting them, by a mock Trial, from punishment for any Murders which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States:

For cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world:

For imposing Taxes on us without our Consent:

For depriving us in many cases, of the benefits of Trial by Jury:

For transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences

For abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring Province, establishing therein an Arbitrary government, and enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these Colonies:

For taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws, and altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments:

For suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.

He has abdicated Government here, by declaring us out of his Protection and waging War against us.

He has plundered our seas, ravaged our Coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people.

He is at this time transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries to compleat the works of death, desolation and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of Cruelty & perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized nation.

He has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against their Country, to become the executioners of their friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands.

He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages, whose known rule of warfare, is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions.

In every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms: Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A Prince whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.

Nor have We been wanting in attentions to our Brittish brethren. We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations, which, would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence. They too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our Separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace Friends.

We, therefore, the Representatives of the united States of America, in General Congress, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by Authority of the good People of these Colonies, solemnly publish and declare, That these United Colonies are, and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States; that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain, is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as Free and Independent States, they have full Power to levy War,",1700731422,1700731422,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I have no idea how a sandbox game can be so educational, funny, entertaining, challenging, and creative. 

To give you an idea of what you may be doing when you learn the mechanics and controls of the game here's one of my latest missions. I had taken on a huge contract to put a research station in an orbit around a moon of Kerbin. I also had tourist contracts and pressure from the general public to explore Minmus. So I constructed a 500,000 Kerbal dollar ship that operated in 6 stages.

1: Fire heavy rockets to exit atmosphere
2: MORE heavy rockets to establish and circularize Kerbal orbit, enter Minmus Hohmann transfer, and brake to circularize Minmus orbit.
3: Separate science lab and supporting experiments (including a cyclotron) with 3 scientists and an engineer inside to leave in orbit.
4: Fire engines of 5-seat lander holding pilot and tourists in the orbital retrograde vector to allow the moon's gravity to pull me in and land. Brake using engines and land on moon.
5: Leave empty fuel tanks and escape gravity well of Minmus. Burn into Hohmann transfer back into Kerbin's atmosphere and use final fuel braking on descent to Kerbin.

Even if you don't want to play the space missions just building planes is so much fun. Basically this game has kept me entertained for hours and hours!

I recommend playing sand box for a few hours just to get the mechanics of space flight, and even alt F12 to bring up cheat menu so you can have infinite fuel, just while you understand space travel and the difficulties of burning and the control poapsis obit flight thing. I recommend a few you tube videos to get the hang of this.

Once learnt (far from mastered for me, I still cheat to get any further than the red planet) You'll have endless fun trying to get to and back! from all the planets, designing space craft, stations, bases, planes, rovers and many other delights.

In a playful way, you get to learn a lot about spaceflight.
Terminology and even complex maneuvers (such as how to get to the ""mun"" and land on it) are explained in an easy-to-understand way, and the visualization in the game really does the rest.
Seeing it all in action is so much better than reading pages of theoretical material.

Career aspects and progression are implemented nicely - the grind for money and research points can be done in a variety of ways, never really leaving you bored.

Really though, KSP is hella fun.

What makes it stand out among other space games is its unique fusion of a sandbox construction game and a spaceflight simulator. When you get bored or frustrated trying to finally make that eve ascent (you won't be able to stop me much longer you purple bastard), you can change pace spending hours trying to build ""that rocket"" (you know, the one that looks cool but also has 6000 m/s of delta-v and is also somehow a VTOL SSTO) or maybe a just a Kerbal trebuchet. I don't know, it's up to you.

Kerbal Space Program is also pretty difficult. How is that a good thing? It treats failure as a natural part of learning and progression. That might be frustrating for some, but I think it adds a lot to the experience. Your first rocket isn't going to work because you won't understand what requirements your vessel needs to meet to launch (My first rocket used jet engines, but had no air intakes. Upon ""launch,"" the vehicle's engines sputtered and it slowly fell over like a pool noodle). If you're paying attention, you can take these failures as opportunities to test, learn, and develop your knowledge of the game, iterating your approach as you go along. With enough time, construction and orbital mechanics will become intuitive, and you'll realize that you're basically applying the scientific process in-game. It also has the added benefit of makes successes, reaching the Mun, Duna, or Jool's watery moon Laythe for example, far more satisfying than they would be otherwise.

Kerbal earns extra points for being ""incidentally"" educational. While it isn't entirely realistic, it is a physically accurate spaceflight simulator, and does teach many spaceflight fundamentals. Physics behaves almost exactly as it would in real life, though some exceptions do exist (no Lagrange points, no orbital precession, no relativity, etc). Additionally, players must consider their spacecraft's fuel, power, and communications systems, the efficiency of specific engines in an atmosphere or space, staging, and more, all of which are important considerations when engineering real spacecraft. Many games which are actually marketed as educational aren't fun and talk down to their audience. Kerbal is not one of those games, and manages to remain entertaining by letting you figure things out yourself (AKA, by failing).

Sandbox mode is typically the mode I play. But this mode doesn't give you much a reason to keep playing beyond construction and exploration for their own sake. And KSP has a notorious issue with uninteresting locations, making exploration unrewarding once you've already reached a destination. Luckily, this can be avoided. There are two other modes (Science and Career) which give you in-game science and monetary goals. There are also mods. Lots of mods. Some which add real rocket parts and destinations, others which add visual enhancements, and a few which add useful in-game tools.

Though I can't give Kerbal enough praise for what it does right, it's got some pretty hefty flaws. Missions take a lot of patience. Loading times are long (especially modded), you cannot time warp during burns (the one actual upgrade in KSP's sequel), and time warp in general is pretty bad without mods like Better Time Warp. It also has problems incentivizing travel--Aside from a few easter eggs, most locations are completely barren. 

There's also ""The Kraken."" Like its brother ""Clang"" from Space Engineers, The Kraken is a mythical beast that haunts the game's physics engine and causes unexplainable ""things"" (explosions) to occasionally happen. Massive rockets, collisions, long chains of parts (part noodles), wheels, and sometimes literally anything will not be safe from The Kraken's terror. These glitches can be funny--search up ""danny2462"" on YouTube--but they often happen at inappropriate times. Luckily, encountering the Kraken in normal gameplay is unusual in modern versions.

So, yeah. Kerbal Space Program is frustrating and sometimes pretty broken. But when the game isn't breaking, it can be incredibly satisfying, silly, and entertaining, too, somehow all while sneakily teaching you orbital mechanics. If you're up for the challenge, and you're a die-hard space nerd, I recommend buying this game (and its DLC, too) without hesitation. You won't regret it.

Oh also, Don't buy KSP 2 yet. It's haunted by the Kraken and doesn't have as much content.",1489767389,1698532997,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Ever felt like being the Elon Musk of your neighborhood (minus the Twitter meltdowns)? Well, boy oh boy, does Kerbal Space Program have a surprise for you!

Welcome to the only space where you can mix incompetence with cosmic ambition! Design your spacecraft, slap it together, and pray it doesn't disassemble like a toddler's Lego project mid-air. Throw in some eager Kerbals, who (bless their brave, naive hearts) trust your basic understanding of physics. 

Plot a course and aim for the stars! Or, you know, aim to just not explode upon takeoff. Get that trajectory just right, and you'll proudly watch your rocket serenely orbit the planet. Misjudge it by a smidgen? Hope your Kerbal enjoys a leisurely orbit around the Sun – forever. And fingers crossed they've got an infinite playlist of cat videos, 'cause space can get kinda lonely.

Sharpen your spacefaring chops, embrace your inner armchair rocket scientist, and who knows? Next time there's a live rocket launch, you might just feel the insuppressible need to chime in with, ""Well, in MY space program...""

Prepare for lift-off, cosmic comedians! Happy launching and remember, in space, no one can hear you giggle. 🚀🌌🤣",1698125808,1698125808,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

Upon landing on the mun for the first time, with a poorly designed ship I collected 500+ (much needed) scientific data. After then lifting off on the mun, less than half way up to a stable mun orbit I ran out of fuel, and immediately began to panic. However, I used monopropellant and 2 rcs jets for about 10+ minutes to get to a stable orbit and rendezvous with the rest of my ship and return to kerbal. Good thing I wasn't in charge of America's space program in the 60s haha. 

After numerous failed mun landing attempts and then this, what a memorable experience. I still chuckle about it, what a game :) 

It's also worth mentioning how fun this still was while I was failing. Overcoming design problems, not having parts I needed researched yet, and trying to engineer around those missing pieces was great fun. 

Still, even today, one of the greatest games.

There's a learning curve, but it's not hard and is actually educational as well - and I'm still learning after 300+ hours gameplay.
As you progress you have to think strategically what new tech will best help reach the next challenges or you can be stuck for a while with assignments that you can't deliver.
I appreciate the Breaking Ground and Making History expansions which I think make the whole experience richer.
Only -ve is that in Steam it takes a long time to load/switch between contexts.

The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical gamer's head. There's also Jebediah's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Kerbal Space Program truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Jebediah's existential catchphrase ""(◉ᗜ◉)"" which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons.

I was born, raised, and continue to live on the southern bank of the Tennessee River directly across the river from the Marshall Space Flight Center. Living in a very rural area of Alabama surrounded by cow pastures and the wilderness of the Appalachian foothills on three sides and a mighty river on the other while simultaneously witnessing and experiencing the sights and VERY loud sounds of our nations largest most powerful rockets on a near daily basis created a love for all things Space Program in me at a very young age. 
    While the frequent test firing of rockets was done a few miles away and hidden from view, the sheer amount of power unleashed in those short burst of rocket fire was impossible to miss. A quite peaceful day with only the sounds of birds, cattle, and the soft breeze would suddenly be filled with a sound so loud and powerful that the earth beneath your feet would reverberate and shake as though it was an earthquake and every window for miles would rattle and on occasion shatter from the violence of a single firing rocket. Watching those from out of town become wide eyed and panicked at the unexpected shattering of the peace was practically a local pastime. I can recall many a time while fishing on the backwaters and swamps of the river with my dad watching the surface of the water turn from that of glass to something akin to boiling water as the vibrations from the rockets moved across the creek. So even if you had no interest in the space program, you certainly could never forget it's existence while growing up in the valley I call home.
    That constant reminder only further fueled my obsession with all things space and space travel, and combined with many school field trips and Boy Scout outings into Huntsville to visit the incredible Space & Rocket Center made for many nights lying on my back staring far into the easily visible center of our Milky Way galaxy thanks to little to virtually zero light pollution pondering not only the many wonders of human space travel but also my place within this magnificent universe. 
  Why do I wax poetically about my life in the shadow of giant rockets in this game review? Because playing Kerbal Space Program stirs those exact same feelings of wonderment and excitement in me as those rockets shaking the ground beneath my feet as a child did. If you have even a passing interest in space, astronomy, space flight, space programs, or rocketry, then do yourself the favor of getting Kerbal Space Program now, you will not regret the purchase and will chastise yourself for not getting it sooner. It's a disservice to call KSP a game or even a simulator, it's so much more than both, it's an incredible experience that has enriched my life and i'm a better person for having it.

So, first and foremost, at 2057 hours, I started my first career because I got bored of sandbox gameplay. It took me that long to make my first career, but that's fine. Anyways, the aspects of the game are significant. Everything about it is fantastic, and the mods make it even better. I have about 35 gigs worth of mods installed, and the visual enhancements are excellent. Get this game before the second one is out on full release and get visual enhancements; you will get the same promised experience. Also, get interstellar extended and galaxies unbound to get interstellar stars. As a warning, the more mods, the longer the initial load time. It takes about 15 minutes to get past the initial loading. The game is very memory and CPU bound, so you must have a good CPU and loads of memory to get a good experience.

All jokes aside, it has a steep learning curve if you know nothing about space and orbital mechanics, but it's so worth it to learn (been there myself). 2k+ hours in and i just started an another (modded) career.

After the initial playthrough, the modding is what hooked me in - you can customize SO MUCH, once you get familiar with the mechanics. I started to look into realism mods, which led me down a rabbit hole into life support and colonization mods, which i ofc knew nothing about, and it made me realize...space is f****** hard!

This opulent voyage into the cosmos unexpectedly unveiled an intricate tapestry of personal growth and unparalleled achievements. The enigmatic allure of this spacefaring symphony not only revitalized the fractured bonds of my familial relationships but also precipitated a seismic shift in my lifestyle. Through diligent engagement with the intricacies of orbital dynamics and celestial navigation, I discovered an unforeseen predilection for discipline and perseverance, culminating in a newfound commitment to physical wellness. The game, akin to an astute mentor, subtly directed me towards the hallowed halls of the gymnasium, fostering an indomitable synergy between mind and body. Emboldened by the lessons learned amidst the celestial tableau, I embarked upon an entrepreneurial odyssey of my own, scribing the prologue of a nascent startup. The analytical acumen honed in Kerbal Space Program transmogrified into the cornerstone of this venture's success. Henceforth, the pursuit of innovation became a cherished vocation, driven by the spirit of audacious exploration. As the fruits of entrepreneurial toil ripened, I found myself in possession of the dream car that once adorned my youthful fantasies, its chromatic sheen emblematic of the tenacity cultivated through Kerbal's cosmic rigors. A domicile of architectural magnificence soon graced my horizon, an abode that bore witness to my burgeoning accomplishments. In a serendipitous twist of fate, the cosmos continued to conspire in my favor. Guided by newfound confidence and wisdom, I encountered a muse whose ethereal beauty transcended the celestial heavens themselves. Our union, born of mutual admiration and a shared zest for life's most profound mysteries, culminated in a joyous marriage that shall forever resonate as an apotheosis of love's cosmic alignment. In summation, Kerbal Space Program is not merely a game; it is an indelible catalyst for transformation. Through its intricate orbit, I emerged from the cocoon of mediocrity, soaring among the stars of personal accomplishment, each celestial body a testament to the journey it inspired. It is a celestial symphony of self-realization, a nebulous wellspring of boundless potential, and an odyssey into the sublime that has reshaped the very fabric of my existence.",1694618114,1694618114,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

THEN you experience ""the Kraken"" - the community lovingly refers to game breaking glitches as the Kraken - I guess everyone deals with frustration in their own way and this community seems to make light of this HUGE gameplay issue.  Maybe there are many others super disappointed in this game - but the reviews don't seem to suggest so.

I think this help give you a real appreciation on what it takes for our current earth based programs.  I am really excited to see what 1.1 brings to the game with even better game play and physics.

You can get your monies worth and more from this even without mods. KSP 1 is definitely the version to buy if your not afraid of mods as well.

This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died.

I purchased this game for $10 on the last sale and had I known how awesome it would be, I probably would have paid full price. I’ve always heard that games could make learning fun, but this is the first time a game has educated me so much on real-life science and physics without feeling like an “educational” game in the slightest.

And it’s all thanks to the Kerbals. Some refer to them as “space frogs”: these are the lovable denizens of the planet Kerbin. The Kerbals and their entire space program are presented as something born out of pure persistence. They only have two stats: Courage and Stupidity, and yet with these and the will and drive to see beyond the skies, the Kerbals (and by extension, you) somehow manage to get up into space, then up into orbit, and then to the Mun beyond. The whacky music, silly dialogue in the tutorials, and funny descriptions of the rocket parts will keep all this science nonsense feeling lighthearted and breezy the whole way through. That, and Jebidiah’s big brave grin.

Now everyone always talks about how realistic and crazy the orbital mechanics in this game are. And, yes, that’s all true. I was blown away when the tutorial immediately started throwing words like “Retrograde” and “Periapsis” at me, with no idea what these things meant. I immediately got the impression that even though it treats the Kerbals like idiots, the game won't necessarily treat you like one. And that can be a little scary at first, but if you get through the getting-to and escaping-from the Mun tutorials, it’ll feel SO rewarding.

But another thing I want to touch on is the rocket building itself, because I feel like not enough people mention that part. I can’t remember the last game I played where I felt I was building a real contraption, and I actually had to THINK about everything that went in it. You can have a crazy idea and make it come to life, but you still must consider stuff like drag, thrust-to-weight, center-of-mass, and so on. Does your rocket have enough power to get to where you need to go? Does it have enough fuel? (Oh, dear God, we forgot the parachutes) Once you get the hang of getting to orbit, every mission will consist of you planning out these missions and building each part of the plan from top to bottom. There’s nothing quite like building a huge 8-stage monstrosity that you plan on sending out to Duna and back and having it all come together.

Now it’s not all roses. For one, the physics can sometimes be whacky. Trips beyond Kerbin’s moons can take years in game, and those years would take many, many hours in real-time. The game lets you fast-forward time, but weird things can happen when you do. The community refers to this and all kinds of random physics bugs as “kraken attacks”, and I’ve seen my fair share. This just means you’ll be quick-saving a LOT if you don’t want to deal with a significant amount of frustration.

Also, the career mode (which has you gathering science and managing funds) can feel very tedious at times. Contracts can range from super easy and boring to wildly difficult and borderline unfair. For some, the contracts encourage landing your Kerbals on Eve early on, and Eve has been said by some to be the “final boss” of KSP due to its super thick atmosphere and heavy gravity. There were a lot of weird decisions made in the career mode, and it can feel tedious to “finish” it. Still, I did, and I’m extremely proud of it (but only on Normal difficulty, and I don’t really want to start all over).

Now one major bugbear of this game is that it’s hideous to look at. I’ve always said it was easy to make space games look easy, and this game feels like it wants me to eat those words. The graphics sometimes look like they came straight out of a Playstation 1. Luckily, there are plenty of mods to make the game look and sound better. Highly recommend downloading CKAN and getting yourselves some of the usually recommended mods. With all the mods I have, the game looks and sounds great (but also, thankfully, my PC can handle it).

As for replay value, I’m not sure how replayable it is. I’ve seen plenty of people playing KSP for years, but I got 150 hours in, and after completing the career mode I’ve slowed down quite a bit. It’s a real shame this game doesn’t have achievements. The game does have missions to play, but I haven’t really dug too deep into them.

I was expecting to learn about space while playing this game. I was not expecting to fall in love with this game so deeply. All I could think about while I was at work was KSP and how I’m going to build my next rocket. Now I watch rocket launches from SpaceX and understand almost everything they’re talking about, and I think it’s incredible. I didn’t just get a good wealth of knowledge from this game, or a fantastic gameplay experience. I got both.

I can recommend this game to people with time, patience and a degree in STEM but I can not recommend this to simple folk like myself, and I usually have patience to learn things in games, I would say ""simulation"" games have never been my strong point, I play pc games to get away from realism.
I am no ""rocket"" scientist, I struggled just trying to understand the 0.2 pressure for the parachute in the very first tutorial.
Controls / keybinds in just about any game is usually a headache for me and the one thing I change is invert mouse, and there is like 50 bloody settings for invert mouse..which one!!

I could have quite literally spent 3 hours trying to configure keybinds / mouse invert etc but the game wont let me even do that, I have to jump right out, change things hoping its the right thing and restart the tutorial...

Kerbal Space Program is an absolute masterpiece that brings the joy of space exploration and engineering to the gaming world like no other. Developed by Squad, this game has garnered a dedicated fanbase and critical acclaim since its release, and for good reason. Kerbal Space Program offers an unparalleled sandbox experience that encourages players to embrace their inner rocket scientist, embark on awe-inspiring journeys, and celebrate the triumphs of exploration.

Unleash Your Inner Engineer:
One of the most remarkable aspects of Kerbal Space Program is its emphasis on real-world physics and engineering principles. Players are tasked with constructing rockets and spacecraft from the ground up, considering factors like thrust, mass, aerodynamics, and more. This level of detail might sound intimidating, but the game provides an intuitive and rewarding learning curve that helps players grasp these concepts and ultimately feel like true engineers.

Boundless Creativity:
Kerbal Space Program thrives on the boundless creativity it offers players. Whether you're attempting your first suborbital flight or planning an intricate interplanetary mission, the game provides an expansive toolkit of parts, engines, and systems to play with. The sense of accomplishment when you launch a custom-built craft and witness it soar into the heavens is unlike anything else. Every failed attempt is an opportunity to learn, iterate, and improve, fostering an addictive loop of experimentation and success.

Epic Space Exploration:
The game's solar system is a playground of celestial wonders waiting to be explored. From the desolate beauty of the Mun to the distant gas giants, each planet and moon presents its own set of challenges and rewards. Crafting a mission plan, executing gravity assists, and navigating complex orbital mechanics add layers of depth to the gameplay that keep players engaged for hours on end. The sense of wonder that accompanies reaching a new celestial body is truly exhilarating and makes the journey itself as fulfilling as the destination.

Community and Modding:
Kerbal Space Program's vibrant modding community is a testament to its enduring appeal. Thousands of user-generated mods enhance every facet of the game, from adding new parts and features to tweaking realism and visuals. This extends the game's lifespan indefinitely, as players continue to find fresh ways to explore and create. The game's community-driven content cements its status as a game that keeps giving back, encouraging players to share their successes, failures, and discoveries with a like-minded global community.

Educational Value:
Beyond its gaming merits, Kerbal Space Program doubles as an educational tool that effortlessly imparts a wealth of knowledge about space, physics, and engineering. The game turns complex scientific concepts into hands-on experiences, making learning fun and accessible. Players are bound to gain a newfound appreciation for the challenges of space travel and a deeper understanding of the universe we inhabit.

Conclusion:
Kerbal Space Program is a true triumph in the world of gaming, offering an unmatched blend of creative freedom, scientific education, and space exploration. Its ability to inspire players to explore, experiment, and overcome challenges is a testament to its remarkable design. Whether you're a space enthusiast, an aspiring engineer, or simply someone seeking a unique and rewarding gaming experience, Kerbal Space Program is an absolute must-play that will keep you enthralled for countless hours.

One of the best sandbox games ever - you get to play with actual(-ish) physics, design your rockets, figure out why nobody likes physics when your rockets explode, rinse and repeat. Game sticks to a simple feedback loop of design-fly-fail what works remarkably well for figuring out what you still don't know. Learning curve past very basics can be steep - depending what you find enjoyable, you might spend more time doing math than actually playing the game... or send little green men to their inevitable doom.

Mods are a must - they make game look better (scatterer), work better (aerodynamics mods) and play better (various QoL). Game is somewhat lacking in more nuanced aspects like life support or part failures - it makes core part (building and flying space vessels) more approachable, but removes some fun constraints those systems create. Find a set of mods you enjoy.

Boy, was I wrong. It took me a whole day to successfully launch a rocket to space, after watching several tutorials I understood I could make anything in the game. But that also meant I could make anything explode, crash, or get lost in the vastness of space.

The game is very realistic and challenging. You have to deal with gravity, aerodynamics, fuel consumption, orbital mechanics, and more. You also have to manage your crew of adorable green aliens called Kerbals, who have a knack for getting into trouble. Sometimes they will scream in terror as their rocket falls apart. Sometimes they will smile and wave as they drift away into the void. Sometimes they will do both at the same time.

The game is also very rewarding and fun. You can create amazing vehicles and missions, and explore a solar system full of planets and moons. You can land on the Mun, the game's version of the Moon. You can send probes to other worlds and discover secrets and anomalies. You can dock with space stations and rendezvous with asteroids. You can even build bases and colonies on other planets.

The game has a lot of content and replay value. You can play in different modes, such as sandbox, science, or career. You can also download mods and custom parts from the community, which add even more features and possibilities to the game. You can also share your creations and stories with other players online.

Kerbal Space Program is a game that will teach you a lot about science, engineering, and space exploration. It will also make you laugh a lot at your own failures and successes. It's a game that will inspire you to dream big and reach for the stars.

I give this game 5 out of 5 stars. It's one of the best games I've ever played. If you love space, rockets, or Kerbals, you should definitely buy this game.",1690292152,1690292152,True,18,1,0.639468491077423096,1,True,False,False

Yes its enjoyable, yes you have to run through the first few tutorials.
Yes the game is missing substantial information to actually do the Job like a real engineer/astronaut.

the only test is a real test, no computer screens to look at at possible arcs of altitude advancement. 
When you click launch to test your craft from the pad they take you (into another instance) ...into what seems like a separate server around the world from you, upload all the parts, a minute, so slow.

Great I like waiting, launch should be instant it is not. It is like they recreated the hour it takes for the vehicle to make it to the launch pad.....

Career mode takes too long, be prepared to understand what the word grind means.

So to sum up, consider what the word grind means, digest it, roll it around on the tongue a few times, then be prepared to spend your entire life grinding. There is no stroking of ego in this game, it is literally, you failed 100 times now you earn the next piece, ad infinitum until you get all the tech.

Slow is the other way of looking at this game, be prepared to learn and the tutorials are badly integrated with career mode, a tutorial will say this is easy do this, in career mode, it would take you 50-100 hours just to get the tech to get a stable orbit and the tutorial doesn't even show you the ship they used to get to orbit, they just place a ship in orbit already...

Can I recommend, not really, it misses so much of what is required to be an engineer/astronaut to get to space. So they instead delayed your progress with grind.

Even a simple read out of how high should this rocket combination get in altitude would be nice. No, you get no information, you just have to test and save each ship design. No indication of where to go to get intel, you test until you get some, then you go somewhere else and get it, but the scientists do not say we need this or this. It is stupid.

Minimum the scientists should identify where they need science reports from.

1 pound boneless skinless chicken thighs
1 teaspoon garlic powder
½ teaspoon onion powder
½ teaspoon cumin
½ teaspoon smoked paprika
½ teaspoon chili powder
½ teaspoon salt
½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
Juice of 2 limes
1 tablespoon olive oil
Topping:

⅓ cup finely chopped red or sweet onion
⅓ cup finely chopped cilantro
1 finely chopped jalapeño
Juice of 1 lime
Salt and pepper, to taste
1 lime, cut into 8 pieces
16 small corn tortillas for serving

Instructions:
In a large zipper-topped plastic baggie or in shallow dish, add the chicken, all of the spices, lime juice, and oil. Close the bag and use your hands to mix everything together. If you are using a shallow dish, use tongs to work the spices evenly into the chicken. You can let this rest for up to a half-hour or work with it right away. I like to let it rest a minute to increase the flavor.
Heat a large skillet over medium to medium-high heat. When the skillet is hot, add a tablespoon of oil to the pan and then add the chicken. Cook for 12 to 14 minutes, turning once, until the chicken is cooked through. Remove the chicken from the pan and let it rest for 10 minutes. If you have an extra-large chicken thigh, you'll need to cook them longer, so turn down the heat to medium and cook them until no longer pink (could take up to 25 minutes or 12 minutes per side).
While the chicken cooks, stir together the chicken taco topping by placing the chopped onion, cilantro, jalapeño, and the juice of one lime in a small bowl. Add salt and pepper, and stir to combine.
While the chicken rests, wipe your skillet clean with a warm rag or paper towels, and place the skillet back on the heat over medium-high to high heat. Place two tortillas (still stacked together) on the skillet and cook until the underside starts to char. Flip over and cook the other side (so the middle of each tortilla won't be cooked against the skillet but it will get warm all the way though). Repeat with remaining tortillas.
Chop the rested chicken into bite-sized pieces.
To serve, place ⅛ of the chopped chicken in each set of tortillas (still two stacked together) and top with ⅛ of your onion mixture. Serve each taco with a wedge of lime to squeeze over the taco just before serving.

It is also pretty complicated and the game mechanics are difficult to understand, its almost like you need to be a real astronaut to understand this lmao.

The game actually does have a story/campaign mode, but I never bother with that, I like to play sandbox and just make stuff and fly/drive it.

This game will teach you more about orbital mechanics and give you a better intuition than reading textbooks, methinks.

Rocket science isn't that hard, after all.

THE CHRISTIAN PERSPECTIVE

This game does not, insofar as I know, portray blasphemy, murder, idolatry, or any other sin. I know of no explicit portrayals of sin, let alone exalting of it.

I think some of the information screens give an evolutionary explanation for the kerbals' origins and history. The game has evolution-based lore. Evolution is just as fictional as the kerbals are, so I guess it's fine that they used that as an explanation. 

Nevertheless, it's certainly a vocal support of the pseudoscience of our era (the idea that living things are the result of tiny changes over vast eons of unseen time and that the earth and stars are similarly the result of ongoing natural processes) being put right next to real observational science which can be tested and measured (how objects move in space, planets, astronomy, etcetera). 

This ultimately aids in the ideological war being waged by the western atheists to confuse the definition of science (1984 newspeak style) to include their nonsense.

If you are a christian, though, you already know about this war and you know the true history of the world. You are immune. The game's lore isn't why people play this game anyway. It'd be the same game if it had no lore at all.

If your child knows how to think critically and understands the war in our culture going on, which every child should be taught very early on (Remember kids: the disciples saw, felt, and touched Jesus after he rose from the dead, but nobody has ever seen millions of years) then this game's lore is not going to be an issue.

It's a tiny polka dot flaw on an otherwise fantastic game.

I was really happy about this and went on designing more rockets, stations, and planes. sadly after nearly 600 hours I only really made it to another Planet once, it was jool. I wish I had gone to more planets but I didn't. but with ksp 2 here I want to expand to all of the planets like Duna and Eve.

I watched man land on the moon just weeks before my 2nd birthday, and had a lunar lander on my cake that year. Sadly, that dream never went anywhere. But this game might just be the next best thing. 

Don't get me wrong. This is NOT Call of Duty or Tomb Raider or Final Fantasy whatever. It's not even Mass Effect ... This game is HARD.  It is frustrating. It has an amazingly steep learning curve. It can leave you shaking, or wanting to scream. 

But it is hands down the best game I have ever played.  I am 55, and I have played literally THOUSANDS of games in just about every genre. I have felt terror, when a screaming woman knocked me (literally) out of my chair at 2 am playing DOOM 3 in the dark. I have felt the thrill of taking the checkered flag in Gran Turismo.  Aggression made my blood pound as I give a brutal check in NHL18. But never ... and I mean, NEVER, have I felt a sense of accomplishment, actual accomplishment, while playing a video game. 

This game does that. 

The first time I got a jet I built to fly was a thrill, but landing it left a feeling of accomplishment. 
Launching into orbit is fun, and even challenging. But completing a successful Holman Transfer Maneuver and setting up a stable orbit around the Mun? Man. I am bloody Neil Armstrong! 

Don't be sissy. The game is more than worth it. And there are not only a boatload of tutorials online for, well, everything Kerbal, but there is also a thriving mod community who have pushed the game WAY beyond it's boundaries in terms of content and graphics improvements.

Don't be afraid. There are hundreds of tutorials on YouTube for anything you might need help with, from rocket/plane designs to orbital mechanics and transfer orbits.  And I am unabashedly willing to admit I use them.

All you need is a copy of the game, and some time to realize you're already addicted, you just don't know it yet  ;)",1686460032,1686460032,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

So the original developer studio that developed this game got poached, no doubt it was an IP grab without a care for this game. KSP2 is a poorly optimized, clunky mess. It's sad, because the original team definitely could've delivered results with all the experience they gathered.

KSP2 only has better graphics. Oh but also a new engine! And yet it matters not as of now, the strongest of rigs tank in performance once you build vehicle with ""too many"" components. But too many compared to this game is a joke.

This game on the other hand runs reasonably well and is stable, there's plenty of content, the game-play is fun and it's charming, the learning curve is a bit steep but there's PLENTY of guides and videos, so you'll be fine. It's educational and it works.

The physics suck. Don't defend it; it's terrible. Spaceships will sometimes just flop over during flight, even though you built it with snap-to symmetry. You just have to accept that, for whatever reason, the game doesn't want you to fly a spaceship that day -- because come back another time and the very same spaceship designs that were pinwheeling all day, will suddenly work JUST FINE, while the stock ships all start behaving like a pigeon in a tornado.

The gameplay modes all suck. The sandbox mode loses its appeal in a matter of two hours, and the career mode is a slog of depressing proportions. The science mode is supposed to be like a lite version of career mode, but removing the money and micromanagement doesn't improve the game because you're still left with the terrible flight control.

The research tree is the true dealbreaker. Imagine putting a dozen hours into a save file (or more in some cases, depending how involved you get in the building process), launching ships, doing science, landing, collecting points, and researching... only to find that you have researched yourself into a corner, unable to reach new parts of the solar system, and unable to do new science things to collect points for more unlocks.

Imagine if a story-driven game did that, blocking your progress and bricking your save file by letting you spend your skill points in a way that prevents you from winning any more gameplay sequences. You would call it Refund of the Year.

I'm glad this game only wasted ten bucks.

Performance:
While some people were botherered by performance issues,I want to say that
this game has an fps score high as 67 on an Nvidia GT 750 and an intel i5 seventh generation chip.
For those who have low performance on their computer,try these things:
1.Change your graphics card or CPU.
2.Make sure that no other applications are running(upset for STEAM!)
Useless#3.Use ""Hyper Boost""(Even your fps changes rapidly)(Intel Deep Link)
4.Lower your graphics setting.
Gameplay:
Aw this game is so great!!!!!
But it doesn't have enouth parts
Realeases your creativity(I create things that kills Jeb)
Music:
Maybe this can improve.
I wish ksp2 music can be added to ksp 1.
Graphics:
You don't have to care about it.
It's a little ""oilly"",maybe we can make it better by adding mods such as Parallex.
Realism:
1.Every liquid fuel engine uses the same oxidizer+fuel.This is unrealistic:
1.1MAYBE Jet engines uses methane(based on the flame's color)
1.2Monopuff uses Aerozine50.
1.3Maybe Realiant uses toxic fuel.
1.4IDK,but realism overhaul makes it better.
2.Planets:
All the planets have ridiculous density and size.
Kerbin's oceans are made of Neutron Star Material.
The entire system breaks when running a simulation for a few years!
Jool should have a lot of moonlets orbiting around it,yet we seldomly sees them.
Overall:
Full score: 8/10 aditional 2/5.Aditional star 1,easy!ADITIONAL STAR 2:ADORABLE KERBALS!

It was planned to launch on February 21, 1967, as the first low Earth orbital test of the Apollo command and service module. The mission never flew; a cabin fire during a launch rehearsal test at Cape Kennedy Air Force Station Launch Complex 34 on January 27 killed all three crew members—Command Pilot Gus Grissom, Senior Pilot Ed White, and Pilot Roger B. Chaffee—and destroyed the command module. The name Apollo 1, chosen by the crew, was made official by NASA in their honor after the fire.

Immediately after the fire, NASA convened an Accident Review Board to determine the cause of the fire, and both chambers of the United States Congress conducted their own committee inquiries to oversee NASA's investigation. The ignition source of the fire was determined to be electrical, and the fire spread rapidly due to combustible nylon material and the high-pressure pure oxygen cabin atmosphere. Rescue was prevented by the plug door hatch, which could not be opened against the internal pressure of the cabin. Because the rocket was unfueled, the test had not been considered hazardous, and emergency preparedness for it was poor.

During the Congressional investigation, Senator Walter Mondale publicly revealed a NASA internal document citing problems with prime Apollo contractor North American Aviation, which became known as the Phillips Report. This disclosure embarrassed NASA Administrator James E. Webb, who was unaware of the document's existence, and attracted controversy to the Apollo program. Despite congressional displeasure at NASA's lack of openness, both congressional committees ruled that the issues raised in the report had no bearing on the accident.

Crewed Apollo flights were suspended for twenty months while the command module's hazards were addressed. However, the development and uncrewed testing of the lunar module and Saturn V rocket continued. The Saturn IB launch vehicle for Apollo 1, SA-204, was used for the first test flight, Apollo 5. The first successful crewed Apollo mission was flown by Apollo 1's backup crew on Apollo 7 in October 1968.",1685756752,1685756845,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The bugs in Kerbal Space Program are so obvious that it's hard to imagine the developers not knowing about them. For example, if you are landed on the Mun and you use move mode to move a part on your ship, you can't get back to build mode because when you mouse over the build mode button, another menu item un-hides and drops down over top of the build mode button, so you can't push the button. It looks like the play testers just switched to using the hotkeys, problem solved, right? But when a new player starts playing the game they don't know the hotkeys so they're stuck.

Another example is the maneuver nodes, they keep just randomly disappearing in the middle of setting the maneuver and you have to click the little X to make it come back. Then because the handles are so close together you inevitably grab the wrong one and screw up the settings so you have to start over, then it disappears again. This is something you have to do A LOT so it gets really freaking annoying really freaking quick when this happens every time.

Maybe the worst bug is that when you rendezvous in orbit and try to switch from one craft to another, the icon for the craft you are already in is in the way of the one you want to switch to and so you can't select it. Again you have to do this A LOT so it's incredible to me that they didn't bother to fix such an annoying and obvious bug after 8 YEARS. You have to go to the tracking station to switch craft and that causes 2 load screens that are so loooooong that it is actually easier to find the 1-pixel-wide point on the edge of the current ship icon where (if you hold your tongue just right) you might be able to get the other ship icon to intermittently appear and if your timing is perfect you may get the option to ""switch to"" after only a few dozen tries.

There are plenty more bugs but I have limited space so I only mentioned the most annoying ones. You probably won't enjoy when your apoapsis number suddenly and inexplicably goes negative and breaks the law of physics either. 

The result of all these bugs, is that Kerbal Space Program causes far more frustration and annoyance than fun, which is a shame because there are some fun elements to the game, if the interface would just do what it is told.

In my opinion, these ""permanent"" bugs are an obvious sign of a lazy development team. They found workarounds instead of fixing the bugs, ignoring the frustration this would cause new players who had not yet discovered the workarounds. There is really no excuse as they've had over 8 years to fix this mess but apparently they chose not to.

I will not be buying KSP 2 or any other title from this developer for the above reasons.",1685634876,1685634876,False,2,1,0.478435724973678589,2,True,False,False

[u]Creators and Tinkerers Will Love This Game[/u]

[b]The Good[/b] – Creation process, humor, different modes, Physics, construction interface, Accessible

[b]The Not so Good[/b] – Graphics, Learning curve, Grind 

[u]Bottom Line[/u] – A truly well-executed, original idea which carved out its own little niche in the gaming community from scratch. Fun, funny, unique, and addictive sandbox with nearly endless possibilities, with something new to explore always right around the corner.

I am not a rocket scientist. If this wasn’t infinitely clear to me when I sat down to play KSP the first time, it became much clearer quickly. My first failure wasn’t spectacular or explosive – It just never left the launch pad. And it wasn’t for lack of trying, either. It was really straining! I also must be the world’s absolute worst about playing a game for only a few minutes or a few hours and then giving up on that game because I “Don’t get it.” It’s at this point games typically end up in my backlog and rarely get played again.
The thing is, after my boring, vanilla rocket failure, I didn’t just chuck the “baby with the bathwater.” I went back to the drawing board and tried again (I think that one exploded) and again (Ran out of fuel) and again (bounced off the atmosphere at reentry). With each try, I honed my skill and learned a little more about the rules of this new star system I’d begun to explore. Learning this way rarely felt like a chore, as it sometimes does with repeated failures in a game, but instead was part of the adventure itself and was, actually, surprisingly fun. There were some missions during which I felt like I’d never get the hang of it, and others I was genuinely frustrated. But everything worth doing has these setbacks sometimes. KSP is absolutely a game worth learning.
I don’t normally do this, but I’ll start with the things about the game that could potentially use improvement because I think the good FAR outweighs the not-so-good. At the top of that list is the graphics. They’re not bad, but they are showing their age. Remember KSP became available for the first time in 2011, so this is to be expected. They’re not bad, but they’re not Elite Dangerous or RDR2. You can probably tell by my first KSP stories that the learning curve in-game is significant. It will probably take you a couple hours to learn the necessary skills to get your crew to the Mun the first time, and maybe more to get safely landed on it and back home. This can feel like a grind sometimes, but that feeling does pass if you give it a chance to.
The really great thing about Kerbal Space Program is that the limit of what you can build and the places you can go depend on you. Just like our own history, the voyage to the moon is just the beginning. There are other astral bodies out there to explore as well. The first step to exploring each of those is to build the right hardware, and the build process itself is fun. Depending on the mode you select for your game, you either start out with every part possible right off the bat (sandbox), or you begin with limited parts and have to earn, research and purchase the others over time (career). If you choose career mode, you can do a good deal with the parts you accumulate as the result of research, but it can take a while before you can “build anything you can imagine.” Eventually, you’ll get there. Just keep plugging away.  In sandbox, the heavens are the limit. You’ll have every part on your first build. I would recommend career mode just for the added structure and tutorial, but that’s going to be about your preference. The humor in the game is a nice diversion from the intensity of your mission/design cadence. If you’re in career mode, plug into these mini-laughs by accepting missions from your mission control building. Those same missions will advance your exploration career if you are in career mode.
The game does manage to make the design/build process a lot of fun. So much fun that just writing this has me wanting to go back and play KSP again. Because the process is fun, it’s very accessible and it’s easy to learn your next step. The build interface is intuitive enough that you can really sit down and start slapping things together right away. Above all of these, I think I like the orbital mechanics best. The physics are really cool. They’re unforgiving, sometimes brutal, and potentially the cause of costly mistakes, but getting to use Kerbal’s gravity to bring your capsule back in from a long journey and see it splash-down safely is almost always an exhilarating experience. You’ll love to slingshot around Mun to travel to Minimus at just the right elevation to avoid the surface while getting as much energy as possible. You may not be a physics nerd like me, but you’ll find something about KSP to love if you give it a try.

Day 1: This is Bill Kerman, I have landed safely on the moon and have lost all contact with HQ. My morale is wavering and I'm scared for what's to come, I haven't eaten in hours and I'm completely shaken. The moon is only dark and cold with no air to breathe. HQ please respond! 

Day 2: The moon is only dark and the vessel has kept me warm through hours of rest. I'm starting to get used to this strange environment but I fear there is no air breathable here. I'm also starting to hear strange noises around the vessel that give me chills every time it get louder. This silence is deafening and I have never felt more alone in my life. I'm going to try and make a radio signal to contact HQ again but I'm becoming concerned as their communications has me on edge; there's no noise coming through to tell me what's happening to HQ. 

Day 3: The screams of the dammed are faint but constant.

Day 4: I see a rescue vessel! HQ has not forgotten me! I'm the luckiest man alive right now! I will survive this ordeal and return to my planet. Thank you HQ for all your support, you have saved my life today.

Day 5: I have witnessed the most horrendous thing I have ever seen with my own eyes. Jebediah Kerman, the man I have trained within the training center and the man I am proud to call my hero, has been mysteriously killed by sinking into the moon's soil moments before reaching my vessel. He unexpectedly sped up and accelerated deeply into the soil just seconds after saying ""Why am I so slow?"" What on Kerban happened? I don't know and neither does HQ. 

Day 7: HQ has sent 3 vessels to attempt to rescue me but all three have resulted in the death of seven Kerbals. The first vessel was the death of Jebediah Kerman, the second vessel crashed by Valetina and the third vessel was some new recruits that crashed in moons orbit. I have sent my last message to HQ informing them to just leave me here, I just don't want any Kerbals to die!

Day 8: The noises are getting worse, someone is screaming in the distance and I can't make out what they are saying.. It's terrifying! Where are they coming from?! I will run out of food soon. The screams of the dammed are faint but constant.",1456798054,1684608372,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Ingredients:
- 1 (2-pound) beef tenderloin
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper
- 2 tablespoons Dijon mustard
- 1/2 pound mushrooms, finely chopped
- 1/4 cup chopped shallots
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 1/4 cup dry white wine
- 1/4 cup beef broth
- 1 tablespoon chopped fresh thyme leaves
- 1 sheet puff pastry, thawed
- 1 large egg, lightly beaten

Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F.
2. Season the beef tenderloin with salt and pepper.
3. Heat a large skillet over high heat. Add the beef and sear on all sides until browned, about 2 minutes per side. Remove from the skillet and let cool.
4. Spread the Dijon mustard over the cooled beef tenderloin.
5. In the same skillet, melt the butter over medium-high heat. Add the mushrooms, shallots, and garlic and cook until the mushrooms are browned and the liquid has evaporated, about 10 minutes.
6. Add the white wine, beef broth, and thyme to the skillet and cook until the liquid has reduced by half, about 5 minutes.
7. Remove the skillet from the heat and let the mushroom mixture cool.
8. On a lightly floured surface, roll out the puff pastry to a thickness of 1/4 inch.
9. Spread the mushroom mixture over the puff pastry.
10. Place the beef tenderloin on top of the mushroom mixture.
11. Wrap the puff pastry around the beef tenderloin, making sure to seal the edges.
12. Brush the beaten egg over the top of the puff pastry.
13. Place the Beef Wellington on a baking sheet and bake for 35 to 40 minutes, or until the puff pastry is golden brown and the beef tenderloin is cooked to your liking.
14. Let the Beef Wellington rest for 10 minutes before slicing and serving",1684407858,1684407858,True,4,0,0.558394193649291992,0,True,False,False

[b]Kerbal Space Program[/b] is the perfect game for those who are tired of being lied to by NASA and the mainstream media. Finally, you can expose the truth for yourself and embark on a mission to the moon with your own spacecraft.

With this game, you'll get to experience what it's like to be a real astronaut, without all the annoying requirements of actually being one. Build your own rockets, test your designs, and launch them into the great unknown. Who knows what you'll find up there, but one thing's for sure: it won't be what they tell you it is.

The game's realistic physics and challenging gameplay will keep you hooked for hours, as you strive to uncover the secrets of space and the universe. And don't worry, you'll have plenty of time to think about the mysteries of the cosmos as you watch your crew slowly suffocate in the cold vacuum of space.

So what are you waiting for? Strap in, launch into orbit, and discover what's really on the far side of the moon. Because in this NASA Simulator, the only thing you can trust is your own wits and determination.

But if you want more detailed review, there it is:
The graphics are a main point in every game i play, for this one, I absolutly LOVE the graphics, even if they are not some top tier kind of thing they are REALLY GOOD and have a lot to give for all planets, effects and overall.
Now for why we REALLY BUY the game is the building, planets and gameplay, first there is a wide veriaty of planets and moons which I really like, the building is flexible and has a lot to give and the EVA, physics, and more are basically one of the best things I've did in a game.
And for extra, I think almost everyone knows how much this game is compatible with mods, I mean there is even a link to mods in the lobby (AKA starter screen) which is amazing for people who like enchancements.

It is a meticulously detailed space simulator, and while it doesn't necessarily have any story guiding your hand, it is still quite fun to explore or work up your space program in Career mode if that's your jam. There are some quirks with the game that can be frustrating at times, although some of these can be fixed (If you're not using Autostruts with Advanced Tweakables enabled, you should be). This game has a lot of exploring to do already, but the modding community takes it to another level. You can mod this game until it breaks, and the modding community has come up with everything conceivable from hyper-realism to sillyness. I'm currently using an upscaled planet pack, N-body orbital mechanics, and life support / general systems overhaul mods (JNSQ, Principia, and Kerbalism in particular) among many others, and I've modded KSP into almost a new game many times over the years.

The only thing I don't like about the game is the DLC pricing. It's a bit steep, but you can get the complete edition on sale for less than $30, and it's easily worth that price if its up your alley.

Basically its a sandbox solar system simulation with no story but rather different game modes. The career mode helps to provide direction at first and is the most educational for space novices. However, soon after that, its all up to you what you want to do. Career missions are optional, though will help motivate you to push further and further. Or you can just do whatever you want in the default sandbox mode with all the technology unlocked. The game is highly technical and doesnt hold your hand. There are various tutorials and scenarios that can help, but be prepared for a learning curve (though at your own pace). 
The physics aren't perfect, and distances between objects in the games simulated mini solar system is tiny compared to reality, but its still massive, with plenty to do. There are mods to make it more accurate and realistic (scale and detail wise), or to make it easier. Its completely up to the player.
As someone who has always been a casual sci-fi fan and earthbound spaceman my whole life, I think KSP has single-handedly taught me more about how space travel works then school, and books, movies, documentaries, etc. combined. And also given me a far greater appreciation for the efforts of early space pioneers as well as the current space programs and companies.
By doing things practically, you get to see and perform a lot of stuff that may otherwise just be concepts on paper and screen. Personally it has given me a far better fundamental understanding, particularly and especially when it comes to ""orbits"", but in many other ways. (Most of the time I enjoy just making ground vehicles, planes, drones, SSTOs, etc, and testing them out).
I could go on about all the ways I enjoy KSP, but in a nutshell, it's just an awesome game, and I honestly have so few criticisms that they seem irrelevant. I would happily give it 10/10, and I'm looking forward to playing KSP2!",1558366254,1683124515,True,140,4,0.894107639789581299,0,True,False,False

Ingredients:
- 1 (2-pound) beef tenderloin
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper
- 2 tablespoons Dijon mustard
- 1/2 pound mushrooms, finely chopped
- 1/4 cup chopped shallots
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 1/4 cup dry white wine
- 1/4 cup beef broth
- 1 tablespoon chopped fresh thyme leaves
- 1 sheet puff pastry, thawed
- 1 large egg, lightly beaten

Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F.
2. Season the beef tenderloin with salt and pepper.
3. Heat a large skillet over high heat. Add the beef and sear on all sides until browned, about 2 minutes per side. Remove from the skillet and let cool.
4. Spread the Dijon mustard over the cooled beef tenderloin.
5. In the same skillet, melt the butter over medium-high heat. Add the mushrooms, shallots, and garlic and cook until the mushrooms are browned and the liquid has evaporated, about 10 minutes.
6. Add the white wine, beef broth, and thyme to the skillet and cook until the liquid has reduced by half, about 5 minutes.
7. Remove the skillet from the heat and let the mushroom mixture cool.
8. On a lightly floured surface, roll out the puff pastry to a thickness of 1/4 inch.
9. Spread the mushroom mixture over the puff pastry.
10. Place the beef tenderloin on top of the mushroom mixture.
11. Wrap the puff pastry around the beef tenderloin, making sure to seal the edges.
12. Brush the beaten egg over the top of the puff pastry.
13. Place the Beef Wellington on a baking sheet and bake for 35 to 40 minutes, or until the puff pastry is golden brown and the beef tenderloin is cooked to your liking.
14. Let the Beef Wellington rest for 10 minutes before slicing and serving.

They are: Juno: New Origins, KSP 2, and Spaceflight Simulator. First, Juno: New Origins. This game used to be called ""Simplerockets 2"", and I can see why. It has no variety in parts (except for engines). It has only one fuel tank, separator, etc. KSP, though, has many different parts that are good for different situations. In terms of content besides the building, KSP has way more to do. The only good thing I can say about Juno is that it can run on a potato. Next, KSP 2. Right now, KSP 2 is worse than KSP in my opinion. It has better graphics, but not much else is better as far as I know. KSP 2 is new, though, so it will probably get better in the future. Finally, Spaceflight Simulator. This game can be described in 3 words: pay to win. It seems like every update to this game adds a new DLC. Without the DLC, it barely has anything. KSP has 2 DLC, but they arent needed to do good and have fun. In spaceflight simulator. basic parts (engines, fuel tanks) are behind a paywall, and you are only given the most basic parts.",1682382325,1682456337,True,7,0,0.513865768909454346,0,True,False,False

From its realistic physics simulation to its charming and lovable characters, Kerbal Space Program is a game that will keep you coming back for more.

One of the standout features of Kerbal Space Program is its physics simulation. The game's mechanics are based on real-world physics, making it a great tool for learning about space travel and rocket science. And the game's sandbox mode allows players to experiment with different designs and strategies, creating a gameplay experience that is both educational and fun.

But what really sets Kerbal Space Program apart is its characters. The game's lovable and quirky Kerbals bring a much-needed sense of humor and heart to the simulation, making it a joy to play. And the game's slapstick humor and unexpected surprises keep the gameplay fresh and exciting.

Of course, no review of Kerbal Space Program would be complete without mentioning its incredible modding community. The game's active modding scene has created countless new features and gameplay mechanics, making it a game that you can play for years without getting bored.

All in all, Kerbal Space Program is a game that truly deserves all the awards it has received and more. If you're a fan of simulation games, space travel, or just great game design in general, then this is a game you simply can't miss.",1682429396,1682429396,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Stimulating, rewarding, enjoyable. KSP provides a solar system and current space technology. Sandbox mode lets you tinker with all the parts freely, while career mode gives context for performing ""experiments"" (launch a rocket to place X and perform experiment Y) which unlocks more spaceship parts to build with.

There's probes, rovers, landers, spacewalks, flybys, you name it. It's a very involving game, solving the problems of how to reach a planet, and slow down to land on it, even collecting a sample to bring back to the home planet. Ontop of being a fun game, KSP provides an easy way to grasp the concepts of early space travel, and it's not overly complicated. Just pick the right parts, and fire your rocket at the right time and direction to get somewhere. It suffers a stuttering issue for many people, but it's not a gamebreaker.

I did end up having issues with the later nonsense, like the RedShell debacle which soured my respect for the game as a product. They still want to sell it at £29.99 despite releasing a sequel. The DLC is expensive, and they added a pointless launcher that wants you to make some other account. Even if you try to skip the launcher, it'll still show you a second pointless interface that has a store button for their other games.

I was trying to understand how it works and where the spaceship simulator is, but it is actually a space agency simulator, not a flight simulator as such. I was looking for something like rogue system or interkosmos 2000, but this nothing to do. In my case, I lost 8 hours trying to find the meaning of this game (I say this taking into account the expectation of wanting a spaceship flight simulator). I tried to return the game but since I've been playing for 8 hours, returns are no longer accepted. In the end I was disappointed and with a game that I don't want in my hands and the bad thing is that today with the gaming platforms there is no way to give it away to someone who is interested. Too bad, but what can you do? So as a reference this is not a space flight simulator (that is to say, it is not being behind the controls of a ship) it has nothing to do or is even comparable to games like interkosmos 2000 in (VR) or rogue system or even flight of nova.

Developed by Squad, the game puts you in charge of a space program run by the green, humanoid Kerbals.

The game tasks you with designing and building spacecraft, launching them into orbit, and exploring the vast reaches of space. The game offers a sandbox mode where you can experiment with different designs and test your vehicles, as well as a career mode where you must manage your resources and complete missions to advance your space program.

One of the most impressive aspects of Kerbal Space Program is its realistic physics engine, which accurately simulates the forces and dynamics of space flight. This makes designing and building spacecraft a challenging but rewarding experience, as you must take into account factors such as thrust, weight, and aerodynamics.

The graphics of the game are also impressive, with detailed models of the Kerbals and their spacecraft, as well as beautiful depictions of the planets and moons in the game's universe. The sound effects and music are also well done, adding to the immersive experience.

Overall, Kerbal Space Program is a game that offers a unique and engaging experience for players who are interested in space exploration and rocket science. Its realistic physics engine, challenging gameplay, and impressive graphics make it a must-play for anyone who has ever dreamed of becoming an astronaut. If you're looking for a game that combines science, exploration, and fun, then Kerbal Space Program is definitely worth checking out.",1674878499,1681689662,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This game has saved my creativity and desire for building Fighter jets, Real World Space Craft, Sci-fi Space Craft, Mechs, Wheeled Vehicles, Bases, Space Stations. Basically you name it, I've probably made it! If your like me and you grew up Building Craft, Lego's, Robotics, RC vehicles etc then this is the game for you no question! You seriously can do it all.

If you have a young child that is interested in any of the above and want to have something to push their creativity and inspire them later on in life to pursue those dreams. Get this game for them asap. (I wish I had something like this when I was younger!) 

This game is also good if you want something to chill out to if you play very serious games and want a break! 

You can build and upload your craft on the Workshop (come visit my page for lots of specialized craft) keeping it stock or if the uploaded craft requires a mod they generally will list it (I don't use mods for my downloads btw) There is also another popular website people upload their craft at which is (kerbalx dot com) (Interstellarkev is my user on here). There is a huge community out there and various Discords you can join to get help, tips, and inspiration.

This game does not require a super computer to run but it is challenging with FPS and loading if you start building over 1000 parts. This is a CPU dependent game. There are tons of graphical mods you can download to make things look more pretty if you would like to but you will need a GPU that has at least 8 GB Vram  to balance it out properly

Some of my favorite graphical mods are

Program CKAN (this will allow you to download mods from the internet without manually installing but some mods you may want to manual install. the rest you can find on the official kerbal space program forum)

Environmental Visual Enhancements Redux or (EVE REDUX for short)
Planet Shine
Waterfall
Scatter
TUFX
Textures Unlimited with Magpie and Textures Unlimited Recolour Depot (T.U.R.D) (this is to change color on parts)

I can't recommend this game enough. it's great. Factually better than the 2nd one as of right now. Worth the full price or buy it on sell if you must. The DLC is also worth it! If you can only buy 1 DLC I recommend the Breaking Grounds DLC btw as it adds robotic parts so you can make things like Mechs, Tanks, Sci-Fi Craft, General moving parts with hinges and pistons, Helicopters Propeller Planes etc. I have made a plethora of mechanical crafts.

Alright stop reading and buy it now!

I've played for a while, both moded instances and non moded and can say I have so much fun. The developers did an excellent job making the game challenging and enjoyable at the same time. 

I find myself spending hours in teh Vehicle Assembly Building (VAB) and then watching my rocket exploding into piecing because of a silly mistake I made. But after watching multiple failures and finally succeeding in landing on a moon or planet, I am filled with satisfaction of my hard work and planning.

If one is willing to put the time and patience into Kerbal Space Program, then they will come to learn a lot of the complicated techniques that space agencies around the world use to do the near impossible things in space that most of us take for granted.

It's a joy to play around with and create spacecraft. It does a good job of capturing the scale, the vastness, of space. Each mission is challenging. 

The only real problem with this game is the onboarding. Good heavens, this game doesn't teach you squat! The tutorial gives you the bare-bones basics to get to The Mun. I really must emphasis how bare-bones it is! There are TONS of keys that all do different things. The game doesn't tell you this. Some of these keys are kindof important, you know, like brakes! Trying to determine the best delta-v for a specific altitude because one of the game's missions asked you to? Good luck with that, game doesn't tell you! Pretty much everything in this game is a combination of Trial-and-Error and looking up videos/posts to learn from other people.

Regrettably, mods are almost a requirement. Not because the game is unplayable without them... it just needs the Quality of Life improvements that much.

It's a great game! Fun to play around with!

Forget LAN.Information in general is really lacking, fitting the 'throw something together, trial and error' game style. Acceleration? Guess. Weight? It'll kind of tell you, but it's like pulling teeth, especially if you want to compare it to anything. Batteries? Cool, I have power! No idea how long that charge will last, and good luck finding what the power use of anything is. The choice of Isp without exhaust velocity is personally annoying, but at least is in line with rocketry texts from the 50s.Maneuvering is actually generally intuitive, even in a simplified system, but has a few particularly annoying glitches. Most especially have fun trying to cancel a maneuver as the most reliable way isn't clicking the maneuver and then the X, it's fiddle with the bottom left mode setting to flip to orbit and back to maneuver to hit the X there because it desyncs what your map mode is.To summarize: It's a great game in its niche of reducing a complex topic to simplicity, but in a few areas it has been simplified to the point trial and error is not just the easiest way but nearly the only way to move forward. Add in some frustrating UI issues and of course the typical wonky collision physics module and you have a game that is merely good, rather than one that is great.",1679619111,1679619111,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Let's start with the bad:
- Bad performance, especially with larger craft and when using lots of mods
- Lots of memory leaks that can lead to crashes, again especially with mods
- Missing some things that as a veteran i consider essential quality of life (there are mods to help with that, but some things should be in the base game)
- Lackluster graphics
- Limited practical use of planetary bases or space stations

For me personally, all of these can be forgiven, as you can see by my hours. And that's not counting the thousands of hours used off Steam. Because:
- Beyond rockets, you can also build spacestations and even ships; you can also construct craft in orbit.
- KSP uses real physics (mostly)
- ...while still being easy to pick up and a ton of fun. That's incredibly impressive given the above.
- Similarly, it's very educational. While the solar system in the game is a dramatically scaled down version of our solar system, you will get a basic intuitive understanding of how orbits work, how interplanetary works and so on that mostly apply to the real world
- Great moddability, giving plenty of replayability. Realism Overhaul in particular can keep you busy for thousands of hours by removing the training wheels and getting the game much closer to reality, which also means it is much harder, giving even veterans a challenge.
- It's a great example for a sandbox game. You can just play around and build silly rockets. You can be serious and try to land on all the bodies (that you can) in one single launch. You can play a career where failure has consequences. Or install mods to add more solar systems, more parts, more realism, ... . There is plenty to do, and plenty of ways to keep the game fresh, especially with mods.

Overall, if you're interested in spaceflight at all, this is pretty much The game to get. The worst issues with KSP are on the technical side and with the engine it uses; otherwise the game is fantastic. You don't have to be super into science to be able to enjoy it, although it certainly helps if you approach the game through a science lens if you want to achieve certain milestones like landing on other planets. Personally, it's what inspired me to learn a lot more about spaceflight and you'll hear many similar stories of other KSP players. It's without a doubt one of the best games i ever played, it made me learn some real science while having fun and some of my favourite gaming moments ever have been in KSP. That first Moon Landing with Realism Overhaul is something i will never forget.",1383081750,1679363627,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

You are limited only by your creativity and the cold iron hand of physics (which has bcome very adept at swatting down lofty ambitions).

Beginners will thrill at finally escaping the atmosphere, intermediate players will find joy in assembling thier first space refuling  station, advanced players will install mods to make the game 10x harder and still show everyone up on YouTube, and Scott Manley will become a household name.

From designing and building your own rockets to planning and executing missions to explore the vast universe around you, Kerbal Space Program offers an immersive and engaging experience that is both educational and entertaining.

What sets Kerbal Space Program apart from other games is its focus on real-world physics and mechanics. The game doesn't just let you blast off into space without a second thought; it requires you to carefully plan and execute your missions, taking into account things like thrust, fuel consumption, and gravity. This level of detail may seem overwhelming at first, but the game does an excellent job of breaking everything down into manageable chunks and guiding you through the process step-by-step.

The game's lovable characters, the Kerbals, also add a fun and quirky element to the game. These little green creatures are your crew members, and they have their own unique personalities and abilities that can affect the success of your missions. Watching them bounce around in zero gravity or celebrating a successful launch is incredibly rewarding and makes the game even more enjoyable.

Overall, Kerbal Space Program is an amazing game that offers a unique and engaging way to learn about rocket science and space exploration. Whether you're a seasoned space enthusiast or just looking for a fun and educational game to play, Kerbal Space Program is definitely worth checking out.",1657371781,1678839097,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I'm an aerospace engineer, so I installed Ferram Aerodynamics Research and other realistic physics mods to drastically amplify this games' aerodynamics that are incredibly simplified.

This isn't a major problem of when you are trying to get to orbit but more so when you are trying to go to different moons/planets. Also the maneuver tool puts maneuver nodes days or years ahead which is annoying. The graphics on this game are good for its time but now is outdated.

For
I like the idea and i want to like the game

Against 

Ive spent more time online looking at videos on how to play it than i have actually playing it
I imagine its really realistic to the point that the slightest mistake usually ends in disaster which is fine if you dont mind save scumming repeatedly.
I dont know why it needs the loader with all its adverts for DLC ect (its all on steam why have the loader?)
The game loading speed is dire, it takes an age to load the game up to get to the main menu which is odd as its not exactly a visual masterpiece, it takes too long to go between buildings, in this respect its really poor.

I did the against first as i was struggling to find reasons for the game and i had to stop with the against`s as i felt like i was bashing the game too hard and went back to the reasons for the game and i am really struggling, i think thats it in a nutshell, i want to like the game but i just cant.
Luckily i got it in the sale for £7 and i may come back to it but im just not enjoying it.

From the very start, you are tasked with designing your own spacecraft and launching it into the great unknown. With its intuitive controls and realistic physics engine, you'll find yourself immersed in an experience unlike any other.

But what really sets Kerbal Space Program apart is the sense of accomplishment you'll feel with each successful launch. Whether you're sending a probe to explore a distant planet or landing on the moon, each step of the journey feels like a true achievement. And with the ability to share your successes with other players, the sense of community and camaraderie is truly unparalleled.

Overall, I highly recommend Kerbal Space Program to anyone who loves space exploration, engineering, or just plain fun. It's a game that will challenge you, inspire you, and keep you coming back for more. So if you're ready to blast off into the final frontier, give Kerbal Space Program a try - you won't be disappointed!",1678485410,1678485410,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Until late 2022.

A launcher nobody needs and nobody asked for whose sole purpose is to push messages about KSP 2.0.
That launcher broke people's games until they patched it.
They then locked all threads about the launcher, to prevent people from pointing out their idiocy.
They then put KSP 2.0 in EA, but at a price point typical for FULLY DEBUGGED GAMES. They are charging you to be their beta testers.

I no longer recommend you buy KSP 1 anything because:
-- there's no guarantee they won't break it for trivial reasons
-- or even completely take it off of Steam in a fit of pique
-- and they've ruined any goodwill they might have had, forever
-- and they don't deserve any of your money, ever",1678483919,1678483919,False,4,0,0.501545846462249756,0,True,False,False
