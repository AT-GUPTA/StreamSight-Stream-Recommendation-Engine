The Counter-Terrorist Team and The Terrorist team. As it got more versions, people went to Le and Cliffe's website which helped them make money from ad revenue. Around 2000 of Beta 5's release, the two were approached by Valve and were offered jobs. The two agreed and here we are now. From a 1999 game to one of the most popular series. To put it simply, (Because this is too long.) this is amazing.

In the depths of infernal flame, where shadows dance and demons reign,
There roams a soul, untamed and bold, through the corridors of endless pain.
A wanderer through the abyss, with footsteps echoing dread,
Bound by chains of sin and sorrow, to a fate where hope is dead.
Through the brimstone and the fire, this soul dares to tread,
Facing horrors beyond measure, where even angels fear to thread.
But with each journey into hell, a strange bond begins to form,
For amidst the screams and suffering, a kinship starts to warm.
With every trial and torment endured, a twisted camaraderie blooms,
As Satan himself takes notice, in the midst of infernal fumes.
Together they laugh, amidst the chaos and despair,
Sharing tales of anguish and woe, in the devil's wicked lair.
But as the flames grow hotter, and the screams become a roar,
The wanderer begins to wonder, what they're fighting for.
For in this realm of eternal torment, where agony knows no end,
Is there truly a purpose, or is it all just to pretend?
With a heart heavy with doubt, the wanderer makes their choice,
To break free from hell's grip, and reclaim their voice.
Through sheer will and determination, they break the chains that bind,
And emerge from the depths of hell, with a newfound peace of mind.
But as they step onto the earthly plane, a chill runs down their spine,
For hell's influence still lingers, in every darkened line.
And as they look upon the world, now haunted by the souls they've met,
They realize that hell itself, is not so easy to forget.
So they roam the empty earth, a specter of their former self,
Haunted by the memories of hell, and all its torments felt.
But amidst the darkness and despair, a glimmer of hope remains,
For even in the depths of hell, the soul can still break chains.
Brought back from hell by Satan himself, to spread the word of the Lord,
Killing everything in your path, a path of darkness, all is black.
Through the fields of sorrow and despair, you walk with purpose in your stride,
A beacon of light amidst the darkness, with hope burning deep inside.
For though you've seen the depths of hell, and felt its searing pain,
You know that light can pierce the dark, and hope can rise again.
So you journey forth, a warrior reborn, with fire in your eyes,
To banish darkness from the earth, and reclaim the sunlit skies.
With each step forward, you leave behind the shadows of the past,
And embrace the light that guides you, to a future built to last.
For though you may have walked through hell, you emerged stronger than before,
A testament to the power of faith, and the hope that we all adore.
So let your light shine bright, and banish darkness from the land,
For you are the chosen one, with a destiny grand.
And though the road may be long, and the journey fraught with pain,
You know that you'll emerge victorious, and the light will always reign.
Left in a cell, condemned to turn to coral,
As punishment for deeds, both dark and immoral.
Slowly covered by water, as the earth is swallowed by the sea,
A fate decreed by powers, far beyond what mortals see.
Once a warrior, now transformed by fate,
Into a creature of the deep, resigned to meet their state.
The ocean's embrace, a prison cold and vast,
A solitary existence, in the depths so vast.
But even as the waves wash over, and the coral starts to grow,
There's a glimmer of hope, a flicker in the undertow.
For in the depths of the abyss, where darkness holds its sway,
There lies the chance for redemption, to find a brighter day.
So let the waters wash away, the sins of days gone by,
And let the coral bloom anew, beneath the endless sky.
For though the punishment may seem severe, and the depths may hold their sway,
There's always hope for renewal, in the light of a brand new day.
In the depths of the ocean, where shadows reign supreme,
Lies a soul condemned, to dwell in this watery dream.
A punishment severe, for sins of days gone by,
As coral grows around, under the endless sky.
But in this watery grave, there's more than meets the eye,
For the soul trapped within, still yearns to rise and fly.
For though the depths may hold their sway, and darkness holds its grip,
There's still a chance for redemption, from this eternal trip.
Yet lurking in the shadows, a fate both dark and grim,
For if you cannot make him laugh, you're just food for him.
So swim through the darkness, and search for a glimmer of light,
For in the depths of the abyss, lies the chance to make things right.
Not alone in hell my friend is there waiting for me, unable to see,
ah yes i know thee like me, we stand together wielding a toothpick,
we brought a weapon sharp and true, a tool to end the threat with poke like a click,
a beast approaches, its dog, a rider its of course a sill ball of joy, not a toy.

Однією з основних переваг ""Counter-Strike 1.6"" є його геймплей, який поєднує в собі простоту та стратегічну глибину. Збалансована система зброї, реалістична фізика та картинка гри дозволяють гравцям відчувати глибокий іммерсивний досвід. Величезна кількість карт та режимів гри забезпечує різноманітність, завдяки чому кожен поєдинок виглядає як унікальне пригода.

Мультіплеєр - справжня сила гри, адже ""Counter-Strike 1.6"" створений для командної гри. Співпраця та координація важливі для досягнення успіху, що робить гру особливо захоплюючою для тих, хто цінує стратегічний підхід.

Гра також вражає своєю витриманістю та стійкістю. Навіть після багатьох років, вона зберігає свою активність в онлайн-спільноті, завдяки чому новачки можуть насолоджуватися грою разом із ветеранами.

Однак, з часом, гра втратила у своїй графіці в порівнянні з більш сучасними FPS. На сьогоднішній день деякі аспекти гри можуть здатися застарілими, але вони все ще мають свою чарівність і можуть привертати гравців з усього світу.

У підсумку, ""Counter-Strike 1.6"" - це не просто гра, а легенда, яка залишається невід'ємною частиною історії відеоігор. Для тих, хто цінує класику та глибокий геймплей, вона залишається важливим етапом в світі відомих ігор.",1706645657,1706645657,True,2,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

This game immediately caught the attention of millions of players around the world. The game is a confrontation between terrorists and counter-terrorists, representing the forces of good and evil. The objectives of the opposing sides differ depending on the map on which the battle takes place.

And here are my thoughts.

This is the most entertaining video game I've ever played since 2007.
I think I've played this game for like 2000 hours, I guess. I played only the cracked version that day.
I finally bought this game, and it's worth 10 bucks indeed.
I still play CS 1.6 because I had an amazing childhood with it!

By that, I didn't mean online or with bots, but I had lots of LAN-party's in my country, and my friends still play it, but there's still LAN-party's sometimes in my country ^^
The game is still fun, and it never gets boring!
I mean, totally, this game has lots of game modes, which are ZM/ZE/CSDM/GUNGAME/FURIEN/SURF/DEATHRUN/BASEBUILDER, and more and more and more.
It's just fantastic! :D

Counter-Strike 1.6 is the newest Point-and-Click Adventure from the makers of the hit game Counter-Strike Nexon: Zombies. Don't be mistaken by the rather plain name, though, as this is not simply another uninspired reboot of that beloved Uninstallation Simulation game; no, Counter-Strike 1.6 is the real deal!

The mechanics and gameplay are top-notch. You can jump like you're in the Matrix, run almost silently by bouncing across the ground on your butt, shoot through a quarter-mile of stone or concrete, plaster X-rated images on walls to distract teammates and enemies alike, or spraypaint fake doors and ladders and watch them all run head-first into walls!
There are ladders in de_dust2?? Who knew!

But as hinted above, it's the physics that really make this game wonderful. Some people see a cliff-face, others see a surfin' safari. Can't figure out how your teammate jumped on that wall? Spend fifty hours failing and falling to your death, and if you're good, you just might get there too! A quick server mod will let you jump in the air, and with some practice and you can move as fast as that guy with 500 ping whose approaching footsteps sounded like a small-caliber machine gun as he shot your whole team in the face with a scout in under a second! Also, remember, kids: everyone knows you run faster with a knife. And even faster with a scout. Haven't gotten accused of speedhacking yet? What about aimbotting?
""BOOM! HEADSHOT!!""

With hundreds of hours of walking in circles around epically-plain sandstone ruins searching for the last cowering, brainless zombie to click on, this game will keep you bunny-hopping back for more!",1669246595,1705889400,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Despite its age, Counter-Strike differs from almost every other multiplayer GoldSrc game by being fairly active, with several servers filled with bots or other players. The gameplay itself is simple to learn but makes itself engaging and fun through being hard to master. There's always something to improve on, and there's always a challenge to overcome. The various game modes, weapons, and equipment available all come to create an experience that, while sometimes repetitive, is always something one can look forward to getting back into.

While improvements and refinements have been made to Counter-Strike through its sequels, Counter-Strike 1.6 is still fun and worth your time, especially at its sales price.

Review:
After spending 9.4 hours diving into the heart of Counter-Strike, it's clear why this game has stood the test of time as a pinnacle of competitive first-person shooters.

Likes:
Pure Competitive Thrill: Counter-Strike's focus on raw, competitive gameplay sets it apart. Every match feels like a high-stakes tactical chess game, requiring teamwork, strategy, and quick reflexes.

Iconic Maps: The classic maps like de_dust2 and cs_office remain not only nostalgic but also brilliantly designed. The familiarity breeds intense engagements and strategic plays.

Skill-Based Gunplay: The skill ceiling for gunplay is high, rewarding precision and mastery of weapon mechanics. The satisfaction of landing a precise shot or executing a well-timed strategy is unparalleled.

Dislikes:
Graphical Outdatedness: As expected from a game with such a rich history, the graphics are showing their age. An update to the visual presentation could enhance the overall gaming experience.

Learning Curve: For new players, Counter-Strike can be intimidating due to its steep learning curve. A more robust tutorial system could ease the entry for those new to the game.

Recommendation:
Counter-Strike remains an absolute must-play for anyone who appreciates the essence of competitive gaming. The adrenaline, the camaraderie, and the satisfaction of a well-executed plan make it a timeless masterpiece. While it may not cater to everyone due to its learning curve, those who embrace the challenge will find an FPS experience like no other.

In the ever-evolving landscape of gaming, few titles stand the test of time like Counter-Strike 1.6. Released in 1999, this first-person shooter has not only shaped the gaming industry but has also become a cultural phenomenon. As I delved back into the realms of Counter-Strike 1.6, the nostalgia hit me like a wave, reminding me why this game is still revered by gamers around the globe.

One of the standout features of Counter-Strike 1.6 is its simplicity, a trait that paradoxically contributes to its enduring appeal. The game strips away unnecessary complexities, presenting a pure and straightforward multiplayer experience. Two teams, terrorists, and counter-terrorists face off in a battle of wits and reflexes across various maps. It's the quintessential formula that has captivated players for over two decades.

The iconic map design is perhaps one of Counter-Strike 1.6's greatest strengths. Dust2, Inferno, and Nuke are not just maps; they are virtual battlefields where friendships are forged, and rivalries are born. Each map is meticulously crafted to provide strategic depth, ensuring that matches are not just about raw firepower but also about intelligent decision-making and teamwork.

While the graphics may seem outdated by today's standards, Counter-Strike 1.6 compensates with its unmatched gameplay. The weapon mechanics are finely tuned, offering a satisfying blend of skill and unpredictability. Mastering the recoil patterns of each gun becomes an art form, and the sound design enhances the immersive experience, making every gunshot and footstep crucial in the heat of battle.

The community aspect is another gem within Counter-Strike 1.6. The game thrives on player interaction, creating an environment where teamwork and communication are paramount. Clan matches, LAN parties, and the birth of esports owe much to Counter-Strike 1.6, fostering a sense of camaraderie among players that transcends geographical boundaries.

It's worth noting that Counter-Strike 1.6 has aged gracefully, like a fine wine. Despite the emergence of newer titles with cutting-edge graphics and advanced features, the game's core mechanics and balance continue to attract players. Its simplicity is its strength, as it allows for easy accessibility without compromising on the depth that keeps players engaged for hours on end.

In conclusion, Counter-Strike 1.6 is more than just a game; it's a piece of gaming history. Its enduring legacy speaks volumes about its impact on the industry and the hearts of players who experienced its magic. Whether you're a veteran revisiting the past or a newcomer curious about gaming history, Counter-Strike 1.6 is a must-play that showcases the timeless brilliance of a true classic.",1703845326,1704463036,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

I like it because of it's graphics, because I seem too like every single GoldScr graphics, but the gameplay is sorta bland. There isn't no bots, and there seems to be a lot of kids playing this. one time I heard someone who sounded like a 6 yr old laughing in his or her's mike. but eitherway, even if I do like how CSS has bots, this game holds up and would be a pick if I had nothing else.

My memories from the days of playing Counter-Strike 1.6 are filled with joy and excitement. I recall the long nights spent gaming with friends, where we fought together in the game and forged friendships that extended far beyond the computer screen

We learned to cooperate, communicate, and trust each other to win matches. These experiences shaped my social skills and taught me the importance of teamwork.

Some of my closest friends today are the ones I met on various Counter-Strike servers. We didn't just share virtual battles but also life's joys and challenges. These friendships are precious, and I'm grateful for the memories we've created together.

Even though time has passed, and we may have lost touch, the memories of those good old Counter-Strike days will always be a part of me.

What sets Counter-Strike apart is its simplicity and depth. The game's straightforward yet challenging gameplay, featuring bomb defusal and hostage rescue missions, demands precision and teamwork. The tight gunplay mechanics and emphasis on skill mastery create a thrilling and intensely competitive environment that rewards strategy and quick thinking.

Counter-Strike's diverse arsenal of weapons, classic maps, and community-driven content have fostered an enduring and passionate player base. Its accessibility to new players while offering a high skill ceiling for veterans has contributed to its widespread appeal across generations of gamers.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and we adopted our son together. Both are now 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I felt lost and unhappy. I was self-destructive. One day, I was so angry with everything spiraling out of control that I punched a concrete wall in a moment of overwhelming emotion. This resulted in breaking my fifth metacarpal in my right hand—the hand I worked with, played games with, and used to carry my children to bed—the hand I desperately needed to ensure I could continue providing.

Upon learning the severity of the self-inflicted damage, I became almost suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man, with no history of depression or anxiety. I had never experienced anger outbursts, nor was I the type to break down and cry, but I was in a tough situation that truly prevented me from seeing the light on the other side.

With nothing better to do, I looked for a game I could play WITH ONE HAND while recovering. Somehow, I stumbled upon this game and read some of the comments. I decided it was worth a try... I must admit I didn't beat the game, nor did I play as much as some of you. In fact, I may have played this game for only a day or two. That being said, after doing so, I had a new joy and hope for life. I managed to leave behind the pain and suffering that had been thrust upon me. I could experience the joy and happiness of other people. I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ minutes listening to this music, long enough to realize that I would be okay.

After realizing this, I turned off the game and went back to work. My hand hurt a lot, but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so sorry for myself and became the father I needed to be at that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving like.

Today, I am close friends with the mother of my children. We don't fight, argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents and friends.

Now I have 3 children. My third child is, wait, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my separation, and we just unexpectedly stumbled into each other's lives. We have been dating for a year and are very happy together.

Moral of the story: you never know what life has in store for you, and if I had given up when all odds were against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you.",1662335096,1702929509,True,1,1,0.366239815950393677,0,True,False,False

If all those hours would have been spend making Art, playing sports, learning music or even reading books Life would have been much improved.
After all those years, 1.6 become a sinkhole. 
Not even enjoying it at the star , I was more into arena shooters, but bad habits build in.

Surely I got to know the flow-state, learn 1-Taps, Handling stress in clutches, edit cfgs, learn game fixed patterns, use strats and joke around with virtual teammates but none of this is useful IRL.

Overview:
Counter-Strike 1.6 stands as the iconic origin of the world's premier online action game, offering an unparalleled experience in realistic team-based terrorist warfare. Released in 2000 as a standalone game for Microsoft Windows, this title quickly rose to prominence, setting the stage for a franchise that would define competitive shooting for over two decades.

Pros:

Pioneer of Competitive Shooting: Counter-Strike 1.6 is not just a game; it's a pioneering force that shaped the landscape of competitive shooting. Its legacy is unrivalled, having been the most-played online game globally and influencing other major franchises like Unreal Tournament, Call of Duty, and Battlefield.

Strategic Team-Based Gameplay: The game's brilliance lies in its team-based approach to missions. Players must ally with teammates to execute strategic missions, including taking out enemy sites and rescuing hostages. The success of each player is interlinked with the overall success of the team.

Realistic Terrorist Warfare: Counter-Strike 1.6 offers an incredibly realistic portrayal of terrorist warfare, immersing players in intense and strategic combat scenarios. The emphasis on realism enhances the overall gaming experience.

Historical Significance: As the final major version released on September 15, 2003, Counter-Strike 1.6 holds historical significance within the gaming community. It is often retroactively referred to as Counter-Strike 1.6 to distinguish it from subsequent Counter-Strike iterations.

Escape from Modern Gaming Trends: Counter-Strike 1.6 provides a refreshing escape from contemporary gaming trends such as loot boxes, microtransactions, and in-game currency. Its simplicity and focus on skill-based gameplay harken back to a time when the purity of competition was paramount.

Cons:

Outdated Graphics: Given its release in 2000, Counter-Strike 1.6 features outdated graphics compared to modern gaming standards. While this may be nostalgic for some, it could be a deterrent for players accustomed to cutting-edge visuals.

Limited Maps and Content: The game, despite its brilliance, has a limited selection of maps and content compared to more recent titles. This limitation, while part of its historical charm, may affect the longevity of its appeal for some players.

Final Thoughts:
Counter-Strike 1.6 stands as a testament to the enduring legacy of competitive shooting games. Its influence extends far beyond its initial release, shaping the industry and captivating players with its strategic team-based gameplay. While it may lack the visual splendor of modern titles, Counter-Strike 1.6 remains a timeless classic that provides an authentic and skill-driven competitive experience, untainted by the trappings of contemporary gaming trends. For those seeking a journey back to the roots of competitive shooting, Counter-Strike 1.6 stands as an undisputed icon.",1525002284,1702026719,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

With a focus on teamwork, precision, and strategic gameplay, Counter-Strike has shaped the landscape of online gaming for over two decades.

The beauty of Counter-Strike lies in its simplicity and purity of design. Divided into two teams – Counter-Terrorists and Terrorists – players engage in objective-based rounds that demand coordination, skill, and quick thinking. The game's emphasis on realistic weapon behavior and the absence of regenerating health add an immersive layer of challenge, creating a truly skill-driven experience.

The map design in Counter-Strike is a testament to thoughtful planning. Each map presents a unique challenge, and mastering the layouts, chokepoints, and bomb sites becomes an art form. The balance between the two factions ensures that every round is a tense battle, whether it's a hostage rescue or bomb defusal mission.

Counter-Strike's influence extends beyond its gameplay mechanics. The economic system, where successful rounds yield money for better weapons, adds a strategic layer, forcing players to make decisions that impact the entire team. This delicate balance between risk and reward is a hallmark of Counter-Strike's enduring appeal.

Over the years, Counter-Strike has seen various iterations, with each new release refining and expanding upon the formula. While the series has evolved, the core principles of precise gunplay, strategic teamwork, and a vibrant competitive scene have remained constant, proving that Counter-Strike is not just a game but a cultural phenomenon.

In conclusion, Counter-Strike's legacy is built on its unmatched ability to provide thrilling, skill-based gameplay that stands the test of time. Whether you're a seasoned veteran or a newcomer, Counter-Strike's enduring popularity attests to its status as a benchmark for competitive multiplayer shooters.",1701959489,1701959489,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[h3]The Concept[/h3]

I do not see Counter-Strike as a video game. I see it as unequivocal battle of wits and skill. 
A mind-training, if you will.
You need to understand the game and other players. Then combine the two in order to win.
This is not a battle of wits against your enemies. It is a battle of wits against yourself. 

Remain graceful in both Victory and Defeat.  
You can learn a lot about yourself after playing Counter-Strike.

Its straightforward yet intensely competitive gameplay has kept players coming back for more than two decades. At its core, Counter-Strike is a team-based tactical shooter that pits terrorists against counter-terrorists in a series of objective-based rounds. The gameplay is remarkably simple: eliminate the opposing team or complete mission objectives. However, this simplicity is deceptive, as Counter-Strike excels in its execution. The game's weapon mechanics are precise and unforgiving, rewarding accuracy and strategy over run-and-gun tactics. The balance of weapons and equipment adds depth to the gameplay, allowing players to develop their own styles and strategies. Every shot counts, and mastering recoil patterns becomes an essential skill. Counter-Strike's maps are iconic, offering a variety of settings and scenarios that cater to different playstyles. Whether it's a close-quarters firefight in ""Dust2"" or a tense hostage rescue in ""Office,"" each map offers a unique and challenging experience. The balance between terrorists and counter-terrorists ensures that matches are often close and competitive. One of Counter-Strike's standout features is its emphasis on teamwork and communication. Cooperation is crucial for success, and the game's lack of regenerating health or respawns heightens the tension. The need for precise coordination and strategy has made it a favorite among esports players and teams. The game's longevity is a testament to its enduring appeal. Over the years, Counter-Strike has received numerous updates and iterations, with Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO) being the most recent and popular. The community has played a significant role in shaping the game's evolution through mods, maps, and custom content. However, it's important to note that the original Counter-Strike can feel dated compared to its successors in terms of graphics and user interface. The game's visuals, while serviceable, do not match the standards of modern titles. Additionally, new players may find the learning curve steep, as the game does not hold your hand and demands patience and practice to excel. In summary, Counter-Strike is a genre-defining classic that continues to be celebrated for its simplicity, competitiveness, and emphasis on teamwork. Its enduring popularity and influence on the first-person shooter genre are a testament to its quality. While it may show its age in certain aspects, Counter-Strike remains a must-play for fans of tactical shooters and competitive gaming.",1700741353,1701423635,True,17,1,0.646766185760498047,0,True,False,False

The game literally gives you nostalgia just by saying ""CS 1.6""
I've played this game for about 12 years (unfortunately i never had money to buy it)
I would say this game is better then CS2 not by graphics, obviously, but by mechanics, movement.
Movement is the only thing that makes this game unique in it's way. I play this game now just because i want to bhop here.
Shooting is special too. You literally don't know when you are going to 1 tap the person because the shooting is very weird. This is the thing you need to work on a lot too. Spraying is not the key in this game. You always need to go for 1 taps unless you want to die. This game gave me every emotion imaginable. I found a lot of friends in this game.
Can't let this game go anytime soon.

This is the Love of games!
This is the Love of esports!
This is Love for Girls! :)

[b] This is not just a game and it is not for your entertainment in the evenings! This is the # 1 world esports discipline! [/b]

It is difficult to evaluate this game somehow, since this is a part of my youth and the first steps in esports, when I was still 11-12 years old :)
At that time, the sky was bluer, and the grass was greener, and the Orcs were no match for the present ... although what am I talking about .... it is from another….

[b] The most important thing in this game is the Team and the Spirit that it contains! [/b]

It doesn't matter what is in your hands! It can be M4A1 and AK-47, or even an ordinary knife!
But all this no longer makes sense when you feel like 1,000,000 eyes are looking at you online, and you need to defuse this bomb or detonate it, and then everything depends on your Team! 
You just go to Length and make a headshot, then make a minus from the Elephant and here it is! But do not forget to discard 2 Flashes on the Zigzag and make 2 more minuses from your Desert Eagle, and now you are left alone! And time goes by….

Years of life pass in the same way, but you, as always, will love this game and smile after 10 -100 years when you see it :)
And, seeing how new gamers play something newer, smile with a grin behind their back and burn the same fire of Love for this world of video games for the rest of their lives!

A few words about the technical capabilities of the game….
Over the past 10x years, the World has changed 10 times! But this game remained the same as it was in 1999-2000! 
If you want to see what the World was like then, and what it was like to live in the World of esports at the turn of 1000 years! Then you need to play this game for 1000 hours so that your eyes and hands and brain are immersed in this World and stay here forever with Love in your heart! 
Yes, there is a lot of something beyond new and amazing around, but why all this? 
When you have your favorite game in your hands, and you see your favorite Team of friends on the monitor! 
[b] But they are not so young anymore, so your girlfriend will be under the table :) [/b]

While the Half-Life engine isn't the prettiest beast out there, there is plenty of animation that creates a smooth look and feel, and the gun models are some of the most realistic looking of any shooter available. The environmental textures look realistic enough and complement the provided camouflage well enough for you to be hidden, but not be invisible. As in real life, the distinguishable difference between good guy and bad guy is a little difficult, but the balance to this is if you can't tell who it is then you probably won't be able to hit him with your gun.

Eventually he let me play a few rounds with BOTs and I immediately loved it. It was one of, if not the very first game i played on PC and the rest is history. Now I take a look at it in 2022 after 7000+ hours and I think it's finally time to say goodbye. CS has brought me some great memories but in the last year it has been kinda hard to enjoy it. One of the reasons is playing CS:GO, which made me better notice the flaws of the older game that sadly never got addressed. First of all VAC in 1.6 hasn't been updated since 2012, so the cheating problem is even worse than in CSGO. Then there's the bad net code and the even worse player models that teleport left and right every time a player moves and strafes. Not to mention the hitboxes and limited crosshair customization. But what bothered me most of all was the fucking scrolling(fast duck on mouse wheel), as if the noobs needed a trick to avoid shots and spam fire till they get a fucking hit. That thing was removed on Source for a reason, but enough of spitting on the game I claim to love so much. CS 1.6 will forever be one of my all time favorites but I just can't seem to enjoy it as much I used to. I'll still be droppin' in every now and then but for now it's time to retire. I fucking love CS !!!

Drive back to the crib
Run back to their arms

Told me in my lifetime
My name would help light up the Chicago skyline
And that's what I'm (and I wonder)

Heaven'll watch, God calling from the hotlines
Why he keep giving me hot lines?
I'm a star, how could I not shine? (And I wonder)

How many ladies in the house without a spouse (what it means)
Something in your blouse got me feeling so aroused (what it means)

10,6578702,76561198069544258,1106,9,90776,0,86076,1707312545,"CS 1.6 - это истинная классика, которая впервые увлекла миллионы игроков по всему миру и до сих пор продолжает покорять сердца геймеров. Эта игра открывает перед нами захватывающий мир соревновательных мультиплеерных сражений, где командная игра и стратегическое мышление имеют огромное значение.

Одной из главных причин, по которой CS 1.6 остается так популярной, является ее простота и доступность. Управление и механика игры являются интуитивными и легкими для освоения даже для новичков. Все, что вам нужно, это оружие, триггерное ведение огня и круглый счетчик патронов. Простота этих элементов делает игру доступной для всех, но в то же время мастерство и умение принимать правильные решения в боях играют важную роль в достижении успеха.

Огромное количество карт и режимов игры позволяют каждому игроку найти что-то по своему вкусу. Битвы на картах типа ""Доставка бомбы"" или ""Захват флага"" вызывают адреналин и создают неповторимую атмосферу. Каждая карта имеет свою уникальную архитектуру, что требует от игроков адаптации и развития разнообразных стратегий.

Также стоит отметить великолепное сообщество игроков, которое прочно укоренилось в CS 1.6. Социализация и взаимодействие с другими игроками во время игры создают незабываемые впечатления и позволяют учиться друг у друга. Благодаря возможности играть в команде и против других игроков, CS 1.6 умело поддерживает дух соревнования и способствует развитию навыков командной работы.

Наконец, нельзя не отметить уникальную атмосферу игры, которая до сих пор остается неповторимой.

Большой выбор игровых режимов и множество серверов с различными модификациями позволяют настроить игру по своему вкусу. Вы можете выбирать между классическими режимами, такими как ""Заложники"" и ""Плантация бомбы"", или попробовать что-то новое и экзотическое. Возможность создавать свои собственные серверы и играть с друзьями добавляет еще больше разнообразия и веселья.

И, конечно, нельзя забыть упомянуть моддинг и создание пользовательских контента. CS 1.6 была и остается популярной платформой для модификаций, создания новых карт, скинов оружия и персонажей. Благодаря этому игроки имеют возможность вносить свой вклад в развитие игры и делиться своими творческими идеями с сообществом.

В заключение, Counter-Strike 1.6 - это не просто игра, это культовый шедевр, который навсегда останется в сердцах многих игроков. Ее простота, командная игра, бесконечное разнообразие карт и режимов, и, конечно же, атмосфера соперничества делают ее поистине великой. Если вы ищете увлекательные сражения и незабываемые моменты в мире видеоигр, то CS 1.6 - это тот шедевр, который стоит испытать.",1354364426,1700669617,True,1,0,0.498257845640182495,0,True,False,False

It's the keeper of unforgettable memories for a generation, and one of the greatest legacies gaming has ever carried. This game was the crucible of exhilarating late-night sessions among friends, intense clan battles, and monumental showdowns on online arenas.

Every time a terrorist planted a bomb or the counter-terrorist team rescued a hostage, the game's intensity and strategy would seize our hearts. The iconic silhouettes of 'Dust2,' the relentless firefights in the deserts of 'de_dust,' and the enigmatic silence of the 'aztec' jungles offered players some of the finest environments of its time.

Landing those one-shot kills with the 'AWP,' making pinpoint headshots with the 'deagle,' or clutching victory with the 'AK-47' after intense firefights became hours of practice. The game provided a platform to hone skills, reflexes, and teamwork.

Sure, its graphics and sounds might appear outdated by today's standards, but the beauty of this game lay in its gameplay. Counter-Strike 1.6 is a legend that will live on forever in the gaming world. Anyone who shared this legend will forever carry its warm memories. It's more than just a game; it's a way of life and an experience that will never be forgotten. Counter-Strike 1.6 is not just a game; it's an immortal legacy.

Despite playing so many CS games I still come back to the original often, maybe it is the Goldsrc engine's charm or maybe my nostalgia that pushes me to visit CS but I often end up spending quite some time remembering the good old simple times. The game is still fun and in fact is the same formula that is used to this day even in CS2. This iteration of CS is the one that laid the foundation of the entire series and this is the game that many other shooters attempted to copy but never replicated it well.

Now is the game worth it in 2023? ABSOLUTELY, many pub, deathmatch, zombie survival and other servers have a lot of active players. You'll find many opportunities to have fun.

My memories from the days of playing Counter-Strike 1.6 are filled with joy and excitement. I recall the long nights spent gaming with friends, where we fought together in the game and forged friendships that extended far beyond the computer screen

We learned to cooperate, communicate, and trust each other to win matches. These experiences shaped my social skills and taught me the importance of teamwork.

Some of my closest friends today are the ones I met on various Counter-Strike servers. We didn't just share virtual battles but also life's joys and challenges. These friendships are precious, and I'm grateful for the memories we've created together.

Even though time has passed, and we may have lost touch, the memories of those good old Counter-Strike days will always be a part of me. It's amazing how a game could connect us and create lasting friendships that will endure a lifetime. ❤️",1698537957,1698537957,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

this game is nearly impossible to play in 2023 due to most community servers being a cesspool of ugly, visually distracting customization that shits on original game's solid half-life low poly aesthetics, power creeping admins and pay to win donation systems, absolutely unbearable community - most people on the closest servers with playable ping rates were not very well-adjusted eastern european boomers who grew up with it, this game's main audience really, and the worst on top of everything - servers that can inject your pc with malicious software, since there is zero restriction or review process on what custom content server admins can force you to download

in the best case you can have some fun with bots (that you have to set up manually, there is a guide, though i swear to god they were a part of the game before?) but you can only play so much with bots

all in all more of a museum artifact of a long gone online gaming era than an actual playable game

The community servers are still full with active people ready to play and have fun with you. Another really good feature that Half-Life and 1.6 had done is modding. No, it's not changing the game to have a significant advantage. It's more visual quality like importing CSGO knifes to the game or having anime characters as your skin rather than the boring Leet models.

And so, in the late '90s, they gave birth to a phenomenon we now know as Counter-Strike.

The game was, in a way, like your grandma's famous stew - a little bit of this, a dash of that, and a whole lot of secret sauce. It was pure magic, wrapped in pixelated graphics and the occasional ""I can't believe you just shot me!"" rage. But it was love at first sight for many. You could choose to be a terrorist or a counter-terrorist, wielding all sorts of weapons and striving to complete objectives or eliminate the enemy team.

As the years went by, Counter-Strike evolved, much like your teenage years - it got a little smarter, a bit more mature, and much better at killing terrorists and defusing bombs. There were new maps, new weapons, and, of course, endless arguments about which gun was the best (spoiler: it was always the AWP). It was a mix of strategy, teamwork, and, well, a fair amount of camping in dark corners.

But it was in 2012 when things got a bit more ""Global."" Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, or CS:GO, burst onto the scene. It was like Counter-Strike had put on a fancy suit, polished its shoes, and gotten a promotion. CS:GO brought better graphics, improved gameplay mechanics, and more matchmaking options. The esports scene exploded, turning the game into a major league of its own. It was like the Super Bowl for gamers, but with fewer commercials and more headshots.

Yet, as time went on, CS:GO started showing its age, like that old sitcom you used to binge-watch in your pajamas. Fans clamored for something new, something fresh, something with a ""2"" at the end of it. And Valve, the brilliant minds behind Counter-Strike, heard their pleas. Thus, Counter-Strike 2 was born.

The sequel took everything we loved about CS:GO, sprinkled in some futuristic tech, and voilà! It was as if the old dog had learned some new tricks. The graphics were out of this world, and the gameplay was smoother than a jazz solo. But, at its core, it remained the Counter-Strike we all knew and loved.

With the release of Counter-Strike 2, CS:GO was officially retired, a hero riding into the sunset, leaving behind an indelible legacy in the gaming world. It was a bittersweet moment for fans, like saying goodbye to an old friend. But as they loaded up Counter-Strike 2 and heard that familiar ""dun dun dun dun"" of the menu music, they knew the journey was far from over. Counter-Strike was here to stay, evolving and adapting, just like the gamers who loved it.

So, whether you're a seasoned veteran or a fresh-faced recruit in the world of Counter-Strike, remember that this game isn't just about shooting terrorists and defusing bombs. It's about friendships forged in the heat of battle, memories made in the dust of de_dust2, and countless hours spent wondering why the guy on your team insists on buying a Negev every round. Here's to Counter-Strike, past, present, and future - a game that keeps on giving, just like a good stew recipe that's passed down through the generations.",1697406293,1697406293,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

If you are someone who has never played counter-strike 1.6, I would have a tough time recommending this unless you want to check out where counter-strike got its roots from. There are some things in this game that are somewhat anti-competitive like crouch walking (some may call it silent-stepping, groundstrafing, g-stafing), quick-switching to reload faster, boosting people through roofs, the insane amount of wall bangs you can do. Some do raise the skill cap. Where this game shined for me was the modding community and the custom game modes. This is where kz started, where surfing started, where scoutzknivez started, bhopping was around before counter-strike but counter-strike had bhop communities as well. This is where weapon skins came from as modders would make custom models for weapons and custom player models. This and counter-strike: condition zero are the only counter-strike games to have a competitive knifing community because the knife mechanics were changed in other versions of counter-strike which made knifing non-competitive. You could get a headshot with a knife; how could you not like that! The graphics are definitely dated by today’s standards and high fps with a high refresh rate monitor does not feel as smooth as in most modern fps games. Counter-strike has always been one of the best game series for the cost compared to what you get because of the communities and mods that sprung up around it. Counter-strike does not have a built-in matchmaking ladder like csgo. This is the game that really accelerated the esports industry. There has been so much esports history made in counter-strike. The reason why steam was created in the first place was to give people a more efficient way of updating their games and a way to implement a cheating protection know as Valve Anti-Cheat with counter-strike being the main focus. This game reminds you just how good you had it when you were a kid and not many games can rival the impact counter-strike has had on the esports and gaming industry.",1696335174,1696341474,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Without any bots to play against, you can really only play against players, and that's nearly impossible at this point due to how old this game is and the little community that it has.
This game doesn't get many players, meaning it's almost impossible to actually play it unless you stay in a multiplayer server by yourself for hours and hours until someone actually joins.

If the developers add bots, I'll replay the game and edit my review accordingly. I do recommend this game, but my experience has just not been positive, due to the fact that there's nobody to play this game with, making this game basically turn into a ""walk around and shoot stuff and do nothing else"" simulator.

Counter-Strike was created as a modification for [url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/trar/recommended/70]Half-Life[/url] and quickly took on a life of its own, eventually meriting a standalone release by Valve. Its development process more or less invented the concept of the public beta. At one point around its public release, Internet traffic for the original surpassed the entire traffic output of Italy. The game itself across all its iterations can be described as easy to learn yet hard to master, like so many good games. Unlike chess and [i]go[/i] however, CS primarily revolves around shooting people.

On the surface, it's simple. Counter-terrorists must stop terrorists from planting a bomb at a strategic location, or rescue hostages that the terrorists are holding. There's a handful of other modes included with the original, but they're almost never played. Players earn money over each round (more for winning and killing) to purchase more suitable guns and equipment. This formula hasn't really changed across the entire series, though CS:GO (now CS2) would eventually add battle royale and cooperative modes.

In practice, rounds can sometimes end with one team being killed before any objectives can be seen to. Apart from a couple of series quirks that people have learned to love - or exploit, if they're Pro Gamers™ - CS is fairly realistic.


One thing CS has going for it that I haven't seen mentioned much is that you can play in bite-sized chunks if you want to. As far as I know, the reasons for it not being mentioned much are that Global Offensive has a competitive mode that encourages playing for entire matches, and that more dedicated players will often play for hours. Strictly speaking, I recommend playing in chunks: CS can get tense and difficult depending on your skill and the skill of your opposition.

However, the pacing is such that it's not exactly the hyperactive bulletfest most of today's shooters are: matches can end up as deadly games of cat and mouse as often as they erupt into firefights. The tension that gives can make any old match feel like you're doing pro plays. Related is the fact that there is no prestige - apart from matchmaking rank in Global Offensive - or killstreaks or what have you for players to literally level the playing field with. It can be frustrating to miss an opponent's head by a hair only for them to not miss in turn, or to be oneshotted out of the blue, but it's reassuring to know that skill is the primary factor here.

Another interesting thing is the individual-team dynamic you usually see on display. Most players, especially Real Pro Gamers™, place a high emphasis on very skilled aiming, but a well-coordinated team that knows how to position themselves on a given map will generally have a big advantage against a team of lone wolf headshotters. CS doesn't explicitly encourage team play or punish a lack of it like more hardcore shooters do.


This particular entry in the series still holds up in my view. The graphics are classic like a fine wine, and you get the no-frills base gameplay that made the series what it is. It's still fun, though the worst thing about the design is that smoke grenades are barely any useful. If you're looking to get into the series I would equally recommend [url=http://store.steampowered.com/recommended/recommendgame/240]the Source version[/url] or the cheaper, newer, more popular albeit more toxic Counter-Strike 2, unless your computer is very underpowered.

The main advantage this first entry has over the rest of its series is that you can play it on pretty much any computer these days, although Source is only a [i]little[/i] more punishing on today's computers. Some of the default maps are kind of mediocre (if somewhat classic) and there's no default bot support, but unlike the beautified expansion-slash-sequel [url=http://store.steampowered.com/recommended/recommendgame/80]Condition Zero[/url], you'll still find a lot of people in multiplayer; even more than in Source!

Please avoid Counter-Strike Nexon: Studio though. It may be based off this game, but it is bad.",1469386872,1696329169,True,3,0,0.572681725025177002,0,True,False,False

[h2]Rating: ★★★☆☆[/h2]

Playing Counter-Strike  is like attending a virtual masquerade ball where everyone's wearing bulletproof vests and armed with AK-47s. It's a dance of strategy, chaos, and the occasional hilarious ""no-scopes"" that turn the battlefield into a comedy of errors. Grab your armor and get ready to cha-cha with terrorists and counter-terrorists alike!

[h3]Pros:[/h3]

1. [b]Time-Tested Gameplay:[/b] The gameplay is a relic of the past that aged like fine wine. It's like playing a classic board game where the rules are etched in stone, and everyone knows the dance steps.

2. [b]Tactical Depth:[/b] Counter-Strike  is the thinking person's shooter. It's like chess, but instead of knights and bishops, you have terrorists planting bombs and counter-terrorists defusing them.

3. [b]Community and Mods:[/b] The game boasts a vibrant community that's been keeping it alive for decades. Mods and custom maps are like remixes, breathing new life into the familiar tunes of Dust and Aztec.

4. [b]Low System Requirements:[/b] Counter-Strike  can run on a toaster. It's like the friend who's always invited to the party because they're low-maintenance and know how to have a good time.

5. [b]Nostalgia Factor:[/b] For many players, Counter-Strike  is a trip down memory lane. It's like finding your old mixtape and realizing it's still as cool as you remember.

[h3]Cons:[/h3]

1. [b]Outdated Graphics:[/b] The graphics have aged more than a time-traveling DeLorean. For players accustomed to modern visuals, it might feel like staring at a painting from a different era.

2. [b]Hackers' Haven:[/b] The game's age also makes it a haven for hackers who have honed their craft in the virtual underworld. It's like attending a dance party where some folks have mastered the art of teleportation.

3. [b]Steep Learning Curve for Newcomers:[/b] New players might feel like they've stepped into a tactical minefield. The learning curve is steeper than climbing Everest, especially when facing off against seasoned veterans.

4. [b]Limited Variety of Maps:[/b] While the classics are timeless, the map variety can feel a bit constrained. It's like having a favorite dance move, but sometimes you want to try something new.

5. [b]Occasional Toxicity:[/b] The community, while vibrant, has its fair share of toxic players. It's like being the new kid at school; you might encounter a few bullies on the virtual playground.

[h3]Conclusion:[/h3]

Counter-Strike  is the granddaddy of tactical shooters, offering a nostalgic dance with terrorists and counter-terrorists. While it might not boast the flashy moves of its modern counterparts, it's still a classic groove that gets the heart pumping.

""Oh, yes, let's blindfold everyone briefly, and may the best marksman with a sense of direction win!""

Two opposing teams—the Terrorists and the Counter Terrorists—compete in game modes to complete objectives, such as securing a location to plant or defuse a bomb and rescuing or guarding hostages. At the end of each round, players are rewarded based on their individual performance with in-game currency to spend on more powerful weapons in subsequent rounds. Winning rounds results in more money than losing and completing objectives such as killing enemy players gives cash bonuses. Uncooperative actions, such as killing teammates, results in a penalty.
Originally a modification for Half-Life, the rights to Counter-Strike, as well as the developers working on it, were acquired by Valve in 2000.
The game received a port to Xbox in 2003. It was also ported to OS X and Linux in the form of a beta in January 2013. A full release was published in April 2013.
Counter-Strike is considered one of the most influential first person shooters in history. The series has a large competitive community and has become synonymous with first person shooters. As of August 2011, the Counter-Strike franchise has sold over 25 million units.

10,146487610,76561198037642560,0,6,184,0,184,1694970107,"Counter-Strike is a Half-Life mod where you are put on a team of either terrorists or counter-terrorists. Each team has to work together to achieve a certain objective or eliminate the opposing team, whichever happens first. The unique feature is that you are given money at the start of each round to buy weapons, armor, and other useful equipment. There are multiple game modes and maps.

The problem I have with this game is that I bought it twenty-three years too late. First of all, there are no tutorials or instruction booklets that come with this game (at least on Steam). You have to read guides made by other players like I did if you want to know even just the pure basics of gameplay. It helps to have experience with other GoldSrc (the Half-Life engine) games too. After you find a server near you that uses your language (English language servers in the United States are not as common as you might think), you'll most likely be stuck playing on the most popular map forever: [b]de_dust2[/b] (a desert map where you either have to deploy a bomb as terrorists or prevent the bomb from being deployed as counter-terrorists). So, if you wanted to play the other game modes or maps, good luck on your search. Anyways, if you're a noob to the game like me, you're going to be wrecked. There are many skills that need to be learned in order to become a decent player. These range from the various types of ""hopping"" to ""wallbangs"" AKA shooting players through walls - which I am still not sure is fair...

Despite all these struggles for new players, the game is still what it needs to be: fun! It's easy to start playing right away, and that's one of the benefits to not having a tutorial. In just a few clicks, you're playing a match with people that have been doing it for over twenty years. The servers I played on didn't have terrible people either - just the standard FPS trash talk you'd expect. I could play this game for a long time and get better at it, but I simply don't care enough to do that. My proudest moment? Getting two frags at the same time.

10,37351243,76561198320182802,0,17,374276,4,133,1708517997,"One of the most admirable aspects of Counter-Strike is its focus on skill and strategy over flashy gimmicks. The game's gunplay is remarkably satisfying, rewarding players who can master the intricacies of recoil control, weapon selection, and aiming precision. Each match is a test of skill and teamwork, creating a sense of satisfaction when you pull off a well-coordinated attack or a clutch round win.

The maps in Counter-Strike are masterfully crafted. From the tight corridors of Dust II to the more open spaces of Nuke, every map has a distinct design that encourages different playstyles and strategies. Map control, communication, and tactical positioning play a pivotal role, ensuring that each match feels unique and dynamic.

Counter-Strike's emphasis on teamwork and communication is truly special. Whether you're defusing a bomb as a counter-terrorist or planting it as a terrorist, success requires coordination and cooperation with your teammates. The reliance on callouts, strategies, and well-executed plans fosters a sense of camaraderie that few other games can replicate.

Despite its simplicity in terms of graphics and mechanics, Counter-Strike has a universal appeal. The game's accessibility makes it easy for new players to jump in, while its depth keeps veterans engaged and continuously improving. This balance ensures that Counter-Strike remains a staple in the gaming world, drawing in players of all skill levels.

The modding community surrounding Counter-Strike is a testament to the game's enduring impact. The creation of new maps, game modes, and skins ensures that the game constantly evolves and remains fresh, even after all these years. This community-driven content extends the lifespan of the game and adds an extra layer of enjoyment.

In an era of constantly evolving gaming trends, Counter-Strike stands as a timeless classic that has defined the competitive FPS genre. Its focus on skill, strategy, and teamwork, coupled with its accessible yet deep mechanics, ensures that Counter-Strike remains a benchmark for excellence in the world of gaming. Whether you're a newcomer or a long-time fan, Counter-Strike offers an experience that continues to shine brightly.",1511535703,1694764359,True,11,0,0.606718838214874268,0,True,False,False

Game is old and nice but aged poorly. Servers are always fighting each other. Some public servers give malware. Boosting is a scam and anyone who says otherwise is irrevocably incompetent. Want a good FPS experience? Play another game. 

As for Zombie-based server...
P2W is putting it nicely. If games could contract and die of cancer, this game is for you. Want to listen to the other guy? Waste your $10 and then have this game sit in your library collecting dust. :)

Now? 2/10

In the realm of gaming, where trends and innovations often shift like the sands of a digital hourglass, Counter Strike 1.6 stands as an enduring masterpiece, its brilliance transcending the constraints of time itself. This virtual symphony of strategy and camaraderie, devoid of the visual grandeur that modern gaming flaunts, is a resounding testament to the profound notion that true artistry lies not in the grandeur of graphics, but in the depth of experience.

As I navigate the pixelated landscapes of Counter Strike 1.6, an overwhelming tide of nostalgia washes over me, carrying me back to days when pixels were both our limitations and our canvas. Every footstep, every bullet fired, carries with it the echoes of bygone moments, reminding me that the passage of years cannot erode the significance of the memories forged within this digital arena. The game is more than a series of levels and objectives; it's a portal to our personal histories, a lens through which we relive our youthful fervor and unbridled excitement.

For more than two decades, Counter Strike 1.6 has wielded its banner as the paragon of shooter games, an archetype by which others are measured, and a cornerstone of the gaming universe. Its gameplay mechanics, while seemingly simplistic in comparison to today's sensory spectacles, remain a testament to the axiom that complexity isn't the sole purveyor of greatness. The mastery lies in how it distills the essence of competition, skill, and teamwork into a concoction that's as potent now as it was two decades ago.

In an era when a cavalcade of polygons and lifelike textures often takes center stage, Counter Strike 1.6 emerges as a powerful reminder that true artistry transcends pixels and polygons. Its austere aesthetics merely provide a backdrop for a symphony of strategy and camaraderie that resonates on a higher plane. This game is a rebuke to the notion that visual splendor is a prerequisite for greatness, a testament to the irrefutable truth that a game's worth is measured in the heartbeats it quickens, the friendships it forges, and the memories it bequeaths.

Counter Strike 1.6 doesn't just defy the ephemeral nature of gaming trends; it shatters it. As I stand on the virtual precipice, gazing at the same pixelated landscapes that captivated me years ago, I am struck by the realization that a masterpiece is not confined to an era. It's an entity that transcends its own creation, an artwork that defies the eroding touch of time, and a testament to the immutable bond between player and game.

So, as I load up Counter Strike 1.6 and embark on another virtual odyssey, I do so with a heart full of nostalgia, a mind attuned to the timeless mechanics, and a soul humbled by the knowledge that true brilliance remains unswayed by the shifting tides of technological progress. This is not just a game; it's an ethereal journey, a celebration of enduring camaraderie, and a reminder that pixels and polygons are mere vessels, while the true legacy is etched in the indelible memories of those who dared to embrace its brilliance.",1692709822,1692710126,True,6,1,0.59643787145614624,2,True,False,False

2 large eggs
2 ½ cups all-purpose flour
1 ½ teaspoons baking soda
1 teaspoon baking powder
½ teaspoon salt
Directions
Beat butter, peanut butter, white sugar, and brown sugar with an electric mixer in a large bowl until smooth; beat in eggs.

Roll dough into 1-inch balls and place 2 inches apart onto ungreased baking sheets. Flatten each ball with a fork, making a crisscross pattern.
Bake in the preheated oven until edges are golden, about 10 minutes. Cool on the baking sheets briefly before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.

Well, step into the time machine and welcome to Counter-Strike 1.6, the game that taught us that camping wasn't just for summer vacations.

Back in the day, we waited longer for our dial-up connection than for a round to start. But oh, the sweet satisfaction of that headshot after patiently lining up your pixels! You could practically hear the 'thwack' of the CRT monitor when you hit your mark.

The graphics were so pixelated, you'd think the terrorists were trying to plant a bomb made out of Minecraft blocks. And don't even get me started on the hitboxes – they were as wonky as your grandma's antique radio.

Tactical gameplay? Nah, we preferred the ""spray and pray"" approach. Who needs strategy when you can just throw a smoke grenade and rush in with a Mac-10, hoping your dial-up didn't crash midway?

Remember de_dust2? That iconic map could fit in your pocket now, but back then, it was our universe. We knew every nook, cranny, and sneaky camping spot like the back of our oversized, trackball mice.

So, if you're feeling nostalgic for the days when LAN parties were a thing, when your mom yelled at you for hogging the phone line, and when a headset meant something you wore at an air traffic control tower – fire up CS 1.6, because those were the times when gaming was as simple and chaotic as your favorite family reunion.",1692395698,1692395698,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

Minh Le combined the tactical gameplay and anti-terrorism setting of Rainbow Six with the fluid movement and gunplay of Quake/Half-Life. In contrast to later iterations, Counter-Strike (CS 1.6)--despite its antiquated flaws--is the most fun to play due to its casual nature, lack of skill-based matchmaking, countless modded gamemodes, and loyal, friendly playerbase.

I personally use the deathmatch gamemode as an aim trainer, as CS 1.6 has the most unapologetic movement inaccuracy and recoil patterns. Flashbangs are just as unapologetic and their duration are usually a death sentence. Boxes can be penetrated by any gun, and rifles and LMGs can penetrate any wall. The game is free of bugs due to a lower complexity of map and player design.

By combining the concepts of some of the greatest games of all time, Le inadvertently spawned a competitive esports culture that would directly influence how CS:GO/2 would be developed. Not that CS 1.6 can't be competitive, but there is less of an emphasis when playing on current servers.

The primary defuse gamemode would later be used in Rainbow Six: Siege, thus inspiring the game it once replicated. Not to mention Riot Games' Valorant would combine the tactical defuse with hero shooter elements and Call of Duty's search and destroy would offer the gamemode in a fast-paced, arcadey environment.

It's safe to say I've invested countless hours in this classic masterpiece. From Jailbreak to Deathrun, and everything in between, this game has provided me with endless entertainment and unforgettable memories.

Jailbreak was an absolute blast, and completing tasks with friends made it even better. Deathrun was my go-to when I needed to kill time. Deathmatch served as the perfect playground.

As for Surf, Bhop, and Longjump, I must admit I wasn't the best, but it was always fun to try and improve. However, my absolute favorite mode was Zombie mode. The thrill of being a survivor or transforming into a zombie provided some intense moments.

I can't help but wonder how many brave souls fell victim to viruses in the process of downloading stuff from the servers.

On a nostalgic note, I fondly remember watching Pro Leagues and rooting for NAVI, and their star player, markeloff. I wonder what he's up to these days, but regardless, Counter-Strike 1.6 will forever hold a special place in my memories. This classic gem is a must-play for any FPS enthusiast.",1691449411,1691596242,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Because he was always with his friends or watching YouTube videos.

You can find my review to Counter-Strike: Condition-Zero, the remaster of Counter-Strike, [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/ciocolici/recommended/80?snr=1_5_9__402]here[/url].[/b]

Counter-Strike holds a special place in my heart, being both a curse and my primary hobby when I was a kid. Over the years, I've poured thousands upon thousands of hours into this iconic game, making it an integral part of my childhood and a constant source of nostalgia. Whenever I hear ""CS,"" memories of countless nights spent competing with friends and striving for greatness flood my mind.

CS's legacy in ESports is profound, and it wouldn't be an exaggeration to say that the world of competitive gaming wouldn't be what it is today without this game. Despite the decline of its ESports scene, the game's community remains remarkably vibrant, a testament to its enduring appeal.

However, for newcomers, diving into Counter-Strike can be a daunting endeavor. Mastering the recoil control, honing game sense, and understanding strategic gameplay can take thousands of hours. Moreover, the visuals have not aged gracefully, and the dated graphics might not resonate with today's generation of gamers who are used to more sophisticated visuals.

When I recently revisited the game, I was instantly transported back to my carefree days, filled with dreams of becoming a CS legend. The familiar sounds, the adrenaline-pumping gameplay—it all felt like a warm embrace from the past. However, I also noticed that what once seemed like a gaming masterpiece now feels outdated in some aspects.

Despite my nostalgic fondness, I realized that the game might not be as accessible to newcomers who have never experienced its prime. The gameplay might only truly resonate with those who have cherished memories of playing it back in the day.

Nonetheless, the fact that Counter-Strike has maintained a dedicated and thriving playerbase even after so many years speaks volumes about its lasting impact on the gaming world.

To rekindle the game's allure and draw in new players, an update that enhances its visuals to meet today's standards and perhaps introduces some modern gameplay tweaks would be a welcomed move. By preserving the essence of the classic CS experience while offering a fresh coat of paint, the game could attract a new generation of gamers while continuing to engage its devoted community.

Although recommending CS:GO as an alternative for newcomers seems like a logical choice, it's essential to recognize that the two games differ significantly in terms of gameplay and player experience. Counter-Strike requires a higher level of skill and precision, making it a more punishing and competitive environment. On the other hand, CS:CO (Classic Offensive) could be a promising alternative for new players once it reaches its full development potential.

In conclusion, Counter-Strike remains a cherished relic in the gaming world, a masterpiece that shaped the ESports landscape and left an indelible mark on its players. For those who have lived and breathed CS in its prime, the game will forever hold a special place in their hearts.",1633865995,1690882506,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Shooting, due to internal game logic, requires a lot more of short bursts or even semi-auto then later games however, spraying is still viable at closer ranges. Distinction between main guns is a lot more prominent. AK is shot in semi a lot more than other guns, M4 w/ suppressor attached is easiest to spray and non-suppressed M4 is somewhere in-between.

Movement feels very different from later games as well. Pressing crouch for a brief moment makes you jump for a very small height which, allows you to peak over head level cover for info. Also, you can double-tap for even bigger effect or bind to mousewheel to be able to ""bob"" continuously as you move making yourself harder to headshot. Usual movement mechanics are different too thus, 1.6 is worth trying at least due to KZ, surf and bhop being unique experience.

Overall, recommended to anyone who played GO/Source/2 at least to familiarize yourself with Counter-Strike's history and, who knows, maybe you like it so much, it becomes your main.",1433164325,1690876931,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It's not uncommon to encounter players who are quick to kick you if they perceive your skills to be lacking.

For newcomers seeking a space to practice and improve their gameplay, Counter Strike 1.6 might not be the most welcoming environment. The competitive nature of the game combined with the presence of experienced players can make it challenging for beginners to find their footing without facing criticism or even outright bullying.

Despite these aspects, Counter Strike 1.6 still holds a certain charm. Its nostalgic graphics and gameplay continue to attract a dedicated community of players who appreciate its classic appeal.

Maybe we need to make it popular again, because this game is still good and playable.

I Understand that people not playing this game anymore because this game is to old, and there is so many competitors such as Valorant, CS:GO, COD, etc.

But, this game is actually better then all the FPS game, for me ofc, i don't know about the others. It's because you don't need high spec, even in low spec this game still playable, and i love how to server things go, like we can choose any room, i mean that's cool.

one last thing about the game is, the game doesn't have ""Matchmaking"", i mean such thing like ""Queue Match"".

Developed by Valve Corporation, this timeless title has captured the hearts of players worldwide for its strategic gameplay, intense firefights, and dedicated community. Whether you're a veteran of the series or a newcomer, Counter-Strike offers an adrenaline-pumping experience that continues to stand the test of time.

One of the standout features of Counter-Strike is its emphasis on tactical teamwork and precise gunplay. The game divides players into two teams: terrorists and counter-terrorists, each with distinct objectives. Coordination, communication, and strategic planning are essential for success. The game rewards players who master map knowledge, utilize effective strategies, and showcase skillful aim. The competitive nature of Counter-Strike fosters an immersive and rewarding experience that keeps players coming back for more.

The gunplay in Counter-Strike is exceptionally well-crafted. Each weapon feels distinct, with realistic handling and mechanics. Mastering recoil patterns, understanding weapon behavior, and honing your accuracy become essential for achieving victory. The balance between the various weapon options ensures that no single strategy or loadout dominates the gameplay, promoting diverse playstyles and strategic decision-making.

Counter-Strike's map design is a testament to its excellence. From classic maps like Dust II and Nuke to the wide range of community-created maps available, there's a rich variety to cater to different playstyles and strategies. The layouts are intricately crafted, offering multiple paths, chokepoints, and opportunities for tactical maneuvers. Map knowledge and understanding player dynamics are crucial for gaining the upper hand in engagements, making each round a thrilling and dynamic experience.

The game's longevity can be attributed to its dedicated community and active competitive scene. Counter-Strike boasts a passionate player base that continues to refine their skills, create custom content, and compete in tournaments at both amateur and professional levels. The competitive matchmaking system ensures balanced and challenging matches, fostering a sense of progression and achievement.

Counter-Strike's accessibility is another strength. The game can run on a wide range of systems, allowing players with varying hardware capabilities to participate. It also offers various gameplay modes, including casual matches, competitive ranked play, and community-created mods. This flexibility ensures that players of all skill levels and preferences can find an enjoyable and engaging experience within Counter-Strike.

It's important to note that the learning curve of Counter-Strike can be steep, particularly for newcomers to the series or the first-person shooter genre. The game's emphasis on skill, map knowledge, and teamwork may initially present a challenge. However, with practice and perseverance, the sense of accomplishment derived from mastering the game's mechanics is immensely satisfying.

In conclusion, Counter-Strike stands tall as an iconic multiplayer shooter that has left an undeniable legacy. Its strategic gameplay, precise gunplay, and vibrant community have solidified its position as a staple in the gaming world. Whether you're seeking intense firefights, cooperative teamwork, or competitive matches, Counter-Strike delivers a compelling and enduring experience. Join the ranks, test your skills, and immerse yourself in the heart-pounding action of Counter-Strike.",1684943735,1688614650,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

Even after all these years, it remains an iconic and timeless first-person shooter that continues to captivate players with its addictive gameplay, intense competition, and strong community.

First and foremost, the gameplay mechanics of Counter-Strike 1.6 are nothing short of exceptional. It strikes the perfect balance between tactical depth and accessibility, making it easy for newcomers to jump in and learn the basics while providing a high skill ceiling that rewards dedicated players. The tight gunplay, realistic weapon handling, and emphasis on teamwork create an exhilarating and strategic experience that has stood the test of time.

One of the defining features of Counter-Strike 1.6 is its vibrant and dedicated community. Even years after its release, you can still find active servers bustling with players from around the world. This thriving community ensures that you'll always find opponents to test your skills against, and the competitive nature of the game fosters a sense of camaraderie and teamwork that few other titles can match.

The map design in Counter-Strike 1.6 is a masterclass in level creation. From the iconic Dust and Dust 2 to the tense and claustrophobic corridors of Nuke, each map is meticulously crafted to offer a unique gameplay experience. The strategic chokepoints, hiding spots, and various routes create a dynamic and ever-evolving battlefield, ensuring that no two matches play out the same way.

Counter-Strike 1.6 also excels in its weapon balance. Each firearm has its own distinct characteristics and serves a specific purpose, encouraging players to experiment with different loadouts and find their preferred playstyle. The game's economy system adds an additional layer of strategy, as managing your resources and making smart purchasing decisions can often be the key to victory.

Furthermore, Counter-Strike 1.6's longevity can be attributed in part to its modding community. The game supports an extensive array of mods, including custom maps, game modes, and player-created content. This constant influx of fresh content ensures that there's always something new and exciting to discover, providing endless hours of entertainment beyond the core gameplay.

Visually, Counter-Strike 1.6 may show its age compared to modern titles, but its art direction and distinctive aesthetic have a charm of their own. The simplicity of the graphics allows for smooth performance even on lower-end systems, ensuring a consistent and enjoyable experience for a wide range of players.

In conclusion, Counter-Strike 1.6 remains an undisputed classic in the first-person shooter genre. Its addictive gameplay, skill-based mechanics, and strong community have cemented its place in gaming history. Whether you're a longtime fan or a newcomer eager to experience the roots of competitive shooters, Counter-Strike 1.6 is an absolute must-play. It's a testament to the enduring brilliance of a game that has brought joy and excitement to countless players worldwide for over two decades.",1687939603,1687939603,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Rating: ★★★★★

Introduction:
Counter-Strike 1.6, the iconic first-person shooter developed by Valve Corporation, holds a special place in the hearts of gamers worldwide. Released in 2000, this game revolutionized the FPS genre and has since become a benchmark for competitive multiplayer gaming. As a devoted player, I'm here to share my thoughts and celebrate the enduring legacy of Counter-Strike 1.6.

Gameplay and Mechanics:
Counter-Strike 1.6's gameplay is unparalleled, offering a perfect blend of skill, strategy, and teamwork. The game features fast-paced, intense rounds where players assume the roles of either counter-terrorists or terrorists. Each side has unique objectives, such as planting or defusing bombs or rescuing hostages, creating dynamic and adrenaline-fueled gameplay. The tight gunplay mechanics, emphasis on accurate shooting, and recoil control require precision and mastery, making every kill and clutch moment incredibly satisfying.

Map Design and Balance:
Counter-Strike 1.6 boasts a diverse selection of maps, each meticulously crafted for competitive play. The map design strikes a remarkable balance, offering strategic routes, chokepoints, and environmental elements that encourage tactical decision-making. From the iconic Dust II to the tactical Inferno, each map presents unique challenges and opportunities for players to outsmart their opponents. The longevity and popularity of these maps are a testament to their enduring appeal and balanced gameplay.

Community and Competitive Scene:
The Counter-Strike 1.6 community is a vibrant and passionate one, fostering a competitive and tight-knit environment. Whether playing with friends in LAN parties or competing in online leagues, the game's community-driven nature creates a sense of camaraderie and excitement. Counter-Strike 1.6's competitive scene has produced legendary players and unforgettable moments, with professional tournaments and championships drawing massive audiences. The enduring popularity of the game, even after two decades, is a testament to its competitive depth and enduring appeal.

Modding and Customization:
Counter-Strike 1.6's modding and customization capabilities have contributed to its lasting legacy. The game's extensive modding community has developed countless player-created maps, weapon skins, and modifications, enriching the gameplay experience. These mods have not only expanded the game's content but also demonstrated the creativity and dedication of the player base, keeping the community engaged and fostering innovation within the game.

Legacy and Influence:
Counter-Strike 1.6's impact on the gaming industry cannot be overstated. It pioneered the concept of objective-based team gameplay, and its influence can be seen in subsequent FPS titles. The game's focus on skill, precision, and teamwork has shaped the competitive gaming landscape, inspiring countless players to pursue esports careers. Counter-Strike 1.6's enduring legacy continues to be felt in the success of its successors, such as Counter-Strike: Global Offensive.

Conclusion:
Counter-Strike 1.6 stands as a timeless classic that has left an indelible mark on the FPS genre. With its addictive gameplay, strategic depth, and passionate community, the game remains as captivating and enjoyable today as it was at its release. Counter-Strike 1.6 is not just a game; it's a cultural phenomenon that has shaped the landscape of competitive gaming.

I am a single father for my son who is now 10 years old. My son recently started playing CS 1.6.

In less than a week, he has already played more than 20 hours.

It was terrible for me, because it was already hard enough for me to spend time with my son.
because he was always with his friends or watching YouTube videos.

So I decided to create a Steam account to play with my son. I started playing but it was my first time playing a video game since the 90s so I was pretty lost. I asked my son for help and we spent several hours together playing this game.

I liked it as it was the best time I have had with my son since my wife died. Playing video games reminded me that there is fun in everything and it brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside of the house.",1684758050,1684758050,True,2,1,0.406122773885726929,0,True,False,False

Counter-Strike is an exceptional first-person shooter (FPS) game that has captured the hearts of millions of players worldwide since its inception. Developed by Valve Corporation, Counter-Strike offers an intense and strategic gameplay experience that is hard to match. In this review, we will explore the key elements that make Counter-Strike a unique and captivating game.

One of the defining features of Counter-Strike is its emphasis on teamwork and tactical gameplay. Unlike many other FPS games, Counter-Strike requires players to work together as a team to achieve objectives. Communication and coordination are vital, as players must strategize, plan their movements, and execute precise manoeuvre’s to outsmart their opponents. The depth of teamwork and strategy in Counter-Strike sets it apart from other games in the genre.

Another standout aspect of Counter-Strike is its realistic and balanced weapon mechanics. The game offers a wide array of weapons, each with its own characteristics and handling. From pistols to sniper rifles, every weapon has its purpose and requires skillful handling to master. Additionally, Counter-Strike's recoil system adds a layer of authenticity, making it essential for players to learn to control their shots. The weapon mechanics in Counter-Strike contribute to the game's skill-based gameplay, rewarding precision and accuracy.

Counter-Strike's competitive scene is another factor that makes it truly exceptional. The game has become a staple in the world of eSports, with professional tournaments drawing in massive audiences and offering substantial prize pools. The highly competitive nature of Counter-Strike pushes players to constantly improve their skills, leading to a vibrant and dedicated community. The thrill of competing against skilled opponents and the prospect of climbing the ranks adds an addictive element to the game.

Furthermore, Counter-Strike boasts a remarkable map design that enhances gameplay diversity. Each map is meticulously crafted, offering a unique layout and distinct tactical possibilities. Whether it's navigating tight corridors in close-quarters combat or strategically positioning oneself for long-range engagements, the maps in Counter-Strike provide endless opportunities for creative strategies and memorable moments. The constant updates and addition of new maps by the developers ensure that the game remains fresh and exciting.

In terms of graphics and audio design, Counter-Strike strikes a balance between visual appeal and performance optimization. While the game may not have the most cutting-edge graphics compared to newer titles, it maintains a clean and timeless aesthetic that doesn't distract from the core gameplay. The sound design, on the other hand, is exceptional, with distinct audio cues that help players locate enemies and plan their next move.

In conclusion, Counter-Strike is a true gem in the FPS genre, offering a thrilling and strategic gameplay experience. Its focus on teamwork, balanced weapon mechanics, competitive scene, map design, and solid audio design set it apart from its competitors. Counter-Strike has stood the test of time and continues to captivate players with its addictive gameplay and vibrant community. Whether you are a seasoned player or new to the game, Counter-Strike is a must-play for anyone seeking an exhilarating and challenging FPS experience.

The original CS is still a fun game, totally worth playing. But if you're looking for an authentic server experience, sad to say is hard to find one, especially with most of the community servers in the game that's mostly hosted by Russians, and some Asian servers, that could sometimes put your PC at risk 

If you could spare a few bucks, buy it for your friends too, try setting up your own servers together with your own DIscord community and maybe setup LAN play with your friends, that is if they brought a laptop or just hit the internet cafe in your area (if there's one available). Plus, with the full package it includes Condition Zero for those who are interested to try out.

Counter-Strike is an iconic first-person shooter that has left an indelible mark on the gaming industry. As a fan of the series since its inception, I can confidently say that the original Counter-Strike is a game that has stood the test of time and remains a benchmark for multiplayer shooters.

One of the most notable aspects of Counter-Strike is its simplicity. The game pits terrorists against counter-terrorists in intense rounds of tactical gameplay. With limited resources and no respawns, every decision matters. The gameplay is fast-paced, strategic, and incredibly rewarding. The combination of teamwork, skill, and communication required to succeed is what sets Counter-Strike apart from other shooters.

The arsenal of weapons in Counter-Strike is iconic, from the trusty AK-47 to the precise AWP sniper rifle. Each weapon has its unique characteristics, and mastering their use requires practice and skill. The balance of weapons and their realistic recoil patterns add depth to the gameplay, making for thrilling gunfights and satisfying kills.

The maps in Counter-Strike are legendary, with names like Dust, Inferno, and Nuke etched into gaming history. Each map has its own layout, chokepoints, and strategic spots, making for dynamic and ever-changing gameplay. The level design encourages teamwork, communication, and strategic planning, creating a unique and immersive experience with every match.

Counter-Strike's multiplayer community is one of its greatest strengths. The game has fostered a passionate and dedicated player base that spans across the globe. Playing with friends or jumping into a server with strangers, the camaraderie and competitive spirit of the Counter-Strike community are palpable. The game has also spawned a vibrant esports scene, with professional players and tournaments that continue to captivate audiences worldwide.

The graphics and sound in the original Counter-Strike may not be as flashy or realistic as modern games, but they are functional and effective. The focus is on gameplay and mechanics, and Counter-Strike delivers in spades. The game has a timeless appeal that transcends graphics and remains a testament to the power of gameplay and mechanics.

In conclusion, Counter-Strike is a game that has left an indelible mark on the gaming world. Its addictive gameplay, iconic weapons and maps, and vibrant multiplayer community have made it a classic that has stood the test of time. If you're a fan of first-person shooters or looking to experience a game that has defined a generation of shooters, Counter-Strike is a must-play. 5/5 - ""A Legendary Classic That Never Gets Old!",1681283627,1681283627,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

 This is the beginning of the life of countless young FPS games, and it is also the childhood in the hearts of countless people. It has been popular all over the world and is a model of the game industry that is imitated and even copied by subsequent games.  This game has been destined to be extraordinary since it was released. Countless servers have been turned on and off, and countless modules have been made and updated. Today it is still alive, living in an abandoned USB flash drive, living in someone’s memory  Here, live the word of mouth from old players to new players.
 Ten years ago, that ignorant boy first met with it, so he was fortunate enough to travel to every quiet corner of the desert and hear the melodious sound of Italian street corners. Ten years later, his school uniform was changed into a suit, and the years climbed up to his face, but when he double-clicked the black and white icon and returned here, he was still the brave boy back then.
 And it will never change.

The spreads on guns are ridiculous even after analyzing recoil patterns and burst firing. Too many variables to consider when it comes to firefights, that aren't explained at all, to even know if it was your fault you died or if you just got hit by lag. This is one of those games im sure runs flawless over LAN or with an optimal internet connection but is really frustrating(because its impossible to tell if its a user error) to get through when your aiming at an enemies head, fire, and the bullet goes completely off course(unless its a sniper). Considering range and the weapon, at optimal range the second bullet in a burst could be an inch off to 5ft away from where you were aiming. When playing this i feel like a nerd with no upper body strength or cardio who always misses leg day thrown into a battlefield with little to no experience even though i have fired multiple weapons in real life. Feels like a bit too much is up to luck to fully enjoy but i do like how chaotic it is and thats enough to keep me coming back for a random MP match here or there. Servers are very active for a game with this age. With all that said i haven't played a ""traditional"" hostage match yet just TDM and FFA but everything feels surprisingly slow and inaccurate, when im not immediately dying, which may work for sloower, traditional, more strategic based modes where you have the time and space to react in a controlled manner while coordinating with other team mates but feels like im carrying a sack of potatoes while trying to smoke a blunt playing TDM and FFA.

** EDIT **
after a long time later, i think i can rewrite this review.

First of all, that game is so old to play. Today's games haves much more technology.
Because of that, this game is literally old for new players who plays to today's games.
I think some people who dislikes to these games, they need to be refresh to himself (to play these kind of games).
Anyway, if you want to be like an old man, play this game (please).

I have a problem in this game, this issue may be happening on to my router i think.
I have a ping problem, whenever i play this game, it's always been that ping problem. Anyone helps me to fix that issue.

- Нет нормальных серверов, в частности ванильных. Практически все сервера накачивают тонну плагинов и форсируют тонну ненужных тебе вещей. Зайдя на один сервер, ты не сможешь вернуть привычное расположение пушки в правом углу. А если я не киберспортсмен, которому не нравится пушка в левом углу, а? Меню теперь это поменять не может и конфиг перезаписывается.
- Из-за того что все сервера не ванильные, как правило это не Counter-Strike. Всё от карт до геймплея меняется до неузнаваемости, порой до неиграбельности при наличии так называемых VIP.
- Мало нормальных русских серверо в таблице и те что есть для школололо с очевидной любовью к модифицированным серверам. Пинг навешивается огромный.

And let's not forget about its younger brother, CS:GO. I mean, sure, it's younger and more popular, but can it really compare to the OG? I think not.

Let me tell you, Counter-Strike may be old, but it's like a fine wine. It only gets better with age. The graphics may be outdated, but the gameplay is still top-notch. The guns may not have fancy skins, but they still pack a punch. And don't even get me started on the maps. Dust 2? More like ""Dust Too Good""!

But let's talk about CS:GO for a second. Sure, it's got better graphics and fancy skins, but what's the deal with all these newfangled weapons? What's next, a grenade launcher? Come on, now. And don't even get me started on the microtransactions. I don't want to have to take out a second mortgage on my house just to get a cool skin for my AK-47.

In conclusion, Counter-Strike may be old, but it's still got it where it counts. And CS:GO? Well, let's just say it's like that younger brother who's always trying too hard to be cool. Stick to what you know, kid.",1677352106,1677352106,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It has lots of mods, plugins and addons which you can play with and have a lot of fun. A few example of my favorite mods are: Kreedz, Zombie, Deathmatch, Gungame, WC3FT, Bhop, Co-op and many more. Unfortunately, people nowadays might think it's just old so they don't play it or at least give it a try, a thing which heartbreaks me... But anyway, it's worth spending time on this game and I think you won't regret it eventually if you have somebody to play with too. :)

Update 2020:
It is cool and all, but there aren't so many players willing to play and the game engine is very outdated (since I got these errors lately)

It was initially developed and released as a Half-Life modification by Minh ""Gooseman"" Le and Jess Cliffe in 1999, before Le and Cliffe were hired and the game's intellectual property acquired. Counter-Strike was released by Valve for Microsoft Windows in 2000, and is the first installment in the Counter-Strike series. Several remakes and ports were released on Xbox, as well as OS X and Linux.

Set in various locations around the globe, players assume the roles of counter-terrorist forces and terrorist militants opposing them. During each round of gameplay, the two teams are tasked with defeating the other by the means of either achieving the map's objectives or eliminating all of the enemy combatants. Each player may customize their arsenal of weapons and accessories at the beginning of every match, with currency being earned after the end of each round.",1675815250,1675815271,True,0,0,0.47413790225982666,0,True,False,False

My son got this game for Christmas in 2022 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my husband had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.

I am 41.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with... The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.",1672975031,1672975031,True,2,1,0.5,0,True,False,False

The series began on Windows in 1999 with the first game, Counter-Strike. It was initially released as a modification (""mod"") for Half-Life and designed by Minh ""Gooseman"" Le and Jess ""Cliffe"" Cliffe before the rights to the game's intellectual property were acquired by Valve Corporation, the developers of Half-Life.

That original game was followed by Counter-Strike: Condition Zero, developed by Turtle Rock Studios and released in 2004. In November of that year, Counter-Strike: Source was released by Valve. Released eight months after Condition Zero, Source was a remake of the original Counter-Strike and the first in the series to run on Valve's newly created Source engine.[1] The fourth game in the main series, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, was released by Valve in 2012 for Windows, OS X, Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3. Hidden Path Entertainment, who worked on Counter-Strike: Source post-release, helped to develop the game alongside Valve.[2]

There have been several community-made spin-off titles created over the years. These include the Online series, Neo, and Nexon: Zombies.",1672308353,1672308353,True,0,0,0,0,True,True,False

Gameplay is truly special, since it defined a formula that nowadays still work perfectly: a team formed by terrorists has to plant a bomb and defend it until it explodes, or simply has to eliminate all the enemies. On the other hand there is a team formed by counter-terrorists has to defuse that bomb or eliminate all terrorists. There is a huge selection of weapons such as AK-47, M4, P90, MP5 or AWP. You can also equip yourself with kevlar and a helmet.

Graphically still hold up well. You can notice how old the game is, but who cares for the graphics if it's a frenetic game? 

Price, however, seems kind of overpriced for a game that is two decades old. Yeah, it's multiplayer, is fun, there are many actives players daily, but having some newer games in the franchise, this should be cheaper. My answer? Sales or the Valve pack.

Counter Strike is a fun game to play nowadays, since it can run in most of the PCs and has an active playerbase . You should buy it and play it",1645540561,1671560723,True,1,0,0.516129076480865479,0,True,False,False

Would I recommend it? F no, tons of way better games to play instead that are way more interesting. Don't waste your time with this crap unless you're a huge fat nerd like me who spends his Fridays playing obsolete garbage like this. Go play P.U.B.G. or that Fornite crap instead.

These dreams be waking me up at night (night, night)

You just trying to find where the tissue is
You can still be who you wish you is
It ain't happen yet
And that's what the intuition is (and I wonder)
When you hop back in the car
Drive back to the crib
Run back to their arms
The smokescreens
The chokes and the screams
You ever wonder what it all really mean
And I wonder if you know
What it means, what it means
And I wonder if you know
What it means to find your dreams
and I'm back on my grind
A psychic read my lifeline
Told me in my lifetime
My name would help light up the Chicago skyline
And that's what I'm (and I wonder)
Seven o'clock, that's primetime
Heaven'll watch, God calling from the hotlines
Why he keep giving me hot lines?
I'm a star, how could I not shine? (And I wonder)
How many ladies in the house (if you know)
How many ladies in the house without a spouse (what it means)
Something in your blouse got me feeling so aroused (what it means)
What you about? (And I wonder)
On that independent shit (if you know)
Trade it all for a husband and some kids (what it means)

My son got this game for Christmas in 2023 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well.

My name is Patrick Bateman.
I'm 27 years old.

I believe in taking care of myself, in a balanced diet, in a rigorous exercise routine.
In the morning, if my face is a little puffy, I'll put on an icepack while doing my stomach crunches.
I can do a thousand now.
After I remove the icepack, I use a deep-pore cleanser lotion.
In the shower, I use a water-activated gel cleanser.
Then a honey-almond bodyscrub.
And on the face, an exfoliating gel-scrub.
Then I apply an herb mint facial masque,
which I leave on for ten minutes while I prepare the rest of my routine.
I always use an aftershave lotion with little or no alcohol,
because alcohol dries your face out and makes you look older.
Then moisturizer, then an anti-aging eye balm, followed by a final moisturizing protective lotion.

There is an idea of a Patrick Bateman.
Some kind of abstraction, but there is no real me.
Only an entity-- something illusory.
And though I can hide my cold gaze...
and you can shake my hand and feel flesh gripping yours...
and maybe you can even sense our life styles are probably comparable,
I simply am not there.",1669834731,1669834731,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

I believe in taking care of myself and a balanced diet and rigorous exercise routine. In the morning if my face is a little puffy I'll put on an ice pack while doing stomach crunches. I can do 1000 now. After I remove the ice pack I use a deep pore cleanser lotion. In the shower I use a water activated gel cleanser, then a honey almond body scrub, and on the face an exfoliating gel scrub. Then I apply an herb-mint facial mask which I leave on for 10 minutes while I prepare the rest of my routine. I always use an after shave lotion with little or no alcohol, because alcohol dries your face out and makes you look older.

If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead, murdered by my brother-in-law Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, Hank came to me with a rather, shocking proposition. He asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using his connections in the drug world. Connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded, I... I always thought that Hank was a very moral man and I was... thrown, confused, but I was also particularly vulnerable at the time, something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me on a ride along, and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin so I agreed. Every day, I think back at that moment with regret. I quickly realized that I was in way over my head, and Hank had a partner, a man named Gustavo Fring, a businessman. Hank essentially sold me into servitude to this man, and when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn.
Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling out. From what I can gather, Hank was always pushing for a greater share of the business, to which Fring flatly refused to give him, and things escalated. Fring was able to arrange, uh I guess I guess you call it a ""hit"" on my brother-in-law, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured, and I wound up paying his medical bills which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge, working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring, and did so. In fact, the bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen in the ranks to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA, and about that time, to keep me in line, he took my children from me. For 3 months he kept them. My wife, who up until that point, had no idea of my criminal activities, was horrified to learn what I had done, why Hank had taken our children. We were scared. I was in Hell, I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, to end this nightmare, and in response, he gave me this. I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. I... All I could think to do was to make this video in hope that the world will finally see this man, for what he really is.",1669559161,1669559161,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False
