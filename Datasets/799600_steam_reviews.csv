Once I got over the initial hurdle I found the game to be a ton of fun. Even on easier settings it's a challenge, and requires planning and good resource management. A loss of a ship, even your primary vessel isn't always cause for a save scum, or restart.

The ability to largely rebuild your ship on a whim is a welcome addition, and the ability to build with scavenged resources is a huge plus.

My only complaint is that the various build options aren't as clear as I'd like them to be. Copying, v. deleting, grabbing, they're all available, but I often find myself unsure of which control I need to achieve my goal. I'm sure this will become more automatic as I play more.

The dev has been working on it since at least 2015, but it's still not content-rich because he's been on his own almost the whole time. Gameplay : pretty much 2D Space Engineers, without landable planets/moons (dev confirmed there won't ever be any), no controllable characters / factions / programmable blocks / drones, no variety in thrusters types either. No gravity generators / scenarios / world settings / rounded corners / beacons / all just-for-fun and RP blocks either.

Campaign is the same thing from solar system 1 to to the end. Sell garbage at neutral stations, kill pirates whose AI can only attack on sight even when your afk ship would kill them, they become garbage, repeat from step 1. Unlocking the whole tech tree in the very first system is probably doable too, then there's nothing new left.

Even modding support is barebones, leading to dozens of mods doing the exact same things with slightly different numbers and maybe copying a different space IP (you better love star wars... without wanting to play star wars instead?). Many good modders left since 2022-2023 patches hit and the modding wiki hasn't been decent in months. It currently redirects you to an old 2010's style non-updated wiki with security warnings...

The roadmap, while promising, moves forward very slowly. At first the graphics and music made think of FTL but I went back to FTL to compare, and realized this has no story, crew are all clones with the same stats and no abilities (no boarding btw), the music is kinda depressing, and while Cosmo is an OK game, it just feels worse. Factorio and space engineers come much closer to this but things are missing here. 
The QoL is good though and there is a minor update every 2 weeks (more npc ships and some bug fixes ; 1 new buildable part every X months if lucky). 
Hopefully the dev hires talent and does this game justice, before too many players grow out of painting ships fancy for hugging battles with no ramming damage...

It lags too badly to play. Limited play-styles.

I didn't want to thumbs down, however, there are a few caveats. This is a fun game, at first glance, and if you love a PvP environment then this game is for you. I learned a bit too late that it was designed as a PvP ship arena battler.

A PvE campaign does exist, however, that isn't the primary aspect of the game. It is fun for early stages, but you will notice some flaws in the late game. A big flaw is that it heavily focuses on building glass cannons. This is one of those games where you simply bring more weapons to the fight and cram it down the enemy's throat as quickly as possible before dying. You don't want ships that have mixed roles or combat styles, you must max one direction. Railgun ship? Go full railgun. Ion ship? Go full ions. It is an all or nothing type of deal.
You can assemble a fleet, however, the AI is a bit janky. When it comes to fleet battling, it requires a bit of micromanaging. Sometimes you will fight targets in pairs or even a fleet of ships. Make a tanky ship, draw aggro, and get your other ships to attack. The AI is not smart enough to engage multiple targets. You can only target one ship at a time, as such, they will ignore threats that flank them, this is made worse in fleet battles. If you want to engage multiple targets, break up your fleet and give each ship their own target. The AI has a problem of mindlessly hunting down the first target it sees. If the AI didn't see your tank, but rather your DPS, it will endlessly hunt it.
One of the most irritating things I noticed is that Railgun ships do not orient themselves to aim their ""Railgun"" at a specific part. This isn't a big issue in the early game with smaller ships that have a centralized design. In the late game where ships are huge and have multiple cockpits and reactors, this becomes a major problem. This means you must manually rotate the Railgun ship to aim its Railgun. Imagine a fleet of Railgun ships, this becomes a huge headache to micro. In the end, it becomes a pause-unpause game. If you just want to enjoy beautiful fireworks, this is not that type of game.
Something I noticed is the clunky weapon balance. In the end, it practically boils down to Flak, which shoots down anything projectile or missile, canceling a good fraction of weapons. Ion emitters, which can be linked and get huge damage boosting buffs, and N*clear Missles which vaporize anything in short bursts.

The missions aren't great, they are simple and repetitive. The only thing that makes them interesting is the variety of ships. There are some cool designs. However, players do not fight half-baked combat ships or non-combat ships for missions. Instead, players fight min-maxed, PvP designs. 
The only parts I actually had fun was in the early-game, where you could actually have varied ship designs and still be viable. The bad part is, you can't stay in the zones in the early-game and you are forced to move up.
In its current state, I would highly not recommend this game, at least not for full price, get it on sale. It is a PvP ship arena battler, sprinkled with a bare-bones PvE mode. Someone once commented it's like Starsector, and no, I disagree. It is nothing like Starsector. 

Lags like crazy closer to the late-game. I want to like this game a lot, but there's so many issues, I just wish I had my $20 back.",1707867558,1707867558,False,7,0,0.626436829566955566,0,True,False,True

Pro's
- Multiple ways to start the game.
- More than decent tutorial as you discover things.
- Decent amount of weapon choices in this stage of development.
- Steam workshop has great mods and game is directly connected to workshop.
- Debugging and modding guide for developers.
- Great ship management options if you want to optimize like a factory.

Cons
- Not enough of each type of missions if you do not want to strictly start with bounties.
- An ok start on the typical space game; hunter, gather, transport role mechanics.
- Lacking any sort to technology diversity. Still early in development but maybe consider a scaling progression based on factions.
- Some mods will not cause a crash in creative mode but crash in story. Modders problem but different modes lack consistency. 

Still planning to continue playing as I am enjoying learning new ways to build a ship that dont turn out as a square block in space. Will update post as things change.",1707517048,1707517048,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

+ Build your own ship and boldly fly whereever you want
+ You will be guided by one of the best structured guide I have seen in a long time
   Step by Step it explaines wheile you grow and modify/expand your ship
+ You can explore and fight at your own pace! No pushy game mechanic! That is awsome!
+ Many things can be configured from ""easy"" down to ""micro management"". do as you like best
+ No pesky food, oxygen or fuel managment! the game feels light to play yet has depth in every corner
+ lovely animations and smooth sounds give you all the candy you want
+ the interface is easy to learn and grows as you play, 
+ you learn everything quickly as you learn not to fight 5 enemies in a level 1 ship 
+ soon you will have stronger weapons, energy, armor and many other equipment at hand
+ build your ship in blueprint mode. that allows you to design ""I know what I am doing"" with final ""make it so""

Ever dreamed of being a cosmic architect, designing your own spacecraft with more gizmos than a Swiss Army knife? Look no further! Cosmoteers is like playing space Legos on steroids, except instead of building a simple castle, you're constructing vessels that would make Kirk jealous.

Warning: This game may cause acute addiction to spaceship aesthetics. I mean, who needs sleep when you can spend all night fine-tuning your ship's color scheme, debating the optimal placement of laser cannons, and arguing with your crew over whether the warp drive should be shaped like a potato or a pineapple?

But wait, there's more! If you enjoy watching your meticulously crafted masterpiece get obliterated by an enemy's missile barrage, then boy Oh boy, I do have good news for you! Cosmoteers delivers heart-pounding, explosive battles that'll have you on the edge of your seat (or spaceship) faster than you can say 'Houston, we have a problem.'

In summary, if you're a fan of intergalactic engineering, chaotic battles, and the occasional existential crisis as you watch your dreams go up in flames (literally), then Cosmoteers is the game for you.

This is a great early access game.  The ship building is better than anything out there.  If you like Legos, you'll LOVE arming your Legos and conquering the galaxy of other Legos.  

Praise aside, there are some glaring core issues that need fixed before this is ever considered ""done"":

1) The AI pathfinding is atrocious.  This is specifically on the friendly side as allied ships (yours or others), will  FREQUENTLY set collision courses toward one another in the heat of battle.  This results in the ships being locked together in a deathball to be picked off by enemy ships.  This seems to happen almost purposefully on the AI's part as I've sent fighters off in OPPOSITE directions only to have them move directly toward the same point.  

2) There are a lot of AI nonhostile ships that don't do anything.  While I get that it adds to the ambiance traffic, they take A LOT of processing power which makes the CPU slog at times.  Either give them a purpose (maybe trade between stations or mining?) or reduce the number of them.

Again, this game is decent and well worth the price in early access.  If the issues above aren't fixed before main launch, I will change my review to ""hot garbage"".",1706758225,1706758225,False,3,0,0.435774326324462891,0,True,False,True

I'm glad to say there's a whole universe to explore and it's one of those games people compare to Freelancer. Except that here, you don't just save up millions to buy a new ship, you can build EVERYTHING on your ship out of parts, from the ground up. It's really engaging to build your own ship and experiment with what works. Early Access updates have been frequent, with good communication - and it looks like they're working on a large 2.0 update to overhaul the universe too.

[b]Pros[/b]
- Excellent tutorial
- Great controls for moving the ship around
- You can target specific parts of enemy ships to blow off
- You can change the speed of time to skip long boring travel times
- You can salvage ships that you destroy to upgrade your own
- Lots of customisation options for a new game, such as galaxy size, salvaging, removing exploration, difficulty settings
- Your ship isn't just a set of parts like in Reassembly or Starcom Nexus - you actually have crew running around. When you salvage things, your crew does an EVA to fetch the parts. Those salvaged parts are physically stored on your ship. If you get attacked while salvaging, you have to call your crew back to your ship before you can leave
- Keeping in line with the realistic angle - munitions must be carried by crew from their storage to the gun. You have to think about where your storages are, not just that they exist
- Full refunds when you remove ship parts
- When you trade with a station, they physically transfer the goods from the ship to yours
- You can give your crew roles, and assign those roles to rooms. This lets you put gunners near guns, and forbid them to carry stuff around
- Probably the most customiseable control scheme in any game I've played. Everything can be changed / turned off

[b]Cons[/b]
- While I understand the ""everything must be connected logistically"" theme, I think it's strange that your ship's reactor doesn't automatically power everything on the ship. Instead, the reactor produces batteries, which have to be carried to parts.
- It appears to be impossible to manoeuvre during combat. You can either tell your ship to attack, or move, so you can't manually evade / turn and shoot
- A lot of menus are hidden behind right-clicking certain things, which isn't obvious

It's still in early access and I've only played a day, so I'll  speak mainly to the parts of the game that are finished at this point with the hopes that the development team will continue to knock the ball out of the park when they add more depth/variety to the campaign mode and other features that are planned to be released.

The ship building aspect of this game is near perfect.  Playing around with the editor is a joy, easily half the time I've spent in game.  They have managed to design an editor that is intuitive enough to get you going with your first few ships in just a few seconds but also allows for you to later develop and design ships of breathtaking size and complexity with the click of a few buttons.  The mirror toggle, ability to copy/paste, save and load designs are integrated so well.  The ship editor is so good that frankly it would be worth the purchase price for it alone.

The ship to ship combat in the game is exhilarating as well.  The same simple, intuitiveness that is present in the ship builder is here - controlling a ship and attacking your target is as easy as a single right click, but the ability to target specific components on an opponents hull, the rock/paper/scissors quality of the different weapon and armor configurations, and the fact that you can add as many ships to your fleet as you have people to man them allow for an unbelievable depth which frankly after almost 24 hours of play I have barely cracked the surface.  As you progress through the campaign, every battle becomes a challenge and a learning opportunity as you watch an enemy deck cannon penetrate your hull and nuke your precious reactor or your heavy laser blasters sputter and de-power mid dogfight because your crew management just isn't up to snuff. 

The story mode is off to a promising start.  The progression loop is simple - start with one of three starter ships, venture off and explore, mine, fight, and trade your way across galaxies of increasing difficulty and hostility, purchasing blueprints for new parts along the way.  The design of the campaign is intelligent, just like the ship designer - you are free to do whatever you want, buy and unlock any blueprints for any part you'd like - but the limiting factor is the amount of crew you can hire at any given time.  This is controlled by a 'fame' ranking, which increases over time as you complete missions.  In this way, a new player is able to go from a simple ship which takes half a brain cell to operate functionally and slowly add on and learn from their mistakes as they progress without feeling like there are random roadblocks or needing to 'unlock' certain features.  It also pushes you to design efficiently manned ships - if you figure this out early on, the crew limitation is less burdensome and allows you and your fleet to punch far above your weight.  I am hoping that they are able to add a whole lot more content and variety to the campaign mode, as of now it is incomplete and after you finish a galaxy or two it gets quite repetitive.

I haven't gotten a chance to participate in any PvP battles yet, but I have used the creative mode which is VERY fun to mess around and test ideas out in yet and I have played quite a bit of Co-Op story mode, which makes the game a whole lot more fun when you're learning the mechanics with a friend.

Boy do I hope the devs finish this one.

Imagine a ship's reactor produces batteries.  Your crew grabs the batteries from the reactor and runs across the ship to put them in the ship's engines, or laser gun, or shields.  So the design of the ship depends on easy accessibility for the crew to reach key parts of the ship efficiently to run batteries around the ship.  They also will have to man the guns when in a fight.  It makes the ship designs a little challenging, and sometimes some parts of the ship will never turn on and it's a matter of figuring out why the crew apparently doesn't have access to that part.

I like the ship design as it is a bit of a puzzle.  As you blow up enemy ships you can send your crew out into space to salvage the materials, and use those materials to either build new ships or to expand your current ship.

The game is in pretty good shape for EA - and there's a free demo that you can play as long as you like which just has some parts you won't have access to.

Minor complaint: the OS mouse settings are ignored.  But this can be manually overridden in the settings menu.

Thumbs up!


UPDATE: The developer is very responsive.  I complained about the mouse buttons, and wrote back that they are configurable in the menus, but he would also look into making them default to the OS mouse settings too.  So I went into the settings to try to find this, and I have to say EVERYTHING is configurable in the settings menu.

the good: 
very in depth build system and funtions, nearly endless possibility (up to 128x128 or 1000 x 1000 modded)
fun interactive combat and building function
a good way of balancing out progress with the crew capacity based on fame 
very addictive
multiplayer does not detrement other players in the party when one person wants to do something else in sector.


the bad:
crew capacity can be limiting if you do not understand combat and are losing fights due to ship size in a dangerous area.
neutral ship AI is dumb and ram into eachother or yourself causing problems with getting jammed into your ship and getting stuck.
allied ships in formation can be frustrating by turning off collision avoidance automatically to stay in formation and leading to a broken formation. 
a lot of information is hidden and forces discovery by testing in a creative server (an example is that ion lasers have decreasing damage with multiple lasers going into one crystal which is explained. what is NOT explained is that the damage bonus is based off of the lowest damage input laser, so if you have 5 lasers, 2 go into a crystal, 2 go into a crystal, and 1 into a central crystal, with the 2 duplex crystals going into the central one, the damage will be lower than if you hadavoided adding that 5th laser.)
game performance will slow down due to simulation of ship crew and materials on ground. i7-9700 @3.0 8 core, 32gb ram w/2080 can run a solid 100+fps until about danger level 10 on solo or danger level 6 on multiplayer with 3 players. once that point is reached the game will start to drop below 60fps. with 300+ crew, performace can stay above 30fps. with 300 crew on a single ship collecting resources from more than one danger level 13 ship, FPS drops below 15 on minimum settings

suggestions:
add more comprehensive tooltips (explosive device, door locations on parts, shield health/energy etc.)
ships lack an information screen to display minor information (weight, mass, etc.)
fixed ai to avoid collision
game optimization for framerate (a reduction in simulation of ships out of draw distance, removal of background, option to toggle crew on and off (visability) could assist as an option)
more weapon variety, there is a decent amount but some weapons overshadow others in terms of capability against enemy vessals.

I ended up tweaking a couple of things in the settings to lower the restrictions on how many crew members you can hire on ships depending on your fame level, and I really appreciate that the game lets you make such adjustments. Really, this game lets you make crazy amounts of little tweaks and adjustments even while in-game too, like assigning specific jobs to specific crew people and choosing how your weapons act and the distance that your ship(s) begin to attack hostiles. Giving crew specific jobs also lets you change their shirt colors to the red, gold, blue colors from a certain classic space opera show I love, and there are other nods to the the same show like hitting a button that says ""Engage"" and another that says ""Make it so"" to begin certain actions. Naturally, one of my first goals was to make a Starship Enterprise that was also a truly effective vessel, then after pulling that off and hijacking a couple of enemy ships to modify and repaint, I decided to make the robot planet Unicron as a massive mobile space station for my ships to roam around with. 
It all went really well. I had a blast, but then eventually it felt like I was just exploring sectors to make myself richer and kill more pirates with no real reason to care about doing so anymore. I think folks could get a lot more out of this game if getting to new sectors often resulted in finding new fun tech, weapons, or even cosmetics to buy/steal/win.

This game is a ton of fun. HOWEVER the combat is challenging to learn, it takes time to figure everything out. But practice (and a little Youtube) makes perfect. You can create your own fleet to manage and fight, or you could bring in a few friends and create an armada if you want! But be cautious and try to save before fights if you go into a new zone, get a feel for the next level of enemies. It will save you headaches. 
I've recently come back to the game after a break and was pleasantly surprised with the balance updates, new ships, and additional weapons/stations to add to your ships. I'm excited to see what the Devs will bring out next.

The building system is bad, obnoxious, and highly annoying.
Global design is AGAIN turned toward obfuscation and hiding very basic information. You're supposed to ""discover things"". The problem is that what you're supposed to find is so base that you should simply be told. (e.g. how shield really work and so on, a real tooltip wouldn't kill anyone)

Trading is pointless, enemies don't re-spawn, the rail gun is far far too OP the list goes on.

I would recommend the purchase and sale prices of items adjusting to make processed items sale values higher than the cost of their raw materials thus meaning you could buy the raw materials and then make them into finished products and make a profit not a loss. Currently buying any resource to make finished products loses you money which goes against all logic. Enemies need to re-spawn plain and simple just have a pirate base warp in every half hour or so and build 5 ships and if they get destroyed it makes more and if it's destroyed a new one will warp in somewhere else on the map in 30 minutes.

Lastly balance the weapons better right now the rail gun is super OP, I would recommend leaving it as is range and damage wise though just give armour a 95% damage resist vs rail gun shots meaning they are amazing for punching through shields to hit vulnerable parts but are a basically worthless against armour then balance the other weapons around as well. Right now the entire game is trivialised by building a massive rail gun and slapping enough engines on for over 90 reverse thrust and you've won the game. Nothing can catch you and the only way you can lose is if your stupid.

All in all it's an ok game and fun for a bit so get it on sale and hopefully as it's in early access these issues will get fixed and the game will get a functioning economy, re-spawning enemies and the weapons get sorted so you can't just win the game before leaving the very first area.",1704066197,1704066197,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,True

New players are expected to understand and strategize all the while you have a high risk of blowing up and getting set back to the very start.

The campaign mode feels extremely grindy and boring, and when enemies randomly fight you, gameplay quickly boils down to spamming right click to target specific enemy ship parts, or just blowing up and losing everything.

More than 50% of missions are fetch-quest styled, asking you to visit a certain number of signals or retrieve a certain number of resources, which gets boring extremely fast.

The other type of missions are bounty/elimination missions, and those are very hit or miss in terms of the profit to risk ratio, along with space stations running out of them very quickly in the early game.

This is disgusting for a space sandbox game to do, because in this genre of game, most people go into it expecting to have wide range of options for what they can do to progress.

In Summary:

1. Mining is extremely slow profit & requires too much setup
2. Elimination/Bounty missions deplete way too quickly & don't have a clear risk level
3. Supply missions can actually have negative net profit & have extremely short time limits


I understand that this is an Early Access game that is under very active development, so I hope that Walt and his team can improve on these issues.

On the positive side, here are my suggestions to the devs:

1. Being able to hail random NPC ships is really cool, and I would love to see that expanded upon

2. Something like an Escort or Courier mission would be really cool to spice things up

3. Mining could be made more interesting by adding a chance for asteroids to be rigged to explode when mined in the wrong spots (mining lasers would have to become much more accurate when manually piloting)

4. The ability to sell ships for scrap at space stations would be great for progression, as players could more easily transition to a better design this way.",1703466605,1703466605,False,8,2,0.562419772148132324,12,True,False,True

Although unfinished, the core gameplay of 'build ship -> fight ship -> learn from fight -> refine and upgrade ship -> repeat until it's far too late at night' is rock solid. It's a bit like a cross between FTL and the Lego spaceship fights you used to have in your imagination as a child, or at least I did. The game, although narrow in scope with a very limited story (basically all just hunt this guy/group/destroy this station), the difficulty, tactics and strategy necessary to win just makes it so complex and compelling it's impossible not to enjoy. A great example of a game that does one thing, and just does it REALLY well.

What kind of captain do you want to be? Build a railgun sniper ship to one-shot the enemy before the even see you? Build a missile cruiser and bombard them into submission? Build a beamer and cut them in half (very satisfying)? Build a chaingun monster to chew through them like it's something out of 40K? Build a cannon laden battleship and just pound them while tanking massive damage? Or my personal favourite right now, build a fleet of 5 ships and have one of each :D The game does somewhat reward min-maxing on ships, so having a jack-of-all-trades ship will generally be less optimal than picking an archtype and perfecting it.

I'm at level 15 in this game now on my first solo playthrough on normal difficulty, and the game goes to about level 18 at the moment. Progression is slow, especially after about level 10, as repairs take a while and battles become complex - early on, you can just duke it out face to face every time, but later on, the ships have such huge amounts of armour you can't do that and you basically have to flank in some way, or you'll be toast.

All in all, this is a very engaging, fun game that is almost infinitely replayable - every battle is different and your tactics can always improve. Seeing your ship finally succumb after a 10 minute battle and its squishy centre explode in slow motion is both fun, a bit sad and makes you go, ""bugger, so how do I do that better next time"" - it's never really frustrating. I can't wait to see what this game finally becomes once it is finished, but if what I've written sounds fun to you, just go and buy it - it is great.",1703206792,1703206792,True,1,0,0.508196711540222168,0,True,False,True

It would be great if you felt drawn into the universe and had a purpose other then just kill this or that. Align with a faction and take over the universe one sun at a time or have your own working space station that traded in the network.

If your thing is just the figuring and design of the best ship then it would be worth it for one run though, it was a fun design method. 
As it is now it seems like it will go the way empyrion did which is lackluster, thrown in story to give a reason for things.

It has a lot of aspects I enjoyed, but as it stands right now after ~26 hours of gameplay, I probably won't be picking it up again unless it gets some serious content updates. 

Its got a really good foundation and if all you want is a Spaceship builder-sim with little to no incentive for making a good spaceship, you will like this game more than I did. Personally, I think it has a ways to go before I can recommend it at its current price.  This is an [b]Early Access[/b] game and as such many of the shortcomings I felt the game had could be solved in the future, on the other hand, it could end up abandon-ware like 80% of the EA titles on Steam.   Personally, I really really hope they stick to it and keeping updating.

For the positives.  The Ship building is absolutely fantastic, and its definitely the strongest aspect of the game, letting you build and fly anything you can think of while having to balance fighting power, manpower, and maneuverability.  I cannot understate how enjoyable it is to build and control multiple ships in a fleet, sending them into combat, and just BTFO'ing the enemy ships or formations I come across.  The foundation IS there. Its got good features like role assignments for bunk areas so you can separate your crew and assign tasks, I like the idea of the progression, being make money, buy new blueprints, build better ships.   Speeding up time, pausing, all good QOL features I want to point out. 

Unfortunately my problem is its a little short on the ""progression"" I wanted from the experience, and the gameplay loop didn't really hook me in, leaving me feeling objective-less and direction-less after leaving the first solar system.  For me, by the time i left the first solar system, which was about [b]1 hour in[/b], it felt like I had progressed to endgame and all that was left to do was fiddle with ship designs, as I had unlocked everything the game offered in terms of ship blueprints, and the only real hurdle was finding items like Diamonds to make Big Shields.  

Which is fine, and honestly might be a positive to some people, I imagine getting everything in an hour and being free to experiment with their starships is ideal... but for me, I wish progression lasted longer.  I wish space-stations/shops in harder areas offered stronger blue-prints, improved version of existing blueprints parts, I wish harder Solar systems offered new resources to gather to build said blueprints. 

So for me, the problem I ran into is while the starship building is amazing, I felt like I had kind of hit my limit by the second or third solar system in terms of improving my ship and even built a second and third, eventually streamlining the 3 ""Attack"" ships and building a dedicated storage freighters to come in after battles and collect resources/disperse ammo.  Like, I really tried to get into the game, but even with all that, it just felt like I had hit the endgame and really had nothing to look forward too from here on out. 

However it is worth noting the game never felt too easy.  If you're not paying attention or get to confident, its easy to get your ships destroyed.  Partially because enemies do get strong ships and designs, and partially because ship AI in this game is kinda not superb.  If you're not micromanaging your ships movements they'll often just bump eachother in a line, pit-maneuver eachother, and fire into the butt of friendly ships.  To some, its a little more engaging to micromanage ship movements, to me, I kinda wish I could send my ships to attack an enemy ship formation without worrying one is going to be spinning in circles face-to-butt with another of my ships because they crossed paths for a second while I wasn't looking. 

As for the main gameplay loop outside of ship building, this is ultimately where I eventually got worn out from the game, and I did try to keep playing, and even installed a few mods around the 10-15hr mark in hopes of spicing up progress a little more and giving me more ship-building options, but yah, it didn't really work.  To give you an idea of the quests available for you, they are

1) Kill a Roaming bad guy
2) Go to a place and kill single or group of badguys
3) Go to a place and kill a group of badguys near a space station
4) Sell Resources to Spacestation 

Thats the entirety of the gameplay experience after you've built your ship or fleet, as I said previously theres no reason to explore anywhere or look for asteroids to mine except stopping for Carbon maybe, as everything else you will find in abundance among the destroyed remains of your slain enemies.   

The game has amazing potential, I'm going to keep my eye on this one as it progresses through Early Access.  I really hope the devs stick with it.",1702871183,1702871290,True,54,0,0.805652320384979248,0,True,False,True

Well, it was a ride. The ship building is amazing, even though all the enemies before very tanky near the end and ship controls aren't great. Managing a fleet of three or four ships is a hassle but very fun, especially if you've worked a few hours on building them and they're fulfilling their role.

In short, it's a satisfying game that does what it says on the tin: it's about building and commanding ships, and it works.

Cosmoteer however is a chill game, where any time spent not killing bad guys is just as enjoyable as killing them. I think I spend more time painting my spaceships than designing them... which unfortunately sometimes shows in how they manoeuvre hah 😅

You can play with wasd-ish or RTS style controls, which is a nice mix. The sound design is great. Each of the weapon types feel unique but balanced. You can fly around in a shoe box or a modern art sculpture just as easily. 

That is not to say everything is all roses. The only real sticking point from me so far though is that crew are very important, but can be easily lost in tough battles and hard to gain, as you need to do tough battles to gain fame enough to get new crew. I kinda wish the fame requirement for crew was based on current crew rather than total crew hired ever. It promotes save scumming every fight, which, sometimes, I'd rather just accept a tough victory or bitter defeat without thinking ""I lost 10 guys and can't get them back, my ship will be useless and I won't be able to get the fame to get more""

if ever anyone has an idea for a game to have more the people who enjoyed the game without get offended for good reason due to a lack of creativity imagination they cant help but feel insignificant well yea your typical gamer trash of course you lack imagination and the reason i don't is simple cause i barley play games and spend my days drawing thinking and doing comedy and sometimes when I'm feeling like shutting down my brain i play games. and i choose early access cause i can help make the games more interesting

but that's not the case when people on mass get offended they cant help themselves ignoring all discourse  they fling insults and do their best to discredit the imagination they wish they had. because they never have to come to terms with their shortcomings.  I'm superior at something i shouldn't be belittled for it because their is hard work and dedication behind it. and this could be taken as an insult go ahead your gonna be insulted regardless so why beat around the bush. people who are insulted fling insults thats how it works its simple and pathetic. 

now just so people dont jump in front of my insults i in no way think everyone out their is idiotic and in no way am i fault free but im not gonna stand by and own  other peoples shortcomings over top of my own. if i had more time and i wasn't trying to make my own show id have more time to make mods to showcase my ideas this is optimal. but its far from a perfect world and if anyone knew how my life has been they'd be thrilled I'm not in a corner drooling with a dunce cap on. it rivals 3rd world hell i assure you people in slums get better deals than i.  but i don't like to complain and in not doing so people assume its easy for me  i just like to prove them wrong and at 43 im starting to doubt that will ever happen.

But pretty soon you have all the blueprints there are and the ship you wanted and then you just keep roaming around, picking fights and doing the same simple missions again and again, salvaging and selling materials.

To keep the game interesting in the long run, in my opinion it should
- feature a much more detailed and living open world where emergent events take place and lasting changes happen, while the player has to adapt and look for opportunities.
- have some decent 4x elements OR follow a rogue-lite approach where consequences matter and you have to improvise making due with what you get.
- have much more variety in resources and components that vary regionally and can't all be acquired in one place and without any faction-allegiance etc, while everything has its pros and cons and nothing being entirely useless in the later game.
- have large-scale open-world multiplayer with hundreds of players per server and consistent player data (ships, resources etc).

Firstly, the ship building is very robust. Each ship  is extremely customisable and it is easy to make any ship tailored to your taste. I love the ship building and at least half my time might be stuck in it. it is most certainly the best part of the game.

Second. The PVE needs a lot of work. I know they are working on it so I won't say too much on it, but there needed to be more weapons and armours (I know these are coming but...) and then add research tiers to those weapons and equipment. Being able to get everything from the first system if you have the money makes the game much less rewarding from the get go. The road map says there will be more  quest activities and that there will be a supply and demand economy, so those are things I will be looking forward to greatly.

Thirdly, performance. The performance takes some really big hits quite early on int he game and it doesn't get much better. Im not entirely sure if the game keeps a track of all wreckage's from all systems, but there needs to be better back end trash clean up. I could be off the mark on whats going on, but regardless, the performance REALLY needs work

The combat is very fun and fluid, the weapons are amazing to work with, the modding scene is ASTOUDNING so it is well worth your money.

1. Tutorial is text based. Better than nothing, but still bad. Massive info dumb at the start of the game - great.
2. The first level is not the tutorial. Every normal player would assume that enemies would stay pretty basic - cosmoteer does not. Long range emp missiles, swarms of enemies, enemies with triple your firepower.
Game throws you into the cold water. If you like frustration, experiment yourself, or just watch some youtube videos - after 3 hours, you will understand the basics. But at this point you can just continue watching other people play and safe yourself some money.
3. Soft softlocking. There is a clear path to upgrades and you can waste a lot of money on stuff you cannot afford. You will be stuck with an inefficient ship and no money. Multiple times.

Unlike some other anything builder games, it's pretty intuitive, it isn't hard to mash together your very first ship™ and see it shoot stuff. However, the depth you can go into while building your ships is insane, and you can easily spend hours on one design, and either see it gloriously work as intended, or more realistically, notice a fatal flaw in it and see it get rekt in a few seconds, but that's part of the fun.

Something to remember while playing is that the designs are never set in stone, and you can always go and tweak or just completely change any aspect of your ship at any time. In career, you'll be designing your ship, see an enemy exploit your weakness, counter that weakness in your ship, see it destroy everything and make fat stacks, move on to the next sector and rethink everything as everyone's suddenly destroying you. It's not just your ship, but your fleet: you can decide to improve upon what ship you have, make more of what you have or just scrap it all and make something bigger and meatier instead.

And what can you make? Well... Tiny agile fighter? Hugeass mothership? Penis shaped sniper railgun ship? Fat dough-making cargo/mining ship? Weird strategy you want to try out for fun ship? Self detonating ship? You're covered, your energy and will to build them is the limit.

This is an amazing game (granted still a little early on the story/long play through side) but definitely offers a very nice demo like feel to what the final product will be. There is a small but amazing modding community along side a decent player base for this style of game. I think if you love space combat and exploration, you will love the feel of this game.

What the game includes *so far*:
Ship building: Build your own ship from scratch or a template, including engines, thrusters, crew bedding, weapons and ammo/storage
Exploration: Can explore galaxies (albeit *currently* they are mainly identical with different ships depending on level/tier of galaxy), mine asteroids, smelt/create items for trade or for ship building and become self efficient. 
Economy: Can trade with AI whether be buying crew mates or buying/selling materials.
Missions: Can complete missions which do ramp up in difficulty and style as you progress. 

What the game DOESN'T have that I think will/could be implemented (my reasoning for possibly being worth the investment):
Before I continue, just want to put it out there that these are just my assumptions/thoughts about how I feel the game could go considering the direction it has took already.
Faction creation: Create your own faction during an all out war between other factions (maybe 6-10 other factions in the game). Choose your 'role' and let it decide who you will start as allies and enemies with and allow your diplomatic skills to be put to the test to make allies or start wars.
AI capabilities: Allow yourself to assign 'roles' to your ship (IE: A ship that will go mine resources and automatically flee if danger around/come back when full. Another ship will take the resources and start processing on their ship. Once a specific amount has been reached, that ship will sell excess quantities for money.) On top of that, you can have AI enemies and companions who will try to flank, out maneuver, retreat if hurt etc and just be more strategic/tactical on both sides of the battlefield. Allowing for bigger battles.
Huge arsenal of weapons: Add more end game style weapons and make it harder to progress through 'tiers' of ships/weapons to offset the ability to basically have a faction making money for you.
Add more story to the game: Perhaps they might make a more linear plot which you could change the course of as you play the game out. 'make your own story' style game. 
More battles, some boss fights, and style of missions
Add different races
Add to ships complexity (circuitry, more to the process of making everything run/be effective, more resources needed to keeping up the ship).
Crew abilities: Make the crew be able to gain experience in specific roles.

These are all just my thoughts, to summarize: This game is kind of barren if you are expecting a huge story telling game or a style of game that will not get repetitive. Though the concept is DEFINITELY there and it is very fun if you are into a space combat sim/like the idea of it.

>>>AI ENEMY SHIPS DO NOT PLAY BY THE RULES<<<

The worst part really is in the mid to late game when one thinks they have a handle on the mechanics of the game, and boy, are there a lot to learn, and then meet an AI ship: designed to fly backward, faster than the player ships could ever be, with more guns than a comparable PC ship design could ever field.

These A.I. nightmare ships are nothing but guns and reverse engines, it's really the sole end game pattern because they do not have to have reactors, storage, factories, and crew compartments.  The mass, cost and vulnerability of which cripples equivalent player designs.

- AI SHIPS -
NO CREW COMPARTMENTS
Often way to many engines to be matched for speed
Not nearly enough command points or POWER to run the immense amount of engines/guns/weapons
No ammo construction or storage for ammo rooms, but they seem to shoot forever anyway...
Insufficient power reactors

Additionally:

Player Controls are sluggish and aggravating, manual control is to sluggish to be useful and automated control logic is terrible.

Friendly ship AI is completely retarded: 
   Friendly ships fly into each other
   They keep shooting with friendlies in the way 
   They do not lead their shots and miss dumb fire ordinance, 
       it neatly flies right by making guns and nuke missiles worthless
   Enemy ship maneuver AI is however flawless

AI friendly ships are a complete menace:
          They will fly between you and a hostile, and your idiot gunners 
          will light them up and then give you a wanted rating turning everything against you

Missile AI, even for tracking missiles, arms, has no IFF, and hits friendly units and turns them against you when unintentionally struck. Especially dumb when trying to save a space station asking for help...

Railguns ARE WORTHLESS and can ONLY be aimed by turning the entire ship. Solely for taking out BATTLESTATIONS, fun to use ONCE.

Ion Cannons are cryptic and difficult to understand, essentially they must be routed through a crystal matrix (EACH) configured in tree structures and combined in powers of 2. This takes so much space, resources, crew and power it is not worth the diminishing returns, conventional arms are boring, but superior at scale.

There's a bunch of gated crafting materials for false climb wall build obstacles that are really irritating for build out and repair. Trying to find enough Tritanium, a basic crafting material, is irritating through the entire experience.

There are a bunch of factories and manufacturing ship upgrades that are completely pointless, as you can buy the things they make from AI ships and stations, and putting them in your ship increases crew size, crew quarters, MASS and cost (AI ships don't ever have to do this and work flawlessly with no storage, crew, or  munitions factories). It's a poorly thought out part of the game with little purpose. Using them is like putting anvils in your backpack at a Marathon.

>>>THE GUI<<<

Controlling this game is like swimming through oatmeal with your clothes on.

We already talked about the sluggish controls and nonsense AI logic, but...

The ships do not wait for crew outside harvesting/repairing, and leave them to die in the cold of space constantly.

The mechanics for building a ship with a front that is not galactic North are incredibly difficult to find and buried all over, though they obviously should be settings in the build menu, they aren't.

Configuring individual components cannot be done in build mode? Aim points, default orders, linking etc.

The DOORS inside designs do not auto populate for some reason and it's easily possible to build components that never work because the crew cannot get to them, and there is no warning!  These look like legal designs, you'll be flying around wondering why your components aren't working even with enough crew and resources.

Overall, the repetitive fun of little ship battles and building stuff peters out, after the game breaks.",1701314961,1701314961,False,13,3,0.538828372955322266,0,True,False,True

I have played this game for a few years, and the thing that keeps bringing me back is the fact that this lone developer puts so much love into this game. You can tell he actually cares about the game, unlike many AAA game developers.

I will say that there is a point at about the 40-50 hour mark where the game can become somewhat stale. However, this is very heavily counter-balanced by the modding capability this game has. Some mods, I will admit, are broken. In the OP way, not so much the implementation way. Most are very thoughtfully balanced, but there are some that stretch the player power in PvE too far, to the point where a single cannon can one-shot basically anything the AI can throw at you. I, personally, don't find that enough of a challenge to find interesting. However, I don't have to deal with that because I just don't use those mods.

Overall, this game is incredibly flexible and it really does feel awesome being a starship architect and commander. While I have not really played enough PvP to make a comment on that part of the game, it is a very interesting way to shake things up.

game has a small area to level up early, but most of the galaxy is much harder opponents and more of them. you will soon find that even with a massive battleship, you'll be outnubered by equally big ships. still nothign is more satisfying that bringing them down and then using their ships as scrap to repair your ship back to full health. really makes the kill worth it. 

but soon you will need to expand beyond one ship, and that's when the wall hits, you gotta build  a second ship and start a fleet. the problem is that i couldn't find anywhere that had enough resources to build a second battleship. 

i tried building a freighter ship and packing it full of scrap from kills, but even a huge freighter wasn't nearly enough. i would have to build 3 of them, fill them up, then maybe have enough to build a second ship. and that just felt like too much work to continue. 

the game has bases you can dock at, that have large resource cashed, but not large enough to build the ship i need. might i suggest you put shipyards in the game that are large enough on their resources that i can build the huge battleships i'd need to continue. because anything less than the ship I built to make it to that point wouldn't survive the first encounter with an enemy. just ask every renegade pack i slaughtered my way through.

And of course there's the creative mode where you have unlimited ways to play around the spaceship design, and run simulated A.I. battles with your ship designs. And one more testament to the power-to-the-players mentality is the built-in mod and Steam Workshop support.

The concept is a great 4x/ space trucker sim, very sandboxy, and there are pirates you can blast!  (can't join em yet... but hopefully YARRRR!)  The ship building is GREAT, although someone in the Discord said my ships were ""hard to look at""  lol, I know I'm new! XD  Anyways, my biggest gripe so far is the fact that the non-Newtonian flight is NOT done well, I spent more of my time getting my 3 ships stuck on each other than succesfully fighting the AI in most battles.  (I'm getting better though.)  And it seems like it is impossible to build a ship smaller than a corvette class.  What I'm hoping to see in the future is more differentiation in solar systems, both in layout, and in the factions and types of quests given, currently there are only two I'll take, pirate hunting, and fugitive ship hunting, cause why would anyone do trading missions or missions on a timer?  There isn't any mechanic present to capture territory or build large facilities like a space port or orbital habitat.  (I'm hopeful though).  Over all, you can very much tell this isn't a finished project, but it has GOOD bones.  I am excited by the content that's already here, and feel like 20 dollars is a fair price for what you get.

The EARLY ACCESS tag definitely shows in its lack of things to do, but the game is pretty fun so far. 

The progression is a bit slow and boring. As said there isnt really much to do, you just fight ships and gather more resources and crew to make your ship bigger and stronger. The game has a currency that you can use in place of resources when building near stations, which is an interesting feature right up until the point where it becomes completely useless. Stations have a simulated number of resources, which means a lot of time they simply wont have ANY resources available to help build your ship. Around that part of the game money becomes nothing more than a score counter.

The combat is fun if a little clunky. It's fun to make a big wall of guns and point it at the enemy, watching a swarm of projectiles rip their ship apart. A lot of time it feels like im fighting against my own AI, trying to wrangle it into moving the way i want it to because for some reason it interprets ""strafe left, face forward"" as ""stop firing, turn my unarmoured side toward the enemy, move forward, move back, move forward again, spin left slightly, explode"". It's also somewhat easy to cheese ships entirely, using high-speed railgun strafe builds. 

Building a ship is a bit like a puzzle, adjustments to your design will sometimes send a cascade of smaller adjustments. Adding parts to your ship bit by bit is much less effective than just deleting the whole blueprint and starting over from scratch. The crew management and AI is stupid though. Anything larger than a prius requires very careful optimization, otherwise your guns might mysteriously stop firing in the middle of a fight because your entire crew decided that the middle of a battle is the perfect time to all go sit in their rooms and do nothing.

Despite the clunkiness, the game is very well optimized for an EARLY ACCESS Game. Even on my terrible non-gamer hardware i consistently get 30+ fps and rarely get slowdowns. Except for when i save, which is annoying, because the ""one hit can kill you"" gameplay essentially requires you to save before every single combat encounter.",1699189616,1699487953,True,1,0,0.496183186769485474,0,True,False,True

You are encouraged to build bigger and better ships, with factories to generate materials, but you'll never find enough crew to man them.  Crew is incredibly inefficient unless you assign them specific tasks.  Fire will eat through your entire ship before your crew will bother to put it out, no matter how many fire extinguishers you have, and things like engines and shields constantly go offline while the crew does god only knows what, and I've purchased the maximum amount of crew I'm allowed to purchase at this time.

Almost every combat is a losing proposition, with fights costing me way more in materials from my shields and rail drivers than I get from killing the ships.  Almost every fight is a snowball.  There is no real challenge here, either I obliterate them with minimal losses or I get obliterated after they blow up one of my shields and start a fire.  Ship designs are these really alien looking polyhedrons that make no actual sense aesthetically but are good for the PVP style combat the game favors.  It's not too long before you run into a ship that rams directly into your nose and tries to burrow into you out of the aiming arc of your guns.  The Player ship is **REALLY BAD** at keeping distance like it is ordered to do, unless you have more thrusters on the front than you do the back.

Pathing is horrible.  I constantly run into asteroids, other ships, etc, and my ship flips around backwards and takes forever to navigate.  A lot of times a ship will push me into the sun and my ship will blow up from bad pathing.

I mean, it's a really simple (repeated) concept that could be really fun:  build space ship and blow up other space ships with it, but unfortunately, really novice implementation leaves much to be desired, and you'll spend more time loading than fighting.",1697806848,1697972064,False,4,0,0.540816307067871094,0,True,False,True

Designing the ship is a nightmare. The flexibility behind designing is close to zero. When you design a ship you expect you have a place to freely do what ever you want, without the space station, ships, planets in your background. You would also like to expect that you can design couple ""parts"" for future use, You would also expect that you can build a ship when you have the resources, but instead you can only build when you have ALL resources needed.

Developers spent a lot of resources on three loading design buttons that are practically useless. Also developers wasted a lot of resources on trying to lure you on socialmedia crap instead of paying attention to quality of life in the game. For example when you start you can choose which ship you want but only to the limit of 70.000 units or so while later in the game you can't access those ships. If you are into spending hours for designing a ship and very little playing then this is for you. I'm here to shot something.

I think what would be interesting would be the addition of various ingame scenarios that necessitate experimenting with ship designs and finding unique solutions. Beyond finding new ways to fight pirates I mean. Maybe diving into the red zone of stars or building ships / devices to do specific things besides fight.

I think there are a few bugs and balancing things to fix yet. My favorite one was when a tiny fighter ship armed with a rocket launcher and cannon rammed itself at full speed into my factory ship, wedging itself between a flak cannon and Point Defence Turret, and sticking there like a leech. Because there is no collision damage, no self damage, and enemies never seem to run out of ammo, this tiny bug wormed its way through 4 layers of armor plating and 3 store rooms to blow up my reactor with point-blank rockets and cannon shots. I loaded my game again and it happened a second time before I decided to have the big ship stay back. It then did the same thing to my large fighter, sticking to the front and sending them both into a death spiral. Finally I just sent a railgun to take it out as it tried to attach itself to my factory. I'm pretty sure this is unintended behaviour, it was pretty funny though. Still something that needs to be looked at.

The AI of your own ships is janky at best and actively harmful most of the time. Ships in a formation regularly will get stuck on NPC ships at stations, your own ships at your stations, actively ignore asteroids or wrecks in front of them, and get stuck on just about anything that it can possibly get stuck on, slowing the whole formation down. In combat, this is especially horrible because unless you have extremely agile ships that are power hungry and require multiple reactors (which explode when they are destroyed), having any sort of combat formation other than ""sit in a line and fire"" is not possible. Again, ships will get stuck, ram the enemy, or just fly right into where the heart of their weapons are, so flanking is extremely hard if you are controlling multiple things.

The power balance is also thrown off early on. Starting off, your first ship needs to be generalized, but the game NEVER throws generalized pirate ships at you. They only throw combat ships at you that are built for nothing but combat, so early game you are always at a disadvantage until you can build something built for combat. this is especially true since some ships just do not have ammo storage at all and come with their weapons fully loaded, sometimes even with some of the strongest missiles or nukes in the game which will EMP you or just blow you up as if a reactor blew up.

The Economy is also a huge issue. There are no consumer goods, so being a trader is not possible, and the only way to make money is to sit around for hours mining asteroids just to be able to make specialized ships. Additionally, hiring crew is a massive hassle. Having anything that is made for combat that needs 300+ crew is going to take you two hours of flying around and hiring people 15 at a time from a station, which, you need crew to fly it around to begin with, so you'll be on limp mode or needing to support this new ship with a skeleton crew from your old one. The game also makes it so every person across all ships you own increase the hiring cost, so the game makes it so you need specialized ships like haulers, miners, stations/factories, and fighters, but penalizes you for having them.

Overall, if you play this you need some sort of mods to make the game playable. Its a well developed game in terms of ship design and for what it does, but the economy and the AI need a HUGE work before this game is 'fair'.",1697316246,1697316385,False,18,0,0.67825472354888916,0,True,False,True

 Pros: 
+Creative infused concepts in building your ship, heavy in ship design possibility

+Fun space battles, utilizing your latest weaponry
+Faction warfare, ability to choose a side, cause havoc for a faction, essentially choosing sides
+Can get rich pretty quickly just from looking enemy ship pieces, feels a bit like space...mechanical...cannibalism=very satisfying to know you're using your enemy's steel plates to repair the damage they just got done inflicting on you.

Cons:
-Not very story rich 
-It took...this many hours to get bored of the repetitive missions; bounties, exploration, or resource delivery to gain fame/gain crew members as that is the limiting factor in growing your ship.

My tip is don't buy it yet though. There is a lot of QoL tools missing still.

This hampers the creative freedom of the player. I will have to stick with one monolithic ship for now.

The real time fighting is incredibly well put together with fluid ship controlling mechanics. There is a lot of documentation to allow new players to learn how to play and quickly start experimenting with ship designs.

However, because of the huge complexity of the game, it is hard to rush into the game play. Time needs to be spent learning the different mechanics before fighting, such as crew management and organisation. If this part of the game was explained more thoroughly, then it would make it a lot easier to pick up this game.

I would also like to see different quest options other than the standard bounty hunt and deliver. Maybe a hijacking quest or stealth quest. This would also give room for more equipment and stuff like stealth gear and ship towing or something. I do feel like this is wear the game is missing stuff as doing the same thing over and over again can get boring. Also, giving the crew skills such that they can get better at certain things would 100% make it more interesting. Maybe it would allow for the option to select which crew you want to hire from the space station rather than just buy the first one. It might get frustration to have random crew members die from fires and stuff, especially if they were pretty good, but by giving the player a reason to care about their crew members would probably make the game more interesting and rewarding.

All in all a 10/10 game, mainly because it took all my favourite parts of FTL, spaceflight simulator, Kerbal space program, Rimworld and managed to combine them effectively. Also, would prefer it if the music wasn't always playing.",1696976039,1697000039,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

I think the fact that any enemy ship I kill I can completely strip and salvage for its resources is incredibly cool, so I have 3 large scale salvage ships solely dedicated to salvage and repair. Theres a pretty wide array of weaponry falling into 3 categories, missile, kinetic or laser but there are different types within those, like ion beams, laser beams, point defence for shooting down missiles etc, or for kinetics you've got blasters, flak cannons, rail guns and more.

I would say the only downside is the game play loop is pretty small currently, it consists of going to stations, picking up kill quests on either pirate stations, renegade pirate packs or pirate ships, or attacking an enemy factions base, then having done that, rinse and repeat when you hyperjump to the next sector, but the next sector might have stronger enemy ships.

The heart of Cosmoteer lies in its shipbuilding mechanics, and it doesn't disappoint. The level of customization and creativity allowed is simply mind-blowing. Whether you're designing a sleek, agile fighter or a massive, heavily armored battleship, the game empowers you to bring your vision to life. The sheer joy of piecing together various components to craft your ultimate war machine is an experience like no other.

The battles in Cosmoteer are equally thrilling. The real-time combat keeps you on the edge of your seat, as you strategize, maneuver, and unleash a barrage of weaponry on your foes. The satisfaction of watching your ship's cannons obliterate enemy vessels never gets old. It's a delightful mix of chaos and strategy that keeps you engaged for hours on end.

While the game excels in many aspects, it's important to note that the missions can become somewhat repetitive over time. However, this minor drawback doesn't dilute the overall gameplay value and fun. The core joy of building your own colossal warship and annihilating everything in your path remains as exhilarating as ever. Besides, the limitless possibilities for ship design and loadout variations keep the gameplay fresh and exciting.

Cosmoteer's visuals are crisp and colorful, and the sound design adds depth to the immersive space battles. The user-friendly interface and tutorial make it accessible for both newcomers and experienced ship commanders.

In summary, Cosmoteer is a must-play for any fan of space exploration, shipbuilding, and tactical warfare.

Its very much become my surrogate ""FTL 2"" since no such game exists. And it expands on parts of that FTL formula in exactly the way I hoped it might. Especially the ship crafting and blueprinting, that alone can just devour hours of play, all in fun. I also experienced megalomaniacal glee when I realized I could steal a whole station and rekit for my own uses. 
Things I would like to see:
The option to combine ships. When I first found a ship-graveyard, I had a rush of desire to grab a bunch of old wrecks, slam them together, and make an actual Space Hulk. Sadly, the option is not available as of yet. I hope the option might happen. 
I think it would be fun to fool around with added crew modules, like medbays and galleys. Maybe another branch of gameplay surrounding science research and developement with specific science modules, like Kerbal Space Program. That might be a bit much though. 
Added cargo options beyond natural resources would be a bit fun to play with for the BGS.

It's difficult to find or even look for bad things to say because these guys clearly had common sense in mind before deciding to make a game. If you run in to an issue or something that was stupid, sure enough it got hammered out.

- very grindy in a way that after 40 hours is still kinda fun but begins to wear me down
- too little variance of items/weapons to put into the ship (yet?)
- there is exactly zero story, which makes the grind even grindier
- absolutely awful ship formation behaviour. Your Ships take forever to go into formation even if they are equipped with powerful engines.
- Crew is a necessary commodity without a quality to them. they don't improve and you can re-buy them anytime.

Suggestions:

/ There should be a story, even if it's a minor one. Some interaction with someone with a face and a voice. The game feels empty at the moment.
/ The crew could level to be of more use, more experience. maybe?
/ More weapons, more commodities, a real bartering system, weapons upgrades, a black market, different types of armor (level 1-6?)
/ The mentioned ship formation problem AND the collisions among ships or asteroids must be adressed in my opinion.

It's your typical grinding experience. Initially i was sucked into the game because of the freedom you get in constructing unique solutions for your individual warfare preferences. That's cool and all. I built a hauler to mine the asteroids and got to money. This gets old quickly though. In the beginning you seem to be shown the entire layout of the game (your star system is easy and the farther you move the harder it gets.) And there lies the problem for me: It is (seems to be) more and more of the same. I spent 40 hours in the first star system and nearly got all the blueprints. I have four ships and a station. I know that there is more but not much? The game progresses super linear, meaning that from the first hour, you pretty much know what to expect.

I give a thumbs up because the ship building aspect and the combat are very satisfying. The rest - i hope - can be improved upon.",1690503541,1695935444,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,True

Not the ideal mix, though. I hugely miss ""drone"" ship type (I think it will come in a future update though), and now I think about it, I miss the cloaking device from StarMade. Cost per ship is too much, whereas in E:D you are given a free Sidewinder anytime you need a ship. Just a basic reactor and cockpit cost you a lot. If all your ships are destroyed, it's game over, which honestly, sucks. Getting a foothold is stressful, but there is auto-, quick- and manual save, so use them.

So yeah, the progress is quite slow, but I give a thumbsup as whatever's implemented, works and after I figured out how things work, plus some mods, I was enjoying the game (on 15x speed. base game has 8x max). Some elements actually surprised me how smooth and user-friendly they are.

AI navigation within  asteroid fields is questionable at times, so keep in mind that most of time your ships will be flown by some NPC crew. My guys had some problems with a nose-heavy build. But you have the option to give specific targets to each of your weapons, movement orders include strafe, rotate towards something, you have builtin and user-defined formations, so manual controls are good and precise (you can fly a ship completely manually with WASD+QE, for example the leader of a formation, and all ships will stay in formation, so that's nice)",1694990514,1694990514,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

The ship building and crew management has a good amount of depth already and more importantly is a lot of fun. The new player experience is just awesome. The way the game introduces you to everything one by one is fantastic and is a testament to great design. I'm about 10 hours in and haven't needed to look up any videos or guides for anything. 

IMO this is above anything else a game about building and managing your own ships and that aspect of it is very well done. The missions, economy, exploration and everything else is just there to facilitate more ship building and progression. I think this is the perfect balance since there's so much to do with ship design and management that I don't want to be bogged down by other things. 

It's already in a great place and it's only going to get better with time. 10 hours in and I've just left the starting system. If games like Space Engineers, FTL, Starsector and maybe a little Dwarf Fortress are your thing you'll love this game.

The only thing that is noticed is almost every time you manage to break the mods that make the game playable, as without the many needed mods the game is truly not worth playing. I really don't see how this factor is missed at every board meeting???

Current ship speed has gone from 480ish m/s to 108ish m/s so even at 18x speed increase it still takes a unexcepted amount of time to go even short distances. Should put a notice up during loading for your customer base bring a book to play the game in its current state because all there is, is sit and wait time.

Why are we not learning from the past here, or does the Feedback just not get read or is it just ignored, can't really tell, but after all this time we ""you"" are screwing the game up at any/every given chance. All for updates that have next no use/purpose or notice! I mean I really like this game it has such potential, but it is a shame that this keeps happening over and over and WAY too frequent. 

For a month or so there I thought the new system of run the dang mods anyway had fixed this issue of not being able to run the game as mods that were being used no longer work ""according to the updated game"", but it seems not... CTD!

 I really recommend making an option to update the game or not and make the updates much larger and much Much further apart, that way we could play the game for more than a day or two before you guys update it with unnoticeable so called improvements that break the mods/game, because frankly it is the mods that are making the actual improvements you guys are missing. Truly :(

I still recommend the game but I can't in good conscience up vote the game when it is getting broken by for the most part unnoticeable updates every other week. I just don't feel that it should get a very positive rating when the game with mods gets update broken so frequent. Though, I can see why it has gone from Overwhelmingly Positive DOWN to Very Positive. Keep working at it guys soon I am sure you can get it to Mixed or Mostly Negative, just keep going the way you are and see if you can pull it off or even kill the game before it ever gets out of early access.",1694746147,1694746147,False,5,1,0.516149461269378662,0,True,False,True

BUT
I think the way power is handled sucks balls. It makes the game into way more of a time sink than it needs to be. Instead of saving my resources for cool new parts for my spaceship, a lot of it ends up going into hiring people to carry batteries around. This is because, instead of using wires and cables, the spaceships in this game receive power from batteries which have to be manually delivered from reactors by your crew. You will set up entire barracks dedicated to housing guys whose entire job is to carry said batteries between reactors and systems. You will design your ship around facilitating the movement of guys carrying batteries. The bulk of your crew will comprise of battery carriers.
Does this add a new layer of strategy to the game, forcing you to consider not only the placement of engines and weapons for optimal targeting and manoeuvring capabilities, but also the layout of your ship for optimising power transportation. Yes, yes it does. Does that inherently make the game better? I am sure there are a lot of tryhards who think that dudes carrying batteries is integral to the heart and soul of Cosmoteer (and I suspect the devs think the same), but personally I would be happy to see this mechanic gone. For me, it is very fun gradually building your own starship using the resources you have collected. It is not so fun having to juggle individual crewmates around so there are enough people throwing batteries at the engines for them to run without fizzling out every 20 seconds. Yes, there is a creative mode which gives you access to lots and lots of crew members, but the game just isn't quite as satisfying when you have infinite money.",1694730643,1694730643,True,83,8,0.837556123733520508,0,True,False,True

Only the non-existing Story is pretty dull. This is still not a problem because the Game itself and its mechanics are fun enough to not even worry or think about Lore.

In conclusion: Is it Early-Access? - Yes 
                       Is the Dev-Team small? - Well, Yes.
                       Is the Game unfinished? - Yes, but its missing NOTHING.

But this shit doesn`t matter this time. Its an incredible fun and refreshening experience and due to the MULTIPLAYER and CO-OP including MODSUPPORT (in Multiplayer-Lobbies, too) makes this game an aboslut treasure and a must-have.

This game could achieve greatness, even now in Early Access you can spend hours upon hours on the shipbuilding aspect and feel you got your monies worth. 

There are several improvements that would elevate the game however, and the roadmap that is published is promising. I think an aspect that would need revisiting is the balancing of different weapon systems, some are simply superior to others and greatly trivialize the career mode. 

Unlikely but for building/designing ships it would feel great if you where allowed to do diagonal placement of objects, today you have to choose between diagonal design and horizontal/vertical.

There's a full constellation of top down, space RPGs, and among those, there are many titles that allow you to build a space ship with lego like building blocks you can loot from destroyed enemies. Cosmoteer shines among its peers on two grounds, you have a crew you need to manage, and you have internal logistics in your ships, so you need to optimize the way the crew moves around and where the supplies needed to power all your equipment are. This two mechanics are fairly simple, you can prioritize tasks for your crew members as in other management games, but that's about it, your crew doesn't relate among themselves, they don't have likes or dislikes, and they don't need food or oxygen or anything other than a room. The logistic mechanics is also simple, and in spite of having 2 fuel types and 5 ammo types is easy to understand and manage. But the game really manages to balance those two mechanics with the building blocks, the exploring and the RPG quests.

On the down side, this game doesn't have a story or an interesting setting, just an open world where you can work with or against 4 factions. That part of the game is rather shallow, as you don't have any diplomatic option other than doing missions for one side or another. The progression in the game is via getting more money or building materials, gaining prestige that allows you to hire more crew, and unlocking building blocks, but your crew doesn't gain any experience from performing tasks and they are basically soulless little peeps.

That said, every zone is the same thing over and over. find all the hidden areas, go around in circles until the map is cleared, turn in the same quests repeatedly, skip whole zones because you don't get points toward new crew anyway because your rep is too high for that zone.

I've played a few different ones, most are way too much work to build a ship only to have it blasted to bits right away. OR the look of everything is too cartoon-like. Another issue is the indy dev team just quits because it is A LOT of work putting these games together. This game is really fun and gets better when you realize the level of control you can have on your ship & crew. The only problem I have with it so far is that once you get to level 14-16 (or so) you start getting SERIOUS LAG!!!! 

It's to the point I am going to stop playing because it's impossible to get through five seconds of game play without it lagging like crazy. I've heard it has to do with the debris left behind after a battle but I think it's also the crew. When you have 500-1000+ little individual roles being performed at once it's going to get unfeasible at some point. (Even with ship vision off it still has to account for the activities of the crew to make the ship function). 

I'd hate to say it but I think the dev team is going to have to rethink the whole crew aspect of things. If you put energy transfer conduits into the game and make it so that 2-3 crew members have to operate and maintain the conduits then that might cut down on the amount of crew you need but also might lighten the resources your computer has to use to keep up with it. I'd say even introduce automation; hell I would spend 1 mil credits to automate some ship systems for each ship.

If you want to play the 'career' mode then the game isn't balanced for it.  The design currently lends itself to a series of rock paper scissors relationships between different design archetypes.  

Have a slow, heavily armored spaceship?  Have fun being kited to death once you run into a fast ship that can shoot you while flying backwards.  Have a fast ship that can close distances quickly on those kiters?  Now you'll get destroyed by slow heavily armored ships.  There are a number of other archetypes that fall into this pattern but the gist is that you'll run into a wide range of enemies in the campaign that are designed in a min-max fashion that will often destroy most ship types except for their specific counters. 

Which leads into the next problem, combat is very swingy.  Run into a ship type that hard counters your's?  Running is borderline impossible in this game.  Turning around and exposing your engines is a good way to not have engines for very long.  By the time that you realize that you're outgunned it's often too late to do anything about it.  Which wouldn't be so bad if there was some kind of respawn mechanic, but instead losing a ship is extremely expensive and punishing - to the point that you'll be reloading A LOT.

music's alright, sound effects are alright

there's something lacking in the core gameplay loop, i think. i pretty well finished two star systems, and anticipate the rest do the same things just with bigger and more complex ships. i don't think that will be enough to carry the game.

i do think that as you progress and build up an economy, there's a lot of opportunity to get creative and also brick your run. spend too much on the wrong things and you might not be able to progress, but build right and there's every chance you can set your own stations up with defenses and storage and everything - it will just take quite a while.

i find myself almost constantly playing on 8x speed. i think that should be addressed - 1x is so mind numbingly slow for building, gathering, trading, traveling, almost anything except fighting. i'd rather not play the game on 8x like it just smoked crack, and would prefer that the standard pace were just improved. scale how much time passes along with it i don't care, i'm not sure time itself really does anything right now anyway except move the NPCs around the map.

Imagine Dwarf Fortress/Rimworld, except your base is your ship/fleet that fights other ships.

You have crew. All crew have exact same stats, but you can designate roles for them. In other words, you open a window to designate their work preferences. You use your crew to do everything from building & repairing ships to operating and supplying ship components. However you do not directly control your crew. Like in Dwarf Fortress, you designate tasks that need to be done, and the AI NPCs have to figure out how to handle them.

There are various factors to consider in shipbuilding: Armor, weapons, energy production, ammo production, thrusters, etc. And it is your job as the commander and architect to design ships that fulfill what ever need that arises. You've got to balance components based on the kind of ship you want. Light armor and more thrust for mobile ships. Large unarmed cargo/mining ships. Heavy and wide brawling ships. People who love customization and optimization will love the shipbuilding aspect of this game.

There's not much of a campaign to speak of. The galaxy you explore is pretty much a sandbox. You're free to travel and explore wherever, then fight hostile ships you encounter.
The lack of things to do apart from pirate bounties and fetch quests is by far the weakest part of the game. It reminds me Mount and Blade: Warband in this respect. It's essentially a make-your-own-fun kind of game. At least in its current state.

The devs have a roadmap with a list of interesting features they may or may not implement. Such as faction wars, shipboarding & crew combat, and a greater variety of quests to undertake. Eager to see this product get more updates and eventually exit early access.

There's a bunch of quality of life features I wouldn't expect to find in most big-name games. It makes ship design so much easier. But the primary feature is creating new ships, pitting them against AI ships, and seeing how your design fairs. Then, refining your design until the locals can't contend with you. After that, you move on to a new solar system and either redesign your ship again or improve it with new equipment and ideas. My only complaint about the game is the poorly designed progression of career mode. You unlock all the equipment early in the game, so the only improvement to be made is increasing the amount of crew you can hire. Thus, more crew equals bigger ship. I just wish there were more variety in ship equipment because it does start to feel rather same-y. Basically, I want more. I'm looking forward to improvements to come. Is Cosmoteer worth $20?

The good:
Incredibly fun and easy to get into.
Layouts matter, so there's a skill ceiling when it comes to ship building.
Tons of variety and customization options.
Plenty of content at current version of the game.
Co-op and pvp modes, so there's two different cups of tea.
Visually appealing, at least to me, heh.(Faster than light and Starsector anyone? still distinctly unique style)

Cons:
For now rather simple gameplay loop, kill ships or mine for resources, build bigger ship to kill bigger enemies.
Not much when it comes to variety of missions.
A lot of other mechanics that i wish were here already, are still on roadmap.

Overall, can't wait for boarding operations, living economy, planetary governance, more guns, more things, more everything, especially mission types and variety.",1691437223,1691440955,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

It is missing a few things and the game is still in development so somethings are expected to improve, namely I hope we get more inventory management and more story and development of the universe plus it would be good to have a real economy and several more things, It would be super cool for you to create a station and handle traders by auto setting buy and sell prices and things like that.

Currently it is hard and tedious to handle your crew, setting every permission is a chore and it only helps that crew type and then you assign that to a specific crew quarter so only certain people will do certain thing and god forbid someone dies and leaves you fXXXXd, inventory management is tedious and not really useful at the moment, selling is not that good either.

I have spent many hours just designing different ships and I have managed to come up with a bunch of variety. Each weapon feel balanced*, minus one weapon in the game. The ions can be absolutely lethal, but you give up a lot of space for a largely fixed weapon. It will eat other ships if done right, but is still well balanced. Also you have Rail guns which again done right are completely devastating, but done wrong and next to useless. You pretty much have to build the ship around that weapon system to get the most out of it. You can kinda lump cannons and lasers in the same basic style since they are at the edge of the ship. They both have ups and down. Laser are very accurate, and great fire rate with moderate damage. Cannons penetration is awesome, but uses up ammo. Both powerful as auxiliary weapon systems. Deck cannons used to be the only cannons I would use since you can put them behind armor. They are fantastic, but you have to be strategic on where you place them to be fully effective. Then you get to the final weapon system...Missiles. Which for HE and EMP they are very interesting provide a lot of support. My issues comes in when you get to the Nukes. They are so broken and so OP that they are essentially the only logical choice at level 17-18. Most AI ships at this level are just Nuke boats with like 10+ launchers. So many that no amount of Point defense or Flax battery will save you. It takes all the variety out of the game at later stages, because you have two options. Make your own nuke ship and out nuke them, or make a ship so big you can afford to lose half of it while you destroy their ship. The game is absolutely one of my all time favorite games 1-14 maybe 15 at the most. As soon as you run into a Nuke ship your excitement will diminish and it only gets worse from there.

At this stage of development the game has no right to be this good. While there's a bit of feature creep (for the stage the game is at), mechanics are well though out and the implementation works. Room for tweaking and tuning, yes, but there are supposed full release games going around with much bigger issues in that department. Roadmap for the game continues the trend and solidifies, for me at least, that this is a labour of love more than anything - some lack of focus on things you'd expect to need to get a game ""shipped"", made up for by ridiculous attention to detail and implementation of features that are just cool and fit the game - even with the risk of bloat.

Core gameplay is simple but rewarding. Fun mix of FTL and Terraria (and its ilk) with a huge galaxy to roam in. Currently the universe is a bit soulless in the sense that its hard to care about various factions or what else is supposedly happening around you, so getting immersed in any way is not likely to happen - which is why its good the core mechanics are addictive I suppose. Personal hope is to see this area get more fleshed out eventually, giving me incentive to choose sides and pick my battles. Wouldn't say no to some sort of random event system with all that, either. Sure, there is some faction story etc. in the game, but it's all fairly hidden away and not really a part of the game.

Even with current full price point the game offers enough entertainment - personally I happened to notice it on discount, but having tried it I'd likely pay the full price too for what it is now and the idea of what it can, and hopefully will be.

TL;DR
A fun FTL/Terraria blend with a solid core but lots of fleshing out left to do. Amazing potential, developer seemingly cares more about getting it right than getting it done - with this in mind, get on sale if chance, get for full price if you're happy to play around and see where it goes.",1690883524,1690885390,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

It can be challenging if you are reckless and/or don't know the power levels. The difficulty is ambiguous, just defined as a number, and you don't have any measure to compare that number against it can be very easy to find yourself in over your head.

Additionally, not sure if the backgrounds change but having some systems be in a gaseous nebula, some be in the pitch black emptiness of space with almost nothing to see, and others looking like a more traditional background could help improve the overall look and feel of the game.

+ music is a mix of jean michel jarre and vangelis
+ vast possibilities for ship construction
+ surprisingly some of my crazy ideas work
+ pleasing combat sounds
+ easy menu structure
+ it's fun to paint your ship
+ ""make it so""

- very grindy in a way that after 40 hours is still kinda fun but begins to wear me down
- too little variance of items/weapons to put into the ship (yet?)
- there is exactly zero story, which makes the grind even grindier
- absolutely awful ship formation behaviour. Your Ships take forever to go into formation even if they are equipped with powerful engines.
- Crew is a necessary commodity without a quality to them. they don't improve and you can re-buy them anytime.

Suggestions:

/ There should be a story, even if it's a minor one. Some interaction with someone with a face and a voice. The game feels empty at the moment.
/ The crew could level to be of more use, more experience. maybe?
/ More weapons, more commodities, a real bartering system, weapons upgrades, a black market, different types of armor (level 1-6?)
/ The mentioned ship formation problem AND the collisions among ships or asteroids must be adressed in my opinion.

It's your typical grinding experience. Initially i was sucked into the game because of the freedom you get in constructing unique solutions for your individual warfare preferences. That's cool and all. I built a hauler to mine the asteroids and got to money. This gets old quickly though. In the beginning you seem to be shown the entire layout of the game (your star system is easy and the farther you move the harder it gets.) And there lies the problem for me: It is (seems to be) more and more of the same. I spent 40 hours in the first star system and nearly got all the blueprints. I have four ships and a station. I know that there is more but not much? The game progresses super linear, meaning that from the first hour, you pretty much know what to expect.

I give a thumbs up because the ship building aspect and the combat are very satisfying. The rest - i hope - can be improved upon.

UPDATE:

127 hours have passed and i will modify my statements.  i squeezed more time out of the game after understanding it better. the mod-community is rich and there are plenty of mods to choose from. some address my issues with weapon variety. generally though i tend to shy away from mods as they throw off the balance of the game. the game still needs a story, some polish and more variety but now it's safe to say that you can definitely get 100+ hours out of it without being bored. just pick it up a few weeks later, if it gets repetitive. also the galaxy/systems to explore is good for 300 hours i reckon. so far though it seems as if the various systems are just harder versions of the starter system with different enemy types.
after my addendum i can still recommend the game, even more so.",1688224102,1690790405,True,69,1,0.867019712924957275,0,True,False,True

The tech tree is tiny. You can max out your tech before even leaving the home galaxy. After that its just an endless loop of bounties and resource gathering. Mods would help if they ever worked. Every update breaks them and the modding community seems to have lost all interest in keeping them updated. 

This game needs a larger more diverse collection of missions and enemies. A larger tech tree. New and alien resources to loot in each universe, new and alien weapons and tech to pick up as you move through the game. First contact encounters both positive and negative.

The good:
* Ship building is fantastic and surprisingly deep and complex if you want to go big.
* Primary gameplay loop of gather materials -> build is satisfying and engaging.
* Missions give you a reason to keep progressing from system to system.
* Progression is well-paced and the difficulty curve is reasonable.
* You can make death beams.

The less-than-stellar:
* Ship AI is super basic and will frustrate you when trying to run through asteroids, ships and stations.
* Could do with more content in the sense of upgrade paths for blueprints and items, more options and trade-offs for shields, weapon types and so on.
* While mining and salvaging is satisfying, it does get tedious to vacuum system after system to get materials for money in co-op. Twice the number of players means half the resources and money rewards.
* Missions could do with more variety and personality.

Overall, definitely worth a buy.

Right now, you can get the best weapons and the best shields+engines in less than 15hours of playing, and after you've obtained those, the game becomes rather stagnant. Sure, you can get richer and build a bigger ship with MORE guns and MORE engines after that, but you can't make any more real progress with your ship. There's still plenty of galaxy to explore, but if you can't discover any more technologies or progress with upgrades for your ship then the game isn't fun anymore, and I've reached that point in less than 15hours played. So if you're OK with spending 20euro for a game that you'll only enjoy for a dozen hours, then have at it, but for me personally, that's a rough proposition because when I look at similar games like Star Valor, Star Singularity, Starcom Nexus, etc., then those games cost the same but give way more progression possibility and ship customization options even after a dozen hours. And apart from that, the regional pricing is really bad and the game is for sale in russia, which both should be addressed.

This game is a sandbox RPG singleplayer, you need to purchase blueprints of different ship parts in order to design and build the best starship that suit your needs, we can find different types of players and missions, mining for resources, space exploration, and my personal favorite: COMBAT! 

There are different types of weapons with their very own advantages and disadvantages, that makes you design the best ship possible according to your budget at that time and you can keep doing missions and killing pirates, assulting pirate bases, stealing their warehouses, selling their stuff and getting paid on their bounty, earning money and start building a bigger ship so you can jump to higher difficulty solar systems and keep going again.

This game gets me thinking on how to improve my ship and getting my crew more and more efficient even when I am on the bathroom, I am really adicted to it by now.

I'm hovering around $0 with all the repair expenses after each mission so I'm unable to amass enough money to buy any good upgrades.

Yeah, okay...

Given this is ""Early Access"", Cosmoteer is yet another development I will be watching with hope and anticipation.  Take Prison Architect and Subnautica for example, those projects made excellent use of the Early Access and went became runaway hits at launch.  What's on offer at Cosmoteer's present stage of development is another all to familiar annoying example of Einstein's Theory of Relativity (Time flies when you're having fun) - If you value your goodnight's sleep, you won't like be getting any playing games like these.  Aesthetics and gameplay are highly reminiscent of FTL: Faster Than Light whilst leaning toward the macromanagerial level of control you'd expect for Star Trek: Bridge Commander.  Unlike FTL, Cosmoteer is purely an open world sandbox experience akin to Elite - Only this game REALLY leans into the freeform factor!  Whilst Creative mode works for a design environment, Career mode is where this game excels.  In fact Cosmoteer really comes alive when you take the training wheels off and play on the difficulty settings that don't give you unlocked unlimited everything and god mode.  Training mode Economy is great if you're looking to take a downloaded ship for a shakedown cruise out of the gate.  Otherwise, Cosmoteer is just way too satisfying to be playing with instant gratification features turned on. As for the designer features of this game... I didn't think I would find another game like Harvest where I could replicate a Deathstar's superlaser, but Cosmoteer's Ion Cannons chained together manages to achieve just that!  And if we're going by the official roadmap for Cosmoteer...  We are going to see another game stampeding through the gates on launch day!

The game is pretty stable around the time of this first-impressions and if you open to giving Early Access titles a fair go, Cosmoteer is a deeply engrossing sandbox experience that is well worth checking out.",1689776852,1689776852,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Didn't complete a playthrough... mods are broken. the new resource collector is ok. I think there was a major balance, Ions are terrible and it takes a ton of engines to move anywhere.

Not worth playing unless its your first 100 hours.

Update after 198 hours:

I haven't picked it up in about a week. 
The gameplay is still very rinse and repeat.

There are mods that add a lot of gameplay and reduce the tedium to nearly nothing. The AI spawns ships that don't take advantage of mods so Its a wash in singleplayer.

Its not a bad game, just underdeveloped.

-
Worth one vanilla and two modded play through.

Multiplayer community is terrible, try to find a friend to play with.

Update after 100 hours:

The energy distribution system in this game makes building ships larger than 50% build grid size infeasible with more than  >75-80% efficiency... Your weapons and engines will run out of power in battle longer than 1.1-2min with a 1:1 ratio. Building larger than that will result in a compounding issue of needing more crew to accompany the additional ship size, needing more crew increases bunk space, making you need more crew to deliver power longer distances.

You can place the unnecessary bunks in the back of the ship, but crew/bunk size dictates the use of only the 6crew bunk, 2crew bunk is not space inefficient.

The AI has a tendency to detect you from way outside your range, and from there its a crapshoot on whether or not they'll come after you. They always pick the worst moments as well. Right after you defeat a bounty and have to repair your ship, that's when they'll decide now is the time to interdict. When you have no ammo left, or no power, or no weapons, or no engines. 

And the AI almost always goes for reactor kills. This leads to essentially cheesing the game by making massive f*** off nose cones in front of your reactor, and your weapons on the wings. Rock back and forth from one side of the cone to the other, while your shields recharge, and yeah, the game is solved. You can also compartmentalize your ships so that a reactor kill doesn't insta kill your ship, and for larger ships, I find that incredibly interesting. But the compartmentalization of ships leads to so much menu hell and micromanaging of the crew, that it's honestly not worth it.

If you haven't played Starsector, I would highly recommend it. It's the best spacefaring game in this genre and it's really cheap. Unfortunately it's not on Steam. Starsector combat is probably 10x better than this game. The AI works better, and the ship weapons all feel meaningful and powerful, unlike some of the ones in Cosmoteer. Star sector also handles weapon management a lot better. I spent 12 hours in this game before I figured out how to set point defense weapons to offensively shoot like some smaller AI ships do. None of the tutorials or control options tell you that its control-click while not in build mode.

Despite all these negatives, the freedom to build my own ships, import ships, load any AI design I come across, and the intricacies of that system make up for all of Cosmoteer's shortcomings. If you want a sandbox game with virtually no economy to speak of, lackluster AI, and generally mediocre combat, then sure, this game's right for you. But if you want a relatively deep ship building game that puts previous ones to shame, you've found it.",1689493672,1689493672,True,2,1,0.535898447036743164,0,True,False,True

+ music is a mix of jean michel jarre and vangelis
+ vast possibilities for ship construction
+ surprisingly some of my crazy ideas work
+ pleasing combat sounds
+ easy menu structure
+ it's fun to paint your ship
+ ""make it so""

- very grindy in a way that after 40 hours is still kinda fun but begins to wear me down
- too little variance of items/weapons to put into the ship (yet?)
- there is exactly zero story, which makes the grind even grindier
- absolutely awful ship formation behaviour. Your Ships take forever to go into formation even if they are equipped with powerful engines.
- Crew is a necessary commodity without a quality to them. they don't improve and you can re-buy them anytime.

Suggestions:

/ There should be a story, even if it's a minor one. Some interaction with someone with a face and a voice. The game feels empty at the moment.
/ The crew could level to be of more use, more experience. maybe?
/ More weapons, more commodities, a real bartering system, weapons upgrades, a black market, different types of armor (level 1-6?)
/ The mentioned ship formation problem AND the collisions among ships or asteroids must be adressed in my opinion.

It's your typical grinding experience. Initially i was sucked into the game because of the freedom you get in constructing unique solutions for your individual warfare preferences. That's cool and all. I built a hauler to mine the asteroids and got to money. This gets old quickly though. In the beginning you seem to be shown the entire layout of the game (your star system is easy and the farther you move the harder it gets.) And there lies the problem for me: It is (seems to be) more and more of the same. I spent 40 hours in the first star system and nearly got all the blueprints. I have four ships and a station. I know that there is more but not much? The game progresses super linear, meaning that from the first hour, you pretty much know what to expect.

Making your own ship is incredibly satisfying and seeing your creations grow when you get more experience in building feels great.

Right now the campaign is quite shallow though. The only change between sectors is more difficult enemies. After about 2-3 sectors you've basically seen most what this game has to offer. Some of the ships in higher difficulty sectors are quite frightening to look at and honestly look really badass. Getting more upgrades implemented would be nice because it gives you a new path to work towards once you've bought all the blueprints.

The fleet system was a really nice surprise but I wished it wasn't so limited by the amount of people you can have. Right now the more fame you have, the more crew you can hire, but it's honestly not enough and it just encourages you to make massive ships instead of trying to make a fleet.

Please remember that this game is Early Access and it's current state should be viewed as a work in progress.

Story: There is not really a story to be had. You essentially just start the game and earn money/materials enough to upgrade/build your ship.

Difficulty: The game is easy in the first solar system you start in but can quickly ramp up if depending on the next one you jump to. The starting system for instance was a 1-3 rating for me and I jumped to a 5-7 afterwards feeling confident I would still be ahead of the game but I was definitely wrong. Ramps up quick and gives you a reason to really plan out your ships design.

Theme/Graphics: The mechanics of the game almost necessitate a simple art style due to how much custom building you do. But I don't think it takes away from the experience at all. I think that for an Early Access game the animations are pretty good and have me slowing down the combat speed so I can watch lasers collide with the enemy ships.

Pacing: Here is where I think some balancing needs to be worked on. The game as is is extremely grind intensive without having enough unique things for you to invest your rewards into. There are only 3 tiers to the weapons and one of them (no spoilers) is clearly better when you understand it's mechanics. Aside from the weapons it just doesn't feel like there is anything else to invest in for more money since the yield of raw materials has a higher ROI than refined materials.

TL:DR Summary: I highly recommend this game if you enjoy custom building games where you manage resources and battle NPCs. This game is a lot of fun but can definitely be a time sink if your like me and try to really plan things out.",1689380207,1689380207,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Should you get the game?  That depends.

As described on the tin, the game is very much Early Access with a roadmap that I've seen progress be made on during my time playing, so I feel confident more content and polish are on the way.
So if you like space ship building, crew management, space combat, and want to support an actively developed Early Access game, then this game, in Early Access form, is probably for you.

This is one of those games that scratches a particular itch I get from time to time, which to me is perfect because I'm not constantly haranguing the developer with ""wen v1?""  I supported the team with my EA purchase and casually come back from time to time to see what's going on and scratch that itch.

It's very playable and enjoyable as-is, and I'm excited for new content to roll out on a ""whenever"" timeline.  That being said, if you're looking for full features, tons of content, and get mad when a game crashes mumbling ""but I paid good money for this."", then this game should probably marinate in your wishlist for a while longer.  Maybe check back in Q4 2024.

For you other Cosmoteers already playing I say to you, why are you reading this? Those ships aren't going to blow up and salvage themselves.  Quit dorking around with reading reviews looking for confirmation you made a good buy and go build you that capital ship of your dreams!

The time the game needs to get a good optimization is awful. The game still lags as hell in the pre lategame stage in some singleplayer reviews and in ALL multiplayer reviews. This game is now almost one yea in an official early access but was playable a few years earlier from what ive found. And it can not be possible that you made an estimated 4mio from this indie game as a single dev, then you should be able to pay 1 or 2 guys to sort the optimization problem out kinda quick.

Even i have simple ideas like an auto debris cleaning process after every 30 minutes or so, since every piece of resource or debris will stay in the game forever and will become a big chunk file in the game. Ive heard of people saying their SAVE GAME FILE was SEVERAL GB BIG. For a 1GB game that is just bad programming overall. It should be possible to make a 2D space game run A LOT better, even more if you made millions out of it because of a nice viral wave that went through youtube. And dont tell me anything about ""yea you have to pay this stuff and that stuff"" Shut the F up, it is a single DEV with a Viral game, it is a damn lot enough money to pay 1 or 2 coder if you wanted to. Im waiting for the optimization patch showing in the roadmap and waitign for the difference it will make once it is released and THEN i will change this review back to positive again.

Great game I really love it... BUT.....................................................

- The lag spikes later in the game makes it unplayable
- The Missions are pretty much the same each system
- The AI is so F****** stupid.. like really stupid.. friendly fire is common, the ships that circle targets crash into your ships that are stationary and doing damage pushing them out of the way of combat resulting in a shit tonne of commands to separate them, hanging around space stations ends up with your ships being pushed out of the way which is royal pain in the butt when trying to work out repairs and upgrades. 

Sadly, the discussion group has been complaining about the lag spikes since November and no fix for it has yet been released, for me I can't play it anymore it lags more than plays which was the reason I had to vote no, I can live with stupid AI where crew EVA miles away from ships to suffocate and ships get pushed around but the lag spikes makes it a slide show not a game.

I'm happy to change this review if it's fixed, but in the mean time it's unplayable at the level I'm at.

However there are some things I do hope get added to the game, I'm sure others have requested these aswell and so will I, Personally I think having stations and AI ships you can task to do things, such as guard, mine, patrol would add more variety to the game, The dev wants to add a flux economy so having player stations would make that system more meaningful as you can create low demand product in one area and sell it where its in high demand, whether you buy low and sell high in another system or have a station focused towards making those products and having AI's or yourself go into another system and sell them just adds more to do in the game instead of ""go here"" and ""kill this"", a quest regarding this system could be if a system is low on a specific resource they could send an emergency request offering double the normal price to be supplied with said product, same could be said with stations that have been under attack and need repairs, they will buy basic products for a higher price than average so they can repair their station, and speaking of this in particular I believe that once they add time to repair they should implement having the station slowly repair itself from its own resources, something along side this system could be when they add the repair drones you could heal your allies stations/ships and either get paid for it or have a better relationship with that faction.

Speaking of factions thats something else I would personally love to see added, i believe there are plans to have an ever-changing faction region, so faction A and take over territory of faction B ect, having your own personal faction would make the game more interesting and would allow all out war with other factions to take over their territory your own, taking over their stations ect and conquering that system as your own, an extension of this system could be a more diverse way to interact with the factions, such as forming alliances or declaring war on them, calling for reinforcements of an ally or even offering your own assistance towards a faction. I believe that you should start out as a bounty hunter until you reach a certain fame amount, probably 2000 as its the current max and gives you the max amount of crew you can have, but once you reach this you can create your own faction removing the limit and instead favoring a limit of how many crew can be per ship, you could do this as you buy a ship license to be able to build more ships and obtain crew for that ship depending on the license you bought, for example a small ship can have 50 crew max, a medium could have 150, and large being up to 300 and just go up in size from their upgrading the license to large X to large XX and so on to give yourself another hundred crew at a very pretty penny, another thing that could benefit the game could be insurance on your ships, if it gets destroyed in battle you can get it back at no cost at your own factory, or at a discount, or purchase it back at a fraction of the cost at an allies factory or a neutral factions factory, of course you need to purchase crew again as you you would need to restaff it, the license would stay to what it was but buying another insurance package for that ship should be required in order to keep it active on that ship.

Some additional things that could be added to the game in no particular order is,

Pirate factions/ rebel factions that broke away from the larger ones.

Respawnable resources like asteroids.

Special events such as black holes, solar flares, a large asteroid entering the solar system with very rare or a large amount of common resources at maybe a higher purity, either it being for a limited time or it leaving the system and you needing to harvest it before its gone

Factory modules for ships, letting you have the ability to create one massive mothership and being able to create other smaller ships, maybe something like the rail gun and the iron beams for example on how to make them, have a designated space in square design letting you build the entire ship within that area and if you dont have a big enough area you cannot make it, or possibly having it to where its creating the ship and pushing it outside the module at the same time letting you create long/large ships but only needing a wide factory module to do it, and if you expand the module it just decreases the time to create said ship but building more of it at once while moving it out.

Sub Factions you can create that are you ally but are mostly independent, you can give them a system and they will expand and produce ships on their own based off of either your own design or designs of basic ships, also having the ability to assign specific ships you make to roles, such as a mining ship or cargo should would help the AI determine what ships of yours are what instead of them having a battleship with a lot of storage be used as a supply ship and vise versa.

End Game boss faction or just an insane ship to destroy as an end goal, it can either just be in one system or start taking over other systems creating a danger for you and everyone else, having you either take it on solo with your armada or have your allies assist you with theirs.

In co-op having every player be able to create their own faction or even everyone being apart of just a single faction, just allows for more diverse gameplay where you can ally or fight your friends, there could even be servers to host a set amount of players in a universe and have them battle each other till endgame or become allies and fight other players and AI factions.

More armor types, weapons, defense systems and ways to protect yourself, for example having a shield like structure but it meant to either buff your armor, weapons, crew speed ect with possible a radius that is adjustable, but the larger it is the more energy it consumes and/or more crew it needs to operate, also having more weapons like the railgun and ion beam/prism's where they need more than one part to function is very cool and I love this feature, having it to where you can design ships around those specific weapons increasing the weapons size and power and building a ship around it, an example of a new weapon could be a black hole launcher, you have a spherical shape having it to where if you increase the size it increases the destructive power of the black hole, but of course you need a way to launch it, so imagine a ""U"" or ""C"" shaped design, the opening in that is where it will launch out in a straight forward path, distorting space, changing the angles of shots and lazers, the further away it gets the less powerful it is until it dissipates, it would be very overpowers to so counter it have shields be the best way to stop it, having its ammunition be a very rare resource and having the energy requirements be large requiring a constant supply and dedicated crew or it will dissipate mid charge.

Creating your own drones, so for example having a hanger bay, having it to where the larger it is the more craft can be inside or the bigger the craft can be, you can create your own craft with their own special rules, allowing you to create very small and powerful ships.

Possibly using the planets as ways to harvest and create products, or colonize them in order to hire your own crew for your ships.

Thats about all I can think about for suggestions, some improvements I'd like to see are regarding items and harvesting them, its very laggy and slow to harvest a large ship, to increase this maybe have a module similar to the tractor beam pick up resources and store them inside the ship and have your crew grab from the module and put them into storage. also having ways to filter resources to grab would be nice.",1667358900,1689142507,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

It is pretty fun ship building until you figure out there is nothing else to do. Try it when it is on sale. Return if you don't like it. 

I changed my rating from a borderline ""No"" to a ""Yes"" because the price is right. ""Early Access""is meaningless if you are paying full price for a game, but this game is priced correctly for what it is.

Things I like: 
- Smooth running, very polished, not a bad UI. Some games have flashy effects and good battle graphics, but crappy menus and UI. I think this game puts relatively equal thought into every aspect of the game.
- Ship building works well. 
- Zero bugs from what I can tell
- Generally, the current state is a solid base for the future.

Things I don't like -
- Very lifeless galaxy. Sure there are ships flying around but there is no backstory, history, economy, no interactions. There is zero no-combat content.
- There is no real exploring. You can search a system in a few minutes, but there is nothing interesting. This could be ""low hanging fruit"" for an update. Add ruins, artifacts, rare resources, space anomalies, anything. 
- The thing that grinds my gears and caused me to write this review (which started out very negative) is the fact that the only resource in the game is crew members. Every other resource is disposable but the search for crew caused me to get bored and stop playing. The crew finding system is ""fame"" based, but the WHOLE GALAXY WORKS FROM THE SAME POOL OF RECRUITS. I got all of the recruits from one system and I thought to myself, ""I will jump to the next system and battle my way to the next station to pick up some more crew"", only to find the entire galaxy has a certain number of crew for each fame level and no more. Each system doesn't have a few crew for fame 1-100, a few for 101-200, and a few for 201-300 fame. In the beginning system, you pick up some crew from fame 1-100, and that is it in the whole galaxy. Every system across known space is updated and raises their standards, so the next system you go to will have zero 1-100 fame recruits.

Being able to design the ships from scratch is so much fun. Setting up crew assignments and priorities is a nice touch.

Friendly AI can get really wonky and needs a lot of supervision which gets to be kinda impossible with multiple ships.

They seem to be incapable of avoiding a simple obstacle, or each other, especially when in formation.
In short, the route finding is a disaster currently. 
Little things like manual control getting switched off any time you open a menu can get irritating. 
Missions variety is lacking.
Really bad stuttering as you progress further into the game.
Overall, ship movement and some janky controls are thorns in the side of what could become a great game. In spite of my complaints I keep crawling back because it's hella addicting but frequently very frustrating.

Pros:
1)  Awesome looking ships and weapon effects.
2)  Good progression system with blueprints.
3)  Large galaxy map to explore.
4)  Intricate ship design with a lot of customization.

Cons:
1)  Very repetitive quests.
2)  Hard limit on crew members, which pigeonholes you into certain designs based on your fame (aka level).
3)  Increasing difficulty of enemies which require you to frequenly refactor your ship.
4)  Blueprint unlocking is finished early on.

I don't know if people play the game on easy or what it is, but difficulty really spikes once you run into your fame limit and you start running into specialized enemy types.  Money and resources are irrelevent in this game.  I have enough money and resources to build an enormous battleship.  The problem is that I can only hire 54 crew members, and the only way to increase that is by killing bounties.

The bounties get tough, like really tough.  They don't run out of ammo, and they turn on a dime even though they have a lot more armor than you.  Unless I see the source code, I will not believe that the enemy ships are bound to the same rules that you are.  Most of the battles end with me dying because I can't turn fast enough.  You might want to put some weapons and shields on your sides and rear end, but remember what I said about the crew limit?  You realize how limited you are once the enemies get tough.  Thrusters also require crew members to refuel, so you are limited to how many of those you can use.

I wasted around 5 hours just fighting, dying, and trying different ideas (but being blocked by a crew limit).  To me this is more of a puzzle and logistics game than a fun space game.",1688766934,1688767074,False,4,1,0.483275651931762695,0,True,False,True

If you enjoy the process of designing, building and re-designing ships you can have fun with the game as you have a few options to do so. There are several types of weapons available (more are announced in the road map). and you have to create your ship structure around to make the weapons work and to keep you crew alive. If you don't use guides then you will have a learning curve about where to place ship components and where you may want to avoid it so you ship doesn't go *boom* quickly.

Even early on you can already build massive ships if you have the appropriate ressources. However you will be artificially limited in terms of the crew size as the game requires you to complete missions and gain fame before more crew will be willing to join you. Missions are the only way to gain fame at the moment. The missions have difficulty ratings and based on the difficulty level you can only get fame from them until you reach a certain level. I guess this is intended to limit your ship builds so you aren't flying around in massive super ships while combating small fighters.

Anyway at the moment when you start the game the basic approach for all available systems is basically:
1. Contact the local stations to get missions
2. Explore the system and complete the missions
3. Salvage destroyed ships and/or mine minerals
3.1 When your cargo hold is full fly to a nearby stations to sell materials
4. Once you complete ""all"" missions you can fly to the next system and repeat from step 1

It's fun for a few hours but becomes quickly stale and boring (for me it was by the time I finished the second system). You will probably spend a few hours in between missions to re-design your ship(s) so you can more efficiently complete the missions. After you have a working design though there is not much reason to fiddle around with the ship anymore. So you then end up just doing missions and transporting goods fo the stations.

The road map shows some potentially interesting changes for the future and I will take another look at the game in about a year.

I really want to like this game as the concept is solid, and the gameplay is pretty good. Ultimately I think there are 4 main things holding this one back:

1. The AI crew is really frustrating, and they don't always follow the priorities you set. Even though I have fire extinguishers all over my ship, and ""Fight Fires"" is literally their ONLY level 10 priority, the crew still ignores fires 90% of the time.  My entire ship will be going up in flames, and the crew just ignores it. At best they may clear 1 square of fire before they wander off to do something else. Basically if my ship is ever on fire, I'm going to lose 75-100% of my ship.  I also cannot for the life of me get my crew to use the railguns correctly.  They will sit there at the controls like any other weapon, but it never fires unless I put it on manual control.

2. The enemy balancing makes zero sense.  For example, I recently put together a massive ship with four of the highest tier beam weapons I have (and their aiming crystals) and four of the second highest tier beam weapons.  I have overlapping shields covering the entire front of my ship, and I have plenty of power generators and crew to keep everything running smoothly.  Then I ran into a level 4 enemy ship with ONE high-tier cannon that literally split my ship in half in less than 10 seconds.  I can have all 8 weapons firing at him and I can't even do enough damage to destroy the enemy cannon before my entire ship is wiped out.  I got rid of shields and just stacked layer after layer of armor... That didn't matter either. This supposedly easy level 4 ship destroys me every time. Meanwhile I can vaporize level 3 ships in seconds without taking any damage at all.  Yeah, that makes sense.  

3. The ship physics are either broken, or the enemy AI is.  Time and time again I will see kamikaze enemies that will drive their ship straight into mine.  No matter how many thrusters I have pushing my ship in reverse, they are stuck to my ship like glue.  Even spinning the ship does nothing.  Somehow their weapons continue firing and none of my weapons can turn to hit them.  I've lost ships to this stupid mechanic more often than I want to admit.

4. There is currently no automation, at least from what I've seen.  Sure you can run multiple ships, but it will be a pain to micro-manage them all for every little thing they do.  This game really needs to take a page out of Avorion's book. That space sim did a really great job at AI-managed ships. You can set a ship to mine an asteroid belt and go off to your other ships who are doing combat or whatever. I initially tried using a fleet of ships in Cosmoteer. The ships were constantly getting in each other's way, and micro-managing every move for each one of them was exhausting.  The enemy ships can group up and function just fine, so I don't see why the players have no automation options.


I really enjoy the game otherwise, but the 4 above issues are just so frustrating. I often log off feeling very annoyed... It sucks because I can tell there is a lot more to the game beyond the first few systems I've visited.  I just don't think I enjoy the game long enough to keep trying it.

Well this is the perfect game for you then!  The construction and design of your ship is as grand as you imagination can be.  I find myself spending a great deal of time making tweaks and changes to make sure I'm creating something that is not only visually cool but also usable during combat.  The game is a mix of Prison Architect/Rim world and FTL.  I played for several hours tweaking and adjusting my ship and I was having a grand time.  Eventually I started to build a second ship and then things started to really kick into high gear.  My primary ship is a tank with defensive capabilities and my secondary ship is light on armor but packs a punch ""Glass cannon""  

There isn't much for story (do this quest or kill that pirate) but the game is endless fun and honestly, a dream come true for anyone that likes ship to ship combat.  The tactical elements are endless.

Pros:
-Ship building is intuitive and fun
-Ship combat is amazing and tactical (pause to plan)
-Music is catchy and sound effects are great
-The price is right
-Highly addictive

Cons:
-Zero story
-Quests aren't varied

Pros:
-Easy to use, intuitive building system
-Good damage modeling that makes sense and provides a clear sense of where your ship if vulnerable
-Clean interface

Cons:
-The career mode is still in need of more building out- you can mine a handful of things, refine them, and build ships, but the mission variety is lacking (""hunt some ships"" ""attack a station"" ""deliver stuff"" or ""go places"") and the way crew recruitment is gated by reputation (earned by completing missions) makes it hard to fully crew the kind of ship you want to build... and more mission variety and a more dynamic career mode would make it feel less repetitive.
-Limited variety in armor and weapon type. There are also some obvious late game ""killer builds"" that discourage experimentation
-AI/pathing issues still need a bit more love- like my starship not figuring out how to disentangle from a station when bumped together (something I can figure out easily enough when flying in ""manual mode"") Also- what's with the starships flying together to fire at each other point blank in combat?",1688524058,1688524058,False,2,0,0.507824063301086426,0,True,False,True

Definitely not speaking from experience, I swear...

At its core, the mechanics of Cosmoteer are absolutely rock solid and rich in emergent gameplay. I would liken it to a cross between two games I've played, FTL: Faster Than Light and a very old game from the 2000s called Battleships Forever where it's a physics based ship combat game with very granular targeting and ship control, with the added gameplay layer of constructing your own ships in-game and all the modularity that entails. The result is a really nice blend of mechanics that are easy to pick up and play with but not so simple to master. The shipbuilding components are easy to understand but deceptively deep despite (IMO) a relatively short parts list, with a very clear sense of progression in your shipbuilding as you learn the concepts required to build good ships and can better optimise and refine your designs. Combat is engaging and rewarding for a variety of different playstyles - depending on your ship's loadout, of course - and can be done against the AI in Career and with/against other human opponents in multiplayer.

The Career mode is where I think Cosmoteer is at its weakest as it's a fairly shallow experience that doesn't really fulfil a space RPG role very well. Progressing and upgrading your fleet can be fun absorbing early on but soon starts to get repetitive as you are constantly limited by resources and crew, and AI ships become so much more optimised and threatening as you ascend the ladder that it limits your range of viable designs if you want to actually progress at a reasonable pace. For Cosmoteer's very modest asking price though it's still a fine experience, just be sure to temper your expectations.

A majority of my nearly 400 hours thus far have been spent in creative mode, just building and testing and painting interesting ships. I design lore-friendly in-game faction ships that are not well optimised but look pretty, but if you want go the PvP route of hyperoptimising everything to a razor's edge and pitting your ships up against other players' in trial by combat, you can do that as well thanks to the robust multiplayer support.

The presentation of the game overall is incredibly charming and cute, and with vibrant colours and a basically infinite assortment of styles of ship to see. Painting a large vessel is unfortunately a little tedious in exchange for the fine control you get, but finally finishing a good-looking ship that also performs well is immensely satisfying. I have to shout out the soundtrack too - Dubmood did an amazing job composing songs that are very distinctive and memorable and I really enjoy listening to them casually too. Really gets in the mood for more shipbuilding, ngl.

And the future of the game continues to be promising. The roadmap is clear and progress is always being felt through regular updates and gameplay additions, and the devs are active and very receptive to feedback on social media. I hope all indie devs can strive to match or exceed their example.

Overall, go buy Cosmoteer lol. It's a great game and I think you'll enjoy it.",1688415260,1688415260,True,13,1,0.642599284648895264,0,True,False,True

New players quit quickly due to the PvE gameplay being unengaging, shallow and short.
if new players would've been pushed to the already working PvP loop first then offered the PvE gameplay as a bonus, game would be way more alive due to the PvP loop being quite engaging and connected with the community, as opposed to the still unfinished PvE gameplay.

Ai is way too easy to cheese in PvE.
PvP has a stale meta
quite dislike the non newtonian physics
a friend of mine has mentioned that he dislikes the engagement ranges, as in, how close ranged the fights are, i do agree with him but im not as passionate about it.
crew run out of oxygen way too slowly, leaving sometimes dozens of crew in the middle of nowhere in PvP, causing unneccessary lag and clutter.
developer is too focused on PvE even though it clearly is not even close to being ready to be the main gamemode.

Watch multiple hours of tutorials on YouTube to get a sense of how to build a ship, the weapon types, placements, economy, etc.  Get in game and attack a ship and salvage it then attack another ship and salvage it then attack another ship and salvage it and attack another ship and salvage it and then attack another ship and salvage it and then attack another ship and salvage it ad nauseum.  

Go unlock some blueprints for some excitement and going forward with your ship.  Find out that you don't have access to the resources necessary to do so.  Find out you need to keep adding to your ship to the point that you are dismantling every design you've made so far so that you can make another one.  Find out you can't get enough crew to make a second ship.  Make a salvager finally after maxing out your reputation in the starting system at 140, then go attack more ships and salvage them.  It's super duper boring.  There are asteroids you can mine and process if you want to try to get some kind of difference of gameplay.  But it'll always come back to attacking another ship and salvaging it.  And having your designs become obsolete and having to dismantle half your ship to add on to it because nothing is set up with modularity in mind.  None of the starting ships are even laid out halfway decent.  Long travel times for your crew and inefficient layouts requiring you to legitimately rebuild them over and over and over again. 

So more or less, it's just boring and slowly paced.  I was hoping for a little excitement.  There is none.  You can spend hours making ships and telling your crew what to do in what priority and what order and etc etc etc, and then guess what you're building for and what you're doing it for?  To attack another ship and salvage it.  Or to attack a pirate base and salvage it.  

This is a sandbox, not a compelling narrative or story or campaign or anything that makes me want to spend any more time in the game.  It's like, ""Do I want to try to redesign my ship for the 5th time?  Not really.  Do I want to try to make another ship with cool weapons?  Hell yeah.  Oh wait, I need diamonds and tri steel for that.  So I'll unlock the blueprints to allow me to manufacture those and go mine some resources.  That'll be fun and different.  Oh, both blueprints require the other resource.  That's wonderfully stupid.  Also, I can't buy those resources at any of the stations in the system to even get started?  Cool!  So I just wasted 45 minutes designing a ship I can't even make.  Do I want to go to another system and do everything that I just did in the first system to maybe MAYBE get ahold of those resources by (guess what) ATTACKING OTHER SHIPS AND SALVAGING THEM?  Not really.  Do I want to keep playing this game at all?  Not really.""  

I'd say if you're into one trick ponies of ship building, this might be your thing, but don't expect more than a few hours of gameplay before you're just repeating the same processes over and over and over again.  Doing bounties and attacking things and salvaging them.  Then traveling to another system and doing it some more and some more and some more.  Maybe eventually you'll have multiple ships so you can do the same thing in a slightly different way?  Maybe you'll specialize your ships to play different roles and set them up in a formation and try to do the same thing that way.  Or maybe you'll be like me and just get bored of it all much quicker than you expected.  

I definitely recommend Airships: Conquer the Skies over this game.  Same kind of ship building and designing with MUCH more fun and a campaign mode that is compelling to play through.  Design stuff to take over cities, upgrade those cities and build bigger and badder ships.  Make airships and landships.  Use all kinds of different weapons and playstyles without having to worry about redesigning your ONE ship over and over.  

It's not that I don't enjoy games like this.  I do.  But this one just doesn't have a lot of spark to it that makes me want to play it.  I'm not working towards anything other than to do more because I can.  At this point in life, I need a reason to play a game other than just to play it for the sake of it.  Objectives.  Goals.  A story. 
 Something.  And ""just because you can"" is what this turns into very, very quickly.  No goal.  No story.  No narrative.  No reason to keep going other than just because you can.  

I'm just going to go back to Diablo 4, or Battlebit Remastered, or hell even American Truck Simulator.  Those all have goals in them.  Complete the story, level up to unlock guns, or create your own company and purchase more trucks and hire employees to make money for you.

You get to build a ship from the inside and then take it into battle at a macroscopic combat scale but with targeting of individual components on ships possible. The campaign is pretty barebones at this time, but it's a formula that's worked for decades: gather resources through trading, or being a courier, or bounty hunting, or mining - upgrade your ship, in this case with total control over how you build it - and meet progressively more challenging content where you'll still be doing the aforementioned things but at more and more interesting scales, as you continue to pump this basic gameplay loop.

if you cheat on this game it will get boring super fast.

Though i will make one mod recommendation if you get annoyed with the supplying power to your ship parts via crews hauling it and you think, they are more tech advanced then us but can't even use coords to transfer power... there are mods for that, just make certain you don't cheapen the costs and it won't be a cheat in my opinion. it was a rather dumb dev decision to not have power cableing or something of the like in vanilla, but maybe they plan to add it still?",1687890942,1687891232,True,2,0,0.515570938587188721,0,True,False,True

It's in depth, giving a lot of freedom when creating the ships I want and making the replay-ability of the game very high, at least where the ship building is concerned.

The ship creator itself is nearly flawless, and aside from modules you will find yourself wishing were in the game, there isn't anything negative there. 

The biggest issue I have is that there is no storyline at all, and when you get to higher levels, even on the hardest settings, you ship will simply steamroll everything you meet. The game is missing truly challenging enemies in the later stages of the game. 

The community is so strong on cosmoteer that it would benefit from a mechanic found in Spore, where player created creatures would be added into your game. If this could be implemented in Cosmoteer this game would be truly exceptional, as you would be fighting other players ships piloted by AI.

With its myriad of features and boundless creative possibilities, Cosmoteer stands as a shining example of a well-crafted indie game.

One of the standout aspects of Cosmoteer is its exceptional ship-building mechanics. The game allows players to design and construct their own spaceships from scratch, providing an unparalleled level of freedom and creativity. From intricate, multi-level warships brimming with powerful weapons to sleek and agile exploration vessels, the possibilities are limited only by your imagination. The intuitive and user-friendly interface makes ship construction a joy, regardless of your skill level or prior experience with similar games.

Cosmoteer also excels in its deep and immersive gameplay. As a space sandbox game, it offers a wide range of activities and challenges. Whether you prefer intense ship-to-ship combat, resource management and trading, or embarking on daring exploration missions, there is something for every player. The game strikes a perfect balance between strategic decision-making and fast-paced action, ensuring that every moment feels engaging and rewarding.

The level of customization available in Cosmoteer is truly impressive. From outfitting your ships with an extensive selection of weapons, shields, and engines, to customizing crew roles and assigning tasks, the game allows you to fine-tune every aspect of your space-faring experience. This depth of customization adds a layer of personalization that keeps the gameplay fresh and encourages experimentation.

Furthermore, Cosmoteer benefits from a welcoming and passionate community. The game's active modding community has created a wealth of user-generated content, including new ship designs, mods, and additional gameplay features. This extends the game's longevity and adds an extra layer of enjoyment for players looking to expand their horizons.

Visually, Cosmoteer presents a clean and appealing aesthetic.

The weapon sound effects are pretty cool and its very easy to pick up on how the game functions.   There are so many ways to customize your fleet.  You want a single big ship with lots of functionality go for it.  You want a fleet of ships that specialize in certain things?  Power to you.  You want to remake ships from your favorite spaces movies?  That works too.

Pro's
-Decent sound effects
-Ship Customization is awesome
-Lots of enemy ship variety.
-Progressive difficulty
-Mod friendly
-Easy to navigate menu's and ship designing
-multiplayer

Con's
-Ship pathing is terrible (unless you're paying attention you could get stuck on a big rock if you travel through an asteroid field)
-Mission variety is low
-Ship combat on default settings feels fast early game
-Factions don't really have a lot of life to them outside of unique ships

Neutral
-No real story but a good open sandbox


I Feel like for $20 you're defiantly getting your value for this game.  The developers put out updates on a good basis, I've seen they interact with their following.  Putting ship designs from their fans in the game.   With frequent updates I feel this game will continue to be worth its price tag and something special will be made.

PvE:
* Railkites are not balanced
* Mining and salvaging is tedious and laggy
* No variety in the missions
* No variety in the systems
* No replay value

PvP:
* There is always someone studder lagging the game
* Studder lag makes it very difficult to control your ship in DC mode since keyboard inputs get dropped
* The game D-syncs frequently when rail guns hit a ship
* D-syncs disables DC mode, changes the player's view, ship selection, it can even allow you to control other players' ships sometimes
* RTS with Collision Avoidance on refuses to move your ships sometimes around debris or asteroids
* RTS with Collision Avoidance off sends your ships directly into asteroids and gets them stuck
* RTS move commands sometimes rotate and move and sometimes strafe only. If your ship doesn't have sideways thrust your ship just wont move.
* RTS rotate commands will not rotate your ship unless your cursor is far enough away from your ship.
* When trying to issue an RTS attack command, if you happen to click any open pixel in the enemy ship, it does a move command instead of a attack command which can be fatal
* Clicking debris when trying to issue an RTS move command will ignore the move command
* Splitter ships can cause players to disconnect, effectively making them a DOS attack
* There is no direct restriction on the number of ships in Domination mode which allows players to lag the game to a crawl, another form of DOS attack
* The low projectile speed, high ship speeds, thruster ramp time make just a few viable ship types.
* Overall the user interface and controls are not well suited for the competitive games modes like elimination, domination, or arena.",1683325192,1685507841,False,9,1,0.540874958038330078,0,True,False,True

Fighting is always the more ""fun"" part so it has to be first, maybe later on the game should think about stuff like repair stations, supply shipyards and catch asteroids while they pass the system.
As far as i can say, no fame gain with mining and selling/trading is my biggest issue with the game as i end up with alot of cash after the first 2-3 sectors but what to do? Limited by fame to get crew for bigger stuff and even if i want to go hunting...i have to ""abandon"" my cargo/miners for a hitting one ...
Beside that, respawn at all is a big issue, no stations, no ships, no enemys, no asteroids ... nothing does respawn (or is at least repair/rebuildable). ""Space Haven"" solved it with a ""jump"" to a new location to refresh everything, ""same"" here, you switch the system (but those arn't infinite).
Don't know if we can expect a running universe (like e.g. ""X4"") if the game evolves with development. (Where we can defend our self build mining hub stations against enemys or supply factions with our trading ships.)

The game is based around evolving your design to beat every enemy and progress, that's how fame works, that's how the respawn works, forcing you forward, crew is the limit, most stuff you need you get from the enemys. If you dare to step aside to mine/produce/trade you end up micomanaging your crew and move it from one to another ship for each action.

Yes, the current fighting/creative/designing part is fun and i like it, but that already is missing QoL features which leads to alot of repetitive clicks and tasks (like repair your ship after fights if you got the stuff at storage or go near a station).
To be fair, if the fame limit wouldn't be there you could build a ship beating half the game at the start system...but that's another issue with non existing techtree for shipparts or other features that would feel like evolving your tech and get stronger over time (at the end you just scale up, more of the same weapons, more same shields. more of everything).

Recommended? Yes, cause i hope the game will add some more depth to the current shallow build and create, but otherwise that's what the game was made for.",1684458487,1684458797,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Its got a simple to do but infinitely tricky to master assembly and design system that produces all manner of fail spaceships on the way to finally getting something that works. The community is extremely engaged and some of publicly designed spaceships are incredible (everything can be downloaded and incorporated in your own games with a couple of clicks.)

The campaign is a little bare bones at the moment but is fully playable in coop and has plenty of dynamic systems operating in a procedural generated star cluster and presents a nicely increasing level of danger and difficulty as the player gets better at the game. 

If you've ever played the likes of Elite or SC or X4 and wondered what it might be like with a bit more visceral damage modelling and partially crippled ships or under the hood control of ship systems with capture, salvage and repair - this game shows you all that stuff in cute, precise and efficient 2d graphics. 

Game is still in early access and active development and can only get better at this point. 

Easy recommend if you have the slightest interest in designing your own ships and playing PVE, COOP or PVP fights arena or campaign in glorious analogue construction detail.

On the plus side, there have been *zero* crashes, which is pretty impressive. On the other hand, there are still some glitches and rough edges. For example, as a Stars! player from way back, I greatly enjoy the ship design process and tools. Well done! However, having to manually place doors and corridors so that crew can resupply a weapon gets really old really fast ... and sometimes it says ""no ammo access"" or similar even though that's not true. Worse, I have one ship right now that for some reason can't receive ammo specifically even though there's capacity and access and other resources can be received just fine. No idea why. Also, the crew-order and supply-chain mechanics are either unfinished or just so counter-intuitive that it amounts to the same thing.

The same sort of ""unfinished or just counter-intuitive"" question also arises with ship formations. Sometimes they seem absolutely essential to winning a battle. Other times they cause ships to ""wander"" in unproductive ways while their comrades get pounded to dust. This is compounded by the fact that ships are *stunningly dumb* about navigating around asteroids and such, often getting stuck in almost-comedic ways. Similarly, I'm tired of accidentally leaving crew behind even though there's neither a reason for them to be out nor any visual indication that they are. Also tired of being severely crew-limited because maximum crew count is related to fame which doesn't increase fast enough when facing enemies I have any hope whatsoever of surviving against.

Then there are the game-balance and difficulty-ramp issues one expects with an early-access game. Enemies always seem *far* more mobile (compared to mine) than they have any right to be, and their armor seems stunningly effective compared to my own. Enemies regularly blow giant holes in my (larger) ships or destroy them entirely, despite having nothing more potent than a large cannon. By contrast, even an augmented railgun or 8x ion-beam emitter complex (yes I know how to maximize output for that) takes several seconds to make even a minor dent even in a smaller enemy ship. It's just barely possible that I'm falling afoul of some not-yet-tuned and inadequately-explained mechanic, but it feels like cheating and makes me not want to play.

These things are all fixable - mostly tuning issues and the reason early access even exists in the first place. There still might be a great game in here somewhere. I encourage the developers to use feedback like mine to keep iterating toward that. That's why I still recommend the game, even though I won't be playing it myself for a while.",1683646251,1683646251,True,14,0,0.679216563701629639,1,True,False,True

I would like to be able to designate some storage areas to be for ammo only, but alas ammo ends up haphazardly placed in the storage, often ending up in the furthest reaches of the ship where it takes forever for crew to bring it, so the big guns just sit idle while crewmembers traverse the ship trying to bring ammo on foot like a bunch of pre-industrial age peasants.

There's no collision damage? I can ram my ship against rocks and other ships, but no damage. You can damage other ships by pushing them into the sun, but other than that there doesn't appear to be any kinetic damage whatsoever.

The main issues is that the sandbox isn't dynamic whatsoever, and the 'objective' becomes hunting these pirate ships which are in stationary positions around the system which becomes repetetive. More faction interactivity in the mount&blade fashion would improve the game, such as creating your own factions, owning your own systems. However if you look at the roadmap they are planning to alleviate this issue.

Performance is currently a big issue since the game allows you, and intends you to have multiple ships but if you are two coop players with 4 ships each in the early-midgame it's already slowing down to 10-30fps on my 5600X and 2060S.

Unique features: Sharing ships a png is really neat.  Complete freedom in strategy and ship design.

What it needs more of: more variety of systems, missions and enemies.  Maybe unique resources or legendary parts to keep the reward cycle going after late game.

Good steam deck compatibility using community profiles - great use of touchpad macros.

I felt like at level 2-3 I had already seen everything there was and the rest was just going to be more of the same. 

This game needs way more ship parts that are level gated or not available in the first or even second system to give some sort of progression. It also needs a story eventually or some reason other than collecting resources to build bigger ships. After 9 hours I felt like at this point I had seen everything this game has to offer.

Sure, you can build any kind of spaceship you want, and everything working together is great, but once you have that spaceship or that fleet, you're just mowing through everything with no challenge, and that's all there is to do. It was fun for about 6 hours.

I'd love to give it a thumbs up, but there's just not enough here.

Where FTL took the micro-management of your crew and Reassembly took the top-down sandbox of exploring and building your own functional ship, Cosmoteer combines the best parts of both of these games to create its own amazing product. As an early access title, I've experience little to no bugs. The crew management and ship building is incredibly fun and comprehensive, and you can really let your imagination run wild. In campaign there are some limitations to your ship building capabilities until you progress, but that's the fun part. About 20ish hours in I've unlocked all the blueprints and at this point in my first campaign I got burnt out. Game became a bit grindy and repetitive, and lost that sense of establishing yourself in the world and the motivation to do so.

 I will now list my gripes:

There is a lack of variety in the missions and can grow stale after about 25ish hours. The only missions I've encountered in my time playing are bounties, group-bounties, explore sectors, find space stations, clear asteroid fields and destroy pirate bases. There are some delivery missions too, but I avoided them as I didn't find them very fun. There was a ton more for me to explore by the time I decided to stop playing, so there could be more missions I'm not familiar with, I just lost my desire to move forward. 
I also hit a pretty hard difficulty curve around this point too where your ship layout needs to be perfect in order to have a fighting chance against your opponents. After having difficulties progressing and realizing I had to do the same thing I'd been doing the last 30 hours all over again, and probably again after that.. etc.. This was my walk-away point.

I wish there were more ship building options, weapon variety is lackluster, especially for endgame. 

Lack of engagement with factions: It was super cool to see freight ships transporting cargo around, but you soon realize it's fairly surface-level. There are some missions that factions can give you that targets another factions vessels or stations, but as far as the factions engagement with each other, I never saw them fighting each other. There was no back and forth fighting for territory. Just seemed kind of lifeless. Again I'm not sure if this changes in the later portions of the game, I just didn't take the time to get that far to see for myself. 

The repetitiveness sets on fairly early and intensely. As mentioned above, not a whole lot of mission variety, or any story driven missions, just get thrust into the sandbox and told to build up your ship and crew. This would be totally amazing, if there were more to do but my 30 hours consisted of: go to this spot, kill ship. go to that spot, kill 2 ships, collect bounties, use money to upgrade. Explore, mine materials, fight ship. All done in this sector after 3-4 hours? Go to next one, do it all over again. After 4-5 sectors and you have enough money and reputation to unlock everything, you've kinda run out of goals. 

TLDR

If this seems kinda critical, I'm just trying to give some feedback, I did really enjoy my time with the game. I could definitely see myself spending well into 50-100 hours on a game like this if it were to bring in the variety it needs in missions, weapons, and faction engagement. As it is now, some mechanics are a bit too shallow for the longevity this game asks of you.",1680583954,1680583954,True,37,0,0.80290532112121582,0,True,False,True

You can get very granular in how you build ships, assign crew to specific tasks, perform some fairly intricate maneuvers with planned courses, etc. The combat is quite fun as well with great sound effects and lots of things going boom and bits of ships and crew flying all over. There are also some pretty good mods out there. Now the problem which basically rendered this game too annoying to play after nearly a 100 hours. Crew AI is just ok, although I have seen them go total brain dead for no apparent reason as well, but the ""auto-pilot AI"" is absolutely horrible. They really need to grant your ships the same level of ""AI"" that enemy ships have as I see them dance around everything with nearly no issues. You get beyond 2 ships and its basically a total train wreck and so annoying for me, I stopped playing for quite sometime and upon returning was already annoyed to the point of quitting again within 10 minutes. It really is THAT bad. With 5 ships in my formation it can take minutes just to get them into a position for which they can then fly straight. Any significant turn, asteroid, station, other ships, and especially their own ships, etc in the way; its over and you have a tangled train wreck of ships which you are cleaning up, again. Top this off with it happening in combat and its just too annoying. The game scaling, while not a reason to not recommend, is pretty bad as well. You can go from one solar system where you are nigh invincible to the next you die, period, no real fight; you are dead. Additionally it seems NPC AI enemies with the same exact ships do significantly more damage per hit from the same weapon than you can do. Combine the poor auto-pilot and scaling issues and you are relegated to developing a insanely monstrous unwieldy ship and constant repetition. I suppose for the price paid and time played its worth it but I probably put up with a good 20-30 hours of the annoying AI before I finally gave up.",1680359921,1680359921,False,7,0,0.520801365375518799,0,True,False,True

[h3]What is Cosmoteer?[/h3]
Cosmoteer is an exciting space simulation game that lets you build and command your own fleet of ships. With its deep customization options and strategic gameplay, it offers hours of fun and challenge. 

[h3]Early Access Review[/h3]
The point of early access is not and should never be just play early. If you are priviledge enough to make a game and get an audience for it... the least you could do is listen to their feedback while developing the game. After all, they are your customers. So... let's talk about some areas where the game could use some improvements to make the experience even better.

[h3]Ship command[/h3]
When commanding multiple ships, it would be nice to know what the total speed is. Also, setting default engagement speed and attack angle could help make battles more realistic and strategic. A fleet attack formation, distance, and angles creator would also be a welcome addition, as it would allow players to fine-tune their tactics for each ship and set that as a default template for each engagement. This completely different from our current system where ships go into close range in a straight line!

[h3]Crew management[/h3]
Another area that could use some improvement is the gameplay loop. Harvesting resources early on often requires transferring crew from your main PvE ship onto your Salvager-Storage ship, which can become tedious after a while. A crew lock feature and a Mine-Move command could help streamline this process and make it less repetitive. Heck! Even better make the tractor beam automatically deposit resources!

[h3]The galaxy[/h3]
The map progression is also an area that could be improved. Currently, there is little to no challenge when moving from one area to another, which can make the game feel monotonous. Adding side quests, higher density packs, or tougher areas in transitional zones could help make the progression more interesting and rewarding.

Finally, some quality-of-life improvements could also make the game more user-friendly. For example, allowing players to select and abandon quests in bulk, and adding a mirror mode and a multiple-placement of resources feature in Creative mode could help make building and designing ships more efficient and enjoyable.

Overall, Cosmoteer is a great game that offers a lot of depth and complexity, but could use some minor improvements to make it even better. With some tweaks to ship commands, gameplay loop, map progression, and quality-of-life features, this game could become a true gem in the space simulation genre.",1679020650,1680286940,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

It gets a bit samey after that, though, as each combat plays out in much the same ways as the last one. There's a lot of weapons to try and a few different ship systems to play around with, but they all boil down to basically one thing: can it actually be supplied with ammo?

Y'see, this is a fantasy universe where ships materialize instantly, conveyors only transport humans, mass effect relays are made from rocks, nobody needs to eat, and cables were never invented.
That last bit is important, because the only way for you to provide power to any ship system is by carrying a battery to it from a reactor that constructs them from magic space vacuum. Therefore, all the logistics in this sci-fi space game are done by humans manually hauling stuff around. This means that you need to provide efficient passageways for the humans to walk through in order to get the battery to the laser turret. You also need a veritable city worth of humans to haul all this stuff, too, as most weapons eat battery charges like crazy.
You are, however, limited in how much crew you can hire by your Fame rating, which in turn can only be gained by killing progressively harder foes. You will reach a point when you simply cannot hire enough crew to maintain the battery conga line to feed the guns needed to advance, in which case you may find it easier to just redesign the whole ship from scratch rather than make improvements.
In its defense, the game does encourage you to experiment and you always gain 100% of resources back from dismantling stuff, so all you lose is time, really.

I might sound a bit negative here, but it's still a good game. You just need to be able to suspend disbelief a LOT in order to appreciate it fully.
Also, it's early access. Who knows what'll happen?

Select a ship. Protect yourself. Carefully chose when to attack and run. Learn your own play style so that you don't get blown up easily as you upgrade, build, and rebuild your ship[s]. For a challenge, take a slightly larger starting money option and select custom ship to go with a civilian freighter. Don't choose your armaments correctly with your limited funds and you'll get scrapped.

This a game about boring grind. You would think that designing a spaceship should be an engineering problem but you would be surprised to hear that in the future, spaceships apparently function like farms in the middle ages: No automation and a lot of grunts doing stupid tasks. So, it's a people management problem.

Let's take a few examples:
1) Guns: Guns use ammo, that makes sense. You would think that ammo are loaded via some sort of auto loader. Your ship could have magazines somewhere and a conveyor bet or some other automated delivery mechanism right? Well, you would be wrong, the answer, grunts, you have your grunts carry the ammo from the storage to the turret for loading one shell at a time.
2) Reactors: They use energy and no fuel, that doesn't make a tone of sense but that's ok. Now, you would expect that energy is delivered to the these reactors via some sort of extremely advance tech called a wire but no, you would be wrong again. The answer of course is... grunts. The grunts manually carry these plasma looking battery from the reactor to the reactor.
3) Lasers: You guess it! Grunts again, they carry batteries to the laser as well. No wires.
4) Missiles, shields, PDCs: yep that's right all manually delivered resources.

So, the challenge in that games seems to be to micro manage your crew, give them detailed priorities for every task (most of the crew's work is to move battery and other resources around your ship by hand, no automation).

As soon as i encountered a difficulty with them it was lights out. Certain enemy ship configurations set up a stream of missiles that seemingly no amount of point defense can deal with. And when one gets through its basically game over. Apparently ""just dodge them"" is the answer. And i guess that shoehorns into the suggestions of ""just completely redesign your ship for every encounter"". Fuck that. I aint gonna spend hours designing a viable ship for one fight.

And dont get me started on maneuverability. Ships of equal size, made of drastically more dense armor than i carry and having half the thrusters manage to outrun and outmaneuver me. Apparently i dont understand the system here, but it REEKS of oldschool ""NPCs play by different rules than PCs"" and that shit dont fly with me.

Some of those AI ship configurations would be very legitimate in a duel. But this game ISNT a duel. Your ship is expected to go against enemy after enemy with minimal damage in an almost ARPG style. Diablo would suck ass if EVERY enemy realistically had the capacity to blow you out of the water under the wrong circumstances. I get what the developers are going for here. A rock, paper, scissors setup where different setups counter different enemy types. But how do you reconcile that with the reality that you may see 3 or 4 wildly different ship types in one map? Do i need to completely refit my ship between each fight? Admittedly that can be done basically instantly, but firstly that really breaks the reality veil for me. Refits like that ought to take place at a station at least. Second, maybe some people get off on that shit? but i sure as hell dont.

The game mechanics are just so nice and unique and allows you to fool around and think freely of your ship designs while also allowing modding which is a nice bonus but even vanilla by itself is super great, graphic is a bit catoony/pixelarty which fits in the theme quite nicely, the music is just perfect and flawless and it gives a nice magic to the game and kind of giving you an emotional lift as you play it whilst it is also charming and engaging in the same time(kind of hard to explain). I got 17 hours into the game by the time of this comment and I have to say one of my best purchases on games was this game. Give it a go and see how you will like it.

Improvement ideas from me:

- Cleared asteroid field indicator/icon should disappear if mined/cleared fully, same goes for scrapyards/junkyards.

- Pirates should be more active on the map randomly and perhaps there should be a setting for this for the intensity of how much random pirates would you encounter.

- Pirates should engage players by some logic if standing near their base for an ""X"" amount of time and ""X"" amount of distance and not just patrolling back and forth but actually gather up as if they were communicating and grouping up against you.

- Maybe something else than pirates could come in the contact with the player from time to time which is not friendly and I do not mean a faction what you are in war with but like an alien race that travels around and destroys stuff.

- Railgun could update its range and stats on the tooltip window with informations corresponding with the connected ""Railgun Accelerator"" to see it's actual true stats including bonuses.",1677459600,1677546153,True,2,0,0.527186751365661621,0,True,False,True

Personal notes and comments:
One of The best spaceship builder games out there, ive played this game since version 0.13.0 (for reference this was before it came to steam and can be considered the ""open alpha"") which is a long time, however this game does take alot of time to play, but if you want to build your dream spaceship and combat enemy spaceships i highly recommend getting it, its also extremely fun to play with friends roving the galaxy as a fleet or going battle royale style.
oh and theres mining too, being able to build your ship from nothing but raw resources you mine and smelt is a truly satisfying feeling, or you could just build a massive storage/mining ship and clear a system for an easy 4-5 million credits (note that mining does take a while so it might be easy but its not fast).

overall if you've got a few days to burn and you want a good space builder i would grab this because you will get your money's worth and maybe more, I personally play alone (forever alone guy here...) but the few times i played with a couple of strangers who convinced me to join them i genuinely had an amazing time (and i wish they didnt drop off the face of the planet those 100+ days ago...).

So get out there captain, discover the stars, build the greatest spaceship you can imagine and Conquer the Galaxy!",1677089095,1677089095,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,True

The game is super deep and complex but it does an exceptional job of not making it feel overwhelming and introducing you to all the mechanics one step at a time. Even if you've never played a game with similar mechanics, you can play this game... Even if you've never played a game before, you can play this game. This matters for a number of reasons but perhaps most importantly for me is how fun and easy it is to play with friends.

It is by no means necessary to play the game with friends but it lends itself perfectly to multiplayer, particularly co-op. You can either have all your friends control their own ships or have everybody control the same ship. You can pause or even slow down the speed of the game at any moment to make it easier to plan and discuss what you want to do with your teammates. It's just so good...

Step one , die in random pvp games with what ever ships you have about 30 games or so , and you get the ropes 

Step 2 
Build cheese ships 

Cheese ships are normaly small ships that run off battery power and have small amo stores .

To my supprise the feilds of play are not big enough to "" running out of power "" is realy an isssue . 

Cheese ships have a critical mass of 4 batteries . 

Cheese ship roles : 

*cannon fodder 
*dps 
*towers 
*CTF takers 

4 most need ship types 

Light tank : 
A small cannon ship , fast and durable with amor affordable 120-190,000

Heavy tank , 350,000 ish , useing deck cannon . 

Neuclar missle ship of some kind 250,000

Rail or HE missle ship for end game ships 500,000 ish 

. 

Laser type ships 

In order to use them they have to be fast . Or they kinda melt real easy , i have not made a good ones yet . 

After you have these few ships well built it is possable to get wins in domanation . And low price end carnage maps . 

Strategy 

Rail beats tank 
Fighters beat rail 
He missle beats fighter 
Tank beats any thing slower than them 

Nuke beats slow mid amor 

Disabler beats heavy fighter ,  ion ,  rail , . 





------------

Note to dev , 
Rails are sligtly op , but thats ok . There has to be a top tier wepon of some kind . 

Also please make a map version that would be a "" conqure map "" 

In the conqure maps , players would have to mine resources to build there fleets . 

There fleets are built from factory that assemble these ship in a que pedending assoicated resouces in ones actual base . 

Bases are built with the same princable , but with a differnt factory . 

Players generaly compete to the death . 
And over resouces , over a vast galaxie 1-20 .. ? Sytems large . 


"" Spells ""

Yes , more fancy missle types please 

Suggustions 

, slim missles  , when fired , can bog down engin ports and disable weapons , temporaly 

Swarm missle 

A large missle that breaks up in to a lot of little missles , simmalr dammage to nuke devived by say 12 little missles  , but over a broader span . So nuke ÷ 12 or so . 

Viral missle 

A missle that is only effective unamored regions and can kill crew , but leave ship relativly unharmmed . 

Lrm missle 

A slow cooldown , longer range HE missle 3x HE missle basicly + range . 


Rockets , externaly mounted , one use ungudied light D vs amor , High D vs un amored rocket .  I say that to make them less spamable but still worth the investment . Comes in sevral sizes , can explode . 

Engins 

High out put engins 

For laser ships , they are only effective when ya cant hit them , so , a more 2x  power guzling engins would pair with them better . As there ships are power base 

Mines 

 You already have , "" Mine 1 ""  , short lived high dammage , like a shot gun kinda 

Comsider adding 

Mine 2 , long live , but very low dammage . Aeria denial type 

Mine 3 emp ,  slime , viral  mine , long live . 

Possible cannon additions 

"" 75 mm horrmet "" 

Long range top mount space consuming long long range low low dammge amo guzling cannon . 

Machine gun 

Not effecitve agenst amor , but at short range can perice non amored  hull and dammage crew . Low.amo consumumption 


Standardard cannon 

Single bearal external cannon 
Slower reload  , less amo consumption some what longer range but less dammage . Smaller model sise . Very some what below avrage cannon . 
. 

Ship 

Realy small stuff 

Like 1x1 energy cube , .
 1x2 cockpit , 
1x1 cew quarters 
1x1 battery 

All reduced effency , so less spamable . 

Mid sise  cloneing bay 

Cloaking cheep , everything but amor 
Cloaking heavy , cloaks amor too . 

Anti cloaking sensor system . 

High density armor , but out weighs regualr amor 

Armor that resist balistic , missle , or laser better but at the cost of less effectiveness at the others . 

Sheilds .... the large sheild is kinda hard to use . Make it more expensive and more pratical 

Extra expensive sheilds that are disabler resistant . 

Bubble sheilds , a sheild that surrounds the whole machine , large power guzzling , but not weak , but not strong either . 

Ai 

Ai little bit blows right now 
But if you could program seperate AIs and have a selectiable list of these behavious for the cockpits that make the game a lot smoother .

This game suceeds in having a fleet of maller ships in generall be superior to less but larger ships (of equivalent cost/mass/weaponry and armor), especially within asteroid field that provide additional tactical cover for smaller vessels, while they tnd to slow down larger vessels a LOT more.
Cosmoteer even balances ""slow but heavy armor VS lightweight agiliy"" nicely against each other.
This art form of tactical and strategical balancing is rarely perfected as well as in Cosmoteer.

You can easily spend 50% to 80% of game time redesigning fleets after EVERY battle AND transporting resources between ships to optimize the more agile fighter to carry less volume, so beware if that is not your pot of tea.

The core game loop can get repetitive. but this is easily approached by just playing the game in short 10-60 minute  episodes, ""one battle at a time""

This game ALMOST suceeds in dynamic-fleet-formations, but they tend to not last during battle like in rts games like Homeworld, because the AI could not cre less to not get into each others line of signt or to just collide with anything in its way.

Modifications as always let you fix the most common bamedesign-issues, that most commonly are define by popular trends that the 4-year-old gamedesign-document did not forsee, like ""slow extension of the crew-count-limit, set by slowly increasing fame, by being more factionally-biased (by chosing to make more enemies, which is NOT a choice to deny unless you want your crew to stay tiny forever), is THE main constrain to progression"" or ""this game is not well balanced for coop-PvE multiplayer"" at the cost of very likely imbalancing the game at other areas (many mods lean strongly in favor of tiny fighter swarms AND huge battleships) and at the cost of requiring 3x the minimum specification (larger ship sizes or much more particles)

Do NOT add too many custom-ships as mods, or the game will crash when you load the LONG list of fan-made ships.

The ai is a bit too basic/dumb on both sides (player commands are always WAY too fuzzy) which HEAVILY randomizes the outcome of ANY conflict, and this invites savegame-reloading-scumming up to 5 retries of any conflict initation, till the result is good enough.",1676298004,1676298004,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

It has a bit of everything for everyone, combat, trade, exploration, and most importantly, a deep and unique design system that I often find myself sinking tens of hours into.

The mechanics are pretty straightforward, albeit still requiring some getting used to, the usage of some resources, like power, for example, is not immediately apparent, as it is quite different from other similar games that I've played, though I find its uniqueness aid in a sense of freshness when exploring possible ideas.

That being said, the campaign is not without its fair share of weird exploit-y things that can be done, on one hand it breaks a bit of immersion and makes some parts of the game irrelevant, on the other I find myself to not really care about it in any meaningful manner, or just simply enjoy the fact that I can push a space station into the sun with nobody seemingly alarmed in the slightest about their imminent demise.

In this game, you can build ... well, I was going to make a list, except the difficult part is that you can basically make ANYTHING.

fighters, frigates, carriers, dreadnoughts, battleships? Absolutely.
mega-war""ships"", death stars, borg cubes, swarm drones? you bet.
stations, miners, depots, support boats, intelligence outposts? sure thing.

The **sheer fluidity** of this game is remarkable and really stands out as a space game. It is one of the most free-flowing, anything goes sandboxes I've played, where the game (tuned to some settings) will never yell at you and will just let you build, build, build. Several ideas I've had that were completely unfeasable elsewhere were possible in this game. 

The game is also **balanced extremely well**. pretty much everything has it's strengths, weaknesses, and counters. The balancing is done so well that arguments very frequently pop up in discussion channels about if a weapon or ship module is better.

I'm not the PR guy though. The game has a **rather shallow campaign** that can feel rather repetitive as it lacks any milestones as the only objective is to grow bigger ship, shoot bigger gun, and repeat. However, this is one of the first things getting serious adjustments on the roadmap.

There are some things I think could work better but it's in early access and I like what I see so far.

The main gripes I have is that beam weaponry is stupidly powerful and that most of the ships the AI can use are way more efficient than anything you could build. Unlike most weapons in the game, there is no hard counter defense to lasers, and most mid to endgame ships use an overwhelmingly large amount of them. The only way to deal with lasers is to destroy the emitters, which can be safely hidden within the deepest armor the ship has. You also can't avoid the ship shooting the lasers at you, as they are all designed to be able to rotate just about as fast as you can get around them. It's very disappointing when you spend hours on a ship design only to test it against an equivalently costed AI ship only to have it utterly obliterated because you didn't want to use the laser meta.",1667524635,1675224724,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

There's no mid-game or late-game to speak of yet, and little to do beyond ""curbstomp random enemy"" missions. The ship design system is interesting while it lasts but is also obviously incomplete. There's a ""small hyperdrive"" but no medium or large, for example. Combat is extremely simple and ship AI is braindead. Co-op is fun for a while.

The developer appears to have fallen into the Early Access Deathspiral: you release too early and need to maintain the appearance of progress, so rather than developing the core systems which take a ton of time and work, you constantly add minor features to satisfy players' feedback. Those players say, ""Wow, what a responsive developer!"" then stop playing (because there's still no actual game), and move on to the next Early Access Deathspiral game. Cosmoteer's settings menu is a testament to this feature creep: there's an option for almost anything you might want, aside from ""be an actual game.""

If you want something more complete, play Starsector instead. 100 hours later, play it again with Nexelerin and a few other mods that sound interesting. Starsector hasn't had an update in over a year, but every update it does get is substantial and adds meaningful new content and gameplay. Unfortunately it's not on Steam (yet?) but it's also only $15 direct from the developer, and it might be the best $15 you've spent on a game.

I did enjoy my short time with Cosmoteer and the developer is clearly talented.

+ Building is fun! I was worried at first because power for major systems needs to be hand-delivered by crew, but having crew size be the fundamental constraint on how big you can make your ships, rather than money, turns out to work well. (If you could put anything anywhere willy-nilly, with no constraints, then there'd be no engineering challenges to overcome and it wouldn't feel like you were actually designing a starship, or be as fun.)
+ Gathering is satisfying
+ Combat is exciting 
+ Exploration is fun - love finding all the little question marks 
+ Crew management isn't something I came into it expecting to need, but it's actually pretty cool - you can assign each bunk different custom roles, prioritize weapons vs. sensors, etc. 
++ The interface for all of the above is actually really well-designed - lots of thoughtful touches like ""blueprint mode"" so you can make multi-step changes where the intermediate steps would be invalid, detailed crew management so you can say e.g. ""if the weapons need charging, forget about the sensors"", etc. Combat, especially, has lots of *optional* detail - you can right-click on the enemy ship and hope for the best, or specify an attack angle for your ship to maintain, have each of your weapons target separate components, etc., or even fly + fire manually (with settings to specify exactly what that means)
* There's a painting mode I haven't explored much but it includes a wide variety of geometric ""decals"" so you can pimp out your ride (and it works basically the same way as the building interface) 
+++ I think I've encountered... *zero* bugs so far, which is astonishing for a small studio or an early access game, let alone both. (Patch notes suggest they do happen, but dev is very responsive.) 
- The dynamic soundtrack design, which adds or removes layers depending on what's happening and what you're looking at, is interesting... but still doesn't quite make up for the fact that the soundtrack itself, while catchy for the first ten seconds of each track, is annoyingly repetitive, more like a ringtone than proper music. 

Really the only major drawback is the story: there is none to speak of. You'd think ""blow up enemies, build bigger ship, blow up bigger enemies"" would be its own reward, but the sidequests are pretty thin (all either ""destroy target X"" or ""visit target X"", aka ""i was going to do that anyway so I might as well get paid""), and without a main quest, it turns out I lost motivation after... *checks notes* 35 hours. 

VERDICT: Worth the price of admission already as a sandbox/building toy. Highly customizable AND the defaults are pretty good. Design, visuals, programming all great... just needs to add a compelling single-player campaign (and maybe some chord progressions) to be a really good game.",1674958753,1674958753,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

I'd like to see: more music, a story to career mode, estimation of danger level of one's own ships, more guidance for problems with ships (e.g., why they handle so poorly), better guidance for where to place crew quarters and manage crew, and better progression of difficulty in the midgame.

I guess the ""fleet"" dynamic could make it interesting, someday, but its just janky and frustrating at the moment. After a ten or so hours of trying to build a fleet I just reverted back to trying to combine them into one ship.

The game isn't horrible... it's just disappointing. To be fair, though, they do patch weekly.. so at least one person is over there working on it, I just don't feel like it's going to go much further in the ""depth"" department. Hopefully they'll prove me wrong.

Buy this if you've hit rock bottom, otherwise, check back in a year.

Missions are incredibly copy and paste, with how many star systems you can visit you might end up seeing everything before you even get past ~60-70 crew mates.

Ship part availability is currently designed around how many crew mates you have, and not necessarily efficiency or even adjacency requirements. Firefighting is negligible, and repairing is instant between battles, but without any real-time repairs during the fights.

The weirdest part is how mining is part of the game, but you are punished for it since it still requires having crew to allocate to mining operations, so you're either juggling crew between dedicated haulers or you need to figure out how to make mining ships combat worthy, which ultimately presents a major weak point.

Crew warping would've been cool, allowing for ship boarding operations. Current state of ship boarding is suicide, as your crew can simply be kited as they try to EVA to the enemy ship.

Currently all u can do is slowly mine and salvage until u get more ships, then there are only 3 viable weapon options to fight very large ships with. Then salvaging takes longer and longer until u have tons of money and nothing to do with it after you build a few good ships.

- it is a game entirely about some ships shooting ships, period (and picking up loot to build bigger ships, ok)
- space, as it's common in ""spacey"" games, is just a lack of terrain
- campaign lacks any feeling of progression. You've got tech available right away and just grind resources and crey with ""kill pirate rats in my cellar"" quests to make bigger, badder ships to shoot other bigger, badder ships.
- the resource that's mainly limiting progression is crew, goons are required to carry batteries around the ship (LOL) - is actually a pain in the ass mechanic that makes you suffer. And then suffer again, if you decide to make more then one ship, because crew limit is global for a player!
- it should mean something that one of the most popular mods is the one that removes this limiting mechanic altogether
- different ""factions"" all use the same tech and the same parts

Obviously in early access so some of the features need to be fleshed out. For example, the economy isnt dynamic ie prices seem to be the same at most ports. Would be good if they could fix this soon so that it is possible to become a merchant. It seems that the main thing you can do is be either a bounty hunter or a pirate.

Also, the factions dont really seem to be at war, even though there are missions to fight other factions. Im sure this will change. Im yet to attack a station and commandeer it, so not sure if you will be able to start your own faction at some point?

It looks like there is a lot of development time that will be needed for the intended features to be complete. However, this game is very much fully playable and worth your money right now.

Maybe add a new ship to my fleet. Maybe scrap a whole ship and put its resources into my main ship. Not enough resources at the station or onboard to build? I build myself a storage ship, fill it with tons of materials, then I can do whatever I gotta do on a large scale. Game automatically uses resources from your fleet, and buys them from nearby stations if you're parked there.

The combat gets more and more intense, enemies have unique ships that push your own ship design to counter them, and even though the game is early enough to only have a sandbox-ish campaign with no real end goal, I've spent 166 hours just improving my ship and pushing into more dangerous territory.

The game roadmap has transforming ships, docking, more weapons, more missions, etc etc. At version .20, about 20% complete, this game is incredible. FTL wishes it was this game.

Worried its too tedious? You can keep it simple or go crazy complex, up to you. Worried its too complicated? The concepts for keeping a ship running are simple but are hard to master. What works for a while will quickly become obsolete in new areas. But, this means, more time to create new ships.

Want to stage battles between ships to test them? Load up any ship/s in creative mode and pit them against one another. I had an entire series of generations of my main ship all duke it out at once, was a blast to watch. When you breach someone's hull and finally detonate a reactor, the chain reaction of explosions is just beautiful to watch.

Don't get me wrong, its a good game, otherwise i would not have spend roughly 100 hours in the game. 
The game gives you a lot of freedom to design and built your own ships. The ships can then be used to explore a relativly big universe, including different star systems. As you explore the universe, enemys become harder and you need to develope and expand your ship/ships on the search of new resources.
You can trade with friendly parties to earn money and/or buy items and to hire new crewmen. 
So far, so good, one might say and i agree! 
BUT, all actions become very quickly quite repetitive! Fights are very similar and started boring me after a short while.
The freedom in creatings ships isnt as big as it seems in the beginning. The game has some hard limitations (crew), which basically always defines the size of your ship. 
While the game offers many different weapon systems and in theory different ships designs, in the end you always will end up with some long range set up (prism/Rockets...) and fight the same way....boring. 
I also miss some ""real"" content! At the moment, the game is a pure grind, where you do over and over again the same shizzel, which ends up beeing really boring.

Pro:
+ nice flexibel building system and crew management
+ big galaxy 
+ especially in the beginning, addictive!!!!
+ hardly any bugs/crashes

Con:
- game becomes laggy/low FPS when using big ships!
- very repetitive after a while
- the building system is not as ""free"" and flexibel as you think
- missing content !! You have the same quests over and over again, the same fights and so on

It's EA, so time to improve in the areas i mentioned. And Anyway, the game keept me in for 100 hours, not bad, not bad at all!

No notable bugs, i have had it CTD with and without mods however.
The game is super simple and very linear in its progression. You continue expanding your ship, build a couple new ones, destroy others and thats the entire game loop.
I think that with tweaks to the game it could be a lot more exciting and meaningful. But as it sits, it fairly barren in scope.
A couple tweaks to make it more interesting IMO would be, reasons to build a space station or factory and maintain it, slight crew micro management like food and water, spawn system changes so that station makes sense, sector difficulty rework and re-playable missions. Avorion or X: Series are great examples of meaningful infinite empire expansion.

The primary gameplay loop is to build a ship and test it against other ships or groups of ships. Campaign mode basically involves accumulating fame, resources and money by doing missions which allows you to recruit more crew and build a larger ship or a fleet of ships. 

The ship builder is pretty powerful once you get used to it but it can be a little unintuitive at first. Ship combat is the same way, deep and lots of fun when you get used to it but it takes a bit of learning what the different controls do. The game has a little bit of a learning curve to it but once you figure it out its a ton of fun. There's a decent enough tutorial to go off of. 

The Co-op campaign with a friend or two is great fun. Both players control the time and save at will. You can transfer resources and ships between each other. Both players have their own crew limits and get credit for mission completion. I probably wouldn't recommend playing co-op with randos but with someone you know. I haven't tried any PVP yet. 

What I think it needs the most in the future would be improved UI elements, deeper crew management and interaction and a deeper campaign. Fortunately it seems like most of that is on the roadmap in some form or another. 

My only gripe with the game that's not on the roadmap is the AI aggro system and/or combat AI. It seems like the enemy AI focuses on the player ship that is most expensive or has the highest DPS (which is often the same ship). The aggro system being a bit more transparent would help a lot with that. I think the aggro AI needs to consider what weapons the ship has, what weapons and defenses the player ships have, their own ability to stop those threats and what damage they already have. The enemy AI could use a little more work too, It seems like as of now they just lock on the biggest ship and attack it head-on hoping they don't get smoked. They don't seem to flank unless by accident. I think solo/co-op combat is definitely functional and fun as it is but it could be better.

Is it worth £18 at its current level?

Short answer, I'm not sure.

It's a decent game but the amount of ""stuff"" you can put on your ship is quite limited at the moment.

On the other hand, the road map looks good and the game has a solid base to work on. It leaves other betas lacking, that is for sure. Combat and crew management is quite straight forward but allows the skill level and ship designing room to grow. UI isn't over convoluted and everything is easy to find.

It allows you to add and subtract ship components to your existing ship and play with design changes without being constrained by money or placement rules so you can work out a design BEFORE spending any cash or resources and if you leave the blueprint window and come back later, maybe to accumulate those resources or cash needed to implement the changes you worked out, it's still there waiting for you to press a button and instantly make those changes from your blueprint.

I find it utterly baffling that Walt has single-handedly (?!) created such a well implemented, well polished, well thought out, game. There are tons of little details that have been given real thought and, dare I say, love, in a way that big studios seem unwilling to do anymore.

For me, the heart of this game is the ship designing. The campaign is more like the testing ground for my designs; an opportunity to test them more organically than I do in creative mode. There are so many ways to approach ship design, and so much opportunity for creativity and cleverness. Trying to find the right balance of firepower, maneuverability, and ruggedness, is a delicious challenge; creating a lean, thoughtful, efficient design, is a fabulous payoff. 

I find the design loop to be particularly engaging here. Creative mode makes it so easy to sketch out a quick idea, and give it some basic proof-of-concept testing. Get results, draw conclusions, make modifications, test again. An iterative design process works extremely well here. If you love playing games like Factorio for the ability to implement thoughtful, creative designs, polished to nigh-perfection, then you might love Cosmoteer. For me, this scratches that same itch. It's just so dang satisfying to take a concept from brainstorming to implementation, and to then get to actually use it. 

This is the kind of game that you can actually play in your head. Away from home over the holidays, I found myself daydreaming, mentally sketching, some designs I wanted to try when I got home. It got to the point where I did have to actually get some graph paper, so I could flesh it out a little better. 

Most ship combat is a bit of a slugfest, and you can trust the AI to take care of things. Personally, I like to design ships that benefit from a hands-on approach; flying by hand, and winning combat in a real tactile manner. Some weapons are pretty forgiving for the slugfest sort of combat, but some really benefit from a deft touch. For example, railgun ships have the potential to punch way above their weight class, with thoughtful tactics and skillful flying. Sending railgun rounds through critical ship parts has some gratifying Expanse vibes to it.

Needs some sort of story, more meaningful sidequest chains, characters/personalities to also explore, and variation in extreme danger vs jackpot-type treasures/encounters early on that gives the untamed and untapped space feel. The core is there to make all these happen at a level that could be all-time-great quality, however it is bland and meaningless right now. 

In short, I recommend waiting on it. All the components are there though, and I encourage the dev to add some flavor. The amount of work needed in this aspect really require getting some extra creative team members involved at this point to move things forward to reach potential, otherwise this will be a ""what could have been"" type-game that relies on mods from community to be great (which i personally never use). I am conflicted on giving this an up or down vote, and may change it later based on progress, but the lack of story/meaning/flavor to the game at this point make it not worth playing and I will hesitantly default to recommend (with the caveat that I recommend this later and not in the current state).

As a side note, I often sway away from games with excessive dialogue and character depth as it seems too daunting to get into and prefer a bit lighter feel, however, I want to feel something, can even be single RNG type dialogue characters that have small chains or single interactions that can repeat, etc. As far as more depth, having some synergy that unfolds based on play style would be simple enough to add and bring cool experiences: i.e. mine x amount of this type of material or this amount of time or build this many of this type of weapon system, etc. Repeated actions that a player likes to do triggers encounters (good and/or bad) that can enhance what they like to do or have a quest to find a hidden mineral or ace space pirate, etc etc.",1673215182,1673215993,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

There's a lot of fiddling around due to the custom ship building nature of it which is fun at first but it becomes so tedious it feels like the game starts to get in the way of itself. After 30 hours I shouldn't be on a constant death spiral towards boredom.

I thought that this was another enjoyable privateer to fleet commander game but it's not at all. Avorion, Reassembly and Starsector are games I enjoyed to a far greater degree and I feel like those games respect your time a lot more as well. This game could do well to take lessons from those games' fleet systems as well as player reward, punishment and progression. In all of those games you can fall to the depths of hell and scratch your way back up, and feel good doing it! Hell, you could take many lessons out of Stardrive for ship building and strategic inspiration or EVE online for ship equipment and build variety. Cosmoteer has the potential to be in line with some of the elements of those games, but it's lacking any flavour right now. Singleplayer is simply not where it's at, and I don't know if it ever could be because of how far off it is at that layer.

Here's why:

First and foremost - there's no epic battles just finicky skirmishes which rival robot wars at best. Fleet management is a bore to the point I don't want to play with multiple ships but the AI designs are begging to be flanked by a second ship or more. Having to manage ammunition is also annoying, leading you to constantly go out and mine sulphur because you can't automate mining nor rely on stations to stock enough. Fights are stupidly easy to win and lose, creating a game that's hard to engage with because you're either steam rolling or you're paying heavy to get rolled (might as well just reload). You'd expect a deeper technology tree, which could both remove tedium and add intrigue to the game but that's not here either. There's no RPG system or macro system that empowers the player or delegates the tedium (such as an empire) meaning you are never a commander always a captain.

On a personal level it has some things I hate in games - the player is constantly farming or grinding to meet the basic battle requirements that every enemy gets for free; the maintenance after battles is something the AI doesn't need to do either; during the event of failure there's next to no enjoyable recovery for the player, as rewards from ""quests"" are miniscule and, most importantly, do not refresh - you may as well reload, breaking any enjoyment (and immersion) from losing (or barely winning) because there's no automation to remove the tedium of getting resources.

Overall, it's a cute 2D ship builder game that's completely one dimensional: it is a ship builder and combat simulator and that's all.",1673152893,1673152893,False,6,0,0.553324401378631592,0,True,False,True

Better: build more ships and go do missions with your fleet!. Mod support is awesome so you can import 10000 new ships. You can even play it in coop! 

Yea, there could be more features like more missions. At the moment there are pretty much 3 types of missions. (A. Go kill. B. Get random commodety and bring it to station or C. Go explore or go visit.) but the loadmap looks awesome and should fill all the needs.

Got bored, made two completely different designed ships that acted as a railgun sniper (Jhin) and another as my frontline tank with missles and flak (Sion). Small story that really sold that game to me a few hours ago: 

My three ships were approaching a level 9 difficulty asteroid field to defeat a group of space pirates and mine uranium on the side so I could start manufacturing nuclear missiles into my arsenal when suddenly 5 blips show up on my screen, all in a 180 degree scope around my formation. I panic and realize I'd have to fully turn around my cargo ship to get it away, and the ships were going to be on me in 10 seconds, so I pushed up Sion and installed 2 emergency shields on the side to lessen flank damage. Meanwhile, I sent Jhin twice the distance, as I had installed him recently with an extension to his railgun, making it a total of 12 sections long. As Bertha finally turned tail, the first 3 ships were upon us. Sion took 3 nuclear missiles from a level 7 sapper and level 5 sapper. Immediately, Sion lost his frontmost shields, leaving 2 backup shields on the front as his last line. Considering that these front shields had never been breached since his development, I panicked and pulled him back, as Bertha had finally made some distance. Meanwhile, Sion had used his energy sappers to drain the enemy's 2 center shields. Leaving the level 7 sappers cockpit wide open, I positioned Jhin inches to the right of Sion and let loose a railgun shell directly into the sappers frontal lobe, taking the nuclear core with it and igniting the ship. I was disappointing that I couldn't salvage if for later, but didn't have time to think on it as Sion took yet another missile, this time of the EMP variety. Having all shields down, Sion began taking cannon shots from a level 6 Scrapknight, quickly breaching and setting fires to all frontal components. The repair bill adding up, I positioned Jhin to the right of a small level 3 missile turret with the EMP's and dispatched it with on shot, but three foes still remained. As I began to panic and realize my fleet was about to become annihilated, a friendly blip that I had missed suddenly came into view, a level 9 fortress. Positioning itself between Sion and the enemy, by sheer luck or AI decision making, I will never know, immediately disassembled the remaining 3 enemy ships with ease, taking minimum damage at all. As I watched in awe, a deafening explosion wrapped over Jhin as I realized my worst fear had become reality; An sole enemy pirate had snuck behind me and dispatched my sniper in one cannon round to my reactor. I quickly pulled Sion back to assist with the damage, but the ship was already on fire with no functional crew to put it out. The enemy pirate fled, the damage already done. Hours of work was lost on a ship I could never recover, but the story doesn't end here. I will rebuild Jhin faster, stronger, and bigger, so that he can once again assist me in my future shipscaping. 

tldr: Game is so fun, each battle is cinematic, and I will never get enough of it.

Basically take Starsector, remove a lot of the direct control, remove most of the extended campaign options, and remove the fleet-on-fleet battles, and add in its place a cool and fully modular building system that is crippled by either the lack of other features or the extremely tedious crew mechanics.

Cosmoteer is fun for a while, no doubt.  It struggles hard though once you get in deeper because of the added tedium.  You can make one mega-ship or build out a fleet in many different ways from beam-boats, artillery barges, and factory ships that can mine and refine resources.  But unfortunately a lot of this falls flat on its face as soon as you're controlling multiple ships at once.

While Starsector neatly keeps your fleet together on the campaign map and you only give vague orders to your other craft in combat (while left to fully pilot your flagship), Cosmoteer lacks any of this AI or autopilot backup for your other craft.  This means orders must be given every single time RTS-style - there is not even the smallest bit these ships or crews will guide themselves at all.  Lack of any active order will simply mean they'll cruise to a stop and do nothing - maybe fire at something if the guns happen to be in range.  Besides that, there is no ""Seek and Destroy"" or even so much as a ""patrol"" standing order you can give craft.

The game takes a little inspiration from other games like Factorio or FTL in that you have a crew to manage, and unlike the ship itself, the crew functions 100% autonomously.  The difference is that you can set up a lengthy set of priorities for each crew category you choose to create in a kind of Rimworld-like fashion from highest priority all the way to ""never do this job.""  In that way, you can set up crew who solely operate specific devices or run energy capsules or other jobs.  When combined with where such crew are stationed in your build, this is probably the most in-depth the game gets as far as managing the ship, because it's not only laying out power cores or guns, you need to set up the crew correctly to run the ship efficiently instead of ""everyone tries to do everything.""

Unfortunately it's that crew mechanic where the game really gets tedious.  There are no simple presets - not even a ""remove all roles"" or similar, so each campaign will see you having to spend a lot of time reworking the crew roles.  While you can copy them from ship to ship, sometimes different ships simply need different roles (ballistic vs energy weapons for example, or just fighting craft vs industry).  This can take a lot of time if you're trying to do it right, and it just feels extremely tedious.

Speaking of industrial ships, haulers, or similar - every asteroid has to be mined manually.  Or I should say, if you try to multi-select several to be mined, you need to be relatively close to them.  Ergo beyond 2-3 you might get at a time, you really have to do the mining yourself.  There's no way to simply tell a ship ""go mine everything in your sensor radius,"" and have it vaguely steer around to various asteroids in an area.  All of that is you.

All of this combined means once you get past a small handful of craft, you really don't want to manage any more - even if you could.  While Starsector will see large fleets of 20, 30, or even more - by the time you're juggling 5 or so ships (one of which is almost always the necessary hauler to save space on your combat ships), you're just tired of having to click around so much.

Again tl;dr - Early Access of course, so stuff is changing.  Maybe they add stuff, but in my experience you can NEVER count on that.  The game's fun to build in for a while and is kind of fun in an arcade type of way, but it has none of the long-term depth other games in its genre (or things near the genre), or more accurately: I don't think it will hold the attention of players of games like Factorio, FTL, Starsector, or Rimworld, which the game is clearly inspired by.",1672867744,1672867744,False,21,1,0.729963898658752441,5,True,False,True

Everything runs well and the building aspect is pretty great but not what I would call amazing since options at the moment are pretty limited as far as objects like weapons and thrusters go. Sounds pretty good for early access, right? If you're into PVP, I'm sure there's fun to be had. But I'm playing single player and it's a pretty forgettable experience. Here's why:

- The crew management aspect couldn't be any more basic because none of the crew are different. Every crew member is exactly the same. They might as well be androids.

- The quests fall into 3 basic categories: attack, mine, discover. Use the resources from these missions to increase the size and power of your ship. It's pretty repetitive at the moment.

- There are factions controlling different sectors of the galaxy but there doesn't seem to be any interaction between them. They just don't like each other because ""reasons"", I guess.

- If there's a story or end goal in single player, I haven't seen any indication of it. It would be nice if multiple victory conditions were added or the ability to form your own space empire. Something to work toward or something that is worth defending.

 As it stands, Cosmoteer might be worth the current price if you're really into PVP or building things for the sake of building. I have hope that the single player experience will be fleshed out over time but right now it's very bland for the price tag. If you're looking for single player, Star Valor does the RPG aspects better and Stardeus does the crew management aspects  better.

It is a good game. The designing of your ships is the best part. In other games, you add on gimmicky stuff to your ship and it does nothing. Not in this game, absolutely everything effect the characteristics of your ship. In some of my earlier n00b designs I put all my engines lopsided and my ship wouldn't even fly in a straight line. Awesome.

But there is easily 1 more year of work needed to flesh out this game.

In it's current state, paying 10 bucks for it is acceptable. Paying 18 - rip off.

For those who aren't in the know, STE built upon the legacy of FTL: Faster than Light, and got much more involved with its main gameplay systems... Namely, crew micromanagement, resource management, ship customization, etc... In some ways, things went great, and in other ways they didn't go according to plan. Aside from a few memorable flaws, however, the game was so fun and challenging that I was able to sink nearly 150 hours into it. That game comes highly recommended by me.

Then there's this game. Cosmoteer takes things to the next level by allowing players to customize the actual hull of the ship. No longer are you limited to cutting and pasting pieces onto system ""hardpoints"" within your prefabricated ship. That's right, you finally get to rip apart and rebuild your entire spaceship, which is a major step in the right direction. You can even deck it out with paint, camouflage, and decals. 

On the other hand, this game is visually ugly, and-- worst of all-- major sacrifices have been made to bring you this feature. To better illustrate my point, let's talk about the combat and exploration of this game and its predecessors.

Combat in FTL can be summed up as ""you point, you click, you micromanage your crew and ship, and you pray."" The exploration in FTL is almost as important as the combat, but ultimately plays second fiddle to combat. The combat of FTL is fairly simple, although there are some interesting strategic choices to be made, but it just works.

In STE, you point, you click, you try to micromanage 100 different things, you mess all of them up, and you pray that you prepared enough for this disaster such that you can somehow carve your way over to the next resource point or shop. Exploration is unbelievably important in STE... In fact, I'd argue that it's even more important than being good at combat. 

Finally, we have Cosmoteer. In Cosmoteer, combat can be summed up as ""Point, click, and pray that you have more crew and weapons."" There is no meaningful resource management during combat. There is no meaningful micromanagement of one's crew, power, or weapon systems... It really is just a numbers game. Exploration is really just a huge grind in order to get to a more powerful arsenal. There is absolutely zero required management of resources such as life support essentials, fuel, etc... that make the experience of simply surviving feel like a reward. Nearly every popular space title provides these elements, or at least a story-related explanation as to why they weren't included. Cosmoteer does none of this.

With such a lack of essential flavors, I don't understand how this game has been able to maintain such a positive review rating percentage for three whole months. Are people just that hungry for more spaceship management rougelikes? If so, go buy Shortest Trip to Earth. It is a far better and more polished version of this game, and the creator deserves to finally have some success... As for me, I accidentally sunk an extra 0.1 hours into this game, so I am stuck with it. Hopefully the creator improves this title. I really like the ship-building feature, clunky as it may be, and I am in love with the idea of one day being able to build a massive carrier ship that dwarfs anything I could've piloted in STE or even Starsector.

Over 40 hours into this game in less than a week. Ugh, I need to stop... nope!

I really hope this game gets finished and adds a bit more content to keep driving you to play. It's still early access so I'll let the content pass. 

The rest of the game so far is amazing. 

PROS:
- Micromanagement is nicely-
Donemaking sure you keep your ship with enough firepower, crew, power, ammo, etc. depending on your build. 

- Ship building- 
build whatever ship that comes to your mind. Then try to manage it ;)

-Pick your poison space play-
 Trade, mine, or pirate your way to money with a need to do all 3. The trade is a bit lacking as of now though. For me though, not a con, trade is boring. Only cool if profitable but then feels like a grind or cheat. 

-Build a fleet of destruction(FoD)-
Building a war fleet and watching it decimate opponents in slow mo as your barrage of missles, lasers, cannons etc tear through your opponents armor and deliver a devastating payload to the command deck and taking down the entire ship so you can board it only to repair it and add it to your FoD. Then hunt down a real challenger. 

CONS at the moment while in early development 

-Its really hard to think of any without  nitpicking. The content it has thus far is somewhat polished.

-mid-late game unlockables-
could use more parts and pieces to unlock further in the game like bigger. (It could be there I'm still early game, also E-access) 

-Mining is grindy-
need more options for commanding mining fleets more easily. Should be able to set my mining ship to mine asteroids while another ship collects ore or some form of that to better automate the mining process. 

Overall the early access version is very playable, looks amazing, satisfies that build and conquer itch very well and generally has me finding myself thinking about how I could build my next FoD while I'm not playing. 

I can't wait to see what this dev brings to this game. This has the ability to become so much more than your average space pirate game. 

Did I mention there's no micro transactions?! Devs- for the love of all things game please don't add them.

The gameplay gets repetitive and stagnant as you do not have to manage resources and can horde everything for yourself. Single player is, at best, a good platform to test your ships you intend to bring into a multiplayer session. If the game would introduce some more aspects to the singleplayer experience, I feel like maybe it could thrive a bit better 

Multiplayer, on the other hand, is hands down one of the best experiences to date from a game. You have to share your spoils from each engagement, coordinate attack strategies on high threat targets, and each of your crafts will end up playing a very specific role like kiting, tanking, and support. The fact that you can make a ship that pulls rich asteroids from the sun's ""Danger"" zone is great!

If you go through and read all of the negative reviews, there is literally a mod to fix ANY complaint anybody has had.

As it is right now, if you mod, youll get tons of gameplay. 

Ideas:
New Mission Types such as 
Escorting other ships
Trade route protection 
Faction wars (that include faction npcs) fighting with you
(To make battles on a grand scale)
Scavenger hunts for loot caches
Retrieving lost ships
Etc.
Also, progreesion limit in a single system should be implemented. Not by fame, but by ship value. As of now, you can build a juggernaut in the first area on career. If each system had a ship value limit, it would balance progression. As of right now, you can become a powerhouse in the first area.

However, the core loop at the beginning in the career mode was just... boring? Even for the sale price, it didn't hold my attention at all :(

The battles seemed like just ""click enemy ship"" with little to no further interaction. A game that has a similar meta questing loop, Mount and Blade (surprising comparison, I know), does not seem to suffer this boredom because the core components of fighting and questing are fun! In this it felt like a lot of traveling before watching a kinda lame ""pew pew"". Combat seemed boring to me in this.

The initial shipbuilding did not seem to show much depth either. It did not seem to have much beyond ""keep stuff near crew and power"", which I found boring relative to the logistical depth you can immediately find in many high-quality colony sim or simulation games. It didn't even seem like stuff was being slowly metered out to you with an enticing sense of future depth. It didn't give me the impression of hiding much? A lot of the sandbox seemed to be the computer's job rather than mine. For example, your crew starts out completely automatic!

As of this review, the game is basically in an unfinished beta state.  It's functional but there really isn't enough content to say whether this game is going to be a good purchase or not.  Primarily for this reason I'm giving it a ""Would not recommend""

The combat is fairly awkward and it's hard to control your ship at times especially if your thurster configuration doesn't account for omni-directional flight...Which is hard to do without leaving a major weakness on your ship unless using a strange interior rocket setup that looks terrible and makes no sense physics-wise.

The ship design interface is probably the best thing about this game and allows you many options for creating a totally customized ship.  Sadly, most of the mid to late-game ship configurations are basically just variations of 2 weapon systems platforms (Rails or Prisms) behind armor and/or shield spam and it gets kind of boring.  

It seems like the developer wants you to make a small fleet of specialized ships to deal with threats but ship and fleet controls are far to awkward and limited for this to be a feasible strategy and ship material costs in the early to mid game are simply too high to risk losing ships, which brings me to most problematic part of this game.

Save Scumming.  
This game has a quick-save feature and for good reason, you will be using it often.  Due partly to the aforementioned crappy ship control.  Sometimes your ship doesn't turn right or get's stuck on debris or asteroids and you end up losing to a foe you otherwise would steamroll over.  

Losing a ship is NOT ACCEPTABLE in this game.  Seriously, this game is less forgiving than the original Gradius.  Resources are accumulated slowly, even at normal difficulty and most of the time your primary combat ship will be made up of 60-80% of ALL the combined resources you have accumulated to that point.  Losing a ship is tantamount to losing several hours to several dozen hours of boring grinding.",1672624035,1672624035,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

On top of that, it's an early access that definitely has enough as it stands to warrant the price. I personally can't wait for some of the new content that's coming. 

Pros:

Combat. The ability to control and dictate the engagement in Cosmoteer is refreshing to say the least. You can control individual gun turrets to fire at specific enemy modules: on the bigger ships, you can easily engage multiple smaller targets by carefully choosing which turrets fire at which enemy. The ability to specifically control how far your ship will stay from the enemy and at what angle makes this even easier. 

Customization. While there aren't that many parts as of the time of writing, you can make some truly sprawling capital ships or stations, or narrow all the way down to tiny gunships. Fleet formation is simple and intuitive to learn as well, making it pretty easy to control even a large number of vessels.

Cons: 

Gets repetitive. As it stands, this game really doesn't have much for you to do. Building giant, insane capital ships with overwhelming firepower and testing that across the galaxy is certainly an appeal, but the grind can take quite a while and each system is fairly indistinguishable aside from station designs and difficulty. As new updates roll out, this issue will be less significant.

Overall, this game truly has near limitless potential for new features and replay value. If you want a game like this that's just more fleshed out, go play Starsector until this is more developed.

the game severely lacks content at this point, every gameplay aspect is shallow and barebones.

after you've cleared the first sector you've basically seen everything.
The quests are always the same, the sector layouts are always the same, the gameplay is...always the same.
mining, trading, bounty hunting all feels so meeningless.

it just becomes a grindfest to get more resources to build a bigger ship to get more resources to build a bigger ship...

ship construction is nice, yet not terribly exciting given the small number of modules at this point. most of what you can unlock is just a bigger version of the previous one. 
i haven't even unlocked all modules because i don't see the point. after abt. 16 hrs the game offers nothing new anymore, there's nothing left to do. but that was already the case after 5 hrs if i'm honest.

finding it hard to stick around at this point though i see the potential the game has. 
also would maybe help if the roadmap had some dates to it.

I'm so sad I found this game at the end of my vacation LOL.

Not only is this an amazing space game, it is VERY engaging.   Making your ships is the best min/max experience I've had in any game.   I cannot speak highly enough.    Then add in the fact this is an early access title on top of it.   I bought the game TODAY and I have 14 hours playtime!!!  There is a board game my family loves called Galaxy Trucker that is very similar to this game.

My only complaint is the state of the game right now as-is can be very repetitive but the action and ships exploding in logical manners is SO addicting.   Then making your ship<s> is addicting as well.

Love this game.    I DO hope that the dev keeps pouring the creative juices into this game.   If the reputaion/faction/win conditions can get along the lines of complex Drox Operative series plus the amazing concepts it would be perfect.   As it is right now it's an amazingly addictive EA title that still needs content aside from the several missions offered at stations.   So far each area you warp to is just a repeat of the last with higher levels.   One thing missing is that it seems the blueprints are pretty quick to exhaust and there isnt anything new really waiting after you've unlocked them all.   Unless I am mistaken.   I've seen 4 areas so far and have all the blueprints unlocked already.    Also doesn't appear to be any form of economy for trade runs if you like doing that sort of thing, there are missions to deliver X item but generally I do not even do them unless I already have the resources at hand then just accept the quest and instantly complete them.   Some more work still needed, but the core concepts are here in golden fashion.   Great work DEV.

On a more serious note, I wasn't expecting to enjoy this type of game because i'm traditionally really bad at games that leave creation up to you with so many possibilities. But its very very beginner friendly. You get the hang of how your ship flies and what will affect it in which way rather quickly.  I usually get overwhelmed with this stuff and end up giving up out of anxiety. 
This game, though? Nope. I've died plenty of times and simply reloaded and learned from my mistakes. I have yet to get frustrated with the game and i am not an easy gamer to please. Its simple yet deep as you get more and more experienced. Just start with one of the starting ships and take it one step at a time from there. I went from a model s to having my own custom capital ship with a crew of 150. Its fun, not super difficult, but yet gives you plenty of space (no pun intended) to grow and explore. You eventually get the option to explore more galaxies with harder enemies. Oh and its got workshop support and basically free DLC, which easily add twice what you already get.

I have heard enemies and resources do not respawn (Traders do?), so eventually you may run out of stuff to blow up in career mode. Enemy ships are slowly getting curb stomped by me now (haven't left the starter solar system so I'm hoping it gets to the big boy ships in the other ones) 8.5/10 hope for a mod or official feature for respawning pirates/asteroids, and some more parts to add for shipbuilding, maybe niche thrusters or weapons for specific class of ships (faster/smaller thrusters for infiltrator ships, big beefy ones for destroyers for example.)",1672282088,1672282088,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

I spent a lot of time and resources building a flagship. It was big, meaty, and had sharp teeth. Didn't matter, because a lucky shot to an inadequately shielded reactor set off a chain reaction destroying the entire ship. 

I got to watch as the surviving gunners in various chunks of wreckage that still had power continued to fire on the enemy while their crewmates burned to death in the next room.  When you salvage ship wreckage you can see the surviving crew milling about through the windows as your crew demolishes the room around them. If they manage to escape they float around in EVA suits endlessly until they run out of oxygen. A way to capture and possibly recruit enemy crew would be a fantastic feature. 

What I love most about this is the potential to create some incredibly broken shit and bully the entire galaxy with it. Look up railgun fans for an example. If you like building, and spaceships, and having to engineer your shit so it is less likely to explode, and creating OP and thoroughly busted contraptions to rain blood on the galaxy, buy this.

It gets a bit repetitive but I'm still enjoying it.

Not knocking it at all but I am really hoping there is a way to expand the ship building grid so we can make extra mega ships.  I'm not complaining it's already pretty big and if it can't be bigger then it's just another engineering challenge to maximize the space available (which is very fun and fulfilling too).

If they don't make it bigger, can someone PLEASE make a bigger building grid PLEASE!? lol

I also love space sims like Elite: Dangerous and Star Valor. I did not enjoy this game. On normal difficulty the game was punishingly hard for the base ship, even with weapon and power upgrades. I would run into pirate ships that were way too strong for my level, which I couldn't tell because they have ""?"" as their level. They were right next to the starter trading station. If you die, you have to restart your save file. I was dying a LOT. I would kill one pirate ship and that ship would summon two more. I would venture out and get leveled while fighting someone with an EMP that could knock my shield out. All of this at level 1! 

I found myself saving every two seconds, just in case I got ganked. It was frustrating when I'd forget to save after upgrading my ship and have to do that all over again. Where's the auto-saves???

The Factorio elements are much more simple than the marketing leads on. Your little people run around and move stuff, but it's mostly like having the drones in Factorio. They're far more versatile and make early game design order less important. In Factorio, there is a clear, gameplay driven progression and in this game, there is none of that. You are kind of thrown into this building system that forces you to be imaginative on a system you've never used before. I highly recommend the starter ships come with more extra space in them to allow players to get used to organizing and upgrading within the system before making them expand. Why? Because expanding your ship comes with a slew of balancing problems. Don't overload one side or your boosters won't work right.

Issues: 

1. slows down to a crawl midgame. Games needs some sort of clean up crew going round mopping up, or there is something wrong in the loop in programming and it needs to be streamlined better.
When I say crawl, I mean the program crawls to a stop in the processing loop.

2. Trade is very slow, need to adjust quantities per person swapped from 1 unit to 1-100 based on time increment.

As alpha, it is a what you see is what you get, there is no more game after the first 2 sectors, which you can see on any video of it, even though there are like 20 sectors. The game play is the same. Build ship bigger/better ad infinitum.

The single player portion of the game is about as bland as plain, store bought, pre-sliced bread. It's also about as repetitive as eating an entire loaf without making sandwiches out of it.

I've played a fair amount of singleplayer now (no idea how much, I'm pretty sure I've left the game running once or twice when I've forgotten about it), and it's a frustrating combination of constantly thinking, ""This is so cool... and so boring."" Granted, part of this might be due to my lack of imagination in regards to ship construction: there's a lot of very well designed ships on the workshop at even a casual glance, but I've never found myself able to make something I'm happy to look at.

I'd never recommend this game to anyone. I find it fun more as an idea of what might be possible, rather than what is, and once I stop playing it I can't see myself picking it back up.

But I also wouldn't call it a 'cash grab'. It's clearly a game with a lot of effort put into it (I believe it's a one-man job?). It's got a clear art style that works well, the building and gameplay are straightforward and almost entirely self-intuitive (I saw a discussion about a tutorial and all I could think was... why bother?). It runs fairly well on my somewhat ageing computer (although it randomly started chugging for no reason recently), even with all the crew running around, junk floating off into space, etc. Combat is straighforward and flashy and everyone loves things going boom.

This is the ant farm sandbox I've always wanted.

Some delicious open ended gameplay without too much overhead. You can ""go infinite"" fairly easily in this game, however enemy ship designs require some thoughtful planning. This makes it a very relaxing creative engineering experience, while still providing a perpetual ladder of challenge and goals.

There's very little resource grind or drain other than repairing and improving your ship, so there is almost no frustration in the way of testing and completing your ideas. ""Save scumming"" can make this game quite casual if that is your goal. Redesigning ships also takes no additional resources, and there is a very handy blueprint mode that lets you plan future upgrades. It will hold your redesign in limbo until you have all the resources needed, and then you can 1 click build everything.

If you like setting up automated, organic systems, this game does it really well. Very compelling balance of keeping things functional while attempting to be aesthetically pleasing.

Career mode, the primary single-player mode, is something I have mixed feelings about. It is not particularly ready to be taken out of the oven, so to speak. Basically, 5 kinds of missions are cycled multiple times per system in each individual system. You can move to another system pretty much whenever you want; however, there are difficulty rankings that are mostly arbitrary. By that, I mean there is no way for YOU to gauge the ranking you can handle. 

While the content in Career mode is lacking on the mission front, the amount of NPC ships, along with their insanely creative and unique designs, makes it worth playing if you are more focused on ship design over goal-oriented progression. Starship combat is something I also find lackluster though it is FTL-ish and I am sure the devs will improve it in the future. That all being said, this is an early-access game, so these problems are accepted.

The actual shipbuilding experience, system, combat analysis, and management are easily the most fleshed-out interface I have ever seen. Not just for spaceship building. I mean for all comparable games with a building system. Somehow Cosmoteer has mastered ""easy to learn but hard to master"" by having a non-intimidating interface with countless nuances. It is far more fun to go into creative mode (exactly what it sounds like) and just design ships to test against various NPC ships and optimize from there. Career mode can then be used for more ""applicable"" scenario-based optimizations.

Cosmoteer's starship building offers a world limited only by your creativity. Do you want to make pretty ships that suck in combat? Good, you can do that very well. Do you want to make an ugly bastard that will make other starships piss their pants? You can. Do you want a starship that does both? Why you totally can! Though, it is difficult.

Unfortunately there are two MASSIVE things ruining this game.
1. Nothing you do affects the galaxy map or the ""ownership"" of a quadrant. So for say you decide to side with the Fringe and take on all the center quadrants. Taking out all patrols, all stations of the defending faction does nothing to change the map or let Fringe take over the area. Ruins any reason for long term play-ability over 20 hours.
2. When you attack said stations or patrol ships in say a 2-4 level area, ships spawn in form no where at level 6-8. This is just asinine. What's the point of designating an area as 2-4 in ""difficulty"" if you can just spawn in whatever you want to defend it. Again ruining long term play-ability and the desire to ""fight for your faction""

So in turn you end up with a find/earn your parts ship creator which may be good for 20-40 hours of building but then useless to continue on.

Detailed Pros
1. The little visual affects when shots hit the shields is superb!
2. Ship building is great and the ability to make squads and crew job placement is really nice.
3. Mining is well done.

Some minor cons
1. Would like to see more size variations in parts, for example a ""medium"" and maybe ""extra large""/""capital"" variants and increase the cost of large parts. It was to easy to just farm for 2 hours and have all large parts on a ship way too early. 
2. Make the game more ""Lone Wolf"" friendly. Not everyone wants to have an entourage of ships to play a game. 
3. Increase shield and armor hit points to make the combat a little more compelling. Destroying ships equal to you in level in <5 secs. doesn't make the combat feel very rewarding.",1671985399,1671985399,False,2,0,0.54356849193572998,0,True,False,True

The most amazing part is that despite being Early Access, the game has so many little quality of life features. For example, you can create crew assignments that control what priority they have to certain tasks - basically, same system as Rimworld. I just learned that you can right click on a number to set all tasks of that type, set all in the menu, or just ALL tasks to that value. 

The only thing I really want soon is the ability to switch between systems in Career mode. Currently the game only runs one system at a time, which means you have to take all ships with you when you jump out. If you leave them behind, you aren't able to interact with them until you jump back.

Overall, this game is giving me vibes from Avorion and RimWorld. I don't know why the latter exactly, since it's a very different game and the Crew currently aren't modeled anywhere like the pawns are e (although it sounds like more might be coming in this area further down the roadmap). Maybe it's just the fact that crew are actually doing the work on your ship (manning the various stations, having to haul ammo from storage to the guns, etc.) and I'm spending my time unlocking new items, getting resources, and that sort of thing.

Pros (general): Fairly simple commands for the most part, all the basic design features I'd expect. Good variety of weapon types/requirements without being too complex or over involved. Runs on my potato pretty well. Adjustable difficulty for both if you want to murderhobo or space mine. Wide variety of enemy types and they scale pretty well as your ship gets bigger, taking advantage of a wide variety of the features, I've drawn several ideas from them. Sound design is great.

Cons (general): Almost entirely 2D, but I understand that trying to create something like the KSP or Illspace ship builder would be so far outside of the scope to be unrealistic. I think the ship builder and limiter could use a bit more polish to add more limiter/requirement UI elements so I know if I'm putting the ship together badly. The crew priority system is a bit obtuse, at least to me, I'd prefer something closer to most colony sims where you can just stack them by importance or a better tutorial for the existing system. Would prefer the firing/shielding arc to be adaptive to current ship design.

Neutral things that might put you off,  but are in the for balance reasons: Very limited set of perpendicular turrets, forcing you to decide if you want armor or a weapon in that position. Crew recruitment is extremely limited in order to throttle growth so you can't park in a ship graveyard and build a flying city in the first system.",1671642932,1671642932,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

There's a lot of fun building your own ship, starting off small with a 30 crew big ship maybe 2-3 lasers or cannons and then end up with a 300 crew monstrosity armed with a massive railgun or an entire broadside of cannons while firing missiles (HE, EMP, Nukes, Mines) from the front like a WW2 battleship.

Looking forward to this game's development, but it's already a good romp.

The gameplay loop is good and fun, with options to change and learn. After many hours it could get a bit repetitive but that is for a game that is still in development.
The coop aspect is top notch and seamless. The one feature you could ask for would be a fast ping system, but the rest works well. The real time + pause system works when each can pause and unpause when needed, therefore you can give orders.
The building is also good and allows for complex designs.
You could say that eventually weapons and ship elements run dry, but there are many combinations that you have to explore.

The game does an amazing job by exposing the player to the different levels of complexity in a way that it doesn't feel grindy or overwhelming. 

I find myself returning to the game daily to not only try a new ship design, but a new fleet configuration. Since the combat is quite arcadey, yet fully simulated, there's a lot, and I mean A LOT of room for tactics like flanking, kiting and using the environment to provide cover. I have won battles being incredibly outgunned by implementing tactics, this is where the game shines the most I think.

---Early access
---Space is empty(Not the good empty)
---Every star system is pretty much the same
---Unpolished in every aspect outside the Combat(Maybe mining is a bit more polished, but thats it)
---Lacking content to test your ship =>there is no real Exploring, Factions are super basic, Missions are simply fetch&kill quests, mining is simple(which might be good)


Overall the game is standing on a Solid Framework.

It definitely scratches that FTL / Factorio itch like others say. These game developers ""get it"".  They develop the correct things (fixing bugs, making extremely tight core game-play versus just slapping on more complexity and content) and it really shows in this product. 


Positives:

- Extremely polished and streamlined for an early access game. Basically, anything that could make your life easier, the devs probably thought of it and it's in this game. Nothing really feels super tedious which is very important in this genre of game.

- Ties back to the first point where there are excellent systems that just work. It's -hard- to build a game like this where you have custom spacecraft but this game pulls it off beautifully. You can actually have hundreds of crew running around your ship taking care of it without any micromanagement.

- Repairing a ship after combat is tedious in most games to the point where I sometimes dread spending time fixing every little thing broken on my ship. Not this game, it's easy enough that it encourages you to play around with different designs. Building is instant. Repairing is instant. Again, streamlined.

- Perhaps one of the only games in this genre where I can effectively manage a fleet / more than 1 ship without it feeling like a chore or needing to worry if one of the ships is going to explode randomly if left unsupervised.

- Did I mention how refreshingly polished this game is already?


Negatives

- Campaign is a bit sparse and repetitive, but totally forgivable at this state. These devs did the proper thing and made sure their game's core mechanics worked well first.

- Multiplayer is also sparse, but this is the same as the point above. 

- I really don't jive with a lot of the UI sound effects. The ""Enemy Detected"" notification gets annoying fast. The resource assignment beep gets annoying. The general UI beeps get annoying. It sucks because I don't mind the music and the weapon sounds feel pretty good too. Minor complaint, but hard to think of more negatives.",1671100082,1671100082,True,1,0,0.525862038135528564,0,True,False,True

Now keep in mind this game is in Early Access ...but that a good thing cuase it gives the makers time to make it right and add everything that is needed to make it great 

Do i Recommend this game ...Hell Yes i do

This game has the opportunity to go alot farther. The developer has a roadmap that  I'm excited for. 

The game is only minorly buggy, which is really impressive for newly launched games. 

Some suggestions to fix/optimize are: 
1. AI ship optimizations/battle tactics (AI ships only have one way to attack currently)
2. Energy draw from energy weapons (maybe be a difference between when in use and not in use?)

Ideas to be possibly added:
1. Collision damage

2. More Generic roles for crew (only energy weapons, only engines, etc)

3. Different energy reactors (Maybe solar panels?)

4. Different armor types (light, heavy, more resistant to energy, more resistant to physical projectiles, etc)

5. Ship classes? (Battleships, middle cruisers, gunboats, etc.)

6. AI to automate mining, salvaging, patrols in different regions in a system or systems entirely. 

7. Create our own empire? (Fleet, stations, hyper drive points etc.)

8. Increased levels? (Maybe up to 50?)

9. AI auto generation of ships (would be fun to see what the AI comes up with. Maybe integrations with ship classes?)

10. Added optional restrictions in ships (food/water for crew, medical, etc.)

11. Larger party group (up to 10?)

Overall:
This game is designed well and I have high hopes for it. My friends and I are thoroughly enjoying it. Thank you dev for putting in the time and effort for making such a game and even putting together a layout of a road map. That's better than most games already.

This got my attention mainly because of its similarity with Reassembly, but this title has so much depth and detail in its premise that the levels of min-maxing on each ship design is beyond comprehension. 

Basically, crew becomes your currency. You build ships, do missions, gain reputation, recruit more crew, pilot bigger / more ships. 

But the most magical thing is the amazing workshop integration. 1000's of ship designs on Steam, directly and instantly accessible in-game make experimenting hugely fun. 

It's an excellent game. Only criticism is it lacks a little depth in missions. There's no linear path in the game, but the galaxy is spread in a way that makes navigating suitably levelled 'maps' difficult. Add to that, the missions do become repetitive. 
But having said that, the meat is not in the missions, but in the ship building. There are 100's of different types of enemy ship and they all fight in a unique way that reflects their defensive and offensive abilities, requiring proper strategic considerations.

The blocky construction may feel weird at first glance, but its what makes it special.
You have an insane freedom in the way you design it. With the phisics of the engines being very important in the resulting speed and handling.
And then the magic happens. In battle every block is independent, so you have an epic ship destruction. This will force you to adapt the way you fight mid battle, two battles will never be the same.
.
Also you have to deal with crew, making the ship accesible for them and losing them too much in battles will prevent you from advancing.
.
Don´t be afraid of the Early access. You wont be bored for many hours. Every new enemy you meet will make you rethink your strategy and design, encouraging you to try new things.

I don't win but I go back a few saves and make some changes I think may work to win me the battle.

It's a nice game. It's priced about right. I played to this time like 86 hours and I finished the game. Overall most of the things worked pretty solid for me. But, there is definitely lots of room for improvement. 
It's clear the game isn't finished and some of the content is clearly from an older version of the game. 

Some of the things I would like to see are:
A better AI (may be adaptable)
A better flight AI (maybe train add an AI model per ship design which is trained) (optional but cool)
Regarding AI - Sending a ship to gather a certain resource would be great. 
Faction development based on time and your interaction. 
They already fight. 
NPCs gather resources/dead ships (or just despawning of said resources after some time when no player is close)
I noticed some ships can't exit the systems because their design is outdated (probably fixed now?)
Resource respawn rate: like asteroids changing every x minutes (fading up or down in the cloud)
Stations I think are already reconstructing but just to mention it
Conflict zones where you could join one side as a mercenary and fight for a faction in a larger battle

I don't know about others, but if there is an asteroid in sensor range during combat my chuckle head's for a crew will always find a way to get it caught in the ships structure and not get loose.  All the weapons on one side of the ship out?..... Bridge crew rarely fails to turn that side towards the enemy.  Shields out on one side?..... here let us expose it to the most heavy fire of the fight.

Regardless of the rage inducing morons I seem to have hired for a crew, it's still a great game.",1670428526,1670868521,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

@Walt Personally, looking at the roadmap I see a lot of great features and content, more stuff, more missions, more hours building ships. The game needs a more rewarding progression, that is more than missions and stuff. I feel the game isn't supposed to be a linear RPG, a more open world experience. I think my suggestions below would still keep that feel whilst giving depth. There is already enough content to spend weeks building and optimising, but nothing to throw it at..

Randomise system size and configuration, they're all too similar.
Lock certain resources, tech and improvements behind more difficult (and then rewarding) challenges.

When you look at the dynamic territory and faction wars mentioned in the roadmap, please consider;

Variable faction fleet sizes and configurations, not the same composition all the time.
Factions and pirates use FTL, adds danger to unprotected support ships.
Player can join a faction, rather than gain favour. (with benefits and consequences)
Player can privateer - perhaps once acquiring tech and effectively black flag player ships
Player can privateer with pirate factions - alternate playstyle option
Pirates actively try to ""pirate"" steal resources and ships from player and factions

and final incomplete thought, a way to manage an empire/fleet across multiple systems, whether part of a faction or not. 'safe zones' to leave dormant fleets, secured area of space by installing defences and space stations?

Gameplay is fun, but doing the same quest in every sector gets a little repetitive after a while, but building efficient and cool ships is the most fun part in my opinion.

This has quickly become one of my favorite games of all time. it is already so well polished and easy to play and get into. I played vanilla for about 6 hours before I hit the 15 mark.--That is like a record for me simply because I like to mod every game I have to improve it. But even so this game is great as is, so creative and user friendly that it is not only playable but enjoyable. (But there is always room for improvement and greater precision and enjoyment.)

And so I am extremely happy with all the mods I can find so far. I am hoping a lot of these ideas and especially what many others have asked/suggested for before the official road map was released, that more of that gets implemented-- either through more mods or through the updates to come.(I kept thinking about what would be awesome to see and sure enough plenty of other people had some of the same ideas before official road map was posted.) I really hope we get to see some more kinds of alien/robotic crew, maybe living organisms?-- (a life like inhabited universe where there is a more of an optional unfolding sanbox like story aspect going on in the background perhaps?) (dynamic events?) (better ship formation tracking so my ships do not run into things but break formation and come back together?)

I am thankful this developer cares about the game being produced and has done such a great job so far, and so I am not here demanding for more but sincerely hoping more of these gaming dreams come true.

No matter what comes I especially cannot wait for the option while fighting to have boarding parties which seems to be a main feature coming.

There's tutorials for basic stuff but not the stuff you NEED to know.  Such as moving items from one ship inventory to another, you have to click a little button while selecting a ship and it opens a menu to transfer Crew or Resources, and you click what you want to transfer.  

Basically the Crew members never need to eat, so once you buy them, they are forever working for you. There's also no stress meter or anything like that. Crew members are like robots on this game, you get them, they work for your ship and you never feed them lol. 

This game has me sinking already 25 hours into it in only 40 hours after buying it.  So yes, it's addictive.  

There are some issue however. From what i can tell Astroids don't respawn. 
Enemies are great for getting materials, but they also don't respawn. 
Stations have missions but never respawn. 
Station missions for Cargo supply says it is ""reoccuring"" but they aren't. Once you do them , they never respawn as new missions.  

This is still early access , i'm hoping they add more! I'd love to have respawning enemies and astroids and maybe base building.  As far as a fleet goes, you can make multiple ships, but it's crew memeber heavy but its best to have more than one ship.  

If your ship gets destroyed it is game over.  So having extra ships, helps.  Especially if you have to take a little ship and run for it just to keep your game going after losing your other ships.",1670402300,1670402300,True,9,0,0.634379267692565918,0,True,False,True

CONS
- Some of the crew management (squads) is confusing at first
- Only a handful of mission types
- The enemy ship AI feels mechanical, e.g. I've never seen an enemy ship retreat once it engages in battle

I bought this game 48 hours ago and have 34.7 hours no record. And that's actual played hours. It's really good.

So after pumping a lot more hours into the game and dabbling in modding a little bit, I have this to say:

This is a really strong EA release that includes everything needed to provide the core gameplay. The career mode is a little sparse right now, but it's fun enough that I've done a couple of playthroughs already. 

There's definitely a lot of content coming on the roadmap, but what's there is definitely worth the price tag and I'm excited to see where it goes in the future.",1668459039,1670275042,True,2,0,0.526907503604888916,0,True,False,True

 I would personally love if you and a friend had the option to co-control and build the same ship. Would also love if the crew had to sleep, eat and train to get better with the roles they're doing (as well as actually doing them of c). Plus, if you could get boarded and had to equip your crew to carry weapons to defend your ship from invaders.

There's a lot of creativity in enemy ship designs already and many of them are extremely clever which can make combat fun.

The game still has its massive share of issues. 
The balance of the game is absolutely wacked, basically anything that isn't a Railgun or Ion Beam is absolute dog water and is like a pea shooter.
because of how the games ship management works, you need an excessively large amount of crew to man a ship, but the problem is that getting the required amount of crew is basically impossible since the game locks your crew recruitment to an unbelievably harsh fame requirement that you gain from doing missions, the issue with this is that once you are past a very low fame threshold, most missions do not reward fame anymore, which leads you into an endless loop of never having enough crew to man your ships.
Another, more technical issue I've experienced is that the game has a massive memory leak of some sort, the longer you play it the worse the performance gets, for comparison when i first boot up my save after opening the game i get a straight 144fps, but after like 8 hours of play i'm only getting a measly 45fps.
These so far are my main issues, other than the obvious lack of ship building parts, but i imagine these issues will be sorted out by launch so i'm extremely optimistic about this game.

This game is extremely addicting and hours can fly by in what feels like minutes, i highly recommend this game to anybody that likes creative sandbox and space strategy games, because this one is like a wet dream come true.",1670242064,1670242226,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

I enjoyed this concept for a good while but once you build a base and a few ships, its over content-wise.
I never made it to end game lvl systems due to the following:
A.I paths are infuriating! click right next to my ship ''move over a bit to get the asteroid in the laser arc'' and ship will take off in a random direction if not strait ahead at full blast,
Don't park anything near a station (safe zone) cause a A.I WILL come and ram you to the other side of the system.
At one point i had to slow to 1/8 and repeatedly pause the game whilst manually firing engines cause the A.I AND direct control could not work out a simple 4 axis movement of straight.
Crew management......uhhhh.
miner set to 10 operate 10 load and still gets out and harvest/collect at 1, set a dedicated crew to miner only and the other crew runs it and the dedicated crew dose nothing!
only 34 crew on all factories and still get idle crew! 
bugs such as powering off laser to free up crew while hyperdrive is charging will not jump at 100% charge.
double click on a ship module will only select some, not all.
P hotkey will not always work on all modules selected.
Game became more annoying than fun.

Only things that could still be improved in career mode is that the fame system is a little on the conservative side when it comes to acquiring fame and crew, though I still think it is a massive improvement over bounty hunter mode. The only other problem I have is the lack of any sort of main factional quests, there are some faction quests but there isn't really a main questline for any of them, which is a negative for me. The game could stand for a couple improvements to the questing system and could use just more variation in its quests and maybe a story. I say this because there are only a handful of quest types, there is go kill some ship(s), go kill some ship(s) in an asteroid field, deliver some materials, contact/defend a space station, explore the system, and go destroy a space station/pirate base. This variety of quests is very interesting, but the problem is that unless you beam into a very high level system the only way to get fame is to destroy space stations at least that I've seen. I enjoy many of these quests but a lack of a goal makes it a little hard to justify clearing out everything in a system. The introduction of storage is a very interesting mechanic and is very well thought out, definitely one of the best upgrades from the demo. Though I do wish there was a 5x5 storage container. Overall, the upgrade from the demo has been amazing and at the writing of this review I already have 25 hours in the game. Highly recommend this game.",1670080340,1670080340,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

The building system while it isn't perfect, presents quite a fun design challenge while still not being... painful.

I'd love to be able to place more doors on crew quarter rooms, namely the 2x2 variant, since it would make ship design a lot more reasonable. A 3x3 crew quarter would also be a nice addition, along with different sized hyperdrives and what not, but I'm sure that's coming as this game is still early access during this time.

Suggestions
- More upgrade paths for items. Perhaps requiring research etc.
- More ways to build ships.
- Add Conveyor belts like factorio or dyson sphere program. Why manually have crew for some things that can be sent through a chute for another crew member to take.
- storyline
- Option to destroy asteroids as a point defense safety feature.
- Asteroids should hurt a lot when ramming them.
- Ability to shield smash enemies
- Ability to command units attack patterns
- Better default automation for crew roles. Takes a while to figure out what roles you need. Perhaps some presets will make ordering critical things more easy.
- Ability to bulk deselect all priorities for a crew role.
- Ability to drag a range of access for crew roles. IE instead of manually assigning locations that can be removed when changing the ship, we can assign a crew to a specific area of the ship like the engine area or the gun area.
- Ability to have different ship modes like ""RED"" would signal all crew to get to guns -> charge them -> Charge engines Etc. Green would allow for manufacturing and mining laser high priority when mining is selected.
-  ability to increase efficiency of items by upgrade them. Perhaps upgrades could be kept on convoys that need to be raided or you need to join a faction to have access to.",1669957794,1669957794,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

I went all out.

12 hours and 1.7mil credits later, a veritable fortune capable of making something similar to a destroyer or a light cruiser, my magnum opus was finished. I gave it everything I could possibly think of, every tool for every scenario I could come up with. Two pairs of gargantuan deck cannons for cracking armor, a set of disruptors and a few EMP missile launchers to disable shields, a complicated weave of shields and armor for survivability, an array of flak cannons and point defense lasers against missiles, two oversized reactors and a handful of smaller ones to power it all, and more. 

I grinned. It was the perfect ship, bristling with armaments capable of countering possibly everything the game has thrown at me thus far. I even had the ship painted, asked the Cosmoteer Discord channel for aesthetic advice, all while marvelling at my work. 

It was time to test my creation. Seeing all the other ships I haven't encountered in Career, I spawned in an Imperium ship of similar credit value and set the A.I. to duel each other.

In less than 30 seconds my ship was demolished. The A.I. had a clever trick; it fired a screen of faster, dummy HE missiles to act as a screen against my anti-missile equipment for a volley of late-stage nukes. The starboard thrusters were the first to go, nukes shearing through the engine room and killing its crew. Left to limp, my ship was forced to weather the rain of missiles at halved speed. A second salvo of nukes hit. The shields went next, followed by a portion of my point defenses. An unlucky missile lit up the cargo holds where I stored my spare ammunition, setting that quadrant of the ship on fire. In a quiet moment of horror, I realized I had forgotten to add fire extinguishers.

My ship was destroyed before my deck cannons could even get into firing range. The simulated crew were either dead or lost to space, left to slowly suffocate as their air ran out. It was back to the drawing board for me.

The game has great concepts and seems to have an amazing fighting system. People are saying if you like rimworld/factorio/ftl you'll love this, and that's wrong. This game has no end goal like the those games do. This game doesn't have in depth pawns like rimworld does, and this game doesn't have story like the others do.

This game is 2D Avorion + FTL Ships/Combat. Your goal is to trade destroy and complete lil generated missions that will build your ship bigger. No end goal, just get big.

Multiplayer? Eh, it's more just start a server, bring your friend in, and let the screw off and do what they wanna do. You don't man the same ship and work together much. It's kinda like if you started a Minecraft server and you said ""build your own base and I'll do mine and we'll judge eachothers.""

The game is actually great, amazing mechanics and everything, it just doesn't have a goal or a reason for me to keep playing. I have about 13k hours in all steam games, excluding things like minecraft and airshipper kinda stuff, so I pickup on concepts / general idea of a game quickly.

The game is also surprisingly relaxing, given there are no timed survival mechanics.  Integrated mod/steam workshop compatibility as well!

That said, there are a few downsides.  Ship controls can be a little janky sometimes when it comes to the pathfinding and auto-avoidance AI.  There's also some quality of life features that could definitely be included in menus and ship management, such as the ability to buy and sell specific amounts via number input rather than incremental buttons, and more control over crew jobs and priorities.

  You can set ships / squads of ships and even the weapons on those ships to key binds.

[b] Run. [/b]

Im not kidding, stay far far FAR away from this game if you enjoy ship combat in space... why? Because its addicting! [u] I haven't seen the sun in weeks [/u].

[b] Jokes Aside [/b]

Cosmoteer is a sandbox, space ship designer, I do believe you can design your own space station, but I haven't gotten to it yet. But what I have done is the core rounds of the game, which the quests from the individual space stations have you do is basically that.

at the moment the Core Gameplay loop is Explore -> Mine Resources -> Upgrade/Build Ships -> Fight Enemies -> Turn Quests In.

It gets gradually harder as you progress into the game and you slowly find yourself in dire need of crew members.

[b] The Good [/b]
[list]
[*] Sandbox Game, Unlimited Freedom.
[*] Weapons are fun, Ship building and Customization is great
[*] An active Galaxy with Neutral ships wondering around (that you can attack and become wanted for a while)
[*] Limited Faction System
[*] Game is a WIP Early Access and Hype.
[/list]
[b] The Bad [/b]
[list]
[*] WIP Game
[*] Gameplay Loop can get old fast
[*] Not alot of options for RP at the moment
[*] Repetitive

Of course there are no fancy graphics and its ""only"" 2D but I't has so much to offer:
Wanna build and control a giant destroyer? You can do it!
Wanna build and control a fleet of many small ships? You can do it!
Wanna build and control a death star? You can do it!

And it's only in early access. If take a look on the road map there is almost everything I expect from a space game.

But I agree with some of the negative reviews. The campaign mode needs some addition and balance fixes, but like I said before its still in early access and there is much to come. That's why I'm sure this game will be epic once more stuff especially exploration-wise is added.

For the developers:
 - Explore missions are busted: You can easily go to high level systems and do the explore missions for a hell lot of credits and renown. I would advise that the question mark doesn't count as discovered when you accept a bounty mission for example. (once got 90k just for accepting all missions at a station)
 - Also letting npcs destroy themselves or a station (at least partially) gives a lot of resources. I would advise to enable npc to collect loot they collected and maybe even get mad at you when you steal it. 
 - Same goes for npcs doing your bounty missions. (once got 170k or so but I did nothing but watch and collect loot afterwards)
 - Also maybe do refreshing bounty missions, I would like that.
 - Also there should be some way to control ships in other systems. (its kinda lame when the game tells you that you lost even tho you still have a whole fleet in the neighbor system.

But with a glance on the road map I am sure it will be a 10/10 right now I'd say its a 7/10!",1667207039,1669733786,True,2,0,0,0,True,False,True

The creator mode is a lot of fun for tinkering and making ships, and you can take those ships and fight other people online in VS match ups etc. Its a great sandbox.

Career mode has the bones of a working long term narrative. Right now its basically fight loot build bigger ship, expand fleet move to new system with harder enemies and repeat. End game fights can be massive if doing the career survival style game. Its an engaging combat loop. Esp as you might need that one piece of tritanium you just cant find to finish your build. As it is now its about combat for the most part. You can mine, but that is mainly so you can build a better combat ship.

I would like to see more creativity in then missions, maybe some ambush missions where enemies WARP in around you. Or hunt you down more aggressivly.

I feel the fame system for recruiting more people needs a bit more tuning. I had a fun fleet going but could never fully crew some ships. I kind of want to be able to recruit from pirates or survivors of pirate attacks I find. Maybe put some rescue missions in the game where you have to save people to get them in the crew under a time limit? I think we need more missions options that can build fame then just the combat ones or blowing up pirate bases.

I hope to see maybe some more expanded weapons down the line. Maybe expand the mining with more events related to it. More missions to mine specific things. 

I would like to see a story mode. And have a game play mode with some depth and narrative story.

I got fast response from the Dev that to swap ship components without having to pay for moving the part from point A to point B you must use blueprint mode, which is like additional layer of design screen. There are plans for QoL update for this in the future, so this might not be an issue in the future.

Now I can just say, that the game looks promising and I am curious what will come with the next updates. Definitely worth a try. If this game will keep expanding it's content and the workshop will deliver as usual, we can be looking on a gem in the making. I had no issues or bugs except the one described before, so neither you should expect any... and even if you do, you should get quick help either through steam channels or perhaps discord (dunno, I got mine in the steam comments just a moment after posting the first review)

This game is a blast. It reminds me of an open world FTL mixed with SPAZ but with an incredible amount of ship customization. Honestly, even the game settings themselves have more options than you could imagine, so those who like to tinker and fine tune their experience will have more than enough tools to do so.

I'm having an absolute blast with this game.  There's bounty hunting, trading, mining, manufacturing, fleet combat, salvaging, and the list goes on. 

You can build/modify your ships during gameplay in real time or with the game paused, which is really nice. When salvaging or mining or just traveling long distances, you can crank the game speed up to 8x to get to the action (in multiplayer as well).

I could gush about this game for a long time. If you enjoy this type of game, it's a must have.  There's already so much content and polish, with much more to come.

Then I stumbled on a YTer yesterday who covered the game. I watched it, and sure enough I was really impressed. It had taken bits of FTL, Space Haven (maybe a pinch of Rimworld), and turned it into a fun game.

This sort of game lives and dies on it's UI, how intuitive and fiddly it is (or isn't). I am very happy to report the UI is excellent, and controls are very intuitive. Things work as you'd expect, or the game's tool-tips will guide you in the right direction. The actual  modifying/ building of your spaceship isn't a matter of spreadsheets and thousands of components. You get simple items, with simple names ie. ""Large Thruster"", not ""Zaxillion Mk.1"" (and thus no need to refer to some stat table to see if it's bigger and better than the small thruster, or ""Blibbob Mk.3"")

Space combat is FUN, watching your little people go EVA to salvage wrecks is FUN, the universe is HUGE! The missions you take help steer you with a pseudo tutorial so you don't feel overwhelmed.

I paid full price for this, didn't even wait for a sale, as the £16 I spend was well worth it (I own Space Haven, so it's cheaper by a cpl quid).

- Build any ship in whatever shape you like, however big you want. Honestly, even with a trash CPU and barely stable GPU I can easily handle 75fps and have fun with big space battleships.
- Instant build, but careful resource management as well. Crew isn't a big concern, unless you've messed up bad and half the deliveryboys got nuked.
- Combat is intense. I feel like I'm watching a boxing match between two giants, and I feel every good hit on my cannons.
10/10, potentially addictive.

I've gotten into the modding scene, and it's better than I ever could have hoped for. Obviously biased.
- [b] Performance issues [/b] at very large scales, mostly dependent on CPU output. Not heavy, but definitely a bottleneck if you're loading 100 mods.
- [b] Gameplay is dynamic, but always interesting. [/b] Imagine being able to let your ships do their thing and chill on a long journey, but the entire system is running even as you crank up the zoom and timewarp.
- [b] Developers are cool. [/b] It's really a labor of love, and I don't want it any other way. They like to fix what they have before they add more to fix, so expect a [i] few [/i] updates every other weekday or so.

Overall, still rate this a 10/10 for concept and execution, though of course it's not perfect. I'm committed to this idea - the Cosmoteer gameplay loop - and see nothing but consistent progress towards the beautiful final product.",1667779984,1669509082,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Not only have we spent many an hour playing the game together, and actually speaking to my teenage son, but I've also discovered a layer of complexity I hadn't realised it had.

3. Great controls, if you are either in command mode or direct control ships feel and look realistic, the thruster plumes give a good sense of omph and speed change.

While still in EA, Cosmoteer is already very much in a playable and more importantly enjoyable state. It has had a great start and one look at the Roadmap should make you realize, that it has a bright future ahead of it.

The only criticism I can think of is that currently progress is locked behind the availability of crew. While it can be changed in the settings, this gatekeeping mechanic isn't too enticing and feels extremely artificial. Maybe the limiter should be number of modules, ship size or (once more modules are available) perhaps the reason to explore new systems should be the availability of blueprints... ideally even in a randomized fashion to encourage replayability. Long term I'm hoping for an official adaptation of crew independent power distribution. Electrical wiring is available as a mod already but it's always better to have something in the base game. It's not too difficult to come up with a system that poses it's own drawbacks (like volatile wiring for example). Once boarding is coming, the issue will have to be addressed anyway in some fashion so it's better to tackle it early on.

A special shoutout to Dubmood, who composed the OST for Cosmoteer. The music is great in it's own right and fitting for the genre... also rather reminiscent of Uplink and X2.",1669465742,1669474582,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Low and medium tier ships have alot of variance and diffrent play styles that are fun and allow you to experiment and make interesting designs. Then you get into the late game and its... Ion beams. Everything and everyone uses ion beams. All other weapons are basically entierly useless. All top tier ships have enough point defense weapons to delete cannons/railguns from existence, and missiles are decent for AI to spam but they use missile parts way too fast to be practical for a player ship. All other energy weapons are redundant when a ion beam just does 20x more damage and can be placed inside the ship to make it impossible to destroy without basically destroying the entire ship. Railguns are fine but are hard countered by shields, and all top tier ships have way too many shields. Basically this leads to most top tier ships being nearly identical, just a fancy design around a big central circle where a ion beam is formed then shoved out through a billion shields and out the front. 

So if you play a campaign expect to have fun for 15 hours, and then just ion beam spam, all the ion beam spam. Nothing else matters. Literally just build a big ass cube that makes a bunch of ion beams and you auto win everything. I find that extremely boring and uninteresting. If I were to balance the game id make it so ion beams either just didnt exist, or they couldnt go through shields on the same ship they are shot from. Maybe just tone down the damage alot. Or add larger longer range lasers/cannons that didnt have the horrid reload rate of railguns. Right now its just boring, you either use Ion beams or you die (Or you dedicate your entier ship to making storing and shooting 10 billion nukes). 

TLDR: Ion beams are boring and extremely OP, this makes the end game boring and uninteresting. games alot of fun for like 15hours until you reach that point, after that I just cant be bothered anymore. Overall like a 7/10 game, just leaving a negative review because the game is currently 98%.

And defensive arrangements require such engaging trade-offs that change with each type of enemy contact. Each unlocked tech requires retooling and engineering exploration. The labor force power and ammo management is inspired, it's very intuitive and rewarding. I'm constantly trying different ship builds and fleet arrangements, even returning multiple times to past arrangements because there are so many approaches that can work with just the right tweak, and all have their downsides. I feel a little overpowered at the moment, and the balance feels occasionally off. It's really hard to play through without save scumming, sudden catastrophic debilitating explosions can sneak up on even powerful ships and undo hours of development. I look forward to a permadeath Ironman mode (on the roadmap). After building a clunky superweapon mounted on my capital ship, I've learned that basically, just a second plucky, back-stabby ship will be more effective than your expensive death ray simply because the enemies have weak spots, but that's really the charm of the combat. And really, all of that changes when I meet multiple lethal ships and my own weak spots become exposed.

The itch I can't quite scratch I guess is that I often feel like I'm consistently steamrolling the local pirates, and then suddenly, my fleet is gutted due to a perfect storm of circumstance, which makes it hard to tell if it's too easy, or too hard. And I'm not even sure if that's a good or bad thing to not know, maybe that's the best kind of difficulty level? I guess I need to adjust my build to anticipate more perfect storms.

Apparently I love it, it's my fifth most played game ever, and it just released. While I have 5x as many hours in Factorio, that is over many years.

This game has a lot of potential but I would recommend you wait a bit for the devs to add more before you spend any money on this. I'm already feeling burned out with the lack of content.

as a TL,DR  I adore this game for what it is, it allows you to make very simple or complicated spaceships and then use them in a sandbox, filled with dangers or against friends in creative without any of the steps being overly tedious, whilst still intricate enough to remain interesting. 

As a starter, I've played quite a few CraftingSurvival games in the last couple years, including games like Space Engineers and Emperion Galactic Survival. Both games have in common that you can build a neat spaceship for yourself and fly it around! And fly it around, and kinda walk through it and just be there. (you get my point).  Sadly without a lot of extra effort on either a community or mods, that is the end goal of these games. You make your ship, go from point A to B and that's it. You can fight, but that's often more tedious than anything often requiring quite a bit of setup. 

In those games the shipbuilding is quite fun and challenging, but using it is often more hassle than it's worth. 
Though a bit simpler (2d and not 3d, also you are not a specific entity) Cosmoteer manages to grasp the same kind of feel as those games evoked, when building the ships. But it also manages to make using them quite fun. 

Because of the 2d nature and it's easy to use system you can whip up a simple ship in a jiffy, It will fly, it will shoot and do precisely what you want it to do. You can then take it out into a sandbox game and just see how well it does. But the quite interesting crew mechanic and the fact every single block is an individual part and can be destroyed/damaged. Gives quite a bit of depth to the design of the ships.

The battles fought are interesting and quite intense, a single lucky shot on an unprotected reactor can cause cascade reactions and blow up your ship, every shot not stopped by a shield plinks off bits of armour (hopefully), damages subsystems or outright guts your cockpit. 

In creative mode you can make the ship of your dreams, test it out against any ship already in the game, or if you play multiplayer fight against/with your friends designs. 

In career mode you're more limited, fame restricts crew size and all ship parts require materials, either scavenged, crafted or bought from stations. This adds a whole new layer of strategy to the game, as cost and efficiency are now way more important. A well oiled machine can run on half the crew than a slapped together rustbucket and leave some space for things like armour or maybe a second ship entirely. 

The fights become more strategic as well. After every battle the ""field"" is littered with the debris of both you and your enemy. This detritus can be used to fix and upgrade your ship. This means that though a good shot at the enemies reactor will take them out, it also means less salvage. Instead taking out their engines and guns would mean that you can take appart (or even capture) their ship. 

Though it's not all roses and sunshine. The sandbox is quite simple, and apart from fighting and mining there is not much else to do. On the Dev's roadmap it is already stated that fleshing out the career mode is on the to do list, so I won't spend too much time on it. Though simple, as a way to test designs it works incredibly well.",1669306434,1669306434,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

A couple things to note however would be the inclusion of more peaceful ways to play (like trading, exploring, or some type of scientific investigation), more ship construction options like circular or oval shape parts, and additional weapons and systems, like torpedoes, magnetic accelerators, and drones.

It would also be nice to have more background as to the AI factions in the game, their ideologies, conflicts, and diplomacy. Also allowing the player to start their own faction, or to claim star systems for themselves as a pirate would be interesting.

Creative is a great way to test your ship designs, or design new ones. But the ultimate test awaits you in PVP multiplayer, where you fight ships that are built by people just like you. 

But PVP isn't your only multiplayer option! You can play through your career together, achieving greatness not only through ship design, but also teamwork!

Pros
- The new scavenging and bounty mechanics add a ton of depth and richness to the gameplay. The classic gameplay is still available.
- The world is full of random ships, many of them neutral that will occasionally battle pirates.
- The developer is actively pushing out balance and performance updates
- Game is very stable.
- Building ships is extremely fun and rewarding.

Cons
- It's in EA so some bugs and performance issues exist
- Some balance mechanics like crew are sometimes really annoying to deal with. If you lose a good portion of your ship and still win, you will spend a long time waiting at a station for new crew to become available. Often the crew limit caps what your ship can accomplish and requires you do tedious crew management to make sure the right rooms are prioritized.
- Running multiple ships becomes difficult despite it being a fun way to scale up operations and potentially explore other parts of the game like mining and manufacturing.",1666647421,1669236131,True,1,0,0.519999980926513672,0,True,False,True

Imagine having your spaceships' reactor taken out by a rail-gun from massive range, then having your ship disassembled around you as you eject yourself to avoid the cutting beams. You watch from the claustrophobic confines of your spacesuit in awe as the husk of your ship is melted down by mining lasers and turned into a storage bay to hold the rest of the scrap from your ship. As the victorious enemy vessel hyper-jumps away, you hear a warning... ""2 minutes of oxygen remaining!""

However, this game really hits all the right aspects of a top-down 2D-based space ship game. From building almost any shape and size ship (as long as you have enough resources and crew) to mining asteroids, taking out bounty and creating a fleet; this game really has a lot going for it.

I am also super excited for the road map as there are some quality of life and things that would be great to have. I also would like to see different faction weapons; such as alien weapons that are different than Terran weapons, and so on.

All in all, if you want more detail on the cons of the game, read another review. For me it is a super fun space ship game and really has a lot to offer to offer.

example:
(mining ship -> asteroid with resources [which would be nice if they refreshed from time to time in places to mine] -> cargo ship / [or AI resource seller] /-> our station -> production at our station of valuable goods and components for shipbuilding -> Arriving AI ship that gathers sorcers and valuables)

Your goal is kinda designing a starship to look pretty, protect the reactors from being blown up, and do damage so you can get resources to build more starships. 
(Build armor around reactors, so railguns can't destroy them.)
Current forecast is a lot of rockets, railguns, and crystal laser beams shooting out of holes in the armor (don't forget to shoot incoming rockets down), to minimize weakpoints will not leave a lot of room.
Factories for producing ammo and storage will require a big ship that has lots of weakpoints and dead weight.
Best to have multiple ships for mining, production and  transport, with specialized tasks.
Specialize them further to do specific damage to crack starbases and enemy ships open and have them not become too fat and slow, let the transports gather the resources.
On combat ships i use the reactor near the engine room kinda like the way the warp drives are on the enterprise, as extensions.
If your engines get shot off, as long as you can still maneuver, it doesn't matter. 
As long as the explosion doesn't cause chain reactions and blows up your ship, you're combat ready, perfect.

Current thinking is to not trust mirror mode too much, uneven starships may have benefits to handle multiple types of enemies without having your ship grow bigger.

If you want to just chill and mine asteroids and hunt petty pirates, if feels like you can do that indefinitely and just watch your bank balance rise.  If you want a challenge, you can hit harder, tougher systems and risk everything to prove your mettle.
If your style is to just drag a box around your ships and point and click to HULK SMASH the enemy you can do that.  If you want deep, nuanced combat that allows you to micromanage your ships, pick targets, and (attempt to) pull off brilliant maneuvers that would make Napoleon and Sun Tzu proud the game allows you to (attempt to) do that too!

When you find your ship just isn't big enough you can just tack on some more guns and weld on some extra buckets to lug cargo or, just like with combat, you can roll up your sleeves and design your ""perfect"" ship tile by tile.  You can run a single HUGE dreadnought that is the envy of your neighborhood or you can command a fleet of specialized craft to dominate the space lanes with and set elaborate and complicated attack programs for your forces to run.

It's a rare treasure for a game to extremely good at any one of those things and this game lets you pick and choose to play however your mood dictates and switch it up seamlessly from one playstyle to another.  I have not tried them yet, but the game also has co-op and PVP options if you make friends.  The soundtrack fits the game rather well and I find myself enjoying it in the background as I'm in other tabs dealing with distractions until I can get back to my new virtual space life.

Cosmoteer comes in as a strong contender in the strategy genre. I've had an overall great experience with the game, especially with the intuitive control scheme and help system. I quite often found that actions I wanted to perform - such as strafing around target ships or changing the default engagement type - were already implemented into the game without being nested in several layers of tabs. For advance controls, especially when dealing with fleets, the help system provided a brief explanation of the key points needed for control. It's extremely rare to see a game execute both controls and explanation of advanced controls in an effective manner, and yet Cosmoteer executes both masterfully.

Cosmoteer also offers an easy to use, hard to master building system when it comes to constructing and modifying each of your ships. Each component is only a single layer deep inside the UI which makes it rather easy to find the exact building component you want when you want it. Combined with the streamlined UI is a well organized info panel for each component which lists out every stat and/or explains modifiers when relevant. The magic (math) going on behind the scenes is fairly simple which allows players of any skill to build a ship that performs well.

[h1]Cons:[/h1]
[b][i]*Disclaimer: The ""cons"" section serves as a disclaimer to anyone disregarding the early access tag and buying the game with the expectation it's on par with a beta release. This section is intended to provide constructive criticism and should be viewed as such.[/i][/b]

The gameplay loop for Cosmoteer can be boiled down into three types: combat, exploration, and industry. Early on in your career you'll mostly be locked to the combat and exploration until you've built up enough reputation and upgraded your ship. Combat in Cosmoteer has some depth to it as it stands, but the outcome of each battle solely depends on the ships ""level"" (which you can see below an enemy ship). The complexity of each engagement boils down into who has more firepower, but as this game is in early access this is slated to change drastically in future updates.

Exploration is barebones as the points of interest are limited to contract locations, asteroid fields, jump beacons, stations/bases, and abandoned ships. Outside of these there's very little reason to explore each system and became repetitive in just a couple of hours. Exploration would benefit greatly from additions such as unique encounters (e.g. fleet battles), anomalies (hidden jump gates?), or even specialty missions with multiple completion states. In general the exploration side of Cosmoteer is in need of some extra content to avoid the repetitive loop that occurs rather quickly.

Industry is an awkward topic due to how it's implemented in the game as mid to late game content. Early on you'll mostly have access to factories that produce basic ammunition and materials used during ship construction, but as you progress you can build factories which are capable of producing specialized munitions and complex materials. You can easily get away will building a logistics ship which stores and produces everything you need wherever and whenever you need it, so this point is not necessarily a con. It'll be interesting to see how industry develops further on as the dev completes other milestones first.

[h1]Verdict:[/h1]
Cosmoteer gets a hard [b]recommend[/b] from me. There's enough content there to justify the price tag while still needing substantial develop before leaving early access. It occupies a unique niche that combines some of the best aspects of various indie titles like Rimworld, Avorion, and Factorio into a streamlined package that players of any caliber can learn. The content roadmap also inspires excitement and hope for future versions of the game.",1669164254,1669164254,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

The interesting part in this game is crew; crew is needed to power/supply all of your performance parts (there are no inbuilt cables or anything like that) so you need to manage their physical travel and the amount of people for each thing, with different walkways, assignments, priorities and distances - all while you're ""fame capped"" in Career Mode.

Fame can only be gained up to a cap within a difficulty, which means you can only have so much crew to run a ship, which inevitably forces you to actually think and design ships that can actually beat higher lvl enemies so you can progress.

Right now Career Mode is unbelieveably bare bones, reduced to the core gameplay loop, and there are not very many different weapons and no ""tiers"" of weapons to speak of, it's a very limited set of lego for you to try to create something out of it - but they do give you a very useful building mode with FULL REFUNDS so you're free to rebuild as you like.

People like to compare this game to FTL and I can understand why, but it does this game a disservice. Keep in mind, FTL is one of my all time favorites. Yes, you can pause the game at any point with spacebar. Yes, you can target individual weapons/systems to attack specific parts of an enemy ship. Yes you travel from sector to sector. But that's where the similarities end.

What I love:
Being able to handcraft your ship(s) over time or their ""creative"" mode is incredibly fun. There's a diverse range of weapons you can select from and even some sub-variants of weapons. You can make some truly massive ships equipped with an insane number of weapons, shields and other add-ons. Crew management is fun but complicated, although not necessarily required. You can micromanage each and every soul onboard (of which there can be hundreds!), or you ignore it and let the AI do it's thing. Frankly either way is just as viable and fun.

You can command multiple ships at once, commanding a small fleet of ships is a bit challenging but rewarded handsomely by being nearly invulnerable due to overwhelming firepower.

THE COMBAT IS AWESOME. This is where the game really shines. The impact effects and sfx are awesome. Watching your freshly retrofit battleship rake an enemy ship with deck cannon blasts and railgun fire is satisfying on an insane level. Love it love it love it. My only complaint here is there needs to be more of it!

Coop for a game like this is truly inspired. Being able to link with friends and trash enemies throughout the galaxy is stupid amounts of fun. PvP is also well implemented and a delight to challenge different ship designs against one another.

What I don't love:
The music in this game is pretty bland and repetitive. I turned it off within the first few hours. I don't personally mind, cos I don't think it takes away from immersion to remove it, but it would be nice to get a real decent soundtrack.

There isn't really a story. You kind of just fly around to randomly generated systems and station to collect missions and resources. The faction affinity system is not really implemented yet, so having a poor rep with a specific faction doesn't really make any difference. It can get boring to just float around the same feeling sectors over and over again.

Where the heck is all the uranium!?

Top down games rarely click with me, this being one of the exceptions, but my usual complaint about top down games applies here. The maps you get to ""explore"" are boring as hell. You can see the same 10 low-res planets in every system. The stations are at least mostly unique, but still it gets kinda lame to explore when everything looks the same.

Nuclear reactors are a pain in my ass. They need to be within 15m of relevant systems otherwise you get severe productivity penalties. But putting them near weapon suites causes them to be vulnerable to fire, which causes CATASTROPHIC damage when detonated. I find myself over-reinforcing my ship just to prevent self destructive chain reactions if a battle isn't going my way. Maybe it's by design, but because it kinda feels a little unbalanced it irks me not knowing weather or not it's a feature or a bug. Alternative power supplies, PLEASE!

Summary:
This game is fantastic start to finish. It's imperfect, but it's EA. Devs are responsive and actively release content which Im very eager to see. There's a lot of other games in this space, but I think this one takes the cake.

The devs have really thought the mechanics through and it's a pleasure to actually play a game that challenges you. My most ""SURPRISE!"" moment was being able to transfer crews/resources between ships, which added so much to my gameplay. I also didn't realise you could make fleets, as I'd been recommended this game by a friend and did hardly any prior reading.

The only two things I'd maybe suggest for improvement/addition at this stage would be boarding parties and a more robust AI. Boarding parties would see the need for new modules and could be an interesting way to takeover ships in a hostile sense, rather than blowing them to bits. Additionally, the AI is quite simplistic in how it fights, as it'll just charge your ship and keep you within optimal range.

If you enjoy Space Haven minus the intricate colony management, this could be a great medium-paced combat game you can really get your teeth into in the sense of both creative freedom and dogfighting.",1668017398,1669147274,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

It does get a bit repetitive. I really love the freeform way you can build ships and even build fleets. The limiters in place like crew size make it feel like a nice balancing act between trying to build the beefiest ship possible and still have enough people to run it which is a really great way of creating a barrier to just going crazy and creating some OP juggernaut. I wish there was more weapons and more upgrades but it's in early access and the devs right now are actively working on bug fixes. So I'm sure more weapons and more systems are coming. 

The issues right now are the repetitive nature and optimization. It starts to really bog down really bad when you start to have massive ships and even small fleets. I have a pretty beefy system and it chugs along sometimes at 15FPS. There's also some really slow times when you're salvaging a ship or just moving across a star system where watching it at 1x speed is really slow but trying to pump it up to 8x speed just grinds it to a halt with sub 10FPS framerate.

complaints
-nonexistent AI, ships fail to react to hostiles unless manually ordered, there is no move-attack, and the escort command does not work reliably. These are basic to any respectable RTS
-the PVP metagame balance is subpar, needs to be based on winrate statistics
-turret manual-fire activates when nowhere near the target
-not enough HUD for weapon aiming
-lobby system is one of the most perplexing and user-hostile software design decisions ive ever seen
-cant join ongoing games
-netcode and performance worse than all the main commercial engines, the custom engine was entirely a waste of labor

opinions
-i dont like crews, especially power, it was inspired by FTL, and should be more like FTL
-weapon ranges are about 4 times shorter than i would like

The game is fun for first few systems when ships are small, trading is small, salvaging enemy ships is small. But after the player goes to higher level systems (+12) with much bigger enemy ships, and players own ship gets big too, salvaging ships gets big, trading gets big.. the whole game goes from nice playable 200 fps to 10 fps.

The mods and the multiplayer gives more life to this, rather empty game. Building ships together, fighting together, ""progressing"" together, it's great fun. But The same FPS issues are even worse together in the higher level systems. On top of that, Connection gets lost, Sync errors, and auto-saving and hyper-jumping causes people to grow hair to a bald head; only to rip the hair off Again. Insanely frustrating. 

It's a CPU issue AFAIK, but Ryzen 5 1600 (6 core / 12 thread 3,2GHz boosted 3,6) should be more than enough to handle the game, at least according to the Recommended System Specs.

It was fun in the beginning, super addictive. But now in the so called ""End Game"" (there's no story, just higher level enemies up until level 18) the game is unplayable, FPS is from 1 to 20, averaging at 11. 

The developer is doing the programming completely alone. Maybe the guy should hire couple more guys to optimize the game.
I will definitely get back to this game when it's more optimized, and hopefully with better mod support. Some kind of a small story/plot would be also a nice thing.


But for now: Great fun in the beginning, before the game becomes unplayable in higher levels.

Fleet management feels kinda clunky (but functions flawlessly), gets annoying managing resources (and I'm the type to loot every single body in fallout). 

Overall very excited to see where this games goes, great opportunity to be the next iteration of ftl, just needs some random quest lines and choices, story etc. Hopefully the dev hires a writer because this looks like a case where the dev is an incredible program builder, but needs some emotional elements. After playing a few hours you've pretty much seen everything in the game. What is this question mark? It's either an enemy, a random loot, a gateway, or an asteroid. That's some diversity, but it doesn't bring out any sense of wonder or fear. Maybe distress beacons and decisions you have to make, help this seemingly helpless crew or loot their ship.

Galaxies could be more diverse. Once you're a big dangerous ship you can walk around without a worry in the world. Would be interesting to see a low chance of an extremely large ship spawning you have no chance of defeating, or swarms of smaller ships flying around the galaxy. 

Even though the galaxy is pretty large, it feels small because there isn't much in it. Fill it with random encounters, choices and a diversity of enemies and this game will be infinitely more interesting.

That's its ""gimmick,"" its good. It doesn't try and do complicated things that distract the player, it's a legitimately challenging game (I might have ticked it up a difficulty) where you need to understand how to design ships well and make sound decisions. The crew management & movement are high level - but that's because the AI for them are designed really well. When you tell your ship to move it balances the center of mass & various thrust locations to smoothly accelerate in a way you can't do manually (there are optional manual controls). The crew can be told what priorities to have, but where you put their quarters on the ship has way more of an impact then which weapon the recharge first - because of the brutal difficulty, if you're micro-ing crew during combat you're already dead (how I'm choosing to play)",1668931404,1668931404,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

The building of the ships themselves is EXTREMELY satisfying and not too complex at all -- in fact, it really takes the pain away from it all together. Adding or removing parts is not a hassle, and the game seems to encourage you to experiment with interesting designs. Changes are instantaneous (no waiting for your pawns to fill a loading bar), and the refunds are 100% of your own material -- so it encourages you to make mistakes without feeling tied to your finite resources. 

Battling is fun and quite simple -- the AI does a good job of taking care of themselves, although you can micro that too if you want. I love switching from the interior to exterior shots to see my crew frantically running around my ship and manning turrets, etc.

It's a great game already with mechanics that are easy to understand but challenging to master. It plays like a cross between Space Engineers and FTL and pulls that off surprisingly slickly. Iterating on your ship's design is both rewarding and forgiving as Cosmoteer is very permissive of extensive redesigns (with copy & paste, mirroring and undo tools) without costing any resources and has an excellent blueprint tool for planning upgrades as you win fights and assimilate your victims into a borg-like fleet of ships. I'm optimistic to see more styles of play emerge as some of the announced changes hopefully land.

The quantity and pace of updates and bugfixes over the past few weeks has been very fast and it's been prioritising the right things. Co-op play is still a little rough around the edges, but I have had a great time playing it with three other friends and we've all sunk dozens of hours into career, multiplayer and creative.

- Game speed can be changed from 1/8 to 8x, which may sound cool but in fact it feels broken. You'll switch the speed frequently (to travel somewhere / salvage wreckages) but it resets back to 1x every time an enemy roams nearby, and that's annoying. I believe it would be much better to make the gameplay more dynamic and keep the speed 1x for everything - currently there's no point in upgrading the thrusters or installing mining lasers, and it is extremely easy to lose your ship at 8x speed
- 2d does no good for this genre. Space is vast and you don't feel it in 2d. You can't see in perspective too, which is not convenient. It harms controls in the worst way possible - you have to zoom and pan constantly, which is especially critical in a battle, and it is hard to keep track of the things nearby. Also transition from real-size ship to its (larger) shape at some zoom level completely breaks the feeling of relativity and you have to pan and zoom (again) to see how far the enemies are and how big are things around you. 2d is probably the main reason why I doubt it is possible to make this game great
- Feels like an arcade, too much. The whole idea of progression in this game is focused around the good old ""fight what you can fight - salvage it - upgrade - repeat"" and when I get bored (happened like 5 times in 4 hours of gameplay), I simply grab 5-10 missions, turn on 8x speed and right-click on the nearest target. In most cases, the target will be destroyed, I'll click to salvage it and then return to the station to sell junk and get rewards. Then repeat until I get enough credits to upgrade the ship and do the same procedure again on a more powerful enemies, questioning myself why I even do that. Just too simple, too automated and too fast - feels like sending a creep in WC3 to chop a tree.
- The only new feature I've spotted is a micromanagement of the ship, where you have to connect everything with corridors and doors. It feels overcomplicated and overbalanced, also not realistic. I understand that it was a game design decision in attempt to make things interesting and to bring in another dimension for the player to care about, but come on - does your crew really needs to walk into an engine thruster and bring in an electricity in a bare hands? I've salvaged thousands of copper wires, why can't I simply connect the neighboring reactor with a weapon and do not watch my 10 people search for doors to drag glowing capsules around? Building the ship is not enjoying for me, and I've played quite a few other games with this feature to compare
- And it looks like there are no other new features this game brings into the scene. It may be good enough for a 2d space commander and may have its way of implementation of the good features you've seen in some other games but, for me, they are questionable enough not to recommend this game",1668740627,1668740627,False,7,2,0.536279976367950439,0,True,False,True

personally my biggest complaint is how tedious it becomes to manage crew and micro battles. (especially rail fanning)
Creating an interface or smart AI to auto adjust crew loads based on custom requested fulfillment would be ideal. Example: I need 20 loader and 30 battery hauler crew, 50 in total. I'd like to set a slider and provide the bunks and a priority list of what crew roles need filled first. As fights happen and crew are lost, less vital crew can then move job assignments to more vital roles that were lost.

The ship building is the highlight so far, though playing the standard game mode & harvesting regularly, you will be upgrading/rebuilding your ship a bit too frequently. There's a decent amount of materials available to ship builders, & plenty more available through the workshop. It's all about finding the right balance of offensive & defensive capabilities, weight/size vs mobility, and micromanaging crew for efficiency - mostly by creating ship layouts that make sense, but also with unique orders. Combat is enjoyable, though you'll find yourself very overleveled & developed earlier on playing on the standard mode (if you're building regularly), so it's best to keep that in mind if you're looking for a challenge.

Current quests include mostly combat (destroy a target/liberate a base), exploration, & delivery. You'll travel between systems looking for more challenging content, though the value of the rewards dries up pretty quick if you take your time to harvest materials & rebuild your ship. The quest content overall is... Passable, at best. Nothing feels particularly memorable, & it doesn't feel like there's enough going on in regards to personnel to make for a Rimworld-like experience, either.

The community is fantastic & helpful/welcoming towards newcomers. The Steam Workshop integration is already offering up a plethora of mods from simple of quality of life tweaks all the way to custom ship parts & unique ship designs, though as always, I'd suggest playing for a while without before jumping in.

As it stands, it's a stunning ship building experience marred by a lack of meaningful questing/gameplay experiences, but what Cosmoteer lacks in content currently is more than made up for by the promise of things to come. Even if the developers were to fail on delivering their vision, the game has built up enough of a fandom that the included workshop support will allow for a bright future regardless. It's a bright start, & a solid recommendation for creative sorts, but if you're looking for a more fleshed out gaming experience, it might be worth holding back for a bit.",1668648940,1668648940,True,139,0,0.903006136417388916,0,True,False,True

I would say this is one of the best games to play if you are new to the sci-fi or ship-building genres, as it allows for a variety of playstyles and ways to go about creating your ship the way you think it needs to be run. My only complaint (and this may just be me being new to the game and not exploring enough) is that sometimes the gameplay is a bit repetitive, go to station, take bounty contracts, hunt bounties, get money, repeat until you have a megaship from the amount of credits you make. There are other ways to earn money and fame, like delivering cargo or exploring the systems, though they come more as a secondary source of income when compared to the bounties.

Some mechanics are already pretty solid, like building your ship, and there is also a good amount of content in this area. 

That said, it lacks on the rest IMO. For example: the gameplay loop can be a bit boring at the moment, as there is lack of mission variety and not much exploration to be done. It's rinse and repeat here, really. Enemy vessels get better as mission levels go up, but they are always the same. The combat also doesn't allow for much strategic creativity, as even though you can rotate your ship to attempt to attack a vessel from behind for example, the AI will always rotate towards you so you end up always having head to head battles in which you either a) aim at the reactor to explode it and finish the battle, or b) aim at the command center if you plan to scavenge it - optionally, you aim at enemy weapons to disable them first",1668564517,1668564752,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Do i recommend? Yes.

It's like a 4X-lite FTL on crack, oozing potential.

What is in the game atm is so well designed, that if it was a more condensed experience, it could easily be a full game already. The reason it's clearly not a finished game is because of the ""open world"" aspect of it, it feels a bit like the X series, without the trading and diplomacy, but with better combat and very intuitive ship building. The OST is also very good, the combat music itself is so strange but so fitting for a sci-fi game.

Biggest con right now is the lack of interaction between you, the factions and inbetween the factions. You, as a player currently is completely besides whatever conflicts might be going on between the factions, beyond a single type of quest where you fight another faction on behalf of a faction, but that only results in temporary ""wanted"" status and you can't really ally yourself with a faction (or become part of one) and become enemies with another faction permanently.

Another con is also that you can make space stations, turret systems etc. but npc's don't interact with them, so there's no economy per se that the player can get involved in, besides going to an NPC spacestation yourself with whatever you've crafted at your space station from ores you got from asteroids.

That said, there is very much the foundation for implementing both an economy the player takes a passive part in and a much deeper diplomacy system. It's not truelly a 4X game yet, but it is definently worth buying into now if you like resource management games like Factorio, or indeed games like FTL.

There are also already mods that sort of fixes some of the problems, like better scaled weapons for late game etc. and with dedicated modding support from the developer, i mean, the cons that exist already have a foundation layed to be fixed and there's already a small but seemingly dedicated modding community, so this is in imo a safe investment even if you'll only play it for a few hours and come back when it has more meat on it.",1668513584,1668514387,True,1,0,0.500638842582702637,0,True,False,True

The game is neat. However, it is still in it's early age and the gameplay loop becomes highly repetitive. Building and revamping your ship is pretty neat and I enjoyed it. Don't expect to get into many fast paced combat, because it's mostly just down to who can hammer the other ship into oblivion first. Scavenge the parts from the destroyed ship, repair, rinse, and repeat.

Currently, I hope that we will see more gameplay added, and a little more depth to the game. But, it's worth the money and is definitely a fun way to spend some time.

--------------------------------OLD REVIEW-------------------------------------------------------------
It seems like an interesting concept, but the controls are abysmal. Ship spins way too fast, and other movement seems sub par. Enemy ships have no problem staying locked onto you, and the view point makes combat insanely unwieldy. I get that it's still in early access, and I hope it gets better, but right now the game is just not what I was expecting from space combat. Even controlling your ship movements is weird in it's hybrid fashion. Or, the starter ships just really suck like nothing has ever sucked before.

Power cords were never invented.

Everything in the game is powered on batteries, and the batteries must be hauled around by your crew members. This is both a blessing and curse for the design of the game. On one hand it turns the game into an actual agent-based simulation of power distribution. On the other hand, contrary to what other people have been saying, this turns the game further away from being a automation and logistic simulation as there's no wiring, no piping, nothing done architecturally other than assignment and placement. In other words, this game is more Rimworld, and less Factorio.

There is another key design choice by the developer that creates most of the color in designing ships: Large reactors are more efficient, both in output, but also in the size of batteries that gets hauled around.

These two things combine to create the central challenge of the game: Distribution of batteries from your crew members. In order to have an efficient ship design, you MUST try to centralize as much as possible around large efficient reactors. You could try to pepper small reactors around everywhere, but you will be causing your crew members to be less efficient. You could pepper large reactors everywhere, but you'd be wasting tons of energy potential and the cost would be astronomical. Striking the balance is key.

Right now in Early Access, the game has two weapons worth designing around... a railgun and ion cannons. These are multi-module weapon systems that can scale up to be superweapons depending on how you build them. It's immensely fun. I just got done building an extremely long double shot railgun ship, with nothing but thrusters with minimal shielding. It survives by maintaining max distance from the target with reverse thrusters and sniping key weak points on the target. 

It's brutally effective and I have cleared out entire level 10 systems with no repair bill afterwards.

On a whole, this game is extremely fun. The satisfaction of making your own ship and having it work is great. The sound effects and explosions get the dopamine flowing. I love zooming in on my target and then, in less than a fraction of a second, having a railgun round arrive from my ship 600m away and seeing the blocks just vaporize all the way to the reactor, and then the reactor blow up... that makes the 2 hour I spent perfecting the ship blueprint all the more worth it. Other ships are just straight up sliced in two from my rails.

I haven't played with the ion cannon system yet, but that also looks like a lot of fun, from the deathstars lasers I've seen. Basically it's a weapon system where you combine beams into one, to make more powerful beams. 

The universe is not as fully fleshed out as other 4x games. It's a bit shallow, but the core parts are working. You can run missions to level up, and then move on to more powerful systems. It doesn't have the open living breathing world feeling... yet. It feels like a linear progression of going to one stage to a more powerful stage.

That's okay for now. It's still tons of fun building ships. This game also has co-op, PVP, and a more industrial side, but I haven't tried it yet because I'm too busy pumping railgun shots into pirates.",1668371881,1668371881,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

I enjoy games like Mindustry & Unrailed, Cosmoteer is an easy go to for short 5 minute sessions. It has time pausing and no time pressured rounds. While I can save anytime and come back I don't want to put it down, lots of fun designing ships to look like my favourite sci-fi shows!

Cosmoteer reminds me of Elite Dangerous with mining, trading, & battling, but in a nice streamlined, less tedious 2D retro style. Different ways to play and progress. Really works well. Costmoteer has more enjoyable and detailed ship designing, more like space engineers but 2D. Its great to collect ore and broken ship parts. I love the ore processing in my ship to make items too! 

Some of the items on the road map concern me (like market price buying / selling), but I bought the game for and enjoy what it is today. 

Overall, glad I bought Cosmoteer and its a game I'll keep coming back to.

I suddenly spent hours on figuring out how to build an optimal ship where your crew is close to its target, I was calculating power consumption, time to target, mass of the ship, required thrusters, etc so the weapons would be capable of shooting continously in longer fights without loosing time due to reloads and power-shortage. 

The other aspects of the game are not really interesting for me, I found the standard loop of the quests boring: same thing with different type of ships, take out x or x+y, mine this, carry that. 

The increasing difficulty in the other hand makes you always re-think your ships and re-design. 
For example: one ship with only cannons and shields with low armor will be melted by lasers and railguns.
If you dont have enough armor, you will be demolished as recharing and spamming shields costs a lot of crew members and it takes time, making lasers and EMPs more effective. 
So its a constant redesigning a ship and figuring out better and better ways to defeat the enemy.

I like these constantly evolving challanges of architecting a ship that is capable of dismantling enemies.
Later you might choose to build a fleet instead of building a big mothership, giving you more options to fight. 

I extremely enjoy the part where I can choose to build a ship that fulfils its purpose then make it look pleasing and fixing its following issues on the go: making it extensible or having rooms to improve. 
I do it everyday as a developer, but its more refreshing in the form of this game.",1668270232,1668270910,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,True

Some notable differences from Classic:

•	By far, the largest change is how ammo production is done. No longer do you plop down an ammo or missile factory and the job’s done. Now you have to account for holding enough basic resources to fill up the factories instead of just energy. Strategically considering volume and tonnage to have enough storage and/or production capacity make designing ammo based weapons have more trade-offs than before. More factories mean more power usage and crew required to run them. However, if you just have storage with no factories, then you risk running out of ammo.

•	Crew can now leave the ship, but can no longer walk through structure pieces. Outside the ship, they are extremely vulnerable and airlocks for separate sections of ships are necessary to ensure they can return if blown out during an explosion.

•	One of the best changes is that roof-mounted turrets can block each other’s LOS. Before, roof turrets literally had no downsides because they could hide behind lots of armor, had no prohibited (unbuildable) zone, and be placed in ways that were far more accessible to crew, ammo, or power.

•	Single-player has seen a ton of improvements. There are tech unlocks, trading, mining, and using resources or money to build parts. Besides the new delivery missions, the combat based ones have more or less stayed the same. However, now it’s not just money as the reward for completing them as you can salvage the defeated enemies' ships as well.

•	There is one change that is controversial in my opinion: vastly reduced doors on crew compartments. This balance decision gets in the way of fun and one of the top workshop mods eliminates this feature. Another mod allows for more doors, but not all the way around as a compromise. I think the latter mod is the way to go forward because building quickly becomes frustrating when nearly everything else is well laid out, but then crew compartment placements get in the way when they have no other purpose in combat except as a gathering point. The worst offender is the crew bunk with 3 door slots but only 1 of those can be used at a time. 

The parts list is still relatively unchanged from Classic. I would like to see some changes to single-player focused parts to allow them to serve a role in combat:

•	The mining laser seems like it has the potential to be turned into a roof-mounted point defense weapon. Right now, it is too ineffective and inefficient to do anything but deal with extremely low-level enemies.

•	Not too sure what could be done about the hyperdrive in combat, maybe temporarily lower the ship’s mass for a quick speed boost or something like that.

•	The capacitor is mostly unchanged from Classic and I feel still pretty useless. Maybe if it could increase the size of batteries stored it might be more worthwhile.

Overall the game is in a great state and the modding community seems pretty active. Galactic Allegiance is back, but I suspect it will take some time before any of the other large ones like ABH make their return.

Cosmoteer has an excellent foundation and is only getting better. I’ve dumped hundreds of hours into the Classic version and I suspect I will dump hundreds more into this version.

However, there are multiple problems with the game that aren't bad enough to not recommend the game, though they definitely decrease the replayability of the game.

First one is the campaign, it lacks a story or goal of some sort. You just cruise through sectors with increased danger doing exactly the same 3 things : killing pirates, saving stations, destroying pirates stations. I mean, I did this for about 5 sectors and I didn't have a single hint of a different kind of mission, it gets boring real fast once you understand how to build a ship capable of destroying anything 1V1. I wish there was a little bit of a story, bosses or more variety of missions in general. If they do exist, in 15 hours I didn't have a clear hint of them.

The second problem is the absence of being able to control the AI. In this game, you cannot (at least I didn't found the option) give control of your ship to an AI. You can't order a ship mining in a sector with a processing station for example. You HAVE to micromanage everything. It really doesn't help that you have a hardcap for crew, which should be (in my opinion) limited to ships and not your whole fleet. I really hope it will come in the future. Right now, I have absolutely no desire/need to build a processing station, the materials aren't a problem at all once you destroy a few pirate stations and recover everything from them to build your ship. And you don't have enough crew to manage it anyway because they are all on your combat ships.

I was excited to buy the game because I thought there would be great, interesting new content to try out.. I was wrong.
The demo is basically the full game. There is really nothing in the game you can't do in the demo, there is no extra tech hidden in the other sectors, no great story to read, no new environment, nada.


[b]If you played the demo for a few hours, you have seen all the game has to offer.[/b]

For more than 20 dollar, this is really disappointing. You could say ""but it's early access"" ... yeah no, I have played the game two years ago and all that has really changed is the addition of resources.


[b]Exploration is basically non-existant.[/b]

There is nothing to explore, no story-line, no environmental mysteries, no characters to get to know, no secret alien technology, ... worse yet every star system plays the same. Also, the quests are only either fetch- or kill-quests, which gets old really fast.


[b]The whole ship building aspect isn't really great either[/b].

For a game that has been in development this long AND advertises it's ship customization as a core feature, the amount of ship customization is laughable.
There is just a handful of actual ship parts and most of them are just a slight stats buff to the smaller version. There is no different armor types, no different energy reactors or engines. It's really just one type and then it's only bigger.

This game has been in development for what, more than six years? Why is there only nuclear reactors? Why no fusion reactors or exotic matter? Why is there only one type of armor? Why is the content updates slower than a drunken snail?


Furthermore, [b]the combat is just really bad[/b].

It's extremely basic, repetitive and mediocre. All you really do is build a ship with as much forward facing weaponry as you can, then you click on the enemy and wait if either them or you get destroyed.

There is no tactic, no flight manouvers, no skill needed, it all boils down to who can fire more weapons faster.
Yes you can build small fast ships, or multiple ships to make a fleet, but why even bother when you can beat every enemy in a single ship using ions or railguns.
And god forbid you get too close, then you get stuck in the enemy and the two of you spin out of control without being able to fire on each other.


Also, it's way overpriced. This game is worth maybe 5 dollar or 10 if you have friends to play it with, but definitely not 20. Wait for a sale or stick with the the demo.

Or just go play Starsector instead, which is superior to this game in every aspect - you just can't build your own ship there, but Cosmoteer doesn't really do it well either.",1668194910,1668237552,False,10,0,0.494551926851272583,0,True,False,True

Things the game does currently well -
1. The ship building system
2. Overall ship variety from sector to sector
3. The difficulty is pretty good depending on your fleet composition
4. Graphics are done well
5, Gives me a real expanse vibe sometimes with some of the logics and combat mechanics
6. The combat feels punchy, the fights at times feel very winnable or loseable at the same exact time
7. I like the ability to create multiple ships and have different roles, I do wish however the fleet mechanics were better

What the game doesn't get well
1. Boring sector to sector, possibly something like a boss ship or big fight or something more
2. Railguns, for some reason I just don't think they pack a railgun esq punch and to me feel off
3. The game really hinders you if you do not do fleets of ships and fleet mechanics are ABSOLUTELY aweful
4. Damn ship movements, there is a ""avoid objects"" but that barely works and its just horrible altogether
5. The sector stations being immediately under attack and the stations literally unable to fight off a fly. There is a balancing act that needs to be done there and fast as the stations themselves are a great way to level up but is hindered by this dumb system of insta attack with railguns and stations dying immediately almost

Would I recommend this game? Yes, I got my monies worth and am excited for the future of this game.

evenings spend researching build strategies.
quick test build in creative, 4h gone.
first stage of early access.

building is easy to understand, but has a big depth already. crew management is vital but not micro intensive because they work on their own.
carreer might need some variety, but carreer 2.0 is part of the roadmap.
so are drone carriers. hinges for transforming ships. more weapons. boarding ships. i am ready.
there is also apparently a competitive scene, i could have never imagined something like this for a creative sandbox ship building game. but now i can, and i am intrigued by that as well.
if this keeps up, even if the game would stay as it is, it's a winner.

so in 7 days I racked up 97.1 hours on this game. I have spent every waking minute and every minute not sleeping thinking how to improve build new and make more. The game really has so much to it and so much more promised I am so highly expecting and when you learn to build ships at a 45 Degree angle and really start improving all sorts of dynamics.

The good it's a amazing game! the bad if you are like me and really go into it and play career and build many things the game even with a 3080 graphics card and all out decked computer it can start to have lag spikes as in load times to render just everything going on. That being said it happens intermittently like it needs to catch up and load it all.

If you are a casual player and not going all out than you probably not notice this that much. Even with this small drawback I still am not able to put it down. You want to build the best ship that is under 1 million and can outmatch other ships the same class that does not use nukes? Yeah still working on it. It's a never ending process of ship building and tactics and I love it!

Big ships are fun as well but it does not have the same tactics and strategies try having 10 ships face 10 other ships 3 levels higher level and see how that fight goes if your ship is not fully optimized to every man and ever square and every step one of your crew take is not in the direction of a positive outcome you wasted resources and it is all down hill from that point. Or what happens if a crew member dies and you had optimized it so to perfection you forget to give a 2nd or 3rd back up to cover his job and so you fail because they didn't pick up someone else's duties. Or wrong placed armor or too much armor making you slow in combat and not able to strafe dodge or move out the way in time from a incoming onslaught of nukes. Yeah every aspect of this when you put enough time into this is amazing.

My only complaint is there is no support for smaller ships like fighters, no proper support for carriers (you can make them using the explosive decouplers but its a bit of a nightmare), and no support for boarding actions. however in the roadmap they claim to plan on adding support for drone carriers and boarding actions, as well as docking. which pretty much covers everything i wish i had

- The control scheme is fairly slick.
- The game doesn't really waste your time and you can get right into the action.
- Component positioning actually matters.
- The weapon and component selection may seem a little limited, but everything has its niche.
- There's some ultralight factory- and supply-chain-building.
- Crew management is neat.

But on the downside:
- The single-player campaign is a little too basic and repetitive and the progression revolves mostly around enlarging your ship, there being no realistic way to go small. You might build up a fleet of ships instead of one single ship, but so far I couldn't see a practical point to it.
- The game mechanics encourage building very strange looking ships, most egregiously ships with inward-pointing thrusters so that the outside can be armored. There are other counterintuitive issues with the 2D building, like a spinal railgun separating your ship into two halves because your crew cannot traverse over or under the railgun.
- Crew have to manually carry everything and even power is stored in batteries that need to be transported by hand rather than through, you know, pipes and cables. It makes sense in terms of game design, but it keeps feeling silly.

Overall I find myself disappointed. There's good here, but the immersion is so thoroughly spoiled by little things that I'm not enjoying myself.

If I could suggest some easy fixes:
* Require infinite clearance for all thrusters.
* Add a railgun-overpass component that does not buff the railgun but allows for crew to pass through it.

The ship building can be fun although you're almost entirely limited by crew so it's not really realistic to be building more of your ship out after every battle and the economy feels pretty tight such that experimentation feels kind of limited.

But do you remember when you finished unlocking all of the ships? You played with each one over and over, and after a while, you wanted more. But there wasn't anymore ships...

Well now there is. Here is all of the other ships you never had that chance to play with, You even get to control your ship directly! Or a fleet if you're so inclined~ There's a lot of intricate controls you can fiddle with to your heart's content.
On the downside though, your crew are only humans, and you can't teach these dogs any new tricks. (I hate myself for that, I'm sorry.) Encounters are nothing special, you're just doing missions for this big ol' station, while you try every trick in the book to convince the people inside it your ship actually IS cool enough to get on... (There IS factions, though, nothing too much about them atm, though, just ships.)

Some things that I noticed while playing which I wish would get better in the future are:
Because asteroids are just very heavy but destructible objects, ships will rather try to push them away and keep following the route instead of backing away and flying around the asteroid. This is especially bad when flying in formation... ships just get stuck a lot.
Also I wish it would be easier to attack neutral faction ships because of missions to destroy said ships.
And I think sll cannons in generell need a buff, it feels like energy weapons just outrange and outclass them every time.

Beautiful game tho, it really got me hooked and destroying enemies is extremly addicting",1667988599,1667988599,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Though I recommend this as a game to dump an hour or two into before work it does have a few rough spots here and there. One of the more noticeable things is that it gets very repetitive over time and thats due to quite a few things actually:
- Theres no real gain nor downside to destroying a faction station/'siding' with a faction via a mission
- You can buy every tech 'blueprint' in the first system alone, making progression in other systems pointless
- Fame is only really used to affect the number of crew members you can buy, which is honestly fine how it is just it feels a bit too unused
- Mining and manufacturing is quite a bit useless because you earn enough money to buy components from stations, of which they seem to be plenty stocked with

Cosmoteer got starship designing bang on. It doesn't take hours to build a functioning ship like many of the other games. You can get a ship up and running in moments (thanks mostly to the designers decision to make building and decontstructing instantaneous). This allows the main gameplay to focus on the funner aspects of space combat, resource harvesting, and questing. 

Changing/Upgrading an existing ship (thanks to cut/paste tools and blueprint mode) is similarly quick and easy, so you don't really ever get stuck in a badly designed ship that you feel is hard to recover from.

The updates are happening all the time and look forward to where this thing is headed.
It's got tons of potential.

I played something similar years ago on android but it was a lot more shallow but still very enjoyable.

I mostly like the ship building aspects.
years ago I used to make up lego space ships with some better lego pieces.
I would spend hours building it and would keep it around and tweak and change it before eventually breaking it all down and starting a new project to rinse and repeat.
This game pushes the same buttons for me.
I have quite the eye for detail and efficiency so my in game ship is in a constant state of evolution and tweak-age.
It's large heavy weapons platform with lots of storage and engines, it quickly became a beast and naturally grew in to a beetle shape without the intention of making it look like one.
Natures perfection repeats.

My current 34 hours is from 3 sessions. (yes, really)
 I all nightered the first session,
 Insta hooked after a very short learning curve. 
This game got me lost in space!




...as a side note, I didn't want to pay 18 quid at first.
I suppose I already had my worth though, and I am glad I spent the cash.

Bad because there are little design flaws when building ships or trying to use your favourite designs from the previous version. Hyper-jumps are sketchy. You need a jump station just to do it.

Bigger ships are cool if it doesn't crash, Stations would be useful for resource manufacturing, and multiple ships are acquired by salvaging derelict abandon vessels throughout space. A shipyard you can build to build ships would be nice. And the constant pursuit of running pirates gets boring fast. Enemies that attack you would be exciting rather than going out and looking for a fight. Fleet battles among nations would be cool. The game needs more military tactics rather than focusing on primarily on salvage and destroy and salvage some more.

The bigger your ship gets, the more it can handle in terms of mining, firepower, and attacks against it, but the inner workings of the ship get more and more complicated the bigger your ship gets, and you end up having to consider placement of everything you build, whilst also trying to make your ship look badass. I designed a ship early game in the blueprint designer (another incredible tool they give you) and guys, it looked fucking badass. I couldnt wait to get the resources to build it. Well, I got all the resources, after many fights and asteroids pilllaged, converted the blueprint into the ship (one click, again, amazing), and took it on a test ride. I'd designed my internals so badly that the thing got blown up by a level 2 ship. Embarrassingly I had called this blueprint for the ship the ""EarlyGameDestroyer"". The only thing getting destroyed was itself.

I then spent a lot of time rebuilding the ship with a different design and really focused on the internals. It looked good, but not as good as before, but jesus christ it is a death machine now. Taking out multiple level 4 ships no problem, even taking on individual level 6 and 7s without too many issues.

…as long as that’s all you like doing. And that’s okay. Maybe. For now.

The Good
Absurdly deep ship construction mechanisms. Right down to “which way does the door out of the barracks face” and “which way do you want people working this job to run.” Some copy-and-paste mechanisms and some mirror mechanisms help with the QOL on ship design.
While relatively simplistic visually, the explosions when you take up someone’s reactor core or the way a ship shears in half with a sufficient impactor is deeply satisfying. Watch chunks of ship spin off in different directions and the poor bastards who were in that chunk spin as well. 
Significantly different offensive strategies exist. Stand-back-and-snipe (railguns), one-massive-beam-of-doom (ion beams), and lots of traditional cannons/lasers exist as well. 
Significantly different defensive strategies exist. The difference between small shields and large shields is not zero, and the different between thick armor, layered armor, or swiss-cheese-style armor is also not zero. 
You can make downright pretty ships. Paint it, color it, slap some skulls and bones on it, go to town. The game itself comes with a remarkably wide range of premade ships that you’ll face, which is pretty cool.

The MEH
The economic model in the game is… well. The game’s early access, and this clearly isn’t a focus yet. You CAN mine and you CAN build your own ship parts… but it’s generally not time/player-input-efficient to do so. Just keep blowing up ships and sending your salvaging ship along behind and you’ll overrun what stations can hold soon enough. Money is never really a problem after your salvager ship comes online. Yes, you CAN factory ship and mine ship… but unless that’s your kick… there’s zero real reason to do so.
So while there ARE lots of different strategies for combat… they are decidedly unequal. Rail-sniping, provided the ship is designed properly, is pretty much a right answer. Especially in PvE, rail sniping punches way, way above its weight. If your ship is slower than a rail sniper, you’ll die eventually. Ion beams are the vogue in PvE, but that’s more because they’re tremendously fun and easy to use than a balance issue. (Now mind you, for PvE, that’s fine, and that’s why this is a “meh” and not a “bad” - but there are real balance issues here.) Realistically, anything that isn’t ion or rail is probably way sub-par, although I suspect a rapid-orbiting deck gun vessel might do well. 
Career mode’s solar systems are very, very predictable. This is an early-access issue, no doubt, but it’s pretty blatant for now.
Resource acquisition for building new ships in career mode in general is a little thin and hassle-filled.

The Bad
Career mode in general is very, very content thin. Fly to X location. Blow up ship. Fly to Y location. Blow up ship. Sometimes it’s three ships. Sometimes it’s a station (which is just an immobile ship.) Sometimes it’s blow-up-a-ship-before-another-ship-dies. When you’re done with a sector, move to another one where you do exactly the same thing with bigger ships. Now again *this is a temporary, early-access issue* but, again, for now, it’s a real issue. Unless you’re someone who doesn’t mind this kind of thing, you’ll run into repetitive content issues by sector three at the most.
The ship design system, for all its glory, still needs more QoL and love. We have blueprints, but we need to be able to design subsections that we can quickly cut and paste.
It can be very difficult to determine why your people are inefficient at times. You end up studying their movements on 8x speed too often.
Many combat features are poorly documented. The reddit is full of “always check the hamburger menu.” The tutorial, while not bad, is definitely not up to the task of the game’s mighty potential. In most games, it’d be a great tutorial - in this one, it’s a clydesdale trying to haul the Titanic. 
I think I’ll surprise and offend some players with this, but: the weapons need more variety. Missiles are too much of a hassle to be used as a primary weapon system, and that leaves you with either projectiles or ion beams. Technically there’s ammunition weapons and projectile weapons, but functionally, lasers and cannons do the same thing and can be intercepted the same way. (The same way you intercept missiles, come to that.) Disruptors (emp lasers, basically) represent a possible route, but we only get one pathetic version of those. Only specialized rush-in ships use those at all.
Speaking of specialized ships, the fleet controls are non-existent/terrible/badly in need of improvement. Mining ships would be a lot more popular if there was a mining AI. Salvaging ships would see a lot more use if I didn’t have to manually fly them everywhere and order them to manually salvage. Using multiple ships in combat isn’t impossible, but I’d hate to try it in PvP, and it’s not easy or smooth to do in any case.

Verdict
Cosmoteer is a game that’s going places - but it definitely still needs time to go there. The core “build ship, make things go boom” is awesome. The balance and variety isn’t - but we’d expect that at this stage. The career mode is paltry - but we’d expect that, too. As long as the promised potential is fulfilled - more variety, more balance, more things to do, and hopefully some frickin’ automation - this game has potential to go quite big indeed. For now? Pick it up on sale, plan to spend a weekend getting familiar with it, and then plan to table it for a dozen patches or so.

Has a bit of faction/territory interactions but it's main focus seems to be mainly resource management/ship design. It's main choke point does have it's basis on reputation which is where you get access to more crew members, what you need in order to operate your ships effectively/efficiently. It does require materials to build but all of that can be mined, salvaged or purchased from stations.

In effect, the only thing that holds your progress back is how much crew you have and how effectively you use them. It has a very in depth crew management system and can be adjusted to the N'th degree. But this has one of my biggest glaring problems/gripes about the game in general. Power management: why does crew use batteries to power all the ship systems? This make zero sense to me, The systems already generate only so much power over time but it also needs to be carried manually to what needs it via crew.

Next issue i have is repairs, just a one click repair all out of combat as long as you have the resources for the parts damaged. Why not have crew handle this area too? Why not restrict one click repair all to proximity to stations? Would make way more sense to me.

All that said, the game is fun to play for a while, it has enough content to cover the costs but perhaps better to wait for more to be developed and/or for a sale.",1667855189,1667855189,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

It is a forward facing attack frigate. Large shield protected by smaller inner shields with 2 layers of armor all around its designed for quick attacks. I added a railgun ship as well, which is great at sniping enemies before they get close enough to the main command ship. The Mk2 version of my railgun ship, which includes 2 railguns with 7x accelerators just got built. After modifying and testing the ship is finally ready for the MK2 moniker and can go out on missions now.

Railguns.Are.So.Freaking.Cool! The sound they make when they fire is unique (and sounds so cool) and I know when I hear the MK1 or now the MK2 fire off BOTH its railguns in quick succession I know somebody is going to have a bad day. I cant tell you how many times my command ship is getting pummeled and the Railguns save the day. There are times where I have rotated my command chip to face my heavy armored side against the enemy fire to give my shield time to recharge, but I notice another ship almost in firing range heading right for me. Crap, this is not good. Then that ""sound""...sweet sweet railgun sound, as an extreme velocity white streak whooshes into the first ship, slamming into its armored side. That wasnt exactly what I was aiming for and this ship is quickly chewing through the armor, about to hit juicy innards of my ship with its multitudes of cannons. Then another railgun shot hits destroying 1 of its reactors, which the subsequent explosion rips off half the ship, including a battery of 2 cannons attached to it. This is quickly followed by another railgun shot from the same  MK2 right into the ships cockpit. Its almost as if its putting the wounded ship out of its misery. Deadly accurate and fast. Suddenly a 4th railgun goes off as the MK1 hits dead center on the 2nd approaching ships reactor, right before it can engage me. The ship splits in 4 parts and no longer a threat.

Exactly what I was wanting from a ship building game. Easy to learn, hard to master. I'm going to make a Star Destroyer. Not yet, it will cost a ton of resources. It's my end game. But I will do it, and it will be awesome. This is why this game is amazing.

* Me ha gustado:
- Gran QoL en interfaces y controles. 
- La construcción, gestión de la nave y de la tripulación me han parecido muy cómodas y ligeras (no suele ser común en este tipo de juegos).
- El ritmo de juego en general también es rápido y directo.
- La variedad de piezas creo que está equilibrada para que no sea un juego con poco contenido y para que no sea un juego abrumador.
- En resumen, parece que los desarrolladores han tenido mucho habilidad para balancear el juego en ritmo y complejidad.

* No me ha gustado:
- Es el típico juego de construcción en cuadrículas en el que puedes lograr mucha más ventaja construyendo la nave para atacar en diagonal (esto es común en este tipo de juegos), incluso da la opción de cambiar los controles para moverte en una dirección diagonal en concreto. Esto es algo que siempre me ha parecido un exploit... manías personales.
- No he visto mecánicas de respawn de enemigos (y creo que tampoco de asteroides, aunque de estos hay más cantidad), lo que se vuelve un problema si llegado un punto has realizado todas las misiones de una zona pero no has logrado reunir los recursos necesarios para hacerte más fuerte y pasar a la siguiente (o los has gastado en cosas secundarias, como hice yo construyendo un gran almacén nada más empezar :). 
- Parece que los componentes más complejos del nivel actual están pensados para obtenerlos de los enemigos, dado que las fábricas para construirlos se obtienen a niveles superiores. Esto hace poco viable la minería/fabricación para avanzar sustancialmente, quedando los enemigos como fuente principal de recursos. Esto, unido al punto anterior, es un problema. 

* Mi voto
- Es un juego intencionadamente rápido y sencillo, pero personalmente me gustan los juegos algo más complejos, quizás con más combinaciones para el combate.
- Personalmente no llevo muy bien que en los juegos de recursos estos sean finitos a corto/medio plazo. Y en este juego, para mí, es el principal problema. 
- Aunque a mí no me enganche, le daría un voto positivo, porque creo que es un buen juego, pero actualmente tiene un ""overwhelmingly positive"", y creo tampoco merece tanto.",1667720626,1667720850,False,1,0,0.436108201742172241,0,True,False,True

There is a more in depth strategic layer, but ultimately the actual mechanics of how the ships work I think are a bit limited. Ideally you want to maximise range and mobility and that means ion beams, which also are impossible to dodge. So you should just build the ship with an ion beam and lots of engines and then every fight is just kiting the enemy and beaming them to death as they can't fight back. Anything that puts you in range of enemy disruptor weapons is to be avoided because they will bypass shields and shut down energy weapons and systems, which means that your ship will incur needless damage which impedes your progression as the game incentivizes destroying enemies without taking damage because you have to pay for repairs with the same currency you use to buy everything else. 

The industry elements are... well there's nothing wrong with them I guess but they all work the same way and it's just flying to asteroids and drag selecting them to mine them and then paying a lot of money to get the industry elements that make them into slightly more valuable components, there are a lot of assets involved but the gameplay doesn't change, it's just dumping money into the problem in exchange for making slightly more money on mining and eventually making your own components for cheaper than you can buy them, but babysitting your mining ships is very tedious work while also requiring virtually no engagement.

Honestly if you played the old free demo version I don't know that this is a great deal different fundamentally, I don't even know if there are any new ship parts, and while there is a big strategic map to explore you can unlock basically all the content in the first system so there isn't really a reason to play it much further than that? It feels like the game doesn't really know how to solve these issues, and maybe doesn't even see them as issues, but I think there are some pretty big issues with how the game is designed that leave it feeling quite shallow for something that nominally is quite complex. There is a lot of possible variety for how you choose to draw out your ship, but not very much actual complexity in how it works, how the combat works, and what is the optimal approach to maximise your progression in the game.",1667691836,1667691836,False,11,0,0.585993766784667969,0,True,False,True

Summary: A game with a lot of potential.

PROS:
- Reasonable map big enough to have fun with
- Multiple choice of component for your ship and many way to make it unique or to adapt it to your tactics (bigger is better, but it has drawback) 
- Fun because it's always fun to build a ship and roam in space with it 
-Hard... check guides and tutorials because you'll be destroy

CONS:
- Industrial path feels empty after a wile, maybe it's not this kind of game. Suggestion: Auto mining platform or ship; way to spend money on (reputation, fame, mercenary, temporary boost, etc); ships offering/buying  resources at unique prices (or different than platform)
- Beginning can be frustrating because a lot of parameters have massive impact on gameplay or QoL (fabricators not emptying  or using resources for example)
- No goal or lore (perhaps due to early version...) 
- Systems, once cleared, feel dead. Suggestion: some pirates should spawn constantly and randomly
- Nothing to do with faction reputation. Suggestion: unique weapon variants or better price",1667611100,1667611100,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

This game certainly will not be for everyone. It, however, gave me a lot of game play I have been looking for, and even a few things I did not know I wanted. 

Being able to build and design your own ships, and fairly quickly your own fleet, to tackle any issues you can think of is just wonderful. 

I started with a beginner ship and started upgrading it to be an all around ship. Quickly, my crew limit started to hold me back. So I decided it was time to try making new ships. I started with a miner, and from there I couldn't stop. Immediately I wanted a cargo ship to fulfill my hoarder tendency. I went out and explored a new system and decided to take a destroyed raider craft back home and add it to my fleet.

Battles:

The good
The battles are still very satisfying, with meaty explosions and the added effect of ships spewing coils, ammo and other resources as they take direct hits.  

The bad
Detection seems like an odd one. If you invest in a sensor, your range is large. But then the enemy spots you at that larger range also (you would think only ships with the right sensors would detect specific ranges).

Campaign:
You now have to gather materials and hire crew at outposts. trade goods and complete missions to earn money (or mine). Giving players a plethora of ways to progress in the universe.

The good:
Very satisfying campaign, going on pirate raids and bounty hunting, picking up the loot of damaged/abandoned ships along the way.

The bad: 
Mining seems to be a slower approach. Raw materials are cheap to sell and refinery blueprints are expensive relative to a users' progress. As you progress through different star systems, the enemy gets stronger. Meaning more mass has to be devoted to defense and defense weaponry.  This doesn't sound bad at first but becomes a painful problem for miners as the game progresses. 
A stealth tech tree would mitigate this. (camo armour reducing enemy intercept range while you can still see them on your sensors basically).

Overall:
A fantastic game. I've already sunk too many hours into this and I've only scratched the surface. Recommended.

*edit* after 27 hours - Not sure what the end game is supposed to be. Or if there's a plot really? 

There's some issue with small ships being like impossible to kill torpedoes that ram up into the side of you and drill into your core and there's nothing you can do to stop them. 

Also some ships will match your speed perfectly at all times and shoot you from outside your range, but there's no way to tell your ship to do that to them with similar armament as far as I can tell. 

Telling my ship to open fire on another ship makes it always charge headlong and ram, even if I'm using a rail gun.

This experience was alot less of the way it is now and so much more like the way that it was, which isn't a bad thing but it is what it is.  

What can be said about a topic such as Cosmoteer in such a short amount of time? There are so many things to discuss, like first time use, proper care, maintenance, and storage of Cosmoteer. There are so many things about Cosmoteer that it cannot be summed up in such a short amount of time. That leads us to the Big Question: Is Cosmoteer for you? If I cannot see myself, does that mean I do not exist? If you are a person that enjoys things like Cosmoteer, then maybe Cosmoteer is for you. If not, then perhaps a financial commitment to the experience is not appropriate at this point in time. It is often helpful to turn to close friends and immediate family to aid in situations such as this where a decision cannot be reached in such a short amount of time.

The big takeaway is this: if you are looking for an experience that really suits a need in a short amount of time, then look no further; Cosmoteer is an experience.

Honestly surprised by how much I have enjoyed this game thus far. My cousin told me about it seeing that it had coop, yet at first I was intimidated by the sheer amount/size of constructions you could make for your ship(s). Also did not realize at first that you could have multiple custom designed ships. After I watched a YouTube video of two guys playing the game in coop, however, I knew I wanted the game. I was five minutes into the video when I decided to close it and head to the Steam Page to make my purchase. After playing it for a few hours I was surprised by how simple building a ship was. I set forth with making a giant, all-rounder ship that could do all tasks set for it yet did not excel in any areas, and later started building fleets of cheap simplistic ships as well as highly specialized combat, mining, and scouting ships. Everything seemed to flow together quite naturally and organically.

I've SWORE never to buy another EA title after wasting hundreds if not thousands of dollars for games that never got finished, but when someone promises ""rimworld meets factorio"", well... I can't say no :)

The truth is that it's nowhere near that level. Maybe 3 to 4 years away. As it stands, it's more of a very advanced, evolved version of ""Captain Forever"" meets Elite 1984 edition . And you know what? That's OKAY! It's fun, it's well designed, and even in its very early EA stage it feels like something you could play for hours before getting bored. 

That being said, you have to remember that at this point you're essentially spending 17 pounds (20 bucks) to support a 'vision' from a developer. I feel comfortable doing that based on what's on offer here, even though it's on the expensive side (rimworld was crazy expensive when it first came out before steam, after all). But you might not be. So what do you get:

- A top down ship fighting system which as I mentionned is identical to ""captain forever"".
- A mission system to gain credits which unlocks various structures for your to build
- A pretty decent build system with the usual trapping, albeit very barebone
- Access to a limited amount of resources types
- Barebone crew management amusingly called ""red shirts""
- A progression system that feels like it could probably last 30 hours before it gets kinda stuck (I'll find out)

If you expect something like rimworld, or factorio or either, don't. Rimworld has been in active development with millions of dollars in funding for over 9 years now. This literally JUST came out. Like I said, you're buying into a vision, and you're given an alpha, a taste if you will, of what the full game might be like when it eventually comes out

If you're confortable with that, go for it. it's engaging, fun and addictive. It shows a lot of promise and I hope they stick to the roadmap but also far beyond to bring it to the heights they are aiming for.

Building your ship is just so compelling, with every choice having pros and cons.  You can optimize forever, but there is no perfect ship, meaning the variety of high-performance ships you can build is astronomical.

The new campaign introduced in early access adds a lot but IMO needs a few adjustments.  Resource management is very cool and interesting but can also be frustrating and finicky (especially after visiting every station in the star system only to find none of them have any diamonds for sale).  The need for cargo bays makes your ships feel a lot more bloated than before.  And, with crew size locked behind ""reputation"" it quickly becomes the bottleneck for how large and how many ships you can build.  (While that limitation can be frustrating it also prevents you from staying too long ""grinding"" lower level opponents which is good.)

It seems intuitive to build separate ""combat"" and ""mining/storage"" ships, but since the crew size limit applies across all ships, it's not really viable - either you take too many crew away from combat ships, or you have such a small crew on the mining/storage ship that it takes forever to collect resources.  This forces both functions to be combined in the same ship so that the full crew is available for both tasks.

- Be more generous with the amount of crew one can acquire.

- Add a component called Magazine for ammo which works similar to the current engine room except for turrets.
- Be able to allocate specific tasks to fleet ships and have them perform those tasks automously (i.e. mine astroids in area, make parts and sell them, escort vessel etc - for those looking for a more combat / build experience)

Early game is great, very polished (so far at least).

See others comments for feedback which seems to be very positive for multiplayer. Not overly grindy and the battles are fun and unpredictable. Actually reasonably difficult depending on level and how many other ships you take on. I notice at some points my ship would clang and explode... but maybe that's due to fire or mines or post-battle neglect ... i'm sure I will figure it out :) You will find auto-saves handy. Building your ship is simple in concept, yet complex in design such that you can optimise resource paths to each block to improve your overall survivability. The tutorials are well balanced and not overly painful to read.  The game could benefit from more of a RPG style comms with AI, but then not sure if that's the intent of this game... 

Anyways, its priced fair and a bunch of fun... Looking forward to see how the game develops further.

I've yet to encounter a bug, there are a lot of really well done quality of life features, everything works how it seems it should work, the content that is there is amazing and it's fun. It's FTL-like in the sense that you can target specific parts of enemy ships and that ships rely on the various systems to function, so targeting just the power or cockpit can work.

 One of the best parts is that when you replace parts of your ship in a redesign you don't lose any money or resources, its a full refund. This means you can experiment endlessly and make your ship better, you can also do this anywhere if you have the funds and resources, no need to fly back to a dockyard. 

I really can't give this game high enough praise, if you like FTL, Space Engineers, Empyrion, or any game that lets you fly/design ships then stop thinking about it and buy it now!!

Spent several hours doing combat, then started putting factories in my ship and spent a bunch more hours doing mining and other things. Now I have a bigger more powerful ship and am going back to combat - amazing gameloop.

DEVELOPER SUPPORTS MODDING!!!

Modding is easy and powerful. If developer support for modding continues to grow, I think we'll see something on the order of Factorio here.

This is an absolute win of a project.

I just like building ships in sandbox mode. A good little feature is definetly the descriptions that you can give ships, because it's very nice for storytelling. I'd love some kind of scenario creator or custom career creator. Mining/Salvaging is fun too.
Modding is also very good in this game. At the point of writing the workshop is very empty, but i am pretty sure that the big mods are going to get ported from classic and brought onto the steam workshop and these mods are pretty cool, they add so many new parts.

Ever since I found out about it, it was already easily in my top 5 favorite games of all time and the official steam release might just be my favorite game of all time.
   It is a Sandbox game, that allows you to not only customize, but also make your own spaceship from scratch, with no limit to imagination or restriction what so ever, intuitive tools that seem simple to use, but lack no depth and provide nearly infinite ways of further improving your vessel and very good physics engine for those said ships to boot.
   If you are even a slight fan of Sandbox games, or Science Fiction, or both, then this is most likely a perfect game for you. There is so much whimsy to be had here, from making any kind of spaceship, a base, or an entire freaking galaxy of your liking, to enjoying the great campaign mode alone or with your friends, challenging others in PvP matches, learning how to become an expert ship designer and commander and so on and so forth. 
   Not only that, but the role-playing capabilities of this game are almost as limitless as the ship building ones. You can do whatever you want, from building your own custom faction, to making your own lore and much, much more.

   ...In conclusion, Cosmoteer is a phenomenal game. I didn't go over the core mechanics of the game that make it what it is, but I don't think that's even necessary. The music fits with the game perfectly and is adaptive to player input, the aforementioned ship-building and customizing tools are simple to access for anybody, but take a ton of skill to master, the physics and handling are great and forgiving, the campaign mode is downright addictive, the modules are all near-perfectly balanced, the options menu has thousands of things to choose from and allow you the complete customization of all the key bindings, graphics, gameplay, many colorblind options and etc, the game has a pre-built GIF recorder, has translations for almost every single major language and much, much more that you will be able to experience yourself if you download the game. 
   If you're still concerned about buying the game, then feel free to try out the demo version which shows off every single base mechanic together with the early game of career.",1667230214,1667230214,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

The thing is, it's still your original frigate. The gameplay loop is as follows: you do missions, you blow up ships, harvest their carcasses, get the rewards. When you have enough money and 'stuff', you buy better tech and re-outfit your ship. And you will do that again, and again, and again. OK, that doesn't sound very convincing, but the game process is very addicting. But in the end, that's all there is to it.

The developer has tried to add some tactical options to the battles (and they might become useful if you have more than one ship) but really, you just need bigger and badder weapons and you will win. If not, you will lose.

For now, the only way to get another ship is to find a derelict, or disable an enemy ship (hard to do). It seems like one should be able to buy ships from the stations, but that's not possible. Anyway, in the end, you will have to do the whole missions/money/stuff/upgrade thing on 2 ships instead of one.

I don't see any trace of a story yet. I think it needs one to keep you going.

I'm not convinced by the whole 'infinite mod your ship', because it never really becomes your ship, as opposed to a ship with X number of hardpoints that can accept type Y and Z weapons and that's it. For example, you can paint your ship. But with every modification or addition, you'll ""have to"" paint it again, assuming you want to do that. As I said, it never becomes 'your ship'. It's continually morphing.

Still, it says I have 23 hours in it, so hey, I got my money's worth, and I had fun. Still, this needs more EA time in the oven. WAIT TO BUY.",1667228335,1667228335,True,3,0,0.562071681022644043,0,True,False,True

You brawl with the other ships. Get famous, more people want to join your crew, build a bigger ship (or more ships).
You think your ship is good enough, get wrecked in another system.
You design a different ship layout, retry.
Repeat.

While the universe is procedurally generated, As far as I can tell, the universe itself is stand still. There is no NPC expansion or invading each other. Even the pirate doesn't respawn. If you already cleared a star map with the bounties, there is nothing left to do there. 

That said, even with that the current gameplay loop itself is already fun. Especially trying a different layout to counter harder enemies. My wish is that the NPC ship would feel alive by expanding its influence or jumping to another system like in SPAZ 2 or Space Ranger or any 2D space game out there, which makes the universe more immersive. But considering this has multiplayer, I'm not sure if both concepts could work (but then again, Drox Operative 2 has multiplayer and a living world, which should work). Do note that this is an Early Access gameand pretty much it is showing a proof of concept. I'm looking forward for the future.

The player is burdened with resources whereas the computer players are not.  If the computer has infinite ammo so should the player.

There's also a disturbing lack of intelligence with your crew.  Randomly leaving post even when they are part of a group that has priority 10 (the maximum) on that post.

Shooting on behalf of the player the AI is significantly worse as well.  I've had weapons not engage in entire battles, despite the enemy being right in front.  Also, what's the range of a missile?  Is it the same as every other weapon?  Curious.

Also have seen AI ships with one small reactor and 6 or 7 guns.  That's a pretty badass reactor.
Not having the same set rules between player and AI all while they outnumber you in every circumstance is just poor game design.

I bought it five days ago (thankfully while on vacation) and somehow managed to play 60 hours nonstop. How did it come to eat my life? It all comes down to Walt's inspired game design. Cosmoteer is equal parts:

- Space exploration. Pretty straightforward 2D sector maps making a web of a galaxy. Thankfully you can spend fuel to warp inter- and intra- maps. Simple reputation with a handful of NPC factions that war with each other. This is the least impressive aspect of the game but it works.
- City building. The ships evolve quickly as your economy grows and the challenge of optimizing them grows just as fast. Each top tier weapon requires a unique layout approach in order to maximize its power. Weight, thrust, firepower, defenses, storage, production, and crew logistics all have to be carefully balanced against each other. 
- Tactical naval battles. It's always great when games are funner on higher difficulties. One wrong move reveals your ship's weakness and it goes kaboom in a matter of seconds. But nothing is more rewarding than the big-assplosion signifying your own perfectly executed strategy. Be prepared to do a lot of quick-loading on the highest difficulty. Locking crew recruitment behind ""quest"" progress means you can't out-grind the difficulty curve. Some of the NPC ships will scare the scrap out of you but each one has an identifiable weakness to exploit. Truly thrilling victories lie in store.

I've yet to dabble in multiplayer but I'm starting to the get the hang of this game. Maybe there's a persistent server out there I could join? Probably too CPU-intensive. We'll see. There are a handful of mods on the workshop but unfortunately nothing from the ~5 years it spent in Alpha has been ported over yet.

Decent sound design - soundtrack is nothing to write home about, but is fairly unique and has its own personality. However, there aren't many tracks and you're likely to hear them all in a short amount of time.  

Art and assets are unique and cohesive. 

Gameplay has potential for depth that is unfortunately unrealized at this time.

[h1] CONS: [/h1] 
Shipbuilding: This is probably why you'd buy the game. ""Intuitive ship design controls"" could not be further from the truth. I am not new to the genre, nor to control schemes, and can confidently say this is one of the LEAST intuitive design schemes I have ever seen. It's clunky, the keybindings are frankly horrid - (ctrl + , to rotate, for example) - Moving parts around is likely to delete them, and they must remain connected to the ship at all times. Placing doors will automatically remove other doors. Parts may lose function for reasons that are not immediately apparent. Games like Reassembly are worlds ahead in UI design. 

The largest gripe I have is that all ship modules need doors to connect to corridors to receive power and ammo, etc - and all modules have a fixed door location you can rotate. The game has the option to add doors, but you can only put them where the game designates doors can go - which is almost always one side of a square. This essentially making the ability to add doors next to useless, as well as restricting all ship designs to ""A long hallway connected to rooms"". [b]ADDITION:[/b] I am, and was, aware that you can rotate modules with right click. 

Gameplay: Combat is binary and uninteresting. Effectively-  ships point one direction and shoot in one direction. Your ship shoots automatically. You fly at another ship and hope it blows up first, and you repeat that until you're tired of it. 

Mining is similarly milquetoast, as well as an ineffective way to play the game. If you want to mine to avoid combat, it likely won't work. You'll make 1/5th of the progress and then combat will come find you. Your ship storage modules aren't big enough to hold much of anything, either.  

Missions are invariably ""Go here, kill this"", except when they are ""Take X to Location.""

You can assign crew priorities, but the UI For doing this is frankly, painful - and there's no real reason that you'd want to do it as the game is designed, barring extremely large ships - at which point, that level of control is largely unneeded. 

Overall: It's extraordinarily simplistic and offers very little in the way of gameplay.",1667027564,1667161469,False,4,0,0.442694187164306641,7,True,False,True

Each of your crew member has unique sprite look and the names but they act same there are no skill level or rank for the crew member.

The building is really compelling and is still keeping me interested so far, but I'd really like to see a bit more flavor on the campaign.  I think building on faction warfare seems a good bet for adding that flavor.

There are small improvements to UX that I've submitted as in-game feedback (I might have got rate limited because I can't submit anymore) but overall the UX works well.  I think there are some really common actions I'd like improved.
1. Loading/Unloading from ships to my own station/factory ships is tedious.  I'd like a way to simply dump my ore/steel/coils/etc into the factory keeping only what storage I've designated.  This can also be improved between non-factory ships when flying many at the same time.
2. Managing storage space when flying multiple ships.  It's hard to tell how much I have left.  I'd like an ""empty hold spaces"" number on the ships I've got selected, maybe in the top right corner.
3. Select by dragging is slightly not intuitive.  When I drag to select a section, and then mouse over, it seems I can move it because the cursor changes to the hand, but then it doesn't move and I have to cut/copy instead.  Honestly feels like a bug.
4. Even 8x feels a bit slow sometimes when I'm transiting cross-system.  I never feel I can have enough thrusters to get me fast in a straight line while also not over-thrusting on small maneuvers so I end up just sitting at 8x a lot.  This is really two issues that affect each other.  Fine adjustments and not over-shooting where I tell the ship to go (brake sooner pls) and also just wanting faster time because ships don't get fast enough.  The whole ""top speed that isn't C"" is a bit weird for the space setting.  Might be nicer to have non-dragging physics as an option.

I bet I'll think of more but this really demonstrates to me this game is on the right path.  I think this is my second time picking this up and it's come so far.  Genuinely having a lot of fun, and I hope the roadmap gets executed because this is worth $20 for sure and I can't wait to see what they can do with this good foundation.

Make a ship.  Fight some ships.  Repair your ship.  Make your ship bigger.  And we're done here.  That's it.  It's also a *little* concerning that the developer has openly stated that multiplayer is their current priority as that's often been the death knell for, well Space Engineers at minimum.  The fact is, multiplayer often takes a lot of resources away from other development and if you paid attention to what was said above, we're at the proof of concept stage here.  We have a decent vertical slice that shows what the engine is capable of, but not really a game you can play in it.

So, no, I wouldn't really recommend it unless the promise of making your ship larger and every so often it explodes is enough to carry the experience.  At is stands I'm always wary of Early Access games because a proof-of-concept is not the same as a game and we're in solid proof-of-concept territory here.  Your crew isn't that interesting.  Your ship isn't that interesting.  Combat isn't that interesting.  Missions aren't that interesting.  It's going to take a lot of work and creativity to move it past what it is right now, and I'm neither certain that it will or that the developer has much of a plan here.  Additionally, given the absolutely overwhelming praise for a prototype (and don't get me wrong, the engine here is cool) I feel like some more critical negatives are required.  So, I can honestly not recommend it unless you are studying game design or game engines, but it *might* be something to watch.

Don't be afraid to destroy your ship in blueprint mode and start anew.  That lets you see how expensive your ideal ship will be, and how far away from your goal you are.  Just remember to save it.

This review is only about singleplayer ""career"" mode.

Pros:
 - it really feels like you have a lot of build freedom for your ships
 - the different types of weapons really do feel quite different
 - exploration is simple but fun
 - enemies feel dangerous, even low-level ones

Cons:
 - it's very hard to make a profit from killing enemies. They will likely cause more damage to your ship than what you'll get as a reward, meaning that doing bounty-hunting missions is mostly just going to cost you money
 - salvaging enemy ships seems to yield almost no valuable resources, despite your own ships requiring a ton of them to build
 - mining is pretty much required if you're going to be profitable, even on a war ship. But mining itself is dull and mostly requires flying circles around the map for a long time looking for that one specific resource that you need
 - you can not salvage tech from other ships, you have to unlock new parts with money. this means that a profitable miner ship is more likely to unlock exotic weaponry than an actual warship fighting other warships that use those exotic weapons",1667121477,1667121477,True,1,0,0.519373416900634766,0,True,False,True

But is it a broken, buggy mess? Also no. It shouldn't be released if it is. Sure, there are some bugs and missing QoL features, but that is to be expected in an EA game. The developer has been very communicative, releasing several updates to address bugs and crashes, and overall did a great job at releasing the game in a state befitting to the game.

As far as the actual gameplay, I think this game is a LOT of fun. I love the crew management aspect and I find the logistics to be intuitive. One of my favorite features of the game is when you intend to repair/make modifications to your ship, and you don't have the materials around you, the game automatically attempts to utilize materials that are from destroyed ships or purchase it from nearby stations if possible. Same with upgrades. I have found the gameplay to be a little shallow since there is not much to do besides make your ship bigger and go against more difficult enemies. But even with what exists, there is a lot of time you can spend before you'd see every system in career mode. 

I cannot speak to stability in multiplayer since I have not tried it. It seems there are some desync issues that the developer is tracking down, but I am confident that these will get sorted. 

Finally, a few suggestions that I'm sure are already on the developer's list:
[olist]
[*] Create ships from scratch without having to find an abandoned ship. I believe this has already been mentioned by the developer as coming in the near future. Right now, you can only create additional ships for your fleet by transferring crew to an abandoned ship. This means if you're insanely rich and you want to build support ships, you have to commandeer one that you've destroyed. And you have to be careful not to overdo the destruction or you won't be able to take control and you'll have to just salvage it.
[*] Better fleet management. I feel like it would be nice to have some more intuitive fleet management. One thing I have taken to doing is creating ships with particular roles in mind. For instance, I made an industry ship that can extract and process ores into more advanced products you will need later. But if I leave it on its own (since it does have rudimentary defenses), it is quite the hassle to have to jump back and forth. Unless I don't see it, having a fleet summary screen somewhere would be really helpful. Maybe also some sort of automation to non-controlled ships? Like if I could command an industry ship to extract nearby minerals from an asteroid field, that would grant me more flexibility to focus on commanding my combat ships.
[*] Construction of hyper beacons/stations. I think it would be a great late game project to create your own stations that have platforms. I apologize if this is already a feature and I haven't gotten there yet. It would be cool to see player-created stations that can defend themselves from pirates like the existing stations. And also to have a facilitated trade network that can help create passive wealth in the late game stage. This is not a super important feature, but maybe a good one to have down the road.
[/olist]

Overall, I think this game is well worth the $20 and has some of the best shipbuilding gameplay I have come across. It is easy to pick up, and has a very nice learning curve that doesn't jump difficulty too fast (but still has a challenge for the player).",1667086730,1667086730,True,157,2,0.896090805530548096,12,True,False,True

Progression is fun and being able to play LAN co-op has made this a great game to play with my partner. The multiplayer is done very well and is incredibly versatile. Some information about co-op that you may find useful:

There are two main co-op options. 1) You are on the same ""team"" so you share money, fame, and growing crew costs. You can control each other's ships simultaneously. 2) You are each on different teams, but work together. You don't share money or fame, and you can't control each other's ships simultaneously (but you can give control of your ships to someone on another ""team"")

When you create lobby, each person can select their team and a starter ship. If you want to play on the same ""team"" but don't want to just share a singular ship at the start, here is a workaround: 

     1) Create a lobby.
     2) Have each person select a different a team and whichever starter ship they want.
     3) Launch game.
     4) Have everyone gift their ships to the host.
     5) Have the host save the game and go back to the lobby.
     6) Have everyone move to the same team.
     7) Have the host load and launch the saved game.
     8) You will all be on the same team with as many ships as there are players.

Some more co-op information:

• You can pause/fast forward time in co-op.
• Rewards are split between all ""teams"". So a $6000 reward will give $2000 to each ""team"" on completion.
• I found it to be frustratingly laggy on wifi LAN. I hardwired my computer and that fixed it completely.
• Sometimes the game will de-sync, then takes around 20 seconds to re-sync everyone. This only seems to happen if multiple players are trading many resources to a station at the same time, with many crew working, while fast forwarding time. It's not a big problem.

Pros:
+ Really smooth gameplay that scales excellently
+ Great music
+ Pleasing visuals
+ Fairly dynamic combat
+ Interesting crew system

Cons:
- Zero plot
- *Really shallow* in terms of viable designs and available parts / ammo / options.
- Mining is smooth, but not interesting
- Low mission variety
- Missile boats cannot be beat, even if you build a completely defensive ship.
- Factions interaction is basic and opaque

That's this game. It marries those concepts well.

The biggest issue I have with this game is the power supply system. Most of your crew's time will be spent delivering batteries from your reactor to the many power hungry systems. Lasers, turrets, shields, capacitors, engine rooms, even rockets. It's a bit silly to be honest, to think in the space age they don't have access to... wires. With a crew of 50 at least half would be hauling around batteries. I would much rather see an electric grid system developed like in Rimworld or Oxygen Not Included, freeing up the crew to do other tasks that actually make sense. Like repairing, which currently is instant.

I am excited to see what the future holds though, as it is one of the more interesting ship building games I've played. But right now the content is just too little for the price. In about five hours I saw everything there was to see, and from what I understand this game has been in development for awhile. I don't regret buying the game, but I don't think I can recommend it in it's current state. The developer does seem to have a pretty good roadmap. But like most early access games, only time will tell whether they can stick to it.

Nobody on that ship was extraordinary, nobody had any special powers.  The Captain though, there was something special about him.  

When we arrived at our designated asteroid field for the day there were instantly 5 hostile blips on the radar moving so fast we knew we had no chance of escape.  Equipped with mining lasers and a handful of P.D.C.s, we knew our best bet was to surrender.

Instantly upon hailing the largest of the ships which was also the closest to us, it's captain called out our Captain by name.  They ordered the crew to abandon the ship.  Said they were going to take the useful crew members to work on their ship and leave the useless ones to float the void in their suits until they run out of air.

In that moment I understood why he chose to staff his crew the way he did.  Turning to the Captain, I was surprised to see his eyes glistening.  I asked him, ""Why would you show weakness to your crew in a moment like this.""  Stern and crass as ever, he looked at me and said ""I ain't cryin' you little shit!  That there is a Cosmoteer.""

This looks a bit like rimworld but its not really, the minions on your ship are generic and can do any job at any time and they dont have skills.   This game is all about your space-ship and slowly building it bigger and bigger and more powerful so you can take on more powerful pirates and other enemies.

The space combat is pretty good, you can control your position and attack angle quite well once you get to know your ship, and the munition impacts and destruction is a spectacle to watch, especially when a power unit explodes!

Ship building is great.  Blueprint mode lets you mess around with your ship and see if you can afford the adjustment without spending anything, and the options available are decent. Hopefully with this being early access more is to come!

I haven't even begun exploring the galaxy yet so I'll update on that later

My friend and I play together in COOP and its pretty good!  its just like playing single player, its just your both in the same galaxy and can interact with each other.  Waiting for the pirates to engage my friend and then closing behind them with my deck cannon is great fun every time :D

I love how optimized everything is.
Runs extremely smooth and scales well on an ultrawide monitor.

Gameplay loop is extremely satisfying.
Building the ship is intuitive even if the systems are a bit more complex than usual spaceship-esque games.

This also scratches this weird ""ant-colony watching""-itch I didn't know I had.
Every station you visit and every ship you see is full with people who are running around, doing their thing and making the ship work.

Like I 100% recommend you get this. And my fallowing comments are to make it better not to say that the game is not already amazing!.

 However notes for developers: 

1. Add easy ship commands like hold fire, and shields up or down. (no need to constantly waist power on shields, and somtimes you want to turn off weapons quickly too wait and more more tactically take them down so it don't cost as much to repair and take over. 

2.0 (on that note, why can I only transfer crew to a second ship in multiplayer, let single player people take over multiple ships if they want!) Let people build a second, Third ship, base platforms whatever they have the stuff for!

3.0 big ask, but a few Small ongoing story ark/foes that come at certain times of game play to attack (base them on fame for difficulty). somthing to try to add a survival vibe to it. Bigger Goals to reach like, (Get to this sector, to free so and so from the pirate/jerk faces who took them! Like if players want they can go hard into it, and ride out to meet the foe's! Or people just vibing can retreat and fight their enemies with stations or npc help/ignore the quets line if it seems to hard or not apealing. Heck you could even let them opt out. But it would add a whole lot for us role play oriented gamers.. (BOSSES)

Absolutely amazing. The amount of customization and freedom of creativity is great and everything is extremely well polished.

You can relatively easily build a defendable ship that can take on swarms of enemies but can you do it in STYLE?

- The economy and faction system is not Starsector level, so if that is very important for you, I would wait.

The game is great but all the new things are repetitive to me and this early access release feels hollow I was expecting more of this developer's amazing work and concepts to become far more engaging considering now I'm actually paying for what I already had for free in the demo but there really is nothing new besides getting it for the multiplayer 0/10

+Mod support. You want ship so massive it will CTD or welcome you with blue hue? Suit yourself.
+I like music, simple but won't leave my head
+Runs good
+There's plenty to micromanage
+Visuals of parts (though there could be small differences between same parts so they don't look copy paste on bigger ships)
+Explosions and destruction of everything.
+Blueprint system work as intended. But that heavy blue coloring obstructs view a bit. There's even idiot proof ""Lost ship"" function for those like me who sometimes spend quite a lot of time building and forgot to click save.

~Some mechanics are in early stages (e.g. repairing or game balance in general)

-No collision avoidance in formation, though i like that rest of ships are kind enough to wait for that one clumsy fuck of a ship to un-bury its ass from asteroid. Ships also don't avoid sun death zone and fly straight into it so you can enjoy view of your ships burn like moth on a candle.

The beta test is now over, and I have purchased the game fully, I did NOT receive the game for free because of this. Now onto the review.

Cosmoteer is a game I have been following for about 7 years now, when I first discovered it, many of the features found in this updated version were simply not there. Since then, the developer has added so many new features and parts, such as ion prisms, deck cannons, and my personal favourite, railguns. Each and every part in the game is well thought out and designed to make ship building more interesting. An example of this is shields being directional, as you cant cover everything with shields, this forces you to prioritise where you want to protect the most, leading to more interesting ship designs. Its this development philosophy of prioritising player creativity that truly lets Cosmoteer shine.

What do players do with this creativity, you may ask? Do they make shielded ships that spin to evenly distribute and reduce damage, do they make lightly armoured fast ships that dodge enemy projectiles, do they make heavily armoured ships capable of decimating everything with a massive laser. In fact, players make all of these ships, the creative freedom of Cosmoteer is unrivalled; and that's why players use it to make giant space penises.",1666882344,1666882344,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Building ships is very rewarding, finding out what works and what balance you need to reach in order to succeed. 

You can have more than one ship and build a fleet! I didn't know this when I bought it, this is excellent. I've found its greatly helpful to get a second ship ASAP and stack it with storage containers to lug around your salvage from battle, makes upgrading a lot cheaper as you don't have to buy the steel.

Downside, at the moment the only things to do are mine asteroids or blow up ships/stations, whilst perfecting your ships.

Upside, blowing things up is a lot of fun, the difficulty curve is smooth, even mining is fun as you hunt for good ore while dodging pirates, and I could spend weeks and weeks building new ships

PROs:

I enjoy the building aspect of the game, it reminds me FTL or Rimworld.

Combat is simple but can be quite challenging when dealing with multiple opponents.

Missions are simple but fine.

Map is done quite well, reminds me Supreme commander.

CONs:

It feels little bit unfinished... i bought almost all blueprints in like 8 hours of game and i barely left the first system.

When playing FTL you still feel some sense of progression ... i haven felt it there unfortunately. Is quite repetitive.

Game automatically slows to 1X speed when new enemy is spotted... i have not found how to disable this feature and its very annoying.

I tend to lose my crew mates by moving when they are outside... i kinda get it, but its also annoying to collect them all the time. Could use some automation.",1666825541,1666825541,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Its a fantastic mix between FTL and Avorion with a good amount of its own ideas. 
I love what the game has to offer so far, the seemingly endless ways to approach the design of your ships and tactical engagement options of the enemy with those designs. 

The sandbox could use a bit more flair and interaction, as there is not much of a back story or any other interaction besides simple missions from stations. At least I was not able to find any other interactions I could experience in the first 5 hours, of which I spend almost exclusively in the starting sector.

Multiplayer coop as a fleet under one commander, or traditional multiplayer.

Started with the laser ship, did some bounties, got famous, made a bigger ship to fight bigger enemies. Got bored...
after a while, made a pure mining factory ship, mined a fuck ton of copper to make hyper coils and got 1 mil credits easily. 
Bought all blueprints and can make any ship I want (although progression being blocked by crew members).

Given developer response below, I am changing my review to positive.

""Career"" mode is pretty bare bones at the moment (shocker, it's early access), but it's still a *lot* of fun.

There's a staggering number of ship designs built into the game (over 200), all of which are available to the player from the start, though you will not have the component blueprints or materials to make the lion's share of them for quite a while.  Though why would you use a pre-built design as anything but a jumping-off-point, most of the fun is in building your own ship!

The $20 price point seems a /little/ high compared to games in a roughly similar vein (::cough:: Star Sector, then again, SS isn't on Steam, so no steam cut to compensate-for...), but on the other hand, I got well more than $20 worth of entertainment out of just the demo.

The gameplay options are refreshingly deep and well-developed to the point of being somewhat overwhelming.  That's not a bad thing, you can always come back to them when you wish you could do something; it could well be contained in the copious customizations.  I would be ecstatic if every game had such a wide array of options.

I had high hopes for this release, and after 11 hours of playing and fully clearing the first area of the new single player career mode, I can safely say that a significant amount of that potential has been realized. 

I'm very happy with the new career, and while it seems to have it's balancing issues here and there right now, I've found it to be far more entertaining then good old bounty hunter mode (single player from back in the days of the demo). Now this new career mode is challenging, one wrong move and your entire ship is gone, once this happens you simply must go back to your last save, and I personally like this because it makes you really pick your fights carefully, but it means you don't end up erasing tons of progress assuming you save prior to entering especially dangerous combat scenarios like when you become ""wanted"". 

A big way you are kept from being unimaginably over powered compared to the AI is by an inability to have enough crew at your disposal to run a massive ship, even if you can technically afford one. This is because of the new ""fame"" system and it has effectively made your own crew the most rare resource that you need. The more under crewed your ship is, the more likely it is to stop firing or stop being able to maneuver during a battle, and this means you need to be smart and split your resources across multiple more efficient small ships, instead of build one massive tank, if you wish to succeed. The way this naturally forces you to use the mechanics for controlling formations is amazing to me and I think it's a great improvement to how you generally went about dealing with AI ships in the demo. 

New mechanics are here and while all the new blocks are awesome, by far the most impactful change is the removal of the 2x2 6 person crew quarters ability to have doors on all sides. And this is where I have a complaint, this seemingly small change makes a lot of sense because of the new art style, but it has presented so many issues on old ships that many if not all of them, especially the big ones, need to be entirely redesigned. This of course simply presents a new challenge and it ain't gonna stop me from playing, but oh my god... there are 4040 crew on one of my best large ships, and more than 3/4th of them are trapped and a significant amount of things in that ship are now unreachable by any crew because of this one small change. I would propose allowing those old crew quarters on old ships (imported from the demo) to still have 2 doors on each side but ultimately I'm just gonna rebuild the ships anyways to suit the needs of the rest of the changes so it doesn't matter that much, but yeah, rip all old ships. To be clear this has no impact on people just starting out in the game, you'll simply build around the constraint, but it's annoying for sure. 

The future for this game is bright, the dev has put in a ton of effort and it shows, the game feels reborn and I especially love the new music, I already knew the new graphics looked awesome so no surprise there, the addition of dynamic lighting from basically everything is awesome, and I look forward to slowly but surely seeing features on the road map become a reality. This is easily my favorite 2D game right now and I'm so happy to see it finally living up to it's potential.",1666755258,1666755258,True,38,0,0.756767690181732178,0,True,False,True

Can't turn around and run, only way out is through

Ram the pirate into an asteroid, he explodes and combusts

My surviving crew attempts admirably to save the ship 

We are crushed by the gravity of the sun

R.I.P, last flight of the Booby

Loved the various demos for this, and having a blast playing the full game!

Lots of new mechanics, new parts, and new possibilities. Definitely more reason to diversify your fleet ... planning to build a chonky industrial barge to cruise along and do salvage-and-manufacturing while my attack fleet zooms ahead to the next target ... 

I find my ship design will usually cruise through a few fights, then get absolutely mauled by something ... it's a lot of fun going back to the drawing board and working out what I need to tweak to win that fight (provided I remembered to quicksave beforehand haha nope definitely never forgot to do that >.<). Sometimes the solution is MOAR LAZORS, but often a smart rearrangement of armour and armament can dramatically improve battle performance, at least for that specific type of threat.

Also pretty stoked to see the roadmap towards 1.0, sounds like the dev has some cool plans, and their progress and approach to this point in development has been pretty cool.

Get this game if you love tinkering with ship designs, cruising around star systems looking for trouble, and making things go BOOOOOM! Just don't forget to install fire extinguishers ...",1666727103,1666727103,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

It took me a while to figure out the mechanics (which I'm still learning), but I'm having a lot of fun constantly fiddling with my ship (and literally blowing others to pieces). It's really satisfying to see your missiles swing around and literally smash the back half of your enemy's ship to pieces.

This sounds strange to say, but I wish there was more grinding. Maybe allow stations to have new missions (even if duplicates) every 12 hours or something? I get sad when I've ""cleared"" a system.
