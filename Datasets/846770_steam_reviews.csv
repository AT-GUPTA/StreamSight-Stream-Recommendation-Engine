The essence of this game is to break stuff to collect materials used to upgrade your gear which will allow you to break more stuff and faster. That's about it. I only played it ~1 hour and a half and about 1 hour of it was breaking stuff to upgrade my gear. It's kinda mindless easy grind but it gets boring very fast. Inventory is also limited at first and you'll do a lot of backtracking, stacking materials and going back to camp to store it, many many times... I couldn't bear to keep playing and decided to go for a refund instead. Combat is also basic. For melee enemies, you'll just be walking backwards and hitting them just after they attack and for ranged, you'll need to avoid projectiles by dodging then engaged in melee. You get some throwing knives early game but only 3 of them at a time then you need to rest to get them back, which spawn zombies back (There's an upgrade to prevent zombie respawn but didn't reach it with my game time). And those knives don't even one shot basic enemies so it's usually a waste of time to use and easier to go melee...

There are also weird behaviors where I couldn't start a charged attack until an enemy was locked on which usually happened when the enemy got 1 meter away from me and there was no time to charge... Breaking stuff also feels clunky when several items are stacked unto each other and you don't really know what you're breaking. They could have double or tripled breaking damage to make the game less grindy. It take 3-4 hits early game to break stuff which really adds up when you need to break 100s of stuff... Sure, upgrading the crowbar will speed up the process but stuff also gets tougher later too so it'll go back to 3-4 hits to destroy bigger things so you'll still waste most of your time breaking stuff.

I'm aware 1h30 of gameplay is not that much to judge a game but I'm afraid in this case, it might be enough to know if it's a game up to my taste. The grind and basic gameplay is a no go for me. Maybe it'll tick your own boxes though.",1708308720,1708308720,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I played it couch co-op, which halved the grind, and we just about managed to get through the game without giving up. I can only look in awe at the patience of people who completed the game solo.

The zombies start off pretty brutal, since you die in 3 hits and they take a few hits to beat, but there are about 5-6 types of zombies and they don't scale up at all as you go, so you're still fighting the same types of zombies all throughout the game and towards the end they're completely trivial.

Every quest is basically just ""now go check out this new part of the massive, sprawling map and get a new item I've artificially required you to get"". And every single place you go, you run into a bridge you need to let down from the other side, or a barricade you can only open from the other side, and know that yet again you'll have to run a mile around all the obstacles to get to something which seemed close by. Get used to it, because the game will force you to explore every inch of the massive map to finish the quest.

Similarly, every recipe is just ""now go smash another thousand buildings to rubble to upgrade this item again"".

I hope you like smashing, because you're going to do a lot of smashing.

It's not a terrible game, but it isn't a great one either.
It's a grind, lots of fetch-quest type of objectives,
You start out with nothing but a small backpack (limited inventory carry space) and have to find and light campfires where you can respawn your HP and upgrade your gear. It takes a lot of grinding to collect materials for gear upgrades. Monsters also respawn when you camp, but in early game this is actually helpful. Mats from things you break are finite, mats from zombies you kill are not, though there is some randomness to to. If you die, you respawn at the last campfire you were at, and have to go find your body to loot back all of the mats you dropped on death.
Keep breaking stuff, keep killing zombies (or being killed by them), keep crafting and upgrading.

It's a rather predictable loop, and gets boring after a while until you find new locations and have to kill stronger enemies.
The graphics and assets used are nothing great- they are console style somewhat stylized graphics and art, not photo-realistic  PCMR style graphics, but that's fine. Easy enough on the eyes, not too busy, but lacking some fine details.

The game runs fine on my old toaster desktop, on my gaming laptop that's a few years old, and on my 4 year old somewhat  beefy (for when it was built) desktop. I haven't tried it on my new high-end rig yet, but no hitching or stuttering for me so far, a nice steady fps without spiking. 

Some survival mechanics, but no need to constantly eat and drink- cooking is more for buffs (at least in early game), but isn't a long-drawn out thing (other than collecting ingredients- grind grind grind for your soup!). Much more casual than something like The Long Dark, which is nice, since the game has only one difficulty. There ae mods out there on the Internet, but I haven't tried any yet. I want to play through the game the way it is before getting into mods, if the game holds any further appeal for me beyond the first playthrough.

[b][u]*Accessibility*[/u][/b]
Probably fine for Deaf and HoH characters- the music is dull, nothing missed there, But you will miss the audio cues some monsters make when they are gaining aggro or are attacking. You'll need to adjust your map to see as much as possible and keep your head on a bit of a swivel. (My Deaf gf is also playing the game- this feedback comes partially from her.)

Low vision players and those with certain forms of colorblindness may have issues, but the game does have a colorblindness mode. (I did not test it, so I can't say how it works for various forms of colorblindness, but the setting is there.)
There is no text or UI scaling, and there is a lot of text to read.  There is a setting to adjust how long text is displayed on the screen- make it longer or shorter.

There is a setting to ""lessen"" blinking effects, but you cannot turn them off completely.

There is a setting to show emojis to indicate mood or vibe, I guess? Probably more useful in co-op play. I am playing Singleplayer only, and found it a tad annoying.

There is a  trypophobia setting to help lessen visual triggers for folks who have the condition.

The game has controller compatibility and kb/m controls- both are relatively smooth and not taxing on my arthritic hands. You can rebind some keys/buttons as well.
*********************************************************************************

I do not have the DLC's, so I can't say anything about them.

So far (a little over 5 hours in) the game is a rather grindy predictable loop of gameplay, which could be boring for some people and provide a sense of satisfaction for others. It's fairly slow paced, and the combat in the beginning is nice, though it becomes a bit easy as you upgrade your weapons.

But it isn't bad- just don;t expect anything new or fresh in terms of a zombie apocalypse game, It'll do for a zombie killing game to pass time without raising your blood pressure too much (unless heavy grind infuriates you).

Time for me to get back to playing. It's satisfying enough to make me want to see where things go, but not something that compels me to play for 18 hours straight. Short sessions are fine, and the save system does allow for short and long sessions- whichever you prefer or have the free time for.

Not great, not bad- it's an okay game, very well made, though a bit of an empty world. Which I would expect after an apocalypse where I hid underground for year.
Probably best bought on sale, but full price does not seem unreasonable either (if you enjoy heavy grind games).",1707504064,1707538378,True,10,0,0.630811333656311035,0,True,False,False

Instead, it's all about breaking stuff and making cool things out of the pieces. Every chair, streetlight, even the kitchen sink turns into loot you can use to craft better tools and wacky gadgets. It's like reclaiming a post-apocalyptic island one smashed object at a time.

The gameplay is pretty straightforward: break stuff, grab loot, build stuff, repeat. It's addictive and keeps you hooked for hours as you explore the island and upgrade your tools of destruction. But watch out for the camera – it can get a bit wonky sometimes and make things frustrating.

It's refreshing that you don't have to worry about hunger and sleep all the time, but Dysmantle does start to lose its spark towards the end. Smashing everything gets a little old, and the last few hours feel like a bit of a drag.

Dysmantle is a chill, smash-and-craft adventure that's super addictive at first, but the camera can be annoying and the end of the game gets a bit stale.

The basic jist is: kill monsters and break stuff, get materials from doing so. Use materials to upgrade your gear. Explore and find more materials and recipes for better gear and stats. Use better gear to get better materials from both monsters and breaking the environment. 
Pretty much everything you see can be destroyed, but it takes a lot of hunting for the recipes and gear to be able to eventually do so. There are plenty of side quests along with the main quest, and most of them are there to help you find gear, recipes, or materials, but also as a reminder that people had led normal lives before the monsters took over. I haven't finished the main storyline yet.
There is immense satisfaction to be had in trying to break the world down and collect everything. There are medals to be earned at bronze, silver, and gold levels for all manner of activities, both trivial and challenging. If you're hoping to get all of the Steam achievements, it WILL take quite a time investment. Dying can have some painful consequences, as you lose any inventory not put away in a stash box - and if you die a second time, anything that was on that first corpse that didn't get retrieved is gone for good. Most of the monsters become trivial at some point, but it's still very easy to die if surrounded, or in... other ways, so there is still always a sense of heightened awareness of your situation to avoid losing precious materials.
Overall, I recommend the game and will continue to enjoy it myself. Others in the DLC reviews have said it's best to pick those up before finishing your first game, and I think I will take their advice and prolong the satisfaction of completing the game a little longer.",1704803399,1704803399,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Both of these games could be considered having a lot of grinding, but if the game play loop is enjoyable than this is not a grind, it’s fun.  I started off the first couple of hours having fun with DYSMANTLE, but then the fun dried up.  A game like this needs to reward your efforts to keep the player’s interest.

I was trying to collect ceramics to upgrade my crowbar, and on three separate occasions I had the game glitch out on me.  On one occasion, after killing a bunch of zombies and collecting some ceramics, my character stopped swinging his crowbar.  As the zombies attacked I would press my mouse button, and nothing would happen.  There was another time where five times out of six, when I hit the button to swing at the zombie, my character would seem to put the crowbar into his backpack instead.  Result, lose all supplies collected.  And the last occasion, I would press the button to swing, and sometimes it would work, and sometimes it would not.

Problem was, when I respawned, all the zombies also respawned, but none of the supplies would respawn.  Not really a lot of incentive to go back and fight the zombies again when the houses were now cleaned out of supplies.

I understand there is a way to stop zombie respawns, but how I would get to that point with melee weapons that only worked when they want to is a problem.  I will probably give the game a try again in the future, but for the moment I am having too much fun playing DREDGE, and Against the Storm is high on my list to start playing.

The most glaring problem with the game is that its advertised as a survival game but its not actually a survival game. The only feature the game has that I would even remotely consider survival is that you have to change your clothes based on the climate you are in, but this really just translates to forcing you to remove equipment you want equipped (like enemy reduced view range or increased move speed) to equip the cold or heat resist gear which more or less means you are spending over 50% of the game being forced into a specific outfit that doesn't actually give you any bonuses simply because the ""climate is too harsh""

Beyond that the game doesn't actually have any survival elements. You don't need to cook to stay alive. You can farm, but the farming is just to unlock a couple of permanent upgrades. Fishing is basically the same as farming. You don't actually build an outpost at all. You can build a house in one area of the map but it doesn't really do much outside of look good and move a few resource processors to one central location. The hunting and taming elements mentioned are also sort of present, except its once again just needed for a couple of one time permanent upgrades. I haven't tried taming but I have heard its basically pointless.

The second big issue I have with the game is you basically see everything the game has to offer in the first 10-15% of the game. You encounter almost every enemy the game has to offer just getting the tutorial and area immediately after the tutorial finished. Bosses outside of 1 boss are reskins of the normal enemies. Resources are somewhat scarce in the beginning but become so plentiful by about 30-50% through that all you are really looking for is metal or occasionally lumber.

*Edit for an additional annoyance* The UX is not player friendly. You have a number of tools/secondaries you need to switch between and rather than going the standard route of a quick wheel with 8 or so slots, you have 4 slots for main tool and 4 slots for secondary which means you end up going into your menu to equip one of the items onto your active bar to use it once, then switch back to the old thing you were using. In the same vein there is no reason to not sprint 99% of the time, but if you put sprint to toggle instead of held it toggles on and off every time you target an enemy. You also can't power attack while sprinting so it just ends up feeling jank no matter which way you go with sprinting options. 

That being said the positives are that the story is relatively good and engaging and mindlessly smashing stuff can be cathartic.

If you are looking for a survival game like 7 days, CDDA, or Zomboid, this is not it, You will be disappointed. If you are looking for a ""numbers go up"" zombie action RPG with a semi open world, this may get the job done for you.",1703972079,1703972816,True,23,0,0.75062030553817749,0,True,False,False

On top down view.
In a different context. And with the requirement of a DLC for taming.
No slavering, indeed. This game is more appropriate for younger audience.

Since it is easier, you don't have to mind thirst and hunger.
A meal is to be cooked only once to definitely earn its property.
Exploring does not require much preparation. It is not an expedition.
Fights are easy. It is hard (not impossible though) to die differently than by accident. Even a boss can be easily killed the first time you met.

It is grindy. You will have to raze parts of lands to obtain the required material to progress. And you will have to discover the elements to dismantle that gives you the most of what you are looking for.
That is the most impressive part, you can dismantle close to everything with the right tool in hand.

Talking about hand, the game keeps yours most of the time. What to do next is indicated as an objective.
It is never punitive. The only punishment may be, if you do not save by stopping at a campfire, to have to re-travel the whole distance from your last save to where you passed away.
Saving makes the monsters respawn. Till you activate a mechanism that blocks respawns. Since the game is easy, seek for it asap without saving. Some, if not all, of the already killed monsters will not respawn if you did not save and then activate that mechanism.
Then you are ready to explore and dismantle to progress in your quest.
Entire map is huge and cover many planet earth regions type. Each part bringing some new element to grind.

All the elements of a good survival game. Except, you do not have to mind to survive much. Just to explore and progress. And of course, dismantle.
It is interesting and well done.
I may not continue it myself since, having played Conan for quite some time, I miss the epic moments here and just play brainlessly. The lore does not attract me much either. Too childish, early teenager style. Not mine.
But I still recommend since it is well done.

Looking forward, from what i read it has grindy bits.  I can live with that - so far the game has given me delight - and some happy stress too.  What is not like me is that the 10 hours up to this review were all in my first day of owning it.  I don't remember the last time I played a game for 10 hours with almost no breaks.  I expect to be playing it for many more.

118 hours in: 240 deaths, completed main story and sidequests but the fun doesn't stop there.  There is still a pile of other stuff to do but now I am torn between starting over for the magic all over again or trying for those elusive last 6 achievements.  Either way it will be joyous.

10/10. Good case study for why tutorials matter.

Oh, you want an actual review?
Dysmantle is what I would describe as a brain=off game.
There is little, if any, challenge, lots of dopamine and ""number go up"" tied together nicely with a persistent world state.
I found that last part to be a major aspect of my enjoyment. The house you spent 10 minutes flattening won't just respawn, it's gone for good.
Simultaneously, persistent desctruction diegetically visualizes your progress.
This tapped right into my completionistic mind and was the only thing keeping me hooked after the first 10 hours.

Ok, time for some negatives:
<combat>
The combat system is really not good, so it's fortunate that the game is very easy.
Attacks swing in the direction the character is facing OR towards the targeted enemy OR towards the cursor.
Instead of choosing one consistent system, the developers decided to choose [b]all of them[/b] making the attack direction during actual combat feel completely random.
(When standing still, attacks go towards the cursor | when sprinting, they go in the direction of the character, unless you spamclick and run into an obstacle | if an enemy is targeted they go towards that enemy, unless you're sprinting or spamclicking | ...)

<power attack>
There is also a ""power attack"" which ""enhances"" the combat system with even more frustrating edge-cases.
If you hold left click, the character repeatedly normal-attacks. Unless you target an enemy, then holding left click performs a ""power attack"".
Unless you target an enemy [i]while already[/i] normal-attacking, then your character just stops attacking entirely.
Oh, also the game will target nearby enemies for you. Unless of course you target an enemy manually, then it wont target anything, even if you remove the manual target. Unless-unless you kill the enemy you (un-)targeted, then it's back to auto-targeting.

Power attacks also work on objects. But naturally you can't power-attack objects at will, only if there is a targeted enemy nearby.
This is a particularly stunning decision, because [b]someone[/b] implemented power-attack damage for objects, but consciously forfeitted this opportunity to add more depth to object attacking than ""hold left click until thing broken"".

<equipment slots>
Another jarring decision is that there are only 2 buttons for switching weapons. One for primary weapons and another for secondary weapons (bound to '1' and '2' respectively).
Tapping either of these simply activates the next of your 4 slots.
For secondary equipment this works fine, if you know your knife is 3 slots over, tap '2', '2', '2' and you're done.
For primary equipment however, you have to wait for an animation each time. So instead the sequence becomes: '1', wait, '1', wait, '1'.
It gets better: some actions, like the dodge roll, disable these keys during their animation. So the game just drops your input, instead of queueing it for after the animation.

The obvious decision here would have been 8, optionally bindable, inputs. One for each slot. Like how every other slot based inventory system does it.
Also, a ""next slot"" button obviously should have a ""previous slot"" counterpart.

<level design>
Elevation changes are handled in incredibly frustating ways.
Some falls kill you, others do miniscule damage. With the difference between these two being about 3 feet.
Climbing is only possible with [spoiler]Mana Rifts, glorified one way teleporters that give no indication where they'll take you[/spoiler]
Fortunately, there is no climbing in most parts of the map, so it's not [i]that[/i] bad.

[hr][/hr]

<conclusion>
This game is slow and certainly not for everyone, but if ""grinding"" does not bother you, the slowness lends itself to watching streams on the side, probably works as a background to ""just chatting"" streams as well.",1703700599,1703700753,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The gameplay is repetitive, but I actually like that sort of thing. I spent several hours in the first small area, carefully making my way through rubble and slowly building up my tools to bash more things. Then I saw the whole map and... honestly, it's way too much. The overland map is ENORMOUS, and fast travel appears limited. 

Unfortunately, this fake ""open world"" is actually a huge detriment: you are continually blocked in by walls, fences, cars, and rocks that you can't get through. I get that destroying the environment is part (most?) of the game, but it's just not fun to run for thirty minutes across a copy-and-paste world and find out ""...oh, I'm blocked in this way by a wall I can't touch yet."" Backtracking over and over and over wore thin.

If you enjoy a kind of mindless (in a good way, except for the BACKTRACKING) kind of resource-gathering game, this is a good one.

Please note that I thought I had softlocked my game (I spent a limited high-level resource in one of the DLCs that I didn't even recognize as a DLC). My advice is follow the main quest for a long time.

The story is shockingly cool and I would try to avoid spoilers.

Overall, this is a very good idea unfortunately living in a very bad map.

It's a fantastic time killer while you're doing something else (listening to an audiobook, talking with relatives at a family gathering, etc.). To its credit and appropriately, it works wonderfully on the Steam Deck, too. It runs fine as well. In my long, long play time, I did not encounter any severe bugs or even a single crash. It always ran smoothly, aside from a few random frame skips. The reason I wouldn't recommend this game is because it's just incredibly rudimentary. There's an outline of a great game here but there are significant flaws that make the overall experience less than it could've been. If what I've said so far is what you're looking for, then by all means stop here. This game's for you. But if you're curious as to what this game's lacking, read on.

My main issue with this game is how safe it plays things. It pushes no envelopes and cuts no edges. You're going to be harvesting materials long after you have any reason to be doing so because this game never gets wild. The weapons cap at a rather low point, long before things could possibly get crazy. You never get a chainsaw or a flamethrower or anything that would fill you with maniacal glee... but that's supposed to be fine because the enemies aren't challenging anyway. There isn't even a final boss, per se. There's a mechanic in the game where you can (allegedly) cause an area's monsters to become stronger. I say allegedly because, even though I maxed out multiple areas, I only ever saw the same enemy types in each area. The description for the mechanic led me to believe that enemies would be *replaced* by their more difficult forms until you had bosses running around as common enemies... at least, that's what I was hoping for. Alas, no. The enemies just have more HP. That's it. Challenge me, game! Thrill me! Make me feel *something.* You tease me for 160 hours and then just end? You don't give me the god-like powers I crave so I can demolish every building... every rock and tree on the island with ease? No? I still have to tap-tap-tap away at everything?

[disappointed sigh]

There's a base-building mechanic... for some reason... in a game where your main goal is to *leave the island.* I never used it beyond the tutorial. I guess every game with crafting needs to let the player build a house (that's functionally useless - you can't even sleep in beds, ffs).

I don't know... maybe I just soured on the game because of how boring it became by the 70% mark. Still, it feels like such wasted potential. It's like walking into a strip joint in Tehran: you're excited by the potential, but you never see anything stimulating, and it's over before anything gets exciting.",1702517424,1702517499,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

In this review, I will go over its general characteristics with you so you can decide if this is a good fit for you.

To start with, this game is set in a fictional apocalyptic world and is played in 2.5D (not 3D), with the main character viewed from a top-down perspective. Throughout the game, you have a limited field of view. The gameplay is generally very relaxing (there are some challenging components, but they are mostly doable without sweating over the keyboards). So, if you are looking for a 3D, hard-core, realistic survival game, this is probably not the cup of tea for you. However, if you are the type of player who is generally laid back and wants to burn off some free time without committing too much attention and energy to some games, this game is a great choice. The price is well worth the amount of content in this game and can provide a good few days of entertainment, even if you are rushing through the main storyline. However, I believe that this game is best played in a relaxed setting where you want to burn some time but cannot commit to several hours at once.

The gameplay is generally satisfactory, with a decent storyline (I will not go into details because I do not want to spoil it for anyone) centered on crafting and upgrading gear. Crafting is more of a ""set"" framework in which you create specific equipment that is pre-determined by the system and usually remains with you throughout the journey. The map is open-world in certain regards (it is set on a massive island), but you do not get to see it from a first-person perspective. Aside from the main storyline, you are also able to engage in side quests as well as farming, fishing, and building your base. In general, I believe the game strikes a good balance between ""relaxing"" and ""entertaining"". It is similar to a virtual story in which you progress and play through.

After discussing its strengths, I would like to focus on some of its shortcomings. First and foremost, this is mostly a single-player game with limited options for cooperative play with friends. Furthermore, you are the sole survivor in this entire game world, and things can become exhausting near the end due to a lack of interaction between you and anyone else (not even NPC). In addition, as your equipment improves and becomes more powerful, the original survival challenge diminishes dramatically to the point where you are simply slaughtering the ""enemies,"" and the risk of getting killed is non-existent (unless you make some really stupid mistake like falling off the cliff or something). All of this, combined with the fact that you are always viewing the main character from a top-down perspective, can be quite frustrating near the end, as you do not get to see much breathtaking scenery.

Having said that, I would say this game is a good buy for idle players, but probably not for those looking for dedicated, realistic survival elements in games.

I'm talking huge empty open spaces to roam, on your way to someplace you actually want to be. I'm talking spiraling, spiraling layouts of barricaded towns, desert canyons, snowy canyons, grassy canyons... and a hell of a lot of uncrossable rivers. There are bridges. Drawbridges. They lower from whichever side you will reach only when you have already been to every part of the present region and are so utterly sick of it that you wish never to return. Without fail, this is the pattern. 

The world design strives to replicate a sense of real homes and garages and factories and a good variety of other places, but this all goes out the window when you consider the intensely video-gamey spiral causeway-riddled swamp in the jungle next door to the plausible archaeological camp. The amount of bullshit swamps you have to wade through just to get a sodding gas mask that you only really need for a few tiny gassy areas that exist solely to gatekeep your progress, is outlandish.

Smashing things is fun, yes. Especially with the aforementioned audio design - almost everything makes a distinctive and satisfying crack or crunch or creak or screech when you obliterate it with one of the tools you discover and create along your journey through the game world. Points for this, absolutely.

However! One serious gripe: ""Break over 99% of all objects for materials with the right tools. No barrier will stop you."" claims the store page. This is a blatant lie. Rivers will stop you. Concrete walls of the barb-wire-topped kind, will stop you. Cliffs will stop you. Not having the resources to fix specific objects, will stop you. Not having the resources to upgrade the right tool enough, will stop you. And even if you max out your axe and sledgehammer, the two most powerful smashing tools I could discover after exploring most of the game world and finishing the sodding thing mostly out of spite? You get them up to 80 smashing power, and there are absolutely objects all over the game world that require 86, 90, 95 or 100, according to the helpful ""whack a thing twice to find out how far you are from being able to break it"" pop-up text.

This may seem petty. ""Well of course they have to do that, how else do you design a game?"" Differently, that's how. Have faith in your concept of destructible environment objects; if some players don't WANT to hunt for keys all the bloody time, if they WANT to bypass half the enemies by just smashing down a wall, why not let them? Why not give them the new experience you are literally promising with your pretty, pretty words, that you have made into lies?

I dunno, maybe the DLCs give you better smashing tools. They certainly promise Fast Travel from camp fires (of which there are just over a hundred) rather than only between radio towers (of which there are 13), which is utterly unacceptable gatekeeping of a crucial time-saving feature that would certainly have brought this review into dangerously positive territory. But on principle, I do not applaud games for taking a feature we ALL wanted, [i]and putting it in paid DLC.[/i] This is not an okay thing to do to your players, your customers. This is abusive. Predatory. Exploitative.

The story dialogue, what little there is, is mostly text-to-speech. Same voice I remember from some Youtuber's meme videos. There's probably some who still use it for that. Not a great delivery system for your core narrative, for the voiced clues to your... confusing, confusing story about a magic man from the sky who brought mana and plague and zombies I guess, to a people who... also had ancient zombies, because... pyramids... and tomb puzzles... but then also [spoiler]YOU are the man from the sky, it was you all along! Aaaaaaahhh!! And the 'one-armed king' title was apparently because you crashed your escape pod and lost an arm, but... but that happened ages before your whole adventure, and also after the end of it, WHAT EVEN IS THIS?! But probably it's all explained away by ""Oh yeah, mana affects time in super weird ways, you probably time-travelled and became the ancient god of the ancient pyramid zombies and all that after losing your memory, fighting through the game and escaping the island in modern day"" ...So yeah, welcome to an eternal time loop cycle of magic, confusion, torment and zombies, I guess.[/spoiler] At least it explains why the protagonist likes to break stuff.

But yeah. The designer never really trusts you with the power they promised you; they don't let you break 99% of all stuff, unless you count every individual tuft of grass and ivy and tree I suppose. Even then, doubtful. Probably closer to 90-95% at most. And the remaining few percents will be very willfully arranged to obstruct you from wherever you want to go, for the entire duration of the game. So... kind of a very false promise, and you really have to grind obscene amounts of endgame materials to get at least semi-close to some freedom of smashy shortcut creation. A great idea half-ruined by half-measure implementation.

The enemies are more annoying than anything. The basic ones soon become meaningless cannon fodder for whatever smashing tool you're swinging, while the more durable ones are a chore. You never really get any particularly good weapons; the katana is okay but only really works well on swarms of trivial enemies, so... not really needed at all. The rifle is okayish, but has limited ammo. Throwing weapons are okay. Grenades are pretty good, just stack them high and spam them on the bosses to win. Couple heavy swings from the sledgehammer and you're done. The five total bosses in the game are thus: A fat zombie that vomits all around, recycled after the initial fight as a regular large enemy that you'll kill a few hundred of, and it is always a chore... and a large robot thing with four different variants. Yes, there are actually more like two bosses in the game. One of which is even unique from normal enemies, but re-used three more times with slight variations in paint job, health and attack pattern.

The combat, as a whole, is one of the main reasons this review is negative. It is a large part of the game and rarely feels fun. Either it's trivial or tiresome. The reason? Enemy design, weapon design, and most of all: Janky controls. Locking onto enemies manually is annoying. The auto-lock-on is even worse. Changing lock-on targets is a guessing game. Press the right stick toward your preferred target, hope it does something. Get hit, or dodge. Press stick again. Still nothing. Give up, try to release lock-on and flail randomly with your weapon. Lock-on does NOT release. Get hit again. If you've cooked a lot of meals to raise your hitpoints, you are not necessarily dead by now. Otherwise, you're back at the last camp fire you rested at. Even if it's waaaaaay off in the distance because you didn't fancy respawning all the monsters before you have a chance to activate the ""keep them dead"" upgrade in the local radio tower, another tiresome chore that has to be repeated over and over, usually involving a spiral maze of unbreakable concrete walls.

That's not all. Your heavy attack is used by locking on and holding down attack. So assuming you manage to lock onto the intended target at all, you then get to hope it registers your button hold. If not, you get a regular attack, which probably won't do much to a target you wanted a heavy one for. Your character can charge a heavy attack while moving, sort of. Ideally you want to close the last distance to the enemy, or time the strike to hit as they get close but just before their attack can land. I could go on, but character limit is closing in.

Strongly disrecommended game that does not respect your time nor desire to have fun. Shame, the sound is really good. Just not much else. Crap controls, crap combat, crap world.",1701453677,1701453677,False,6,2,0.561532557010650635,0,True,False,False

It is like a crafting metroidvania almost.  The breaking stuff is simple but cathartic, who doesnt love breaking stuff.  The combat keeps things interesting enough with new types and simple bosses introduced along the way, and nothing beats getting strong enough to start 1-shotting the enemies that used to annoy you.

My only real complaint is the controls and the camera. You can not move the camera enough to good a good view of what is ahead of you on a widescreen display unless you play the game sideways if that makes sense. The character does not aim at your mouse except for when you first click. this is mitigated by a lock on system but is still clunky and negatively effects combat against groups. The characters movement is not great but that might be a skill issue on my part as I came across a block pushing puzzle with breaking floors and the character moves so slow with the unresponsive blocks it just lead to a lot of frustration. 

Still overall a great game and well worth the price.  I am 15 hours in at the time of writing and I have uncovered 1/3-1/2 of the map.. with the last 1/4 of the upgrade tree to unlock, but there are hidden unshockable on there after certain quests so maybe more.",1701246095,1701246095,True,3,0,0.57055211067199707,0,True,False,False

[b]TL/DR[/b]

Imagine if Cookie Clicker and Death Stranding hooked up at Last of Us's house party and had an illegitimate child. This is that child.
Walk around the map and hit things with a stick to break them to get materials to upgrade your stick to be able to break bigger things. There are zombies with plant growth.

[b]The full version[/b]

I enjoy zombie games, post-apocalyptic scenarios, open worlds and crafting, so Dysmantle was on my wishlist - but I hadn't gotten around to buying and playing it until I saw Iron Pineapple review it in his ""Steam Dumpster Diving"" series ([url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsT8SpRff80&t=2390s]link with timestamp here[/url]). That led me to buy it and play it - and it sucked me in. I highly recommend watching it if you want the opinion of a seasoned gamer.

[b]What I liked[/b]

99% of the objects in the game are destructible, though some items will take serious leveling up and unlocking of new tools and weapons. There is something incredibly satisfying about walking into a town and completely leveling it, leaving only the floor plan. It is a meditative experience that, at least temporarily, got me off the heroin needle that is Dead by Daylight. It even made me more productive at work, as after some time just breaking walls down into bricks with a bat I would think ""I could be doing something more useful right now"" - and I'd go and do it.

The world itself was clearly designed with love, with plenty of cute details and Easter Eggs, like a little girl's treehouse telling adults to keep out, or a ""grave clearly belonging to a great warrior"" with Guts's sword as a gravestone.

The Pets & Dungeons DLC lets you get pets that are immortal and help you fight enemies - and you can pet them, too!

[b]What I didn't like[/b]

Personally, I had a lot of trouble with controls. I missed so many hits by hitting in the wrong direction. This is not a problem when you're dealing with one zombie - but when you're dealing with several, it can get overwhelming (thank God for the dodge roll). It is especially a problem in wooded areas, since if your character walks into some trees - you can no longer see them. And I absolutely hate bushes in this game. Oh, you think you can run through there? Nope, that's a bush - that looks so much like the surrounding ground that you will only detect it because you got stuck on it.

While I enjoy grinding for resources, what I found absolutely tedious in this game is map traversal. It is so sprawling and so labyrinthine, it got to the point that I simply gave up on several side missions not because of the missions themselves - but because of what a chore it would be to get to them. There is fast travel between certain points on the map, but that doesn't really help when I still need to go through a maze to get to where I need to get, constantly consulting the map and setting markers so I don't miss my turn. I feel like this game would benefit from some sort of navigational assistance for already mapped areas. At least make the ""North"" arrow slightly bigger - I feel like I shouldn't have to deliberately search for it when I look at the mini map.

I was greatly turned off by the lack of transparency. Continuing the topic of traversal, the map is static - i.e. it won't reflect passageways you've already created, unless they involve interactive terminals. When you start the game, you see a ""skill"" tree of tools that you will unlock over time, and you think that that's it - however, the game just suddenly slaps new tools on there that aren't even part of the same tree, or that don't even go on the tree. This is frustrating, because it leaves me unsure of what I should work towards: am I simply under-leveled, or do I need a completely new item that will be unlocked later in the game in a different quest? From what I've seen, that's how Metroidvanias are supposed to work (I've never played any myself), but I feel like this map is way too big and has too many obstacles that you can't do anything about (rivers, mountains) for this lack of information to be sustainable.

[b]Final words[/b]

I put 84 hours into the game - and I haven't even finished the side-missions or purchased the second DLC. It relaxed me, it helped me with my productivity - but I did occasionally find it irritating. I'll probably go back to it sooner rather than later, since it did soothe my inner hunter-gatherer. Which is why I recommend this game to other white-collar workers whose monkey brains won't let them concentrate on slides and spreadsheets until they've stocked up on berries, fish and rocks.",1701139674,1701139713,True,19,5,0.715897679328918457,0,True,False,False

It's a bit like Red Faction Guerrilla which I also enjoyed.

I didn't experience any game breaking bugs, but did experience  a bugged twin boss.  I only saw one of them spawned on top of a railing next to water. One had already spawned on water and immediately drowned. The other was stuck and frozen in place and vibrating, I hit it once with a weapon and it fell in the water and disappeared. So didn't get to fight them, but not a problem.

Even though I did enjoy it at first and was obsessed about trying to destroy everything, there's only so much repetition I can take and I did feel sick of it. I spent 30 hours just trying to destroy everything before I started following the main story and upgrading everything and managed to stop being obsessed about destroying everything. 

The world is way too large and lacks meaningful content. It's hard to know where you are supposed to go as in you find out you need a gas mask to progress but doesn't mention anything about where to go to find one. I was sick of feeling aimless so looked it up online where to get a gas mask, I should not have to do that.

I like that the story is a bit mysterious but also dislike that the plot isn't explained properly and the ending is lazy it just goes straight to credits and your game statistics.

It's the kind of game to play that is mindless and if you want to turn your brain off destroy things and just tick everything off on checklists. 
I mostly like the game and recommend as I enjoyed it and had some fun , I only rate this game 6/10 and not higher as it's a bit too tedious and drawn out.",1700903944,1700903944,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[b][u]General Thoughts/Overview:[/u][/b]

So, hear me out, I got a lot to say. 

First up; do you like boring games? 

I don’t mean that in a mean way, it’s just that this game is very slow. How slow? Well a third of people haven’t finished [i]the tutorial[/i]. A quarter of people have killed two of the four bosses needed to get towards escape, and only 1 in 10 people actually finish the game… 

This game is very long winded, and it slows you down at every point. For example, upgrades are material locked, by materials can only be acquired through said upgrades to improve damage, meaning you have to be lucky for drops. Then further upgrades are locked through needing better tools, constructed from materials you can only get from the fully upgraded previous tool, creating a double material sink as the new tool needs upgrades itself to match the damage of the fully upgraded previous tool. Finally upgrades are THEN locked behind a material you haven’t found, and don’t find, because it needs refining from a structure found in a specific poi. And this is all before you can make and upgrade a tool out of it, which can break objects containing it. It's all very convoluted. 

The number of clicks needed to do anything at all is too damned high. The game was clearly made by whippersnappers with working joints, because good lord do I need to play some point and click adventures, or something else that’s click light for a while after this. 

Now as for the story, the basic premise is that you emerge from your bunker after some kind of apocalypse, setting out to escape from the now fungal-zombie ridden island. Along the way we find pieces of a larger story at play, and don’t worry if you miss it throughout the game, they’re sure to absolutely clobber you with it at the end. 

Finally I enjoyed the sheer number of Finnish cultural references, but many won’t make sense to anyone who isn’t familiar with the culture, and will seem to be absurd for the sake of absurdity.

[b][u]Pros:[/u][/b]
[list][*] Emergent storytelling is done fairly well here. The quote unquote ""real"" story is told through the environment, radio broadcasts, and many of the side activities. I was around two thirds of the way through before it all clicked into place, and the little clip at the end made me smile and roll my eyes. 
[*] If, like me, you're a packrat, then good news! There is a certain satisfaction in tearing down an entire neighbourhood and storing all of the raw materials for a project you'll probably never undertake, and the endless storage means you just have to get yourself to a drop chest and you’ll have all that shiny, shiny, loot. 
Sadly there is no monstrous horde you can produce and sit on. 
[*] The mechanics are mostly satisfying and the gameplay is enjoyable. If it wasn’t so damned drawn out, the game would be really, really good. This is further bolstered by nice atmosphere, good use of sound, and the absence thereof. The mini quests and exploreable bits and bobs are also well done, leading to an all-round positive experience across basically everything bar progression.
[/list]

[b][u]Cons:[/u][/b]
[list][*] The combat has no evolution at all. Monsters just get more spongey and need bigger weapons.
[*] you need items from diving in the various tombs and finding and killing the various side bosses in order to upgrade the towers to keep everything dead, or you have to fight every non-boss monster again after every rest, and if you DON’T do that then every run becomes a 'please don’t clip onto anything and get smooshed' fest, especially as you start out REAL squishy.
[*] The game is just [i]terrible[/i] at giving you instructions. I was 99% of the way through the game before I realised time locked chests can be accessed by running to them as fast as possible after resting. Every. Single. [i]Other[/i]. Mechanic. Needs. An. Item. The game literally trains you to think you’ll need something to use that later. It’s very frustrating. And where it does need an item, like fishing, it doesn’t always explain itself well then either. I’d fished out half the fishing spots before I got over my cosy sim conditioning, and discovered I could just leave the dude to fish and he’d clear it out by himself. Game logic dictates you need to click on the bite! I like that I don’t need to here, but [i]PLEASE TELL ME THAT.[/i]

 [list][*] A lategame trinket that can be used in the map to teleport to any campfire in the region you’re in. This is a must. The sheer volume of running about to complete everything, and the distances between link towers is just too much for the end game. It’s the whole everything getting drawn out problem. (Hell, give it to us after the main quest is complete, a reward for those wishing to explore more when the story that the game wishes to tell is over.)
[*] A ‘dysmantle mode’. I propose in this mode, using the building plan, you can drag a box over an area and watch the dude go to town taking everything apart (that he has the dps for) in an accelerated frame like the one used while sleeping. This would MASSIVLY cut down on the grind, stream line levelling and character progression, and be interesting to watch. It would allow those who wish the catharsis of tearing it all down themselves to do so, and those of us just doing to for the xp and mats to get on with the exploration. If you’re worried about balancing it, then give a decreasing XP penalty per level of the building plan, and possibly a cap. 
[*] Some WAY more efficient tutorial bits. Dysmantle tries to teach you through you doing, with a few tips in the tutorial area. However it misses the mark on quite a few points. Here is a list of things I wish I’d known, with a little thing the character could say to inform you. 
Map: You get one once you activate the first link tower. “I’ll get a copy of an island map and a compass there.” (When the quest pops up.)
Bosses: Stay dead, and are not the epic encounters the music paints them out to be. “Hey, this one has a name! I don’t think it’ll be back.”
Timed crates open from last rest, not requiring an item. “Huh, X seconds ago was when I last rested at a campfire… I should try to get here faster after my next rest.”
Fishing: No clicks needed! (For this one, I’d simply remove the bite sound and let the fish get pulled out automatically. Gamer senses scream ‘CLICK THE BUTTON!!!’ when you hear that little ‘plop’.) 
[/list]

[b][u]Overall Recommendation:[/u][/b]

Dysmantle would make an AMAZING 25-35 hour game. Dysmantle makes for a tedious 70 hour game. 
The long and the short of this is my opening question: Do you like boring games? If grinding, street by street clearing, massive material requirements, and long haul exploration are your jam, then you are absolutely going to love this game. And evidently around 12.5% of people do, because they finished the game. 

If not, you really won’t. This game isn’t for people looking for a survival crafting game, or a zombie fighting game, or a fast paced adventure. It’s for those people who like the tedium. 

If you are one of the people who gives this a closer look, and decide to pick it up, then my main advice to you is: Fight everything. Be brave. Nothing in this game is particularly difficult, but it does all need practice. Keep that inventory empty and go for it.",1700134693,1700136283,False,3,0,0.517728149890899658,0,True,False,False

This game is solely designed for time wasting and dismantling anything and everything in the environment. Combat is almost non-existent and only 3 enemy types actually have the ability to kill you and the rest are just fodder or in the way. Story in other reviews is apparently ""fantastic"" but in all reality is shallow and not really there. I guessed the end before the halfway mark. The game is designed around tedium, tedium, tedium. You have blunt weapons and slash weapons. Blunt weapons break certain objects and slash does the rest but you must have the damage number to break them so the whole game is about upgrading your tools to break higher level stuff until you can't anymore and somehow find the next item through leveling up in the tree or discovering blueprints. SPOILER! The best blunt weapon you can't even get till you beat the game first for some reason and almost the same for the best slash weapon. The environment is designed as if God himself hated humanity and made three levels of height and a 5 foot drop would kill you and you can only get to higher levels via mana portals. Alot of this game is about blocking you , deterring you, or making you go well out of your way and then saying you need to do this 1 thing to progress but then you find out later theres another and then another and then ANOTHER!

In any case, It plays well on the Steamdeck. There is one issue. The lettering appear to be lower resolution & can be difficult to read. I'm not sure if there's an adjustment that I need to make on my settings, but its minor.

As stated before, the gameplay is very addictive. You will find yourself grinding for hours & not even realize it. When you ""dismantle"" items, you gain XP, when store items, you gain XP, & when you destroy enemies, you gain XP. You can gain skills that will help you along. You not only can craft items, but also improve them. You can also at some point build structures, furniture, & other items. There one thing that I find frustrating: You can only craft items at a campfire. If you come across a table, you can only upgrade your equipment, but must use a campfire to craft new inventions. This wouldn't be so bad except that to start with, when you use a campfire, enemies in that area re-spawn. You can make it to where enemies don't re-spawn, but the item needed for that is harder to locate than normal. You also have to use campfires to level up & select new skills. So be warned. I'd love to see an update that allows you to use a table to invent new items, without having to use that campfire.

With cleanup you can destroy most things and kind of ""return things to nature"" but not floor features and it leaves you unsatisfied. 
With exploration, the map is massive but if you're not doing cleanup the content itself is rather sparse and nothing leads you from one thing to the next. 
As a mix of both, you're usually going by the main objective, but either destroy a certain part that leaves you feeling the need to demolish the whole complex or beeline to the target and feeling like a lot was forgotten on the way which needs backtracking.

Unless resources respawn or something, the loss of everything you dropped on the first death, because you die a second time on a corpse run, is poor game design.  I've lost so many resources from cheap deaths, that I may have to start over to progress past the second area.  

This isn't Dark Souls, resting and upgrading shouldn't reset all the enemies. (Yes, I realize there are workbenches to be found in the world that don't reset spawns, that's another band-aid for a poor game design choice) Also, respawning enemies that don't even drop anything worthwhile in the first place, is just stupid.  And the Dev knows it's stupid, because there is a thing to unlock that stops them from respawning.  Maybe you've forgotten that most enemies can be avoided in DS games.  Most of these zombies will chase you to the ends of the earth to do battle.

Usually, breaking things apart and crafting is my jam, but this is just tedious.  It's really boring after you leave the first area, because everything is spread way farther apart, protected by lines of idiots you can't avoid, and the game becomes more combat-focused and less Dysmantle-y.  That wouldn't be so bad if the combat was compelling, but worst of all, anything that spits can really only be killed effectively with an extremely limited supply of projectiles that are replenished when you sit at a campfire.  Which...you guessed it...respawns the spitting a-holes that you didn't have enough ammo to kill the first time.

97 hours of constant fun, mindless destruction, guiltless kills and that's because I decided to end it before finishing it all (to be continued).

I bought the game with all DLCs and I think they are all worthwhile (the pets DLC just has the most hilarious couple of NPCs :D )

         -Very satisfying that almost anything can be dismantled and repurposed.
          -Game mechanics are smooth, not buggy, and the challenge to relaxing ratio is just right, except for one thing I'll put in the cons.

          Con - The shelters were too much for me.  I am not that commited to my repeated death to master them and moved on to a different game, leaving the shelters undone.  And you are going to need to conquer them to complete the main story.  So I don't actually know how the game ends.

I still enjoyed taking apart everything, and I would recommend this game if you want a low-key challenge that you can listen to an audiobook most of the time while you play.

- Everything is there to make great ""builds"", but half of the time you are forced to wear hot or cold clothing.
- The rifle is useless as it is
- What is the point of the forester costume? It really doesn't matter whether you cut the tree with 3 or 5 hits.
- The riot shield is ok, but it could be much better.
- Base building is pretty much pointless, other than being able to make a sawmill and a forge. The Home portal is useful, but that's it.
- Farming is also mostly pointless
- The level up traits feel too random, and a lot of them are useless. (e.g. there is one that gives you +50% healing from food. Most food items heal more than your max health by default)

I dislike having to constantly swap 'weapons' to break down different objects, the story is kind of there, and there's nothing that really feels like 'survival' other than trying not to get hit (about three hits in general is enough to kill you). 
Also, the camera sucks. The camera is really, really awful. I either can't see what's around me, or I can't really see where I am because of all the trees, or that one bush that blocks your movement.

After playing more of the game, I want to add that advancing in the game feels like it is all over the place. After discovering an apparent tutorial for finally being able to build in the game, the first objective is to build a ""concrete platform"" as the base, and a ""concrete staircase"". To do that, you need stones. Okay, right? Stones are very common in survival games. Unfortunately, for this game, stones might as well be a legendary resource found towards the late-mid to end-game resource. Your character is apparently too stupid to 'invent' a pick axe for all those large piles of stones laying around, and smashing concrete bags yields fabric. Only after creating a wrench and smashing the smallest of stones (yielding one stone resource each) am I finally able to do the bare basic of building in this game. 
Honestly, playing this game makes me want to play anything but this for the same experience, such as Fortnight survival/story or other 'survival/base building' game.

There's crafting, construction, and a variety of monsters to fight but success in all of these is affixed to one single core mechanic, dismantling things, and that gets pretty boring after a few hours.

If you are into looting and breaking/demolishing everything and anything then this one is for you, worth every buck! I couldn't care less for the story.

I just adored running around chopping trees, cracking stones, dismantling buildings and having the unlimited ability to loot as much as I could to a point where I had thousands and tens of thousands looted tree leaves and such that I did not even need by the end of the game, but it was just so satisfying to run around and loot all kinds of materials that I could not resist, but to spend hundreds of hours in there.

Just a pro tip: make sure to get your hands on ""Power Fist"" and ""Khopesh"" tools/weapons when they become available. These are the only two you'd really need that would be enough to dysmantle everything on the map. I would also recommend watching some tip VODs and familiarize yourself with all the tools and things you could/should do in the game not to miss on something you wished you knew early on.

Currently I play, the game on the Switch and intend to resume my game on Steam in the future. The game is solid and has a lot to do, in particular it's worth its money. That's all for the moment.

1. Review: 
First of all, I am really pissed of by this game. I almost finished it, but now my patience is over. It is a pity, because this game has large potential. ('Zelda, the breath of wild' is great and wonderful, 'Divinity Original Sin 2' is great but grim and 'Dysmantle' is ...?)  

It is grindy, has not much fun and many times there is no motivation to continue. The target lock system is a pain in the ass in tight situations. (Switching it off does not work!)  In addition there are not much explanations. During the play, I wrote down some possible suggestions, but I am to angry to do so - at least for the time beeing.

Should you consider to buy this game? Yes and no. If the negative reviews do not worry you to much, then buy it at a discount of 40% (about 12 euro). 

TO STEAM: It is about time to introduce a third button for the assessment to get a better distributions of them. For example, Yes, Yes/No and No. This should be possible in the 21-th century.

GENERAL ADVICE TO THE DEVELOPER: To be fun and addictive the resources must be easier to collect (it must not be dull and brainless) and there need to be more of them. For example, more processing units. And they must not DISAPEAR. The different parts of the game must better add up to a unit.

The game map is at least 5 times larger than it should be in comparison to its content. Especially that most of the tech progression is forced into the first 8-10 hours.

The player has to grind through lots of well crafted, but ultimately pointless content. It hurts me to say this, as every single area and location is uniquely constructed down to the last detail, there are no repeating structures (though the enemy variety is practically nonexistent) and I never got the feeling that I'm visiting the same place when entering a new area. Still, these areas are practically empty of meaningful content. The player only rummages through them to catch an elusive dish receipt for a marginal stat boost.

There is A LOT to explore, but there is no reason for exploration. Then there are the straight timewasters: crafting machines and growing stuff. I completed the Ark collection, but boy it took long growing the hundreds of vegetables from each kind. Why? Just why does a PvE singleplayer (with additional coop, I know) game have mechanics like that? And what convinced me to write this review were the Mana Chunks. After completing the game I had the intention of at least finishing exploration around the island. But the damned rifts require Mana Chunks to activate, even though I used most for finishing the game and craft the end gear, to the point where I'm out of mana as well.
So in order to finish the exploration, the only semi-fun part this game still has to offer I need to grind an estimaged 10 hours or more by activating Ascension Signals to respawn monsters so that I get mana to craft the damned chunks 15 minutes a piece.

This is a beautifully crafted game. There was literally no reason to stretch content this hard. And well, I say stretching, but actually they put incredible effort into building a pointlessly large world for this game.",1694903944,1694904096,False,16,0,0.66315072774887085,0,True,False,False

► Голода нет - еда нужна для получения перманентных бонусов к статам в первое приготовление и как хилки при повторном.
► Холод и тепло выступают ограничителем прогрессии - нужно использовать соответствующую экипировку, чтобы нормально что-то делать в холодных и жарких локациях.
► После смерти персонаж воскресает у костра, заодно восстанавливающего заряды у экипированных расходников.
► В игре есть быстрое перемещение.
► Временных ограничений нет и ситуация на локациях может стать лучше или хуже исключительно по желанию игрока.

[h1]Так что же ты такое?[/h1]
Вопреки впечатлениям от скриншотов и трейлера - это адвенчер с элементами песочницы и метроидвании.

Основной фичей игры является тотальная разрушаемость всех декораций. Любой объект, не являющийся ландшафтом можно расщепить на составляющие. Другое дело когда это будет можно, ведь часть прогрессии напрямую завязана на прокачке снаряжения. Скажем, получаемая по сюжету кувалда на максимуме имеет всего на 15 единиц урона больше, чем доступный ранее газовый ключ. Для рамсов с мутантами это роли особой не играет, но кувалдой уже можно ломать легковые автомобили, чего ключом сделать нельзя. Некоторые проходы или шорткаты заблокированны именно такими ограничителями.

Получаемый от ломания всего подряд хлам можно и нужно приспосабливать для своих нужд - изучать новые предметы, улучшать уже изученные, переплавлять в более высокоуровневые аналоги. Хлама не слишком много в плане разнообразия, но просто тонна в плане количества. В какой-то момент эта тонна даже пригодится, тем более что за ломание объектов и складирование хлама начисляется опыт. Это, кстати, самая спорная часть игры, т.к. можно внезапно обнаружить себя за сносом жилого квартала и осознать, что прошёл уже час. Но опыт нужен, за уровнями персонажа залочено изучение предметов.

Игра при этом нифига не серьёзная. Общий цимес тут повязан на мане, есть всякие устройства телепортации хлама на базу, телепортирующая обратно на берег резиновая уточка, если вдруг свалитесь в воду, скелеты-хранители огромной пирамиды, какое-то количество шутеек и там ещё по мелочи всякого.

Базу строить можно. Какое-то время даже нужно: огород и станки для переработки - наше всё. Смысла в жилом доме нет, т.к. в игре нет никаких механик это оправдывающих. Разве что для эстетики. Кроме базы можно будет ставить турели и в игре есть места, где надо поиграться в тауэр дефенс. Они простые, бояться нечего.

В игре, в целом, есть чем заняться - исследовательская часть тут на уровне. Мир открытый, практически цельный, за исключением пары небольших мест. Активностей хватает, раскиданы они по миру вполне адекватно.

It's... okay. My opinion of the game is that it's just okay.
Far as I can tell, the game mostly has the same gameplay loop the whole way through, minus some little distractions like digging and farming, and the combat never gets much more complex.
Also, most of the game's combat boils down to A: attack, move, attack, move, or B: get behind something, do a charge attack, and if they're still alive, then attack, move, repeat. Pretty clunky.

Anyway, interesting stuff:
-Cool you can break just about 100% of everything you find at some point or another, leveling entire houses and such
-Picking perks per level up has always been a fun RPG thing I've always liked
-Zombies that aren't just dead things, some look pretty gross
-Good price for the base game
-It's got an ""invention tree"" to unlock new stuff

Bad stuff:
-Getting the entire package of the whole game without a sale costs $40, and there's another DLC coming up
-Simple combat, though you have a janky dodge roll
-No survival mechanics, despite being labeled as such in both the description and the tags
-Kind of a metroidvania, weirdly, despite NOT being labeled as such. Lots of ""can't go this way until you get X thickness jacket"" or ""need Y tool to break Z so you can get to the next area""
-99% of your time is spent smashing everything, running to the storage, smashing everything, running to the storage
-Zombies don't drop enough loot to justify fighting them, they'll drop a leaf when trimming a house's hedges gives you, like, 50 leaves
-Your ""invention tree"" is simple and tiny, and I don't think it ever gets any bigger or more complex, you basically unlock things in order with not much player choice
-Death penalty is kinda weak, you just drop your stuff and return to the last ""bonfire"", and you can go pick them back up pretty easily

But I LOVE grindy games where I can turn my brain off and watch a tv show or something in the background, and let me tell you, this game is GREAT for that. The gameplay loop did start to get somewhat tiring once I reached the 50 hour mark, but lucky for me my playthrough only took 57 hours. 

Some points of frustration I had with the game were the strictness in how some puzzles were designed, and the smelter usage in the late game. The puzzles were designed in a way where if you made a mistake you would have to restart the entire thing, which takes you through a loading screen then takes another 30 seconds to get back to where you were, so if you make several mistakes you were just wasting your time. In super late game you need to craft around 60 Titanium to get all the parts for the ark and Khopesh/fist upgrades, and im not complaining about the materials bc if youre destroying every steel resource you find, like I did, you will have enough, but rather waiting for 60 Titanium and 20 Mana chunks to cook in the smelter is AGONIZINGLY SLOW, sleeping 12 hours barely does anything to fix this since the wait time is so long. 

Aside from complaints, the combat was very fun to learn, and I can kinda see the souls-like comparison for the early game, though once you get a weapon that does at least 65 damage, as well as having good recipes, you can just one shot everything with a charge attack. The enemy design is pretty nice, despite having few enemy types. Though I wish there was more of a difference between the main bosses, that feels like some missed potential. The mini bosses all have distinct designs though, which looks great. 

For a game created by a team of 11 (If I read the credits correctly) this was an awesome game and a great use of almost 60 hours.

Graphics are simple, but nicely stylised, and the combat isn't too nuanced either, sure. But the core game loop of exploring, gathering resources, returning to camp and using those resources to make better tools that can gather more exotic materials or clothing to survive in harsher environments is insanely fun. The feeling of being able to destroy more and more of what you see is extremely satisfying. You start off being very carefully led around environments by barricades and end up smashing through walls to get where you want to be.

The DLCs are both fun. Worth the money and consider doing them asap due to the convenience they reward you with. 

Here's the real shocked though...there's a story. And it's actually good.

I wasn't playing for the story at all, and that's perfectly fine, not every game needs one. This game's mechnically fun enough to play that I would not have minded a loose justification for what you do. But no, I actually ended up drawn in to a creative tale that went far further than I ever expected and impressed me up until the end. It's told loosely through radio broadcasts and the odd note, but gives you plenty to digest between each. It may look like you're in suburban America at first but...you're really not.

Final odd thoughts; this has tons of things that it didn't need, but add a lot of charm. I've seen some complaints about the game being ""grindy"", but I went all-in on xp gain buffs at first and had no issues levelling up. The Ark scavenger hunt sides quests may feel grindy, but they really aren't. Grow crops, check them every so often and forage while doing other things. It's easy to get everything and the other categories you'll probably gather for while playing normally.

It's a ""survival"" game that expects you to actually survive and hopes that you will have fun doing so.

You surface from your underground bunker into the desolate shell of your subdivision, surrounded by grotesque parodies of the animals, human and otherwise, that now populate this huge island. From that point on you explore, gather, craft, fight, as you try to survive and solve the mystery of what happened. Pre-recorded radio transmissions spout ominous and vaguely threatening speeches, and SOMETHING happened to create all these monsters, right?!?. It's up to you to rework the material left behind into the tools that you will need to adventure in this charmingly deadly world, but as I said, the game wants you to survive and the punishment for death/failure isn't terrible.

The play is the thing. Starvation and the complete destruction of your progress are not. It's also SUPER fun. Plenty to do. Lots of places to adventure. Much fun to relax into. I am highly enjoying this shell of a world, and somehow, it seems just a bit happier than IRL 2021.

Despite a few issues here and there DYSMANTLE is everything I've wanted out of this survival-esque genre. Starting with the downsides: Direction can be difficult, the highly free camera control means it's VERY easy to lose track of where you are and are going, and fast-travel is overly limited until you 100% clear one of the DLC. Some things aren't explained well enough, specifically the permanently-missable nature of a lot of medals and achievements due to problems with non-enemy respawns.

On to the upsides: Food and other sustenance is optional and meant for permanent improvement, not uncreative metering of how you spend your time and resources. You FEEL strong even with early gear, and have a good toolkit between items and movement to keep fights from going too far south. In the later game there are deliberately-infinite resource generation options, which mostly boil down to trading time (often even idle time) for material. Between that and farming this game makes coming back to base from an adventure feel rewarding in and of itself.

I've been gaming for 33 years and this was a fresh experience. I was able to play for two full days (literally like 12 hours a day) and not even begin to get bored. Shortly after though, I was ready to finish the campaign. 

My recommendation: (1) focus on quests and story progression and gather as you go -- i maxxed out all my stuff by the time I finished exploring like 1/3rd of the map and then just started rushing to the end game. If you spend a ton of time grinding unnecessarily then you will probably lose interest sooner.

Minor critiques: They did a great job keeping tedium to a minimum. For some reason, however, planting crops requires planting each individual crop one at a time after switching to your seed bag... this is a majorly tedious bit of game play that should have been avoided. 

For someone like me, who gets bored with games very quickly, 24 hours of entertainment is exceptional. Like, VERY exceptional. I'm just trying to finish the game now and the final quest just keeps going.

I do think after about 30 hours, I'm ready to take a break however. Which is not a statement about the game's quality, but rather just the fact that I need a change of pace from its OCD triggering nature. I imagine I have another 20 hours at least before finishing the main story. That said, I did wrap up the expansion I own, **Dysmantle: Underworld**, which you can access pretty early in the game as part of your exploring. I'd say that part alone I invested 10 hours into (plus 20 or so into the main game story).

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2989074592

So, a little about the base game. It is a top down ARPG, with a splash of Soulsborne, and a fully destructible world, hence the name Dysmantle. In fact, destruction is how you'll get consistent xp. It's a tiered system where you get xp when you destroy anything, when you store the materials you get from said destruction, and I want to say when you pick up the items as well, although it's kinda all blurring together, so that last part might be wrong. You also gain xp through defeating enemies, using skills such as fishing, etc...

Through the xp system, you level up and gain a buff chosen from a few options each level (this part is reminiscent of the rewards system in the *Borderlands* series). Leveling up also unlocks item recipes, from weapons to clothing to persistent skills (such as lockpicking) to buff trinkets. However, to craft them, you need materials you've been collecting from destroying things and defeating enemies. Additionally, one resource category is food items, which can then be combined using recipes found during the game. These recipes create single use dishes that give permanent buffs.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2989074570

The Soulsborne aspects come into play with the campfire checkpoint system which also functions as character management, unlimited resource storage and fast travel location. You also find relay towers which are basically transport hubs which also give options such as allowing you to stop enemy respawn in an area. The combat is dodge strike dodge strike or the inverse, with a fair amount of strafing/circling necessary as well, although there is also limited ranged options also. If you die, you leave behind a skeleton from which you can retrieve any craftables you had on you at the time.

Speaking of craftable materials, you do have a limited amount of storage on your character for consumables as well as equipment slots. Your backpack can be upgraded. Your equipment slots upgrade automatically, periodically, as you level up. 

The world is actually quite vast and exploration is essential in completing tasks and progressing the story quests. There is also an initially steep learning curve which can seem daunting. 

It's been a lot of fun, but as mentioned at the start of this, I need to take a break. The destructible world definitely triggers an OCD need to do exactly that, but for me, it reached the point where it was becoming excessively compulsive lol.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2989074623

Anyway, TLDR. Really fun if hella grindy game. I feel it's worth a look and definitely worth a purchase during a future Steam sale. There is enough content just in the base game to probably get 80 hours out of the game, and you could probably sink another 20 hours into the Underworld DLC if you're thorough. I think I'll probably buy the other expansion during the Summer sale and use that as an excuse to get back to the game.

One thing a new player should be made aware of is that while fishing, you don't have to pull up the line for each fish, it auto pulls and recasts for you. I wish I had known that sooner. And if you are wanting to get 100% achievements, then don't worry about doing the [spoiler] Ark filling collection until you're already in the final Crown area, since the real prize in the Ark is locked and the key is in the Crown region.

- when you go to fireplace (checkpoint) you MUST WAIT until all the items will be transferred into storage box - ONE BY ONE!!!! (it's annoying at the endgame wher your eq it's much bigger than at the beginning)
- sometimes it doesnt matter where you clecked to throw a secondary weapon, the character doesn't throw where you clicked but where he currently looked (SOMETIMES! - there are no strict rules to care about xd)
- more about secondary weapons - if you throw a mine for example you'll see exactly where it will land, BUT if there is a obstacle it will jump in the different spot and SOMETIMES INSTANTLY KILL YOU. Why not showing where exactly it will land? (sometimes it looks like less than inch!)
- last quest after endgame - when i saw it i thought it's a joke. You need to spend more than 10 or 15 hours just to collect resources (i mean smashing everything) to fill the bunker and (probably) loose all this items just to complete the quest without any prize - i mean prize it's UNKNOWN xddd)

There are a couple of irritating things, but overall it's a solid game, puzzles are just difficult enough for a game like this. Progression is done well. Inventory management is mostly good (I don't like how it's handled in many games, so I'd know).
It has an interesting approach to backtracking, which doesn't make it a problem. I'd love to have fast-travel between campfires in the base game (it is a thing in DLC), but running from one side of the map to another also doesn't take that long.

Discovering new areas and upgrading enough to smash through Barries is genuinely fun.  A good discount buy. A few things:

It's not open world. It is a maze with a few very clear paths it forces you down. YMMV.

It's not a crafting game. You can make two machines which turns some stuff into other stuff, and there's some cosmetic crafting. That's it. Upgrading gear does requires mats but to me that's not crafting.

The game rewards relentless exploration. At times trying to find a particular object or landmark made Dysmantle feel more like a hidden object game than an open world game.

Combat is very easy. Over time I developed a large arsenal of weapons I never needed or used.

I got to the end and then discovered that to finish the game I had to do a bunch of side quests which I skipped because I didn't enjoy them. That made the endgame drag for me.

Overall, I was ready to be done with this game about ten hours before I finished it.

The premise is interesting enough. Fight zombies and mutant zombies, take apart the environment so you can build tools, structures, items, and cook dishes for permanent stat boosts. And, ultimately, escape the island.

There's a few good points to this game I enjoyed:

1. The crafting system was relatively simple and easy to understand. You have tools/weapons that can cut, and tools/weapons that can smash. Just about every object in the world can be destroyed by cutting or slashing it hard enough; sometimes either works. You collect a relatively small variety of materials from the stuff you cut and smash, which means it's not hard to accumulate stuff for building or upgrading. Some things can only be reliably gained through structures that synthesize lesser materials into better materials (Lumber, Titanium, and Mana Chunks), so there is a bit of a bottleneck in the game until you learn to make those structures and accumulate the materials/fuel to make these. Still, overall this part was pretty enjoyable, and I found myself demolishing entire houses with glee.

2. The story is fairly interesting, and isn't your run of the mill ""Oh no the zombies are here run and survive"" type setting. All dialogue in the game is a product of either the main character's musings, ancient murals, or tape recorders. With the exception of the main character, most of the voice work is kind of... well, lame, but there's a reason for it. Some important elements of the story, such as Mana, should have been worked into the setting much sooner than it was, because I was able to find Mana Beads before I even knew there was a storyline reason for them to exist. But still, overall a short and relatively fun story. Nice vocal tracks once in a while, too.

3. There's a ton to explore, plenty of secrets too. There's several ruins you can go into and solve puzzles to gain a fairly rare but versatile item as a prize. I was always pretty curious to see what was around the next bend or down the path. There's environmental hazards as well that you need to create items/clothing to deal with, and with the exception of the Gas Mask I found this a tolerable and sometimes interesting hazard to deal with.

There's a few drawbacks to this game that made it a bit of a chore for me to finish:

1. Good GOD the combat controls are weird. I'm not a real Yakuza, so I didn't use a gamepad, perhaps that was my failing for trying mouse/keyboard and sticking with it. The general formula for combat is, walk up to enemy, hit them from behind, if not dead or able to hit from behind, back up until they stay in place and swing at the air, then walk up to them and hit them again, repeat last two steps until dead. 

The reason the controls are weird is because I cannot for the life of me figure out what prompts my character to aim. You'd think it would be where the mouse is pointing, and that does general seem to encourage him to attack/throw/shoot in that direction. But if you're moving, for some reason he sometimes forgets about aiming entirely and just seems to attack/throw in an almost random direction. Also, once he auto-targets an enemy, he will not be dissuaded by the three other enemies that just ran up and started clawing for him; he will face that same enemy until either it is dead or he is. 

On that same note, enemies with ranged attacks have an almost ridiculously inconsistent aiming AI. Sometimes they'll toss projectiles nowhere near your direction, other times they will lock onto you with pinpoint accuracy to the extreme of being able to predict where you're moving and track you without error. The combat quickly wore out its welcome, with the exception of a couple interesting boss fights.

Speaking of, 75% of bosses in this game are just bigger/angrier versions of regular enemies. Go fig.

2. I know what I said before about exploring, but honestly the island could have been half the size and I would have been happy. There's way too much wasted space in this island, and with zombies/mutants every ten to twenty paces it quickly becomes a chore to go anywhere. This gets more extreme the farther out to the edges of the island you go, with vast stretches having enemies, trees, rocks, and nothing else.

3. The bottlenecks I encountered in this game may or may not have been simply circumstantial, but I found them exasperating nonetheless. Getting the Gas Mask was easily the most tedious and boring part of the game, as you need it to explore about half of the remaining island but there's no directions on where it is unless you decided you wanted to explore the jungle in the southern part of the island much earlier than logic dictates. Further, I know lumber and titanium are rare materials, but why are the recipes for building the structures that make these so hard to track down? It just makes you stick with the wrench and the machete for much longer than game balance would have you do so.

4. Saving the best for last here: 

TOWER DEFENSE IS THE WORST MECHANIC IN THIS OR ANY OTHER GAME EVER CREATED. 

Seriously, this game would not have suffered in the slightest if the current iteration of shelter/pod defense was scrapped before release. Not only is one rare material needed for turrets incredibly hard to find (You get around 12-15 in the entire game and turrets take one or two each depending on what you build), but the difficulty of the defense sections is ball-breakingly hard. Even if you only have enough materials to build one turret, the game thinks it's fair to throw two waves of about 500 enemies each at you to teach you the folly of trying to play these sections without a veritable wall of turrets ready to go. There's only one portion of the main story where the tower defense mechanic is required, and it is easily the most frustrating part of the entire game. Seriously, this would turn me away from the game if I knew it was a thing before playing as far as I did into it.

As for the graphics the style is great, everything fits together very well, the fighting, building, crafting etc is all very well put together and enjoyable, nothing feels like an annoying boring task. The only major downside is the lack of any online multiplayer at all, however the fact it even has local co-op is a blessing in this day and age.

Rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐

Dysmantle is a thrilling PC game that immerses players in a post-apocalyptic world of chaos and discovery. With its vast open-world setting, satisfying combat mechanics, and addictive scavenging gameplay, Dysmantle offers a unique and engaging experience that will keep players hooked for hours on end.

One of the standout features of Dysmantle is its expansive and visually striking open-world environment. The game world is filled with desolation and remnants of civilization, creating a sense of eerie beauty. The attention to detail in the environment design is commendable, with each location offering a distinct atmosphere and challenges to overcome. Exploring the vast landscapes and unraveling the mysteries of the world becomes an exciting and immersive adventure.

The combat mechanics in Dysmantle are satisfying and impactful. Armed with an array of weapons, players engage in intense encounters with various enemies that roam the wasteland. The combat system strikes a good balance between skill-based combat and strategic decision-making, providing a sense of empowerment and challenge. The ability to dismember enemies and use their body parts as resources adds a unique twist to the gameplay, making each encounter thrilling and rewarding.

Scavenging and resource gathering are at the core of Dysmantle's gameplay loop. Players must explore the world, gathering materials and crafting resources to survive and progress. The crafting system is well-implemented, allowing players to create useful tools, weapons, and equipment to aid their journey. The addictive nature of scavenging and the constant drive to find valuable resources and hidden secrets keep players engaged and motivated to explore every nook and cranny of the world.

The progression system in Dysmantle provides a satisfying sense of growth and improvement. As players defeat enemies and complete objectives, they gain experience and unlock new abilities and skills. This sense of progression enhances the feeling of becoming more powerful and capable in the harsh post-apocalyptic world.

Furthermore, Dysmantle features a compelling story that unfolds gradually as players explore and interact with the environment. The narrative is intriguing, with intriguing lore and mysteries to uncover. While the story may not be the central focus of the game, it adds depth and context to the world, making it more immersive and engaging.

However, Dysmantle does have a few areas that could be improved. The enemy variety, while decent, could benefit from more diversity to keep combat encounters fresh and challenging. Additionally, some players may find the resource gathering and crafting mechanics repetitive over time, as the core loop remains relatively unchanged throughout the game.

In conclusion, Dysmantle is an impressive post-apocalyptic PC game that offers a vast and immersive open-world experience. With its satisfying combat mechanics, addictive scavenging gameplay, and intriguing story, it provides a thrilling and engaging adventure for fans of the genre. While there are areas that could be improved upon, Dysmantle is a game that offers plenty of exploration, destruction, and survival to keep players entertained and enthralled.

The EA process on this has been, as far as I'm concerned, a gold standard for clarity and frequency of updates. The world is well designed, and paced well. Your main loop is looking for whatever resources are needed for your next upgrades, while being selective with your battles... and increasing the range of things you can scrap and foes you can fight and places you can safely go.

You have a pretty steady drip feed of stuff you can make progress towards, and places to explore. And unless you get close to too big a foe, or too many, it's pretty chill. Pro-tip, you don't have to click anything while fishing. You just... start, and your little guy will take care of it.

Edit: 2 DLCs and 70 hrs and I finally finished it. Bit of a slog on the back end, when you've run out of reasons to hoard stuff, it loses that little dopamine hit from getting a load back to camp.

The game offers the familiar Open World Survival Crafting experience, this time in a brightly colorful, isometric post-apocalypse that is quaintly welcoming despite the zombies. Some of the zombies can be quite a challenge. But most of them won't, especially as you get more levels. Caution is the key. There isn't a classic stealth mechanic; but the zombies have limited detection ranges (which you can truncate further with the right equipment), so coming up behind them for a power attack is the best way to deal with most threats.

Side note: The trailer can be misleading. I've played over 38 hours and have yet to unlock the rifle.

I love some of the mechanical decisions. For example, you carry weapons, armor, headwear, special items and trinkets. The number of weapons, special items and trinkets you can carry is determined by how many you have crafted. This encourages you to craft unlocked blueprints even if you do not plan to use the items just to progress towards better equipping capacity. ""Special items"" are consumables like throwing knives and bandages: you have a certain number of uses. These uses replenish at a campfire. You do not have to keep crafting replacements for the ones you use. I think that's brilliant. 

Likewise, some things are a ""feature"". You craft it once to permanently gain the item's ability. Crafting a cooking stand will allow you to cook at campfires (rather than having to find stoves in the wild). Craft a lockpick and your ability to pick locks is now set to yes. No breaking lockpicks and crafting more. Nor is playing a mini-game required.

After thirty-eight hours, I still don't know what the story is. But I'm convinced that there is one... a story being slowly revealed piece-by-piece. Not only through environmental storytelling and snippets of radio broadcasts, but through the mechanics themselves. There are ""souls-like"" campfires where you respawn at the last one you camped at when you die. And your character is not unaware that this is happening. Likewise, the respawning of the monsters appears to be a phenomenon that is recognized in-universe. There is a mystery here that has me intrigued...

However, the story isn't revealing itself fast enough to hold me after the grind has worn thin. The game is big with the grind. 

[i]Dysmantle[/i] knows the successful gameplay loop for OWSC games and delivers it with both challenge and progress given out at the right pace. However, its adherence to the staple mechanics of the genre can come at the cost of immersion. For example, it is standard in games like this that you can upgrade your gear. And that subsequent upgrades require higher-tier materials. But when you have a limited number of materials for each tier...

Why does the next upgrade for my baseball bat require electronics? Why does upgrading my cowboy hat call for lumber?

Another example: the gimmick of the game is that you can break down everything in the world, turning it into materials for your crafting (and eventually building). Since boulders require more powerful tools to break apart, stone is a rarer material and used in higher-level upgrade recipes. Forgetting that this is [i]stone[/i] -- small rocks should not hard to come by.

(Perhaps if I was doing major construction, I could see a need for the rocks I use to have been acquired from dismantling bigger rocks, but for meeting the stone material requirement to upgrade baseball cards, I... wait, why do I need stone to upgrade baseball cards?!)

Yet despite the occasional, genre-mechanics-driven ludicrous elements, I played for over thirty-eight hours without regret. By the end of that time, I had located a campfire adjacent to a fast-travel point, cleared the zone of monsters, and installed a device that prevented monsters from respawning in the zone. I had taken over the nearby structure and turned it into a refining station with a smelter and a sawmill creating certain very rare materials out of lesser ones to order. I had expanded the crop field of a nearby farm and was producing more crops than I would likely ever need. 

I bought this game on sale, and I have gotten my money's worth. If Open World Survival Crafting is your jam, and you have the chance to get the game on sale, it really is worth the purchase.",1687068272,1687068717,True,9,0,0.647731602191925049,0,True,False,False

My biggest problem is that almost all my deaths are cheap deaths by turrets and traps. The gun turrets instantly kill you when you get close, while the rocket ones fires across the screen with some random targeting that hits you even if you are actively dodging. Some of them are placed with purposes, like forcing you to find a alternative path, which are fine; but a lot of them are just annoying for the purpose of being annoying. And most of the traps are just sucker punches (except the for sanctuary ones which have a story). The Crown is the like the epitome of such cheap death designs, which is sad for being the finale of the game.

Other problems include stopped running after attacks (I pressed shift for like thousands of times), view-blocking by the trees (especially in the jungle, where there is no way to rotate the camera for not being blocked), and ridiculous locked up auto-aiming (why am I locking up to a deer when I have a fishing stick in hand? And why do I suddenly turn around and hit another approaching enemy while giving up the one that I was in the middle of killing, even with my cursor on it?) Some of these situations are simply rage inducing.

On the bright side, there are plenty of efforts reducing the backtracking and repetitive grinding which is nice.

They fixed the resolution bug but there still is no resolution between 1080p and 4k. At least you can pick 4k instead of 5k if you want to play at 20FPS. :)
That's the other thing, now it's an Apple Silicon native app. That (?) increased performance a little bit. It still 30FPS at 1080p on my M1 with decent, to my eyes, visuals, but input lag is good and the game is more than playable. 
I still don't feel I would recommend to play it on a base M1 if you have any other better alternative, but as it stands now it's not a terrible experience at all.
Because of that I'm changing my review to a thumbs-up.

Original review:
I played the game start to finish on console and I liked it so much I wanted to be able to play on the Deck too. 
It runs great on the Deck, but when I tried on my Mac (M1) it runs so poorly I wanted to warn Mac users. 
For starter It doesn't seem to detect the correct resolution when my MacBook has the internal screen on. It shows 5K in the selection instead of the 4k resolution of the external monitor. 
More so, no resolutions available between 1080p and 5k/4k. 
On top of that, it runs at 10FPS at 4k and 30 at 1080p. Unless you set low details, but at that point the graphics is quite grainy and ugly. To my eye at least.
Maybe on Mac with Intel is better, it’s an Intel binary, but still. If you plan to play on Mac, take what I experienced into account.

The Good
- Very very expansive.  Large world of things to whack.
- Nice progression of skills, tools and abilities.
- Clean nice looking graphics.  Not fancy, but functional and well done.
- More variety than I expected.  Farming, defender sub-game, upgrading, puzzles, speed racing, quests etc.
- Good variety of items and need to optimize what you carry in different situations
- Story and quests are pretty decently engaging.
- A few tough challenges along the way

The Not So Good
- Combat for the most part is easy and you mostly face the same baddies. 
- After you level up, most of what you will face isn't challenging

It is a pleasantly grindy loot-gathering ARPG with Dark Souls style bonfires, dodge rolls, an engaging storyline, and terrain puzzles (how do I get there from here). The combat is simple, and the grind isn't too bad. The game provides conveniences like fast travel and the ability to prevent enemies from respawning. It's a fairly mindless loot-gathering ARPG where you can smash everything.

There is almost no survival game play, just temperature. Crafting is very linear. There is a system for base building, but I'm 30+ hours in and haven't had much use for it.

The controls are quite odd, so here's a few tips to make it feel more conventional.

* Bind Rotate Camera control to the right mouse button.
* Bind Run to something convenient like a spare mouse button.
* Turn on Run Toggle.
* Turn off Autolock To Enemies.

Like a lot of games, there's no reason you shouldn't always be running. For some unfathomable reason, you'll stop running after you kill an enemy you have locked. When fighting a group, suddenly you can find yourself walking in the middle of combat.

the devs of this game have winnowed in expertly on the precise science of perfectly-timed dopamine hits and addictive progression systems.  before playing, i asked myself 'does the world need another zombie game?' certainly not.  'another post-apocalyptical survival RPG?' nope.  for whatever reason, i gave Dysmantle a try . . . and that was the end of my free time in May 2023.

you start off breaking stuff and beating back the undead with just a crowbar.  120 hours later you are equipped with everything from a sledgehammer to grenades and multiple dare-i-say superpowers like time manipulation and teleportation devices.  between those two extremes, Dysmantle doles out progress in the most delicious, compulsive morsels that keep you playing just 10 more minutes, just 10 more minutes, until it's 4am and you gotta work in a few hours.

complaints on Steam about the 1st DLC, Underworld, mostly revolve around the fact that it lacks that sense of slowly-emerging progression and strengthening of the protagonist and his gear.  I played Underworld simultaneously with the base game (from around level 28 onwards), so I didn't have that experience at all.  for me, those insanely satisfying moments of progress kept coming throughout my play, whether i was exploring the Underworld map or the base game's main island.  that being said, i can see where someone who had completely maxed out their character's stats in the base game prior to starting Underworld might have found the expansion a tad flat.  hopefully my review will help at least one future player from that fate!

the 2nd DLC, Doomsday, takes the setting and mechanics of Dysmantle and applies them to a new archipelago near the main island, with a bunch of interesting new enemies, new collectibles and craftables, and — best of all, in my opinion — a whole whack of environmental puzzles!  whereas straightforward puzzle-solving in the main game was primarily comfined to the 21 Tombs strewn throughout the map, in Doomsday it's much more streamlined into the game itself.  much of the progress and dopamine hits are hidden behind tasty electric circuitry puzzles.  this shiz is right up my alley!  the Doomsday DLC also seems to have been better received across Steam reviews.

i would recommend Dysmantle and its DLCs to pretty much any gamer, because it's bound to have something that will appeal to everyone.  just look at the game's official description: ""Explore. Fight. Level up. Survive. Gather. Craft. Harvest. Hunt. Build. Farm. Solve puzzles. Fish. Cook.

- The game includes a large amount of grinding, especially if you wanna do everything and uncover the whole map. But even if you stick to the main story and a few side missions, there's still lots of grinding to be done. Keep that in mind if you aren't a fan of that.

- There are some Souls-like mechanics (e.g. bonfires, monsters respawn when you rest - but there is a way to stop that per region of the map, after dying you can pick up the loot you were carrying from your dead body, rolling to dodge attacks, regular attack and power attack), but combat is not at all Souls-like, it's extremely easy and not the focus of the game - also the variety of monsters and the challenge they pose isn't big at all.

Cons: There's a lot of grind to it and you can easily get frustrated when you can't get where you want to because the path is blocked or when you realise a side quest is actually necessary to finish the main quest (without a way to differentiate other than googling). Some of the enemies have an awfully high/loud screech which can be painful if you're neurodivergent so you might wanna turn the sfx/voice volume down. You need to complete the Underworld DLC to unlock the best form of fast travel.

Pros: SMASH! Unlocking better weapons to smash more things is fun. By end game/post game (if you do the right side quest) you can smash or slash your way through pretty much anything. You can pet deer and they'll follow you/fight with you. You can build a whole brick wall house by the end if you have enough materials and build limit. Strangely addictive.

If you want a nice ""zone out"" game, it mostly services and there's even a little bit here or there if you want to engage a bit more.  It's fun to break stuff, the progression of breaking stuff to upgrade your equipment to break more stuff works well enough, and it's built a world just interesting enough to explore.  My criticisms are harsh, but they sit atop a mostly harmless game whose biggest crime is just being okay.  I assume most people will ultimately find it fine.  Still, Dysmantle is one of those games that Early Access likely did more harm than good.

Yeah yeah yeah, I can ""feel"" the heated, angry steaming vapors from incredulous fanboys for saying that. Rage if you must, but Dysmantle is overly long and packed with pointless features stemming from pressure to be more like other games in whatever genre this is.  Farming, base building, and even tower defense are chucked in here with little rhyme or reason.  It gives the game a very ""Shareware syndrome"" feel.  That is, the first part of the game was developed without ""fan"" intervention and has the best content, progression and ideas.  A lot of the mid-to-late game plays like an obligation.  Now, credit to the devs for doing what they could here.  Each biome has a ""feel"" to it. The hot and cold biomes are conquered identically, but the need to use certain items *does* break up what has by that point become very routine.  There's a nice bit of map interconnection as well with shortcuts to open up and connect previously separated areas.  It's not amazing, but these are the ideas that make it work.

What doesn't work is that Dysmantle runs out of content about halfway through its runtime.  This is made worse by it running out of *ideas* halfway before that.  It honestly feels like Dysmantle was meant to be maybe half as long, and after some success in early access the developers did what has long sunk success in early access: expanding their original idea into a much larger one.  Luckily, it mostly worked out.  The game wasn't ruined by it's excesses, but it really doesn't benefit from them.  There's just a much better ten-to-twenty hour experience here.  Being ""too long"" is a weak criticism, but running out of content is a much stronger one.  Even so, as I said at the top, the worst crime the game commits is just being ""fine.""

Me, and so many others love it. It suits us OCD collectors down to the bone. Of course, the reviews that are not so kind are the haters, not the lovers, which stands to the obvious feelings toward any game you play.

The proof in the pudding is the amount of thumbs up rather than the thumbs down.

I need to absolutely destroy everything. If I cant because my weapon needs an upgrade, than I toddle off and grind away, blasting everything in sight, until I can upgrade, and then go back and finish off the job, until there is nothing standing.

I am thankful that the combat doesn't really require the COD accuracy. if it did I would put the game down, I cannot aim for you know what, and get very irritated very quickly when i am re spawning every 2 seconds. Auto-aim is just not an option I always feel its cheating somehow. Every-one to their own I guess!

This game is HUGE!, and with the recent DLC, there is enough variety for even the most critical mind. You will  be playing this, the lovers that is, until the proverbial cows come home.

I might have the world record for greenery in my inventory, I just cannot pass anything that is breakable, without breaking it. I have tried, but the pull is stronger than Geoff Capes in a tug-of-war with me.

I am happy there is controller support, my preferred method of input for this type of deal, sit back in your oh so comfortable chair, and get cracking.

I do not want to bore any-one with describing the game play in detail, there is no need, its a grind fest, farming, combat, upgrading,cooking, fishing, decision making, exploring bonanza, and that list is not exclusive by any means.

Well done to the Devs, IMHO, one of the better outings for this genre, by a country mile...Thank-you, its a joyous, mindless in the best way, taking you away from the real life grind game. Highly recommeded.

progression comes down to you dismanteling (yeah...it's in the name) everything not fast enough to run away and i do mean absolutly everything. 
chairs? beds? walls? cars? doesn't matter, beeing it enemies, wildlife or scenery everything yields ressources which in turn allow you to upgrade your gear, craft completely new gear, cook (permanent buffs) or build a little base (later on).
ontop you gather exp for everything: killing mobs, gathering, building, even stashing your ressources in your storage box. 
you level up which unlocks higher tiers in the pretty expansive ""talent""-tree (pretty much a blueprint-tree and similiar to rogue-games a randomized upgrade (presentet as cards offering permanent upgrades).
new tools also allow you to open new paths.

the map is also hughe, even more so with the dlcs. but it's not just size. the gameworld has been carefully crafted, offering a pretty clear main-quest and side-quest aswell as sorta enviromental goals which also feed into the overall progression, like achievments which also grant you exp-rewards.

all of this in a pretty to look at world (very colorfull), which still should be able to run even on a toaster ).

Also some very difficult  mini games.  The bosses and minigames require extreme precision and successfully completing several sections in a row without fail.

Let that sink in.  You make many attempts to complete the first section, and finally succeed.  Then, you DON'T get 15 tries to complete the second section; you fail and go back to the first section. With three or more sections, it was mathematically impossible for me.

It was fun just to play the beginning and middle sections.  I was able to defeat some of the bosses by avoiding them until I leveled up, became stronger, and had better equipment.  Sadly, I had to give up with just a few more requirements left to finish the game.  Weird- the first minigame you encounter was the most difficult for me.  Hundreds of attempts and I just don't have the coordination skills needed.


You cannot finish the game until you complete ALL the minigames.  


BONUS- there is a bug that disables sprinting each time you strike an enemy.  On the forums, the bug is acknowledged, but they aren't sure if they will fix it or not.  I guess they're too busy making DLCs.  If you barely make it through the combat sections, this bug is a killer.

Unlike most of the other negative reviews, I love the grind, as evidenced by my nearly 300 hours of play.  Bummed I could not finish the game, get the reward, and go back into the world and keep playing, keep building more structures.


I really can't understand why a fun, casual game would not consider adding difficulty levels so more people can play- without the frustration of getting very far in the game, only to be stopped by a minigame.

I do understand how games get completed, released, and multiple DLCs released without fixing bugs and known issues. They have been very successful with this title and format, congrats.",1628890732,1680807709,False,1,0,0,2,True,False,False

At first, I was a bit overwhelmed by all the different tasks I had to complete in order to escape the island. I mean, who knew that I would have to be a master fisherman and puzzle solver in order to make it off this wretched place?

But once I got the hang of things, I started to really goof around with the game. I mean, who needs to level up and survive when you can just spend all day harvesting and cooking delicious meals? I must have cooked up at least 50 cakes during my playthrough, much to the chagrin of my virtual waistline.

And don't even get me started on the crafting system. I spent hours just combining random items together to see what I could come up with. I think I ended up creating a pair of hammer-shaped sunglasses at one point, which was both hilarious and completely useless.

Some of its positives are:
- It's a large world with lots to explore
- Controls are simple but effective
- Equipment variety and collectables feel valuable most of the time
- Sound design is acceptable
- Art style works well
- World feels very well crafted and lived in

Some of its issues are:
- Game is very grindy. As its title suggests, there's a lot of destruction used to gain resources and I had to destroy multiple entire towns down to their foundations to get enough resources for all the game's mechanics.
- Base building is kinda underwhelming. Your build limit is pretty low, even at its max, compounded by some items taking multiple points to place. Ended up removing most of my 'base' to make room for more utility items (need quite a bit of build cost to make a halfway decent farm). Would have liked to see the base building mechanic limited outside of the 'build area' the game provides you and unlimited within its bounds.
- A lot of the equipment is useless, mildly situationally useful or should have just been given as passive bonuses (looking at you fishing lure). Equipment slots are limited but you can swap most of it any time you want so it became a chore swapping out fishing lure or element resistance or 'poison' resistance equipment all the time for their situational bonuses.
- Enemies get pretty samey pretty quickly. There are only 12 enemy types (excluding bosses) and only 9 of which you see regularly so the game is absolutely packed with fodder that, after you get the [spoiler]axe equipment[/spoiler] a third of the way through the game, feel pretty overused and underwhelming. I rarely felt threatened by anything other than the Mutated Hurler and only then because their attacks were fairly random and could 'accidentally' hit me some times despite my best efforts.
- The story is weird and doesn't really come to a satisfying conclusion. There are hints as to what it might be but few of the game's mysteries are actually resolved by the end.

Steam says 65 hours at time of review but I'd put it closer to 40 actual hours with a lot of it spent idling in the background. I don’t regret the playtime and do hope 10tons tries again. Though, for the love of all that's holy, make run a toggle or something next time. My poor thumb can't take holding a button down for almost 40 hours…

In this game, you play as a character who is stranded on an island after a mysterious disaster. The island is full of debris and abandoned buildings, and you must scavenge for resources to survive and craft weapons to defend yourself against monsters and mutants.

The graphics in ""Dysmantle"" are beautiful, with a colorful and cartoonish style that makes the post-apocalyptic world feel more light-hearted and fun. The sound design is equally impressive, with a soundtrack that will have you humming along as you chop up mutant creatures with a frying pan.

Gameplay-wise, ""Dysmantle"" is a lot of fun. You can smash everything you see with a hammer or other weapons to get resources, and you can craft new items and weapons to upgrade your character. The game's combat is simple but satisfying, and it's always satisfying to take down a particularly nasty mutant with a well-placed blow.

One of the most entertaining aspects of ""Dysmantle"" is the ability to upgrade your character's skills, such as the ability to carry more items or move faster. It's always satisfying to see your character become more powerful and efficient at scavenging.

Overall, ""Dysmantle"" is a game that will have you laughing and having fun while surviving in a post-apocalyptic world. The game's beautiful graphics, fun soundtrack, and satisfying gameplay make it a must-play for anyone who enjoys a good survival game.

However, the game is not without its flaws. For example, sometimes the items you need to progress can be difficult to find, and you may find yourself wandering around the island aimlessly. But that just adds to the humor and frustration of being stranded in a post-apocalyptic world.

In conclusion, ""Dysmantle"" is a game that will have you feeling like a post-apocalyptic MacGyver as you craft weapons and scavenge for resources. It's a game that doesn't take itself too seriously and is sure to have you laughing as you bash mutant creatures with a frying pan. So if you're looking for a fun and entertaining survival game, ""Dysmantle"" is definitely worth a try.

846770,135538680,76561199230938895,40,6,605,0,605,1679863681,"In DYSMANTLE, players control a survivor who emerges from an underground shelter after an unknown disaster has devastated the world. The game is set on a sprawling open world filled with dangerous creatures, mutated plants, and abandoned buildings. The player must explore the world, scavenge for resources, craft weapons and tools, and fight enemies to survive.

One of the unique features of that game is its dismantling mechanic. Instead of simply collecting resources, players can dismantle various objects found in the game world, such as cars, houses, and even trees. This allows them to gather materials in a more efficient manner and craft more powerful items.

Overall, the game offers a unique take on the post-apocalyptic genre with its engaging gameplay mechanics and beautiful hand-drawn graphics.

While the game is generally well-received by players and critics, there are some negative aspects to the game that some players may find problematic. Here are a few potential drawbacks to consider:

 - Repetitive gameplay: Some players may find that DYSMANTLE's gameplay can become repetitive over time, as the player must constantly scavenge for resources and fight enemies in order to progress. This may lead to a sense of monotony or boredom, particularly for players who are not fans of the survival or action-adventure genres.

- Slow pacing: DYSMANTLE is a relatively slow-paced game, with a focus on exploration and crafting rather than fast-paced action. While this may be appealing to some players, others may find it too slow or lacking in excitement.

- Limited storyline: While DYSMANTLE has an intriguing premise and backstory, the game's actual storyline is 
  relatively limited. Players may feel that there is not enough narrative depth or development, which could make the game feel less engaging.

- Lack of direction: DYSMANTLE is an open-world game, which means that there is no set path or direction for the player to follow. While this can be liberating for some players, others may find it confusing or frustrating, particularly if they prefer more structured gameplay experiences.

I think this would be a stellar game for kids. It's simple, cheerful, well-polished, and has no hint of vulgarity.

But if you're expecting a survival game by the usual definition, you might be surprised to learn that food is something you eat once for a permanent stat upgrade, looting nets you simplified macro-ingredients such as ""plastic"" or ""wood"", and crafting is basically a skillpoint system in disguise that locks abilities and tools behind resource quotas. Oh, and there's Souls bonfires.

This is not a survival game. This is a survival-*themed* ARPG, where instead of battling your way through waves of monsters to gear and godhood, you beat the crap out of trashcans to make metal, and repeat until you have enough metal to unlock self-replenishing throwing knives.

None of what I described is a bad thing, and I think the game is made with the best of intentions. However, I got a wildly different impression of it from the store page. Even the name ""Dysmantle"" makes me picture a detailed disassembly every time I hear it, but only in hindsight do I now realize it's just referencing how you'll be smacking half the world into abstract chunks with your basic attack.

I don't feel misled or anything, but even looking around the store page in a new context, nothing about it gives me the impression that in this post-apocalyptic game with farming, fishing, and cooking... that it's impossible to starve, and those are actually stat treadmills.

Solid game, not my thing. Definitely play with emojis on.",1643456763,1679608907,True,0,0,0.518815934658050537,0,True,False,False

Doesn't mean its bad, but I think it's important to play it with that context to keep the simplicity of a lot of the systems from being grating.  I did not go in with that context, so I burned out trying to min-max too hard, as I'm used to more hard core games.  

That being said: I wish it focused more on its narrative and made the locations you visit more interesting to support this more casual approach.  I feel like if it's going to be cozy, exploration should reward you with story/character tidbits since the progression matters much less in the grand scheme.  More ""mini-mysteries"" and intrigue would've gone a long way to encouraging me to just take my time and explore instead of just grinding for upgrades to be a better murderer like I do in most survival games.  

Because without being propelled by the typical progression loop of most survival games, I didn't feel much pull to keep going forward, as I feel I've already seen everything the game has to offer at this point, and what will come later will be more of the same with higher numbers.  I get a lot of games end up in this bucket, but they're usually mechanically deeper and thus more fun to engage with.  This game's very simple, for better and for worse.

All that said, it does enough right that I can still recommend it if you just want to turn your brain off and chill (I like the art design, some of the enemy design, etc).

3. The story. It's very unique, has a really nice plottwist and makes sense in the end. Beside that you have small sequences with music which feel really fitting.

The game takes place on a deserted island where the player character wakes up after a catastrophic event. As the player navigates through the island, they must scavenge for resources, craft tools and weapons, and battle dangerous creatures.

One of the most impressive aspects of Dysmantle is its open-world design. The island is expansive, and the player is free to explore it at their own pace. The game encourages players to think creatively, using their wits and the tools they create to overcome obstacles and progress through the story.

The crafting system is also a highlight of Dysmantle. The player must collect various resources scattered throughout the island, such as wood, metal, and plants, to create weapons, tools, and shelter. The game offers a wide variety of crafting recipes, and the system is easy to use, making it easy for players to experiment with different combinations and find what works best for them.

Combat in Dysmantle is engaging and challenging. The player must learn the strengths and weaknesses of each enemy type and use their weapons and abilities to defeat them. The game offers a variety of weapons, from melee weapons like swords and clubs to ranged weapons like bows and firearms.

Another notable feature of Dysmantle is its art style. The game features a colorful and stylized aesthetic, with bright colors and bold lines. The environments are beautifully rendered, and the creatures and characters are well-designed and visually interesting.

Overall, Dysmantle is a fantastic game that offers a fun and engaging survival experience.

90 hours for $20 ain't bad. Smash everything you can. Get upgrades to smash more stuff. Clear the island of inhuman and nonhuman creatures. Then kick back in your beachfront cabin, think about your choices, pet the deer, and fish in the seas you emptied out — until the end of time.

Not technically how the plot wraps up, but that's how I decided to end it. See, as the story got closer to the end I decided I didn't like our protagonist very much, and I *certainly* didn't want to see him succeed at his goal of getting off the island. Not how he wanted to do it, anyways. Stepped away from the game for a bit, and then decided that was the right ending for the story. A few things left unsmashed, but so be it.

My island would stay clean forever.

After said time elapsed, all I could remember about it were my gripes, and so I'm gonna leave a just barely negative review.

From the top then. Dysmantle is a Souls-like Metroidvania– and I hear you say already, ""What are you on about? It's obviously a survival crafting open world game"".

Ah, that's what it looks like on the tin, but mechanically, it's basically a Souls-like Metroidvania. Your progress across the overworld is limited by what mobility upgrades you have, and you acquire them not by picking up a single, well, upgrade, but by collecting enough crafting materials to build them– essentially just splitting them up across the map. Then you have to bank your progress by reaching bonfires, consumables and enemies refresh when you rest, you drop everything on your body if you die, you dodge roll around a lot, and there's even an enemy tier up mechanic.

So what this means, really, is that all the stuff that might have drawn you in if you thought it was a regular survival crafting game– the gathering, farming, hunting, farming, fishing, and so on– it's all for show. They do not contribute to any survival mechanic whatsoever, as the game is proud to proclaim, but still brazenly decides to call itself a ""survival"" game anyway. What is really going on is that you're collecting mobility upgrades fragmented out over the map and locked behind hours of grind. It's telling that none of the resources respawn, except the stuff you get from killing enemies.

So that ""thrive, never starve"" motto? Yes, it's true, in the same way that it'd be true of Doom. There are no survival mechanics at all, which doesn't make this a genre-breaking survival game– it just makes it a different genre in disguise.

Other gripes. The main one is that, for a game where the main (and by far the most satisfying) gameplay loop is about destroying things, you don't get the wreck-everything weapon until literally after the main story has ended and after a massive grind. And THERE IS NO NEW GAME PLUS, which makes acquiring it almost entirely pointless. Way to suck all the fun out of what should have been a joyous experience.

Then there are a lot of mechanics that really shouldn't have been mechanics at all. The trinket system makes only partial sense; some of them boost rewards from, say, fishing, which by the way there's only a finite amount of fish on the map, so if you wanted to maximize your rewards from fishing you'd have to remember to keep swapping out the related trinkets. It would have been much better to make them permanent passive stat boosts instead of that silly system. Same goes for the environmental limitations- having to constantly switch between clothes is a pain and a half, especially with the interface. The farming is a pain and a half. Building is unlocked some hours in, is a ridiculous distance from the closest farming plot, and feels like it was included as an afterthought.

All these don't change that the core gameplay loop– breaking stuff– is extremely fun. They do, however, take a lot of the fun out of it, especially since some of the most blindingly obvious things that would have made the game a lot more fun are nevertheless missing. What, couldn't give us the big thwacky weapon a little earlier? Turn us loose in a new game plus with it? What about maybe an automatic grenade launcher? Faster running? Unlocking all bonfires as fast travel points?

Oh yeah, another gripe. Travel is so painfully slow that anything increasing your movement speed will eventually end up permanently on your body. I would willingly take environmental damage from wearing the wrong trinkets if that meant I could keep on the one that made me go faster.

Overall– great idea, excellent core gameplay loop, slightly misleading marketing, some glaring flaws, and a couple of hideous omissions that meant I ended my time with the game quite unsatisfied.",1677130506,1677130506,False,190,8,0.836626410484313965,0,True,False,False

Sometimes I just buy a game when it's on sale because it's recommend that I'll like it based on other games I've played. Most of the time that ends as a disaster because I didn't really pay attention to see if it was a game I might actually like. Dysmantle broke that trend, I have to admit 7+ hours in and I'm enjoying myself quite a bit. It reminds of the game How to Survive but with base building, a better leveling experience and lots of exploring. Dysmantle feels like it could have even been originally designed as a mobile game but was instead released as a PC game. Normally that also ends up being a huge down fall, nope not with Dysmantle. This feels like a fresh game with ideas borrowed from multiple other games and executed well. So yes, if it sounds like I'm giving 10tons a lot of credit, that's exactly what I'm doing. Now let's get down to the good stuff.

Pros:
*  Dysmantle has a lot going for it, exploration, limited crafting and base building, lots of loot to collect, lots of side quests, lots of secret areas and items to find. There truly is a plenty to do in this game AND the map is rather large, 7+ hours and I've barely scratched the service of exploring the map
* Interestingly enough, the game is simple yet at the same time it's challenging, there are puzzles and certain ways to deal with enemies in combat and in some cases avoiding them altogether. Dysmantle melds the simple and complex together to make it quite fun and addicting. There is always something new to find, the question is do you have the right tool for the job.
* What did I mean by the right tool for the job? Well in Dysmantle you can nearly destroy everything in the game. Buildings, forests, rocks, cars pretty much anything you see. You just need to acquire the right tool OR upgrade certain tools so that you can destroy more and more items for resources. For example, as you start there won't be a lot you can harvest for resources, you'll have to upgrade your crowbar. Once you do that, you'll be able to break apart bigger and bigger objects.
* Fishing is done automatically, once you've cast your line in the water. ( I WISH WOW HAD THIS FEATURE LOL)  
* The campfires which are your main source for accessing your character's items, perks and new recipes are actually very nifty. They serve as save points, places to sleep to acquire a buff, healing and restocking of supplies, storage and are also all over the map, so you won't have to struggle to find a save point. 
* I do appreciate infinite storage when you are playing a resource management game, but in Dysmantle's case, I really like the way it's done without having infinite space on your character. You'll have a certain amount of space that you can carry resources (which is upgrade-able) but after your bags are full you'll have to return to a campfire where you'll find a storage box. Everything will automatically be placed in your storage box by either accessing your box or using the campfire. So far what I've noticed is your storage box does hold a infinite amount, but from I can tell there is actually a finite about of resources in the game so maybe there is a limit but it's nothing you'd ever have to worry about. 
* The artistic style used for Dysmantle is actually impressive, you'd think in a post apocalyptic game it's going to be sad, dreary and full of death but actually there is something relaxing and peaceful about playing
* I don't know how many perks there are or how high you can level your character but each time you level you get to select a new perk. Examples you can get buffs for damage, fishing, cooking, gathering, building etc. It feels great to level each time, because you'll get to select a perk which is going to really help out. Also when you level, you unlock new recipes to build. This could range from trinkets, to weapons, clothes and bunch of other useful items. All these items can be crafted at your campfire or work benches. 

Cons:
* No customization for your character other than choosing different clothes as you acquire them, but they have different stats so most of the time you are going to wear what best suits you for how you are playing.
* Enemies are lacking uniqueness, there aren't but a handful of different enemies and the bosses are just up scaled versions of the normal enemies 
* Combat is extremely lackluster: attack, roll, attack, roll, attack, roll, maybe heavy hit if you have the chance (this does apply to ranged weapons as well). It really isn't fun, it's tedious and becomes boring after you've done it for a bit. This is probably the biggest disappointment for me. 
* I know this is a important mechanic for the game but, zombies continuously respawn every time you use the campfire unless you upgrade a tower that permanently keeps the enemies dead, however it'll cost you a very rare item to upgrade a tower and so far, at least how I've been playing, I haven't found but one of those rare items. There are multiple zones, with multiple towers so as you can imagine, there are loads of enemies that keep coming back. That's a little frustrating because you will use your campfire a lot, and having to repeatedly kill the same zombies over and over again starts to really drag down the enjoyment.
* I don't like how some things aren't explained and if they were, somehow I missed it. For example the timed crates. [spoiler] Basically, once you've used the campfire each time crate counts down in seconds before it locks. So, you have to pre-plan your route and use speed trinkets in order to get to a crate before it locks. If you don't make it, that's okay you can just reset it by using the campfire again. But the point is, there is ZERO explanation as to how that works. I had to look up a video on youtube in order to understand. My question is why? [/spoiler]

* Base building is worthless, there is ZERO reason to waste time base building because it does not help you at all. This is unfortunate but really doesn't take away from the fun factor. If this were to ever change, it could be a big deal and add loads more of replay-ability. 

Honestly, any of my grievances with this game are minor aside from the combat. I wish the combat was better. That by itself might be a reason I'd not recommend this game to someone, HOWEVER the game is too good on all other fronts for me to complain about one thing and let it ruin the experience. If you like to explore, build, collect resources and kill zombies then this game is perfect for you. There are hours upon hours to be spent on Dysmantle, so I don't see any issues with paying full price. It's worth it. Two thumbs up to

It's not the best survival craft game, but in the beginning I would have possibly recommended it as a way of introducing someone to the genre. In my opinion however, the main thing it had going for it was the local co-op aspect. Other than local co-op, there is no other reason to recommend this over the other more popular survival craft games on Steam. 


I do also have some serious criticisms which definitely pushed this review into the negative. The environments and building types don't really change too often; I wish there was a little bit more contrast in this regard because everything seems to feel the same after a while. The game becomes tedious because it doesn't really ever get much faster to accumulate crafting materials, yet at random times you will need a ton of the early-game ones. There is a serious lack of fast travel for a map that has so many roadblocks; this game needs the ability to fast travel between campfires and not just weird power stations which are in too few numbers to actually be useful for pushing the edges of your explored area. Due to some of the things I have mentioned, this game becomes a slog and not much fun to play, even for a survival craft game. It's still very casual, just really tedious. So that's going to be a nope for me, even though I think having local co-op in a survival craft game is kind of cool. If you're wanting an open world survival craft game with local co-op, go for Portal Knights instead (which has building as well).",1659548402,1673954262,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[hr][/hr]

Okay, maybe some detail is warranted.

It's light on the survival side: Dying drops a corpse with your undeposited mats (except a couple of limited-supply or quest things), dying while the corpse exists loses the old corpse and the mats it carried, and no other penalties.

There's a little grinding for materials, but my pack-rat tendencies meant that the only serious mat-grinding I did was for one of the post-main-quest weapons, and I really only had to knock down a half-dozen buildings, and clearfell a forest or two. The rest of the time, I knew what I needed to collect, and mostly collected it in-passing as I played.

There's an Ubisoft-level of points-of-interest; after 100 hours, I had 100%'d all but the ones that aren't physically visible on the map (fishing spots and buried treasure), and because I'd resurrected all the perma-killed monsters, search every square meter of the map (or just the waterways) was going to be a hassle. So that's parked for when I pick up the DLC and come back to it, next time I can afford to throw 10s of hours at a game.

[hr][/hr]

I had two heat-related crashes, i.e. not the game's fault, and in both cases I lost basically zero progress. Like, seconds or less. The only way I can see this working is if the game is doing some kind of continuous journal-based recording of every action you take (or world-state change you make), and then at ""save"" time (auto-save and save-on-exit), it's just processing that journal down into a data store for (I guess) each region or zone. The world was also seamless in movement, and notably fast in teleporting across the map, so whatever world-state streaming they're doing, it's [b]nice[/b].

And after the crashes, the game knew it'd crashed, and offered to submit the save game as a bug report if it wasn't a system crash.

Basically, it's the ext3 of savegames, and [b]everyone[/b] in this industry should be making this a minimum bar. It's very much a slap-your-own-forehead idea, and now I've seen it, I can't unsee the large gap in every other game.

(To be fair, other games that haven't suffered a system crash might have had the same feature, but I wouldn't know. I can't think of any other game I've played that [i]has suffered a system crash[/i] and lost zero progress, so this is the first time I recall benefiting from such a tech.)

I harp on about this both because I'm a video game developer myself, and appreciate a nice technical design, but also because it is a microcosm for something important that permeates the game and the discussion board, and is my meta-tl;dr review:

This game is a blast and it has earned the very positive review score on Steam.

It's the polish that really sets it above others in this genre. At it's core, Dysmantle is a pretty basic, straightforward concept - zombie apocalypse, you emerge from your shelter and you're trying to escape the island. You destroy a ton of stuff in order to craft other stuff; kill a bunch of zombies; explore the heck out of the island; uncover quests, ruins and puzzles; build a bit here and there; and improve your character to continue that journey. In that sense it's not unlike Don't Starve and similar games. But where Don't Starve is more of a pure survial game, Dysmantle is more action-oriented and much easier to enjoy. 

To me, what sets Dysmantle apart is its pacing. It starts off basic - how to destroy stuff and kill zombies. Then some crafting gets added in. Then quests. Then some tools. Then story bits. Then farming. Then fishing. As such, anyone can really pick up and play this game without having so many concepts thrown at you at once. The pacing feels spot-on. Every time things start to get a bit dull for me, there's a new area to explore, a new monster, a new craftable item, a new tomb or a new game play function to keep me interested. I'm still seeing new things 25 hours into the game and when things start to get easy, the difficulty curve bumps up a little. 

There's a real sense of progression in this game. I revisit old areas just to dismantle items I couldn't before becase my tools weren't good enough. Enemies that were tough will become easy but yet there's always another challenge around the corner. But there's also quick-travel to get around the map and when I revisit the old areas I feel more like a conquerer coming back to do some additional pillaging as I'm so much more powerful. 

Graphics and sound aren't awesome but they're fine. The art style is colorful and cartoony. The graphics are good enough to work. The camera is a top-down 3rd person view which works really well in this kind of title. The camea choice was well thought-out and something closer-in or 1st person would have ruined it. There's no real soundtrack which also works fine for me - I think background music might have gotten old and this is one of those rare titles where I like to listen to my own music while smashing refrigerators and zombie heads. If there's a real weakness in this title it's in the sound design but I'm not troubled by it.

The controls aren't difficult to master and the UI is easy to navigate. While I've played games with tighter controls, I'm not having any problems with them being too mushy. When I die, it's not due to the controller (which I rarely use). It's because I'm old, I've done something stupid and I not longer have the twitch skills to recover from my stupidity. So I get sent back to my last campfire and have to engage in a short corpse run. I must have done that a thousand or more times in WoW, so this doesn't faze me and it's not much of a penalty. Death really isn't very punishing and that encourages the player to continue to explore and push their boundaries. 

Now like other games of this genre, some may find it grindy. After all, the game is about exploring a very large map, destroying pretty much everything and crafting better items to continue the journey. It's not a creative game and it's not particularly deep but it doesn't need to be if you like the gameplay. If you don't the game will get pretty stale for you. I'm always seeing something new so I'm not getting bored. 

In fact, what Dysmantle reminds me of is the original Diablo. Wait, what? You heard me. Diablo's gameplay loop wasn't deep - there was a thread of a story tying the systems together, exploration was the real point of the game and it just was exceptionally well polished with an addictive gameplay loop. Dysmantle has some simlar characteristics as the original Diablo and that's high praise - tight gameplay loop, continual character progression, loose narrative thread and I want to load it up again to see what's around the next corner. Note that I'm not saying Dysmantle is an all-time classic. It just has a similar feel to me and it's addictive. 

If you're still on the fence after reading this, take a look at the reviews - even the recent ones - and look at the time played. You'll probably notice that most players have 30, 50 or even 100 hours played on a $20 title. That right there should tell you something because all too often you might see good scores but players walked away from the game after 5 or 10 hours. Not this one. People review it....and then keep playing.

tl;dr: Hesitantly recommended.

Dysmantle is, at its core, an open world survival craft game for a casual audience of the genre. You won't starve to death or be endlessly crating ammunition to take out the next group of enemies which personally appealed to me as someone who has never really enjoyed those aspects of the genre.

When I first emerged from my apocalypse bunker, a couple of things came to mind. 

Firstly, this game is really beautiful. That's not to say the graphics are realistic, they're not, but the art style is nice to look at and the lighting is fantastic; especially with the day night cycle although 'night' is hardly dark enough to notice. I really don't think there's anything they can improve on here. 10tons art director, take a bow. 

Secondly, ""what do I do?"". This can be both a positive and negative. I quite enjoy a game that doesn't hold my hand with quest markers but unfortunately that's not what this is. There are plenty of quest markers to follow but I never felt like the main quest was a good balance of quest markers and self discovery. For example (minor spoiler but not really since the game lacks a real story), there's a part of the main quest where you have to collect fuel cells which are spread across the map. If you try heading directly to them, you'll realise the paths you wish you could take are blocked off in some way like a Souls game and you'll basically be using those on your way back instead. It seems to me that a better way would have been to direct you to somewhere along the path you actually should be taking and have you find clues to continue your search instead of just knowing the end destination.

However, the journey to these destinations is what really matters in Dysmantle. You'll find plenty of side quests along the way to do a variety of things from learning how to plant seeds, finding buried treasure, or killing a number of enemies within a time limit. Just an FYI for the devs on that last one: the timed enemy killing quests give way too long and make it feel like the time is unnecessary. I really enjoyed the little tombs scattered around the world that all contain a puzzle for you to solve although the reward is always the same and doesn't feel as satisfying as just completing the puzzle itself. I found myself excited whenever I came across one as it was a nice little break from the usual gameplay loop. 

The gameplay loop itself will consist of you breaking things and doing quests and then returning to the campfire/materials chest to level up. Levelling up is basically a perk system where you're given a random choice of passive boosts such as more hitpoints or faster fishing etc. These are nice and definitely make me want to return to the campfire as soon as I see that level up notification. The campfires themselves are plentiful so it's rare you'll struggle to find one less than a minute walk away. 

Dying is not much of a problem in this game. Most of your items will be dropped and kept on your 'corpse' from which you can recover them as long as you don't die again beforehand, again, much like a Souls game. You always seem to keep items of a certain rarity however which, although I was thankful for at the time, cheapened the experience and removed almost all elements of risk. I often used death as a convenient way to travel back to camp after completing a particularly remote quest. 

As for the game's namesake, this is where the game can become addictive. Being able to (eventually with the right tools), destroy almost every structure of the game world is truly fantastic and I became obsessed on occasion with completely wiping all traces of a structure from the map. Sadly, you can't remove the floors/foundations and the map will always show the original structures too which is disappointing. It's not enough to ruin the whole system but it definitely irks me enough to not want to fully clean the map as I may have felt compelled to do otherwise.

The building system is definitely to my personal liking as pieces are prefabricated and snap together. You can also build using materials stored in your chest without having to withdraw them which is nice but is also somewhat contradicted by a few of the 'repair' quests which do require you to have the items on your person. A strange choice when I can build something, using the same items the quest requires, right next to the quest objective directly from my materials chest, but I can't repair the objective with them. But, as mentioned previously, you're never too far from a camp so getting the materials isn't too tedious.

As much as I enjoy the building, it does seem to lack purpose. There's not much reason to sleep in the game (and you can do so at a campfire anyway), you can cook at a campfire (although cooking seems mostly useless in my experience), and there's not really much in the way of 'machinery' and the two I've used can be found, although perhaps more inconveniently, at easily accessible points on the map. You are able to build anywhere but it feels like you are expected to build in the suggested, purpose given area.

The combat is, in my opinion, fine but basic. You hit things with whatever tool takes your fancy or throw special items, like knives or grenades, at the enemies whilst you roll around. It becomes quite tedious at times as you basically hit > roll > hit or occasionally do a power hit if you get a moment. 

Speaking of the enemies, there is not much variety. You're mostly dealing with about 5 or 6 types, with no model variation within those types, throughout the game. The bosses are sometimes different but a lot are just scaled up versions of what you've already faced. I also ran into a few situations where the AI were so bad that they ran into a river (instant death) and I got a free boss kill.

The story and lore are very light. As someone with a low attention span, this usually suits me fine. There's no conversions to be skipping through as you're the only person on the island capable of speech more complex than screams. However, I found myself slowly becoming interested in the lore of the island which is mostly revealed to you via small notes or short audio clips which, although perhaps immersion breaking for some, don't fade out if I walk away which is nice in a game where I'm too busy walking around smashing things to stop and listen to the radio for 15 seconds. The tone of the game is very light for a game in the post-apocalyptic genre and fits with the bright cartoonish art style. I found myself missing the humour and/or social and political commentary of games like Fallout as Dysmantle doesn't really have any message but that's fine and may suit people who like to keep politics out of games. I do think the game would really benefit from more humour though. 

Something that I feel really needs improvement is the audio. Not the basic sounds which are fine. You hit a type of thing (brick, wood, skull of an enemy) and the appropriate sound plays. But there isn't any music for the most part and when there is, like when riding the trains, it felt so out of place and made the silence of the regular gameplay all the more noticeable because that's what accompanies you throughout this game. Silence. Now this may be a choice by the developer to make you truly feel like you're alone in nature with the only song you'll hear performed by birds (not to be confused with 60s Rock Band 'The Byrds'), but the fact that you do get music when fighting certain bosses or during the aforementioned train rides, makes me think it's for budget reasons. I truly believe this game would benefit from at least the option of an ambient soundtrack or something like Metal Gear Solid V's tape player, although obviously, for a developer of this size, with much lower royalty songs.

In conclusion, there's a lot of room for improvement but the game had a solid foundation and I'm excited about its future.",1672749678,1672749678,True,25,1,0.758190751075744629,0,True,False,False

I don't care for survival crafting games and yet Dysmantle managed to win me over.  That says a TON.  Don't Starve is the only other game in this genre that won me over and even then it was only for maybe 10 hours and not nearly enough to play that game through.

This game found that mix of progression and zen game play that kept me going forward.  By the time all meaningful progression came to an end I was having a good enough time with uncovering the map and doing the main quest that I still wanted to play to the end.  

I now know what kind of survival crafting game appeals to me.  Great work.  Recommended.  

The reason this is an 8 and not higher are for a few reasons that may not resonate with fans of the genre but did with me obviously.  

1) I strongly believe storage space needs to improved in these games.  By the end due to a late game item this was addressed but IMO that item should appear in the opening 10% of the game and not by act 3.  

2) Teleportation between campfires.  I see no compelling reason why this game demands so much backtracking.  I understand the DLC addresses this but not everyone buys DLC and it shouldn't be a paid feature.  

3) Increase weapon damage to items.  Dysmantling things is fun...but hitting things 7 or so times to break down certain objects wasn't.  Holding down the A button for so long during segments of this game became annoying.  Either consider a toggle auto-attack or make it so the max attacks to dysmantle anything is like 3.  Ideally do both because what harm would there be in that.   You could even gamify the dysmantle speed by giving it an RPG mechanic...as you break down something in particular the character gets more experienced at doing so and gradually goes from needing 7 hits to 6 to 5 and so on.  That would probably take something a bit tedious and make it a bit more fun.

4) Combat is average at best.  Its not the reason you play this game and ultimately becomes better than you'd expect going in but at no point was it great.

Genuinely, I cannot think of a game I've played that combines everything 10ton does here, and does it with such love. This a huge (and I mean HUGE) world they've created here, with so many secrets to uncover and things to do. It's astonishing that it all works as well as it does.

It's not a PERFECT game (for example, I could do without ALL the mountains/road blocks and specific, sometimes frustrating paths to get to where you HAVE to go), but I do understand the choices they made. They want you to explore. It's one of the main components of the game loop. It can be a bit much sometimes, but the exploration and the grind added to the fun for me. And it is a VERY grindy game, fyi.

Explore. Create. Build a unique base of operations. Craft and upgrade new and better tools and weapons to use. Kill monsters. LOTS of monsters. Uncover the mystery of the island. Who is the Crown? What part did they play? What is this super important looking tunnel that I can't access yet? What are these strange obelisks? There are ancient tombs to explore? How did all these humans become (many) various versions of monsters? And so, so many more things to uncover.

Ultimately, I would give the game an 8/10. Amazing, with a bit of room for improvement. But not too much, honestly. I hope 10Ton does more dlc, a sequel, and more games like this. Because right now, I can't find any games that offer every specific feature this one does.

The things I don't like:
* You can fall in the water or a crevice outside of combat (and die).  This is a design choice and I don't like it.  It's made worse by the fact that your 3rd person view is sometimes a pain to track because of trees/cliffs/etc.
* Breadcrumb quests - a bunch of them.  ""Get this thing over there""  You get there and there is a note that says ""moved it over there"".  You get to there #2 and find another note.  Once or twice is OK.  But there are too many.  And a few quests where an items is ""by this or that object"".  Here's the thing: you can break just about anything.  Did I break the stuff it was near?
* Completion quests - gather 10M of this that and the other and get a prize.  I kinda want the prize, but I'm not gonna fish.

The deal breaker:
I'm at the end of the game and I need a few of a rare resource - and I'm not sure how to get 'em.  What's worse is that I used a few on things I didn't really need - but there was no other use for 'em that I knew of.  So because I planned poorly for something I couldn't really know, I'm punished as a player.  Sigh.

However!  I did have a lot of fun breaking stuff up and crafting and all that jazz.  It's not a bad game - just a few bad design decisions and a lack of information.  If you're OK playing a game for a bunch of hours *but not finishing* then this is a good choice.  I like to finish games - though I do not need to complete all the bonus stuff.

It has a lot of storytelling and with tons of things to do which expands exponentially as you progress.
Pros:
- Relaxing
- Fun combat
- Easy to get into
- Good story
- Lots of playtime and exploration
- Online community has all the answers you need if you get stuck
- DEV has a clear idea what the game should be, and you notice it as you play

Cons:
- Only COOP is shared screen (just like the old console times)
- You have to revisit a lot, which some find tedious
- Relaxing (this is not the challenging hardcore survival game, if that's what you want)

Relaxing single player zombie survival in a dystopian world, meelee focused, with a good story and plenty of playtime.",1672055489,1672055489,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

DYSMANTLE is a game developed and published by 10tons Ltd

The game offers some nice graphics and a nice aesthetic, although some ugly glitches here and there, it is pleasant all the same

The game does suffer with some repetitiveness at certain areas of the game but a fun game nonetheless

DYSMANTLE overall, however, is a fun game to play, yet sometimes repetitive and it does get boring if being played for a long time, but is a very good open world survival game to play in short bursts!

It is deeply satisfying to destroy everything for the xp and resources and the overall progression of the gear isn't bad. The graphics are done well and the environments worth experiencing. All that being said, there's not much to guide you though the game progression besides best guesses and the internet. For example, I had to search online to find out that timed chests are completed by waking up at a campfire and immediately running to the nearest chest within the time limit. The game does get a bit repetitive and the hot/cold mechanics leave much to be desired (you work to get gear and upgrade it, but have to abandon it the moment you enter a hot or cold environment). Additionally, by the time you get the end game gear, there's little point in having it except for if you want to go through the tedium of destroying the whole map. I truly wish the devs and the game the utmost success. I hope they bother to read this and improve what has the potential to be a fantastic game.",1670205992,1670205992,False,5,0,0.583333313465118408,0,True,False,False

 what grinding catharsis is all about,

 obviously, completely ignore all the crazy reviews saying 'game has too much grinding', 

 __That's__ what the game is supposed to be __about__ (!!),

 I had this idea myself years ago, ""why all these weird survival games doing weird things when you should just be able to destroy and scavenge everything yourself?""

 ""It would be the perfect game for completionists and consolidators who love to clear everything in their path, and ideally have huge amounts of upgrading to just keep using all the stuff you collect.. "",  etc

 Well sure enough, finally somebody did it, and it's amazing

 Not only is the 'grinding' aspect phenomenal (says '99% of everything is destroyable', and they mean it),

 but also, equally important, they actually took the time to 'polish' everything so every little thing you do is fun, smooth and satisfying - 

 from the sound of when you destroy things to the ease of use of your storage boxes to the setup of the menus it's all there, rock-solid and spot-on smooth game-play.

 It's like the devs actually took the time to play their own game !   Imagine that, seriously

 Can't say enough good things about this game  (upgrading is great, combat is bang-on - you don't have to use extra items or get fancy skills to beat most of the enemies, since the controls and design of combat is fantastic,

 the 'extras' do help though and add to the sense of 'power' you get),

 Map is HUGE and nowadays that's a rarity - not only is the game's design great but it's actually 'big' and gives you a sense of excitement as you smash through everything knowing you're one step closer to 'total map domination' lol,

 It's fun yet relaxing, for the people getting sick of all the 'let-down' games where the pvp aspect is annoying, imbalanced game-play frustrating, 

 unpolishing game design unsatisfying and small scope unfulfilling - you found the game to play to actually relax, look forward to, and get a sense of satisfaction and completion as you play.

 It's best to relax to when you want some fun 'down-time' (to destress during the day or relax before bed),

 I'll be removing most of my reviews over time but this is one that will stay up, a game like this has been long over-due but the devs nailed it,

 better late than never, Amazing job devs!",1669880358,1669880358,True,0,0,0.486486494541168213,0,True,False,False

Still gonna try to be ""fair"" to it  

The Goods : 

- First 10 hours are good if not Great. You feel like you're progressing, you get stuff, you start to explore the world and you grow stronger.
- Some okay tunes in the game
- Has some interesting ideas at first ( like food recipes giving permanent bonuses ) 
- Game looks decent

The Bads :

- Story is inexistant at best and tries to go out with a ""plot twist"" at the very end to make it seems like it was much deeper than it is. You don't learn much about how or why it happenned, it just went bad and it's basically your fault. The end !
- Gear progression is a mess. Some tools are hidden behind specific quests that you might easily miss if you don't follow an unclear path (i.e Gas mask). Similarly, i spent about half my gameplay rocking the same gear since the only better weapons were locked behind the Endgame ( unavilable until you basically finish the game ... ). Made for boring combat 
- Combat is lackluster. Basically one of the thing you do the most through the whole game and it's just bad. 
Lock-on doesn't seem able to handle multiple zombies at a time, often ending with attacks whiffing or the character wildly circling trying to readjust his lock on. Same goes for ""strong attacks"" that can be a mess to pull out in a tight spot 
Enemy variety is also minimal. There's basically 12 ""different"" enemies in the game and most of those are ""variations"" of each other. Same applies to ""bosses"" which mostly are ""buffed"" normal enemies and / or reused 4 times with minor variations.
- Many quests are based on the "" go over there, LOL  you don't have a key, now go alll the way Over there instead, following a maze like path to drop the right drawbridges to get the key to unlock the same Boss fight you did the last three time !""
- So many systems seems to have been added ""last minute"" to potentially pad up content. 
""Tower defense"" sections that are mind numbingly boring
""Settlement building"" which is almost pointless since your ""house"" doesn't seem to have any mechanical effect in game. Sure it unlocks you a ""teleport"" that i never really had to use in 40 hours because the spot you end up is far from most good spots anyway ?
""Timed Crates"" that mostly just tell you ""you're too late !"". Don't recall seeing any info In game explaining what those are.
- Whoever decided to add a Shaky Cam Effect to the sledgehammer. Seriously ... F that ...",1669878519,1669878691,False,28,0,0.637430012226104736,0,True,False,False

I do wish the map updated to reflect changes you make.  For example, there are cars and buildings on the map.  If you destroy the car or building, it unfortunately doesn't get removed from the map.  Not that big a deal, but would have been nice.

I don't mean that this is bad - I really enjoy grinding games, they help me to deal with my anxiety a lot. Dysmantle is perfect in its niche. It offers a rewarding and addictive system, in which you have to collect materials in order to upgrade your tools, so you can collect better materials with them in order to create more advanced tools, etc.. Once you get into this, you just can't stop.

The open world is just beautiful and fits the gameplay process perfectly. Everything is made with a keen attention to details. There's a huge world with multiple biomes to explore, quests to complete and mini games to play.

The story is not the main part of this game, it's unobtrusive and just moves gradually on the background to guide the player through the world. For a game like this it's a plus.

The only thing I didn't like was that the endgame seemed a bit empty for me. Once you're able to collect all the materials with your tools, which happens close to the end of the game, it's not that interesting to move forward in order to just complete the storyline. It doesn't take much time at this point though.

Also, I have to say that after playing for 70 hours, I haven't experienced a single bug, which is lovely in the age of unfinished and buggy games.

Death is forgiven, so you keep going, though you may lose some stuff when you die.  You can rush though the game, but often it's satisfying to slip into a destroyer mode -- a somehow relaxing way to spend your time -- smashing everything in sight.

My only real annoyance with the game was that it feels like it sometimes deliberately wastes your time, by e.g. only allowing you to fast-travel within a very few points, meaning you have to spend a bit manually walking.

There's a very good amount of additional, optional content as part of the game: the obelisks (combat challenges), tombs (puzzles), the shelters (tower defence), finding all the myth tablets (exploration), farming (crafting and chilling), fishing, side quests...

And yet I recommend this game. How's that? Well because it's fun (duh). The ability to destroy your surroundings which depends on level of your gear feel really good: a few hours ago your traversed building like a maze and now you return there and can bulldoze your way straight through it. wall_clip=0 in the nut shell. Also the moment you realize that thingies you accustomed to see as a background suddenly become resources to gather - is a treat in itself.

Of course experiences isn't all that good. A few problems I had are:
- rigid combat. Doesn't feel good to fight monsters.
- overgrindy. I would up progression speed like 25% at least.
- open world way too open. You always need a specific material which you have no idea where to find except for running everywhere. It would be nice to have this info on map when you've visited the place once for example.
- late game is kinde meh. I dropped at about 70% mark. Last 30% are boring because crafting halts to nothing and game becomes repetetive. The best weapon can be obtains only via The Ark quest which is questionable at best. Devs fucked up reason and cause principle. To get materials you need weapon, but to get good weapon you need materials.
- stutters. Seems like memory leak occurs after few hours of playing. Restart helps.

But still ability to destruct all things around you works and feels really good so I recommend this game. I didn't feel like I wasted my time even though in the end I dropped it.

This is not a survival game, it's just a post-apocalyptic setting. Eating is optional and has permanent stat perks only. Pointing that out, since I know plenty of people who hate an eating/drinking mechanic in games. As far as exploration games go, it's semi-linear, but the map is large enough to make you feel like there's plenty to explore. The points of interest are great motivators if you're into achievements. There are also some mini games like 'tower defense' and an arcade combination game trickled in. The building addition is a fun side-game if you like builder games, as well, though not the focus.

Combat is straightforward, and while mobs are a pain at first, upgrading equipment allows you to eventually sneak attack all the mobs in the game, which can be quite fun and less painful when clearing large population areas. Some of the end game weapons are super fun, though I do regret that they're only really feasible to get towards the very end of the game, where usefulness is not that high. You'd be too OP if you got them early, though, so I get the developer decisions on that.

As for accessibility, there are some dedicated in-game options, which I appreciate, including blinking reduction. There are also screen shake and camera follow control options, and you can turn off Depth of Field. No FOV adjustment, but you can increase camera distance to help with 'scrolling' triggered motion sickness (the view is semi-overhead). As someone who is ridiculously sensitive to motion, this game does not trigger me EXCEPT during the teleporter animations. I could do without those and tend to close my eyes until I hear the animation stop. There's also a freeze frame animation stop option, but I'm not sure what it does. Oh! And you can adjust the size of the UI, which is always nice for those who play on big-screens.

Overall its a great game. Worth the money!

Pros:
- Satisfying to watch the materials collect
- Auto empty is a great feature
- Graphics are nice
- Very simple yet great game
- Thank you for increasing damage/crit chance when undetected
- Thanks for allowing crafting to happen without needing resources on person.
- Traversing the map gets easier as you level up and craft more items. Especially a home base! 

Cons
- Should be able to collect thrown knives. 

- Make enemies drop completely random loot (to an extent, obviously not like a titanium rod). I mean who knows what they may have in their pockets

- Need to include a guide to the waypoint. I need to open my map every 2 seconds otherwise

- Need to make a way to fabricate everything from something. Maybe include mining for raw resources to be able to build electronics etc.

- In the collection tab there should be info about where and how to collect the materials after you have discovered it

- It would be a lot cooler if you had proficiency in each item. Like the more you kill with the bat the stronger you get with it. Stuff like that adds to the experience of the grind

After a bit I started ignoring any and all side quests just to finish the game in the hopes that something truly interesting would happen, but a game built around drudgery is bound to force the point. After finally finishing it, the game informed me I had spent 42 hours playing. All I could think was, ""What a waste.""
The combat was clunky, repetitive, and unimaginative, the building aspect was pretty much pointless except for the turrets and resource refineries, everything takes so many resources it take ages to grind up enough of the world to really do anything, the act of grinding up the world around for said resources gets old after about an hour, the tower-defense aspect felt forced and hastily slapped on, travel takes forever and the fast travel is too limited to be of any real use, the story was shallow and unimaginative... I could go on but I want to make a special point of calling out the music. It's like one of the devs woke up one morning and said, ""Oh my god, we don't have any music! Carol! Don't you have an indy-artist musician looking for a break? Let's see if we can get them in here and do a soundtrack for a few cup noodles!"" And so, Dysmantle's soundtrack was born. 99% of the game time is utterly devoid of music, then suddenly there will be these silly little cinematics set to the most godawful out-of balance tripe that just had me wanting to skip every single one of them.

For the review:

ONE negative.........The music sucks.

Literally play all your netflix, hulu, peacock, youtube, rumble, whatever videos to listen/watch to because the games audio is lacking real bad. No music in the game keeps you entertained. There is music btw, but, it sucks a**.

I listen to my spotify playlist from Led Zepplin to Slipknot to Jim Croche, any song works asides from the games standared music.

THE POSITIVE

Game does not feel slow, if you know what I mean, meaning no set ups and then wait 3 real life days and come back to check progress.

Every day I have launched the game something new has happened. I earned something, upgraded something, built something.

Huge plus, FULL CONTROLLER SUPPORT !!!!!

GET OFF THE D**N ISLAND. Hit everything, upgrade, break more, brake more, get more stuff, explore a HUGE open world.

There's no limit to your stamina, no limit to your time awake, the only limitations are your tools and weapons in the beginning. As you increase your skills, weapons, equipment, you're able to go out further and further. I played without the DLC for a while. When you camp the zombies respawn, however, the better you get the longer you can stay out because you never get tired. The game opens up massively after the first few hours of play. It's totally worth it. If you are a dragon quest builder is kind of person mixed with fallout 4 mixed with the survivalists then this is your game.

Most of my gametime was spent attempting to scrounge up annoying amounts of menial supplies so I could upgrade my kit just enough to survive the next area, or just to get past some sort of barrier which was too strong for my current tool to tear apart. This was fine right away, but quickly became mind-dulling to the point where I kept having to tell myself, ""It'll get better after this next quest, okay well maybe it'll get better after this next quest...""

The combat left much to be desired. If you weren't getting the ol' soap-drop treatment because your equipment was too poor or your health wasn't upgraded enough from food upgrades, it hardly matters because combat in Dysmantle is about as dry as a nun's bush. Tied with the campfire mechanic it's like Dark Souls but if it was produced for the same target demographic that consumes Cocomelon.

I can excuse a lackluster story if the gameplay is compelling, but it's not. So the story doesn't get punches pulled either. As far as I got, it was boring and generic. I didn't get that far, but Crown Station didn't give me much to keep going for. Also, the story being told through one of those automated text-to-speech voices from those Reddit shorts got really old, really quick.

Before I knew it, 4 hours passed, then 6 (my Steam Deck says I played 6). I would have played even more, but cut myself off so I don't burn myself out. I had to make myself quit so I can enjoy this slowly. 

There's an elegance about the way it doesn't hold your hand, but offers points to interact with that fill the role of a tutorial. The crafting is simple to execute, but the unlocks and progression offer enough choices to make it interesting. 

So far, the character and gear progression has allowed for enough trial and error with MOBs can end in death without it being frustrating. That's a tricky AF balance to achieve and why most games lose their luster too fast. I can tell I will be getting my money's worth out of this--even if I'd paid the full price.

The game has a ton of thought put into it, and many things that I thought would have been overseen weren't. Obviously there are a lot of QoL stuff that could be added - and one of those is in the DLC which sadly costs roughly as much as the main game with a 47% discount (which is unacceptable - and you really only need it for all achievements and that QoL feature). You will also require an end-game weapon to finish the game which requires you to finish two optional tasks (no spoiling but you'll guess what those are when playing through). I tried finishing the game without using it and it's extremely difficult - even WITH that weapon I had some trouble.

Despite that though, the game is really entertaining. I had a ton of fun with it. I don't regret the money I spent on it for one second. It's open world, exploration/adventure, has a lot of crafting, skills and abilities, and you truly can destroy anything in it. Even certain story related barriers can be destroyed after you finish the main game!

The scenario was OK, nothing innovative but also not bad. At least it's more interesting than ""evil corporation messed with virus, virus spread, here we are"". Anyway, I recommend it on 47% sale like I got it. Maybe at full price you'll get a bit of discomfort from requiring a DLC for the stuff I said above.

PS: The game also has a base building mechanic but I only used it for an associated quest (whose reward is enormous). Sadly base building wasn't fleshed out - there's really 0 reason to make an actual base really. It's not an oversight imo, it's just that the game could do without that feature entirely. Its quest can also be a bit frustrating as you're pretty much making something you know you don't need xD",1664801446,1664801446,True,1,0,0.509176731109619141,0,True,False,False

It feels like someone played The Legends of Zelda, went around breaking pots, and felt like the pot breaking is the best part of the game and wanted to make a game just breaking pots.

In Dysmantle, you play the survivor of an apocalypse, leaving their bunker for the first time, and trying to escape an island. The game tries to do environmental story telling, but fails miserably. Everywhere in the same biome looks and feel the same, and there's no real storytelling. No mysterious skeleton chained to a wall, or a car with abandoned luggage. In fact, the whole world feels abandoned. 

While I don't mind a game being grindy, it can't be ALL grind. And this game is all grind. I played for 6 hours, just breaking stuff, beat 1 very easy boss and a bunch of zombies with the same attack pattern, just faster, and that's it. I got too bored to continue after that. Even the ranged zombie is just dodge and attack. 

And none of the weapons feels different. You use different things to break stuff, but you don't need to like in Minecraft where only certain equipment can gather certain resources. So in the end, it's just how much of the resource you want with the things you have.

>>>>> Graphics 7/10 <<<<<
Graphics are simple but effective for an indy title.  Day and night cycles change the view of the environment somewhat but nighttime does not really slow you down at all.  The overall biomes are pretty basic: forest, desert, tundra.  The DLC gives you a bit more but not a lot.   There is nothing done poorly here, but little stands out at unique either. 

>>>>> Characters / Setting / Story 7/10 <<<<<
There is a story here, but you will need to explore out of the way to discover it. I highly advise that you do so, as the story is quite interesting with a few plot twists that I will not spoil.  The main character is really the only one with no NPC's and therefore no dialogue between characters.  The island itself and the DLC area are ok, but not really atmospheric and unique.   

>>>>> Music / Sound 4/10 <<<<<
For me, this was the weakest part of this game. With VERY rate exception, there is no music to this game.  The few tracks you get are cool, but I would have liked more.   You get some ambient animal sounds which give some atmosphere.  I do like how all the enemies make distinct sounds so you know what is in the area.  Bottom line: maybe make your own playlist and listen while you play.   

>>>>> Gameplay 8/10 <<<<<
Gameplay will be the make or break for players.  Craft tools to break down structures in the environment, level up, upgrade, and make better tools to break down tougher structures.  This gameplay loop is the essential hook of the game which you will find either very addictive or very boring depending on individual taste.    Many of your tools also double as melee weapons to take on enemies.  You will get a fun arsenal of both melee and ranged weapons, but expect melee to be used the most.  Enemy type variety is moderate.  You do get some variation but more would have been better.    

>>>>> Funfactor and Bugs 8/10 <<<<<
In 40 hours of gameplay, I experienced no bugs, broken quests, or crashes to desktop in either the base game or DLC.  Personally, I found the basic gameplay loop to be a fun zen-like experience.  It is easy to lose hours playing this game, breaking down everything in sight with glee.  However, I would not recommend attempting to 100% this game unless you are ready to put in some serious grind hours.  One specific side quest has you accumulating a truckload of every type of item in the game and for me the cool prize was just not worth the hours.  

>>>>> Bottom Line 34/50 (68%) <<<<<
I very much enjoyed my time with Dysmantled.  The exploration, combat, and dismantling was a fun time that I would recommend.  But I am giving the score that I am due to a few reasons.  First off, the grind is real.  This will appeal to some and put off others.  I completed the main quest but could not bring myself to complete the more tedious quests because the gameplay became a bit too repetitive.  Also, the lack of a soundtrack really hurts the game.  The devs are still supporting this game and have an active release schedule.  I hope that they continue to refine the experience and more folks get to enjoy this game as I did.",1664003477,1664003568,True,22,3,0.718908071517944336,0,True,False,False

Getting increasingly better equipment to deal damage, withstand changing climates and dismantle both nature and man-made structures can be fun. And the game encourages you to fiddle with different sets of equipment, sometimes surprising me that THIS specific thing suited my play style and not the one I expected.

You'll spend hours collecting materials, figuring out where to go and what to do next. I am not above looking up solutions when I am stuck - so I can't say I ever got frustrated to the point where I'd wanted to give up. Plenty of info online.

No need to worry about the game mechanics being too difficult for casual players, either. If so desired, there are plenty of ways to cheese your way to the finish line. You decide how you want to play, and I appreciate that a lot.

The story is well told and engaging IMO, especially if you take the time to look at the world. 

A lot of care went into making this world emotionally accessible. If you read the notes, signs, if you realize that chair and cooler, with a drink, sitting in a remote place ... that was someone's favorite fishing spot. That room full of empty (beer?) cans, but no furniture ... you wonder what happened there. You'll find this pretty much everywhere and it made the connection between what used to be and what is now both real and pretty sad.

My (currently) one and only complaint is the fact the pacing for getting new tools and weapons seems a bit off (i.e. too late ingame). Hoping for future patches to rectify that. (Edit: they did fix that, great job!)

I'd recommend if you enjoy games where the focus is heavily on collecting resources (e.g. Terraria, Minecraft) and combat is a side hustle.

I enjoyed it.

Long version:
Pros:
- Simple but additive
- The character progression was rewarding;
- The mix of mechanics (fishing, farming, fighting, exploring, etc) worked very well for me, I was never bored;
- Destroying stuff was fun most of the time.
Cons:
- The idea of ""find this rare resource to access this part of the map"" is cool (and not at all inovative) but need to be improved by guiding the player. The game need to be more clear about what you need to do to get access to a part of the map. Sometimes it its very clear (like when you need the gas mask), but sometimes it is not (what mana rift do I need to enter to get to that damn hill? or where the heck is the last audio log that I need to listen in order to progress in the DLC?)
- The grinding could be reduced a lot;
- The world navigation could be improved, a few times, I had no ideia were to go in order to progress so I had to search the web for an answer;
- It is a personal thing, but I dont like puzzles at all.

Dysmantle is a sandbox survival game in a postapocalyptic zombie setting. In Dysmantle you play as The Survivor, the last living human on a mysterious island. When a plague hit the island you went into a shelter to save yourself, after many years you are forced to leave when your supplies run out. What has become of the island during your absence?
Nothing good, that's clear. Every person on the island is either dead or has become a zombielike Mutant. Your new goal? Escape the island!

This is where the game begins. Dysmantle puts you right at the door of your shelter and you start exploring the world while the game explains how everything works. Now, the most important part of Dysmantle is destruction. Almost every object in the game is destructable and every time you destroy something it will drop its materials that you can collect.
You start with a crowbar which isn't very strong but it can break down smaller objects. Eventually you have enough to upgrade your tool and allow it to destroy bigger and harder objects in the world. 
This is Dysmantles main gameplay loop, you use your tools to destroy objects in the world, you collect the materials, once you have enough, you upgrade your items and can destroy more. This plays directly into progression because you will encounter many areas that are impassable thanks to blockades. You need stronger tools to get rid of harder blockades. At first it might be something small like crates or garbage cans, later you will get sandbags, wooden pallets and even cars that block your passageway. 

But not all problems require wild destruction to solve. You also need to find specific keys or find a new crafting recipe for a tool that helps you progress. Sometimes you have to repair a bridge or have to find parts for a train to fix. The game will you navigate most of the time where you have to go for your mission but you can always go wherever you want and you will always find stuff to do everywhere. There are a lot of extra objectives and side missions that you can do which are not required to finish the game but can help you to progress faster, mainly by giving you more experience or materials.
Speaking of experience, everything you do in the game gives you xp, either by destroying objects, killing enemies or even dumping your materials in your storage. On a level up you can select one of a selection of random perks, those give you powerful boosts in the long run. Your crafting tree also has level requirements for better items. So you have to level up eventually if you want to get those better destruction tools.
Besides tools for destruction you can also craft clothes for defensive purposes and trinkets, which give yxou more specialized buffs. You also can craft tools for bonus stuff like a shovel to dig for hidden items or a fishing rod so you can catch fish. There is also farming and cooking in the game although it is not required for survival since your character does not have a hunger bar. Food instead gives you a permanent buff but you have to find the recipes first. These are almost always in the kitchen of the various houses you will plunder.

A core gameplay mechanic in the game are campfires. These act as your ""bases"" in game. Whenever you find one, you can sit there to heal up and replenish consumables, you also can dump your carried materials in the storage (which is important since your character has limited inventory). On the other hand, using a campfire will respawn all enemies, whch makes backtracking more difficult. When you die, you wake up at the last campfire used but all your carried materials are gone. You can regain them from your corpse but since enemies will also respawn on your death, it might be hard to do so. This is a system similiar to what Dark Souls has done however, Dysmantle is more forgiving in that regard because you can storage your items for safekeeping.

The game also features a quick travel system in the form of ""link towers"" those old radio towers are usually your first point of interest when you enter a new zone and are marked on the map yo you can easily find them. Activating them will allow you (at some point in the game) to move between them and you will also know the location of other nearby link towers. Later they can be upgraded with useful transmissions that disable enemy respawn. This is also an important aspect of the game not only because it makes the game easier over time and less of a hassle to travel through an already explored zone, it also ties into the progression because the enemies will now drop a new type of loot that is needed for late game upgrades.
What makes this game so much fun is how enjoyable it is to just run around and break down stuff. When you hit the point that not even house walls can stop you anymore, you feel so powerful and just go where you want, creating your own shortcuts.

That being said, I have to take of the rose-tinted glasses. Not everything in this game is good and especially the collection part of the game becomes at some point probelmatic. Eventually you start to notice how much time it takes to collect enough materials and the game turns from ""fun destruction simulator"" to ""grinding session"". You walk around a town in the game and destroy absolutely everything just to get another upgrade. Some of the late game imrpovements are too pricey in my opinion and it gets only worse if you want the ultimate item in the game. There is an end game project that requires absurd amounts of materials to finish. Now, I have to say it is optional you can finish the game without it but I find it absurd that the best item in the game is locked behind a mindless grinding session and once you have it there isn't much left to use it for anymore.
The other ultimate thing (an ultimate weapon) is more manageable and is tied to puzzle tombs that you can find in the world. The only thing that holds you back to do these is if you cannot find a solution to their puzzles but at least you are not forced to farm for hours.
There are still some other issues, even if I leave out the optional endgame quest. Late in the game you will encounter turrets at some major points in the game. These will almost always instakill you and the only way to deal with them is to find a way to sneak behind them and destroy them in a clean hit. My gues sis that this was the only way for the developers to gate the player through specific paths because at that point you can tear through most obstacles. This isn't however a fun way to play because you have to move carefully and keep paying attention so you don't accidently run into a turret. Not to mention that you still have to deal with regular enemies often in the same area.
Towards the end it gets rediculous and the game spams those turrets at every possible corner. The last zone of the game is especially terrible in that regard and I had to take multiple breaks during theat section because it became too frustrating.
The soundtrack and graphics of the game are not noteworthy. They are good but not in an outstanding way.


Besides that I still think that Dysmantle is a very fun game and it was very enjoyable to play through it. While I didn't like very single minute of it, I liked the better half of it and the game really offers a lot to do. I probably won't do 100% the game because there is too much to do but I liked playing through the main story and collecting most of the stuff you could find. The game does a good job of tracking what you got and what you still have to do, it has an entire section in the menu just for the collectibles and you can also see very easy on the map what you have already collected and what not. You can also filter the icons of specific types of items, so you can easier find what you have been missing. So for anyone who wants to go 100% it is easy to track.

Edit:
I gave it a second try after a a longer while - still the same opinion, it's ok but the game most likely won't keep you invested long enough to acutally finish it. 
Why? There's a few reasons:
a) low enemy variance + low variance of combat moves
b) progression slows down after the start quite a bit
c) the tools that we upgrade do not give as much advantage for gathering as the most likely should
(only scythe allows for breaking multiple items in a swing - after destroying a couple things like that, all other tools feel extremely limiting when you have to smash everything individually)
d) some upgrade ingredients are very hard to come by which further stunts your progression

It is constant entertainment, not too easy, not too hard, just the right pacing, and an incredible map. The replay ability on this map is insane. Just when you think you finished in one area, you figure out you need to go back to it for another quest. I love it.

Dysmantle in its core is ""just"" looting materials, but it is enriched with a lot of things to do to keep you busy and get the feeling of progress and accomplishments.

You get basic RPG character development in form of equipment and improving it, level ups, farming, building, crafting, fighting, exploring, challenges, story and atmosphere. Together all mechanics works really well together and makes this game a really good one. Mybe not as challenging, but it's great to relax if you don't want to concentrate too much on a game. Finishing the game and completing it propably takes over 40h which is really good bang for your buck value.

Plus: It works really well on Steam Deck and is a perfect game for the platform, and this version is in every way superior to the Nintendo Switch version (which I played for around 32h).

Although you can disassemble almost everything, this is NOT a typical survival game where you need a regular supply of food/water to survive and materials to build and maintain things. You only need materials to UNLOCK things - make new or upgraded equipment. Whenever you rest at a campfire, your health is replenished and any limited-use equipment like ranged weapons is reset to its full capacity (at no cost). You also never have to build or maintain shelter structures.

That is a good and a bad thing  - it actually means less grinding than many survival games as you only need to get enough stuff to unlock gear, and don't have to spend any effort maintaining the status quo (eating, repairing, making ammo etc). You never have to worry about running out of anything. On the other hand late game it makes the hoarding feel empty as there is no purpose to all the wood, metal and food you've collected.

Pros:
- Huge open map full of stuff you can smash up and carry back to your camp
- Actual XP skill-based progression, not just item-based
- Most equipment can be upgraded to more powerful +1/+2/+3/etc versions
- Mix of stuff you can unlock with XP+Gear plus stuff that needs progression (to specific quests/places) to obtain
- Likewise, a mix of gentle grinding vs exploration-quest progression
- Fairly relaxed and casual feel as you don't need to do anything to ""maintain"" yourself or bases
- August 2022 update massively expanded base building, can construct elaborate bases now with more utility buildings and lots of different furniture and decorations
- Smash and chop your way through buildings and forests to make paths
- You can tame and pet the wild animals, even get them to join you and fight your enemies
- Plenty of side-activities, hidden items, mini-puzzles etc
- Ability to prevent enemies from respawning in certain areas - or to make them come back tougher
- Extensive backstory revealed through logs, radio broadcasts, etc
- Storage is abstracted, so you don't have to worry about which chest had which thing in
- Nice top-down graphics and quality music
- Map filters and stats screen make it easy to work out what points of interest have been finished and what you can do next
- Some clever easter eggs and hidden away things

Cons:
- Not much variation of wild animals (Deer, Baby Deer... and Reindeer... and a bird that's more of a background decoration)
- Deer you have befriended who follow and fight with you frequently hit you with their antlers while trying to attack the zombies.
- Not many ranged weapons, very limited uses, and they are either very short ranged or on the weak side
- Limitations of ranged weapons often means you don't end up using them at all due to saving them for ""emergencies""
- Farming and fishing feels a bit empty when you don't actually have to eat
- Progression bottleneck at mid-game where you need a specific bit of gear to move forward and are railroaded into one long, arduous path to get there
- Final battle is disappointing and anticlimactic
- Getting access the best weapon *after* the final battle is very frustrating...
- Instant death traps are also quite frustrating

Sometimes that, alone, can be enough to freeze and crash this game. It's not an every time I tab out / something updates problem, just a sometimes but enough to be annoying problem.

Still, I am enjoying it enough that a one-an-hour problem (at the very least) isn't enough to deter me.",1661605218,1661605605,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I bought this game on a whim because it was on sale and I'm a sucker for anything with a bit of farming. I wasn't expecting much but WOW I was shocked by how much I ended up liking it (clearly it was a lot based on the hours I sank into it).

BUT if you're like me and are totally into that, then I think you'll be pleasantly surprised by this gem of a game.

The premise is you're a zombie apocalypse survivor and you're on a mission to escape this enemy infested island. You smash everything in sight to collect resources, level up your gear and weapons, and collect necessary parts to get off this god forsaken rock. At first, I didn't think there would be any real lore to it but I was pleasantly surprised to find a good story line (that even game me chills at the very end). You can farm, cook, fish, treasure hunt, and now build and decorate a house along the way while exploring this surprisingly large map. There's also a lot of side challenges including puzzles, combat, beat-the-clock races, and a fun mini game.

Cons: [b]#1.[/b] The inventory system is hella stupid. If you're carrying even 1 resource piece, then that entire resource slot is reserved, and you can only have like a maximum of 13 resource slots, so your ENTIRE inventory can be full after picking up just 13 [u]pieces[/u] of resource... that's crazy stupid.
[b]#2.[/b] No game music whatsoever on streamer mode.... NO music.
[b]#3.[/b] Your body's loot disappears when you die.
[b]#4.[/b] The harvest tool system of the game is obtuse. You 'progress' through the game by using a tool then upgrading it, then switching to a 'new' tool, then repeating this cycle. You do this exactly 9 times... fxcking 9 times that you have get a new tool and upgrade it.
[b]#5.[/b] The game is filled to the tits with gay mechanics and cheap shots that are meant to kill you... like a 'shover' placed right next to a cliff which yeets you off the cliff to your death... [i]haha, so damn funny /s[/i]
[b]#6.[/b] The base game has 1 gun that has VERY limited uses, plus you unlock it very late into the game. Know what made Dying Light 2 so much worse than Dying Light 1?... they removed guns...
[b]#7.[/b] There's an enemy unit in the game that you cannot kill with ANY weapon, except the mana crossbow (which has limited ammo, and if you're out of ammo, you're just dead, because you cannot outrun this enemy).

This is one of those games that COULD be fun, but it has so many obtuse and backwards mechanics in the game that it twist this possibly fun game into an absolute chore. And unfortunately I can't recommend this $20 chore.

- Complete freedom to do whatever you want (within the game's limits), there are very few moments in the game where you're compelled to continue a linear route. 
- Gigantic map, with the new Underworld DLC, you'll require plenty of hours to complete your playthrough.
- Straightforward gameplay mechanics. Break things, make things, upgrade things. Super simple and progression isn't difficult to achieve.
- NO HUNGER/THIRST SYSTEM, my god I'm so glad they didn't incorporate a hunger/thirst system. Food you make provides permanent buffs to your character and only needs to be made once. Obviously this allows you to just relax and keep playing, and not worry about whether or not you need to find food.

Cons
- Around half of the upgrades/repairs in the game require a lot of wait time or senseless grinding to complete, especially anything requiring steel, titanium or lumber. 
- Traversing the map is very tedious in the beginning, and is only satiated near the end game, but only slightly (without getting into any potential spoilers). The DLC does end up helping with this issue however.

Pros:
+ Simple gameplay mechanics, no need extensive understanding of what you're doing.

+ Controller is perfect for this game.
+ UI is friendly and intuitive.
+ Graphics is decent and you don't need fast PC.
+ The capabilities to destroy everything (as long you have the right tools and damage)
+ Long playtime plus more if you aim to complete all the things they offer to you.

- The top down view makes every building in the game doesn't have roof nor multiple stories.

Okay so now game is about break everything apart and collect materials / invent & craft gears and upgrade them so you can break more stuff and break old stuff faster. It has average story and enjoyable side quests.

I have 3 things that i dislike ([b] totally personal preference [/b])
- Map is huge, going and traveling is tiring and by huge i mean really huge, although its not a bad thing for everyone some like it some dislike it. You can fast travel via link tower'si every area has 1 link tower. I would prefer to travel around campfires instead of link towers.
- Zombie ai is braindead (unintended pun xd), you can fight and kite them easily. They dont pose a threat. 
- Crafting materials via smelter etc. (iron, steel) takes real life time. I hate this kind of system im playing a single player game i dont want to wait for 20+min for bulk crafting. (This is what made me stop playing the game, also i dont feel like grinding right now. )

A vast open world (I'm 51% complete after 50 hours) that's trickle fed to you at just the right pace, so it never feels too repetitive, or outstays it's welcome, there always something new to see or do. Yet, while being a huge world it can often feel claustrophobic, at times due to the camera (one of my few and minor complaints about the game) but more often due to clever design.

There's a lot to do and even more to see, there are many puzzles to solve from the not too hard, to the slightly challenging, perhaps borderline frustrating, but never to the point I've had to look up a solution. 

There's story aplenty from the multitude of side quests, notes, radios etc that tell the story of how you end up starting the game in a bunker and emerge into a very different world tasked with finding your way the safety.

DYSMANTLE is an RPG lite open world game of exploration, crafting, collecting, killing, tower defence, building, farming, fishing, hunting, animal befriending, puzzle solving, reading and a huge amount of dismantling, everything and anything in sight to get those precious resources. 

You can even take it to the next level if you want by playing the perma death difficulty... not for the feint of heart, I die every 5-10 hours, half the time from stupidity, the other half from complacency.

A highly addictive game that alters the very fabric of time, honestly before you know it, 50 hours of you life has passed. A great game for a quick pickup and play to pass a few spare mins or to loose yourself in for hours at a time.

If you do buy the game, which I recommend, note that in the options you can set run to toggle on and off rather that have to hold it down and also while verified on Deck, playing this game will knacker your trigger, trust me, I'm surprised my LMB hasn't file assault charges against me after 50 hours of DYSMANTLE !!!",1661034000,1661093676,True,19,0,0.697824776172637939,2,True,False,False

Basicaly you can destroy the entire map and meanwhile you progressing and gain experience. You can inventing new items then upgrade them. Every piece of the world have some damage requirement to able to destroy. That mean you first barely can break down a small chair or a little bush with your crowbar, but later when you get Sledgehammer you easiely can destroy a car on an entire building or with Axe eliminate a full forest. The way you destroy, the feedback as everything shaking on your hit, the sound effect make the destroy realy fun. Then there is the floating materials as animatedly move into your inventory, it is so satisfying. You just can stop it. I often figuring out that after a hour I cleared a forest or made a little town vanished. There is also quests with stories. The Map is huge, many many different zones like towns, forest, arctic, desert, jungle, city zones. The animations also in place. And there are the enemies, as it not just objects to destroy, but strange mutants with their unique attacks what you need to learn to fight them effectively. The movement work with Mouse+WASD.

Cons:
-There are some things that just aren't explained or explained a little badly. The ""Animal Friend"" perk doesn't let you know an item becomes available for crafting. It's also not explicit in explaining that all weapons of a certain damage type damage appropriate objects. Like switching off of crowbar and using a bat instead.
-After exploring all of the quests and sidequests, there are still going to be things in your list of craftables that show up as empty. I think people assume this is due to preparing for future DLC. Maybe I really did miss it, but I'd say I've been in basically every nook in the game over my 103 hour playthrough.
-Could have used a bit more in background music.

Pros:
-Combat was really fun and gives a lot of variance. All of the different trinket combinations accommodate lots of different play styles.
-The lore of the game is really cool, no spoilers, but do those side quests. Very worth.
-LOTS of challenges to overcome. Some things are ALWAYS deadly regardless of where you are in the game or how geared you are if you're not careful.

I read some reviews, but this one tipped me over the edge, so I recommend you go there:
[b]https://steamcommunity.com/id/martryn/recommended/846770/[/b]

""Dysmantle"" is a solid 80%. To be exact:
[0 1 2 3 | 4 5 *6* 7] = ~81% (75%-88%)
where 0123 is the negative half, 4567 is positive.
This is the way I gauge games: I ramp up the resolution of the score list until just before I'd no longer know where I'd land.

[b]Why is it not 100%?[/b]
Because of the stupidly awkward camera angle and camera controls. I constantly feel like I want the camera to be lower, to look more into the depth - and I'd really like the camera to follow where I look instead of going all twin stick on this.

It was a grind, especially at the end (yes, I did the Ark achievement). The best weapons in the game don't arrive until after their use is exhausted, and everything else feels pitiful. While the name of the game is ""Dysmantle,"" breaking stuff is oddly the least fun part. Hit something six times, move forward; hit something six times, move forward -- it became monotonous.

That said, if you like the Ubisoft collect-a-thon formula, enjoy the graphic style, like top-down gameplay (the camera often felt in the way), and haven't had enough of zombies in a post-apocalyptic world, this could be a fine way to turn off your brain. I didn't find the game groundbreaking in any way, and the story is interesting but minimal, but maybe that's not what the game is about.

One more gripe, vsync seems broken on a 1440p 144hz monitor. Screen tearing is minimal with vsync off (approximately 170 fps on ""high settings""), but a permanent tear develops 1/4 of the way from the bottom of the screen with vsync turned on.

What remains is a dabble of secrets & mysteries, rewarding crafting mechanics, satisfying puzzles, and a polished game engine. This is NOT a survival game! Your progress will be saved and the dreaded ""permadeath"" is absent here. But the game will still take a long time to finish as the area to explore is huge. 

If you like collecting stuff and don't mind spending a lot of time harvesting resources/materials to craft/build/upgrade items, you will enjoy [b]Dysmantle[/b]. There is also the usual [i]Experience System[/i] that enables the player to choose what [i]Skills[/i] to have and upgrade. In addition, there are mini-games within this game and some of them are:

- Shelters = Like a Tower Defense/Raid game for acquiring rare item/s
- Tombs = Solve puzzles to get Blue Eye Orb reward
- Arcade Machine = Mini-game

If I can wish for something more here, it would be to have additional enemy varieties populating the island to delay the feeling of repetitiveness and increase the excitement further of finding new challenges & stuff. I hope the upcoming DLCs will also fully answer and clarify the major parts in the story. The bits and pieces of clues I found in my adventure are not clear enough for me to understand what really happened. I have a hunch but I feel the gathered information are not enough even if I heard the voice at the end of the Credits.

There's something relaxing about smashing a bunch of stuff. 
I really enjoyed playing it.
But I felt that the endgame was awkward. 
Spoilers ahead.
Near the end, I found an unwinnable battle. The only unwinnable battle I faced in the game. I knew what I needed to do but didn't have the resources to do it. After a little googling I found that I needed to visit 3 more shelters and 5 more tombs. 
But there is no way to find them. The game REALLY needs a way to scan for undiscovered points of interest. 
I also found an ARK and made my way to the 2nd level and couldn't open a back room. Needed a key. No idea where it was. Didn't find any clues to tell me. So I googled it and found out that the only reason to open the room is to get the best blunt weapon in the game. But then I found out that the ONLY way to get that key is to literally finish the game. Finish the very last battle (the one I couldn't win) then fly away to the end credits OR don't fly away to the end credits but go get that ultimate weapon.
Why put an ultimate weapon that can only be found after the game is finished? There is no reason to find it or use it!
There is another ultimate weapon that might be required for that unwinnable fight. Maybe it's winnable without it but I failed repeatedly, then got the ultimate weapon just to win that one battle to get the second ultimate weapon that I never had any reason to get or use.
In order to get the required ultimate weapon I absolutely had to use the internet to figure out where 5 tombs were located because the game doesn't give me an in-game way to find them. I guess I could have wandered around forever but didn't have the time and patience for that. 

TL;dr: Finishing the game has one (probably) unwinnable fight that requires an ultimate weapon that requires finding 20 tombs all over the map with no way to find them. Winning that fight allows you to end the game (roll credits) OR get another ultimate weapon that is impossible to get before you win that final battle and now that the game is over, you don't need it.

I did like the game, but being able to scan for the hidden tombs instead of using the internet and being able to get those ultimate weapons a little earlier so I could actually use them for more than a minute would greatly improve the endgame.",1659342737,1659342737,True,24,0,0.735897719860076904,0,True,False,False

It's an open world, zombie game with cute visuals and not so bad of a story. They could've detailed the story though, it would have been better imo. Anyways the game is built on 2 things: 1) You break things (hence the name XD), 2) You walk. I mean seriously you keep breaking and walking. This might be kind of boring for some, I find it somewhat of a soothing experience though. Get to somewhere new, start breaking things, emptying your mind :D  The combat is fairly easy, so although it's a zombie game - it's not stressful. Map is huge, the invention & improvement of your gear is nice, there are many alternatives to choose from and there should be something that fits your style. There is farming & fishing which are a little superficial but enough I guess. There are no bugs, everything is nice & polished. So these are the nice things. Ah I just remembered when you ""finish"" the game, and you didn't finish all the side quests, and do the grind, it allows you to come back to the last moment, so that you can continue with them - I think this was a nice touch.

The negative for me was, the map is HUGE, and although this is not that much of a problem normally, it is barricaded in a way that the devs want you to progress, so you can't go everywhere, need to get certain stuff, improve your  gear..etc and that's ok too, but the elevation is leveled, so you can't really tell if you can go somewhere or not on the map, and especially from mid to late game I spent %90 of my time trying to get to somewhere. After a certain point it becomes like a maze, and they added some shortcuts once you do certain things, but even they are not helping that much. There are many places that you can't get to - until you figure out how, and I don't want to give spoilers, but man the late game is trying to find a way to somewhere all the time. Another thing is, say you need whatever to progress in the map, and that whatever is in a town, and you cleared that town, but until you trigger that mission, you can't find that thing. Game says ""don't break this, this might be important"" so you know it will be in a quest that you hadn't found yet. This kind of kills the mood since you broke 10,000 cabinets before but now this one is ""important"" - in addition, you'll have to get to here again, and try to find this in the future - and you'll probably have to walk shitton again here to find this place.

My stats show 63 hours, but I go afk leaving a game on so it's probably like 40-50 hours of play time and I have to say 30 of it should be walking and trying to find the way, and walking to get somewhere that's blocked, and walking back all the way, and walking some more.

The good
Exploration, crafting and combat all feel *good*.
You can smash lots of stuff for materials, with upgrades in your gear leading to more things becoming smashable.
Colorful graphics.
Excellent crafting/skill trees.
Not too stressful.


The meh
The map: Very big. Maybe too big. Yes, there's more to explore, but until you slowly open up fast-travel points, just getting from place to place can get a little boring.
The quests: Some are good, some are lame. None involve still-living NPCs.
The enemy types: There's like 4 or 5 you encounter regularly. A little more variety could've been better.
The grind: If you don't like collecting ingredients and hacking zombies over and over and over, you won't like this. I kinda did, actually, up till the bottleneck quests.

The bad
The bottleneck quests:
I will forgive a very mellow, grindy game if it lets me explore and progress. But once I got stuck on one of the major quests, I realized that certain areas would never open up to me unless I finished them. I know this is kind of a whiny complaint, but most of the game is just semi-mindless resource harvesting, and then to have to switch gears to look for YouTube walkthrough vids or guides just to get some crucial item, well, it harshed my mellow.
The story:
Pretty cliched and barely there. You can find clues in notes and radio broadcasts. After 20 hours, I don't feel invested in my character, and to be honest, I think this was a wasted opportunity.

The verdict:
This is a solid game, and if it's on sale, I'm pretty sure that like me, you'll get at least a good 20 hours of fun out of this. After that, your mileage may vary.",1658312031,1658312878,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

You start with nothing, with no knowledge of what has happened or how the world has came to be. You leave your bunker to go out into the open for the first time and then you see what devastation has fallen the planet. While you explore and ""ruin everything"" you will encounter deadly foes, boss's and a VAST array of enemies to keep you on your toes. Also while adventuring/surviving you will find radios that tell you about the world and the story of what has happened. It does not look bad at all either.

At the heart of the game, you ""dysmantle"" almost everything for its component parts, then use these gathered resources to craft better gear or level up the gear you've already crafted.  Collecting resources and killing baddies all contribute to your experience points, and when you level up you get a small perk of your choice as well as access to new gear you can construct.  Pretty straight forward, huh?

Except that it's not.  You think you'll clear a zone of all resources and move on, but the game has an intuitive way of locking access to certain things until you do other things, very Metroidvania.  Given the massive open world of the game, it seems like you're never going to run out of things to do.  As an example, your primary ""tools"" can be leveled up to increase their damage.  The more damage they can do, the more things you can destroy.  Where at first your weak sickle can't chop down that telephone pole, which are all over, once you level up your axe you can go back and chop them all down, giving you valuable steel.  Steel which you can then use to level up more gear, create more items, etc.  And when you gain access to blueprints and the base construction portion of the game, you can now smelt that steel (somehow) into titanium, which unlocks even more stuff.

All the while, you're stumbling your way through the map, chasing down quests.  I'm 30 hours into the game and still feel like I've just started.  Trying to gather these batteries, which I know lie in certain zones on the map, but to cross to those areas I've got to go through all sorts of obstacles.  First it was intense heat and cold, requiring special gear that I needed to manufacture, which required hides, which required hunting deer.  Then I've got to cross these zones I haven't explored yet, and every time you come across a cabin in the woods, or another small town, or mini quests that strike your fancy, or you want to activate the zone's tower so you can permanently kill the monsters...

Point being, the game keeps throwing goals at you.  And each one is very easily reached when you focus on it, which always pushes you forward, driving you to keep playing.  It really is satisfying.  And then you stumble back across an earlier area of the game, and you realize all the great resources that were there that you never harvested because you weren't capable of it initially, and so you're going back through and rediscovering all the stuff you missed.  

And the game has some sort of story.  The world is being slowly fleshed out.  There are secrets to discover with each new radio message and military base you come across.  Tomb puzzles to solve.  Obelisk battles to fight.  Underground bunkers to clear with the use of turrets.  

Yes, I'm 30 hours into this game, and if I had to guess, I've got 70 more hours to go.  I haven't even reached half the zones on the map, and there is plenty to do still in the areas I've already gone through once or twice.  And the thing is, if I ever get bored with exploration, I'll stop for a while and clear an entire area of resources, deconstructing houses, chopping down all the trees I can find to process the wood into lumber, planting crops, hunting game, harvesting wild mushrooms...  And when I'm feeling bold, I might go make another attempt at an obelisk challenge, or revisit the wells to see what I can trade for.  Deposit more stuff at the Ark.

Yeah, highly recommend this one.  It is oh so satisfying.",1657950481,1657950481,True,21,1,0.736380815505981445,0,True,False,False

I don't feel like I'm exploring. I feel like I'm.. slapping everything in sight with a wet fish.

Dysmantle is perhaps similar to what Fortnite was originally meant to be. Perhaps the part they realised just wasn't that much fun. Minecraft is about mining and crafting, and it achieves that fairly well. There's generally a 1:1 return on what you dig up. Dysmantle is about.. dismantling lots of things. Lots and lots of things. Slowly.
Theoretically there's content here. A story. There's a reason to explore. Which gives it an edge over something like Project Zomboid, and yet Project Zomboid is more satisfying than Dysmantle manages to be.

It's difficult to specify the exact problems. A faster gameplay loop and better camera might be all the town needs, and there's still potential that people like Dysmantle the way it is.

Pros:
Highly destructible world
Good combo of ""survival"" and fun
Good natural progression
Minimal materials grinding

Cons: 
Generic and Basic Combat and Enemy Design
World is way too big for the game. 

Overall I'm a fan of the game however I'll admit it hits a personal sweet spot for me and won't be for everybody. It's a very basic ""Don't Starve"" with zombies. Emphasis on VERY basic. Definitely a game you can chill and do other things like watch TV or listen to music.

Of the many survival / builder games I've tried Dysmantle is my favorite. Its premise is simple - smash things (and  monsters), collect materials, craft bigger tools to smash more things.

What Dysmantle gets right: 
- Well balanced mechanics make tearing into the environment easy and fun, no matter what your level.
- Progression feels meaningful, with compelling story
- Huge map with great range of settings and resources
- Challenging, varied puzzles and side quests that don't feel like a grind
- Surprises!

This game was developed by some Finns who spent too much time on Murican prepper forums and decided to build a bunker in the woods, where they descended with The Walking Dead DVDs (subtitles with emojis edition) and a cistern of vodka; but, as is well known, Finns are allergic to close proximity of other people, so they promptly went utterly insane - and their delirious attempt to escape the bunker and reintegrate into society inspired them to make this game.

Okay, that's probably not what happened.

[h1]Break Everything[/h1]
The main gameplay loop, at least early on, is simple. You break whatever you can with given tools, level up, upgrade said tools, then break more, harder stuff. All while fighting respawning zombies and not having to eat or sleep. It's actually quite exhilarating, and seeing the gigantic world that the game offers you and a nice crafting tree gives you high hopes for the game.

Sadly, it doesn't shake out that well. This break->upgrade loop ends rather quickly, as you max out your stuff; the only way to improve your breaking ability at that point is to find new tools, and then resume the loop. And indeed, it happens a few times, but it's not quite as fun by then; it also starts to feel very railroaded towards the end - oh, you need (n) damage to break object X? Oh, you just managed to get (n) damage! Wow, object X dropped a new resource, Z! And it just so happens that getting (n+5) damage requires this new Z resource... it makes sense from a game design standpoint, but not from the world design standpoint. But honestly, at that point it doesn't matter that much, because the game gives you new toys to play with.

[h1]Wow, it Unfolds[/h1]
The game periodically unlocks new systems and things to pay attention to. It is a little clunky - you can't interact with object O until you've completed this particular plot event, which doesn't explain anything at all - but honestly, I didn't mind. New stuff is good. So while at first you think you're stuck in a world of ever-respawning zombies, after some time the game teaches you a more permanent solution to your undead problem. While you don't need to eat, cooking grants you permanent stat bonuses - so you'll be on the constant lookout for new recipes, and finding ways to get more ingredients. 

As you explore the world, you unlock new things. I won't spoil what they are, since learning that you can do this or that is a very nice part of the game.

Eventually, some minor archaeology comes into play, and finally you realise... this game actually has a plot. Wait, what? Really? Yes, really - and while at first it seems like it's a boring excuse plot, eventually it turns into a proper mystery, driving you forward towards solving it, Dark Souls-style. The way the game surprises you with both this revelation and the contents thereof is probably the best part.

[h1]Dark Soul of the Wild[/h1]
The game takes cues from both Zelda: BotW and the soulslike genre. You rest at bonfires, which heal you and restock your item uses, but respawn enemies (at least at first). As for BotW - you explore the open-ish world, activate towers to see the map, complete mini-dungeons and [strike]collect korok seeds[/strike] find fishing points, activate wishing wells, find pieces of the plot, do small quests. 

The way the world is constructed is also a bit soulsy, yet interesting. There are a lot of doorways which can only be opened from the other side, which raliroads you into taking a specific route. I didn't mind that all that much; it's well designed in my opinion. And there always is enough openness to have some sense of agency when choosing where to go. Some areas are duller than others; not all of them are fun. But many are.

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
So is it a good game? I'm recommending it, but honestly, it could go either way. There was plenty of fun on my journey. I was originally planning on 100%-ing the game, but then I realised I stopped having fun at some point, and that prompted me to just rush towards the ending. And I'm glad that I did, because there are some nice revelations towards the end.

Do you like survival? This isn't survival, you can't even die (I mean... you respawn). Do you like exploration? There's plenty of it here. Do you like cheap death traps? You don't, but they're here also. Do you like emojis? This game has emojis in it's writing. Do you not like emojis? You can turn them off. Do you like grind? There is grind, both the fun and the unfun kind.

I'll just say this: it's pretty nice, as long as you don't try to complete freaking everything. Unless you enjoy grinding for grinding's sake. This game is better than I thought it would be, but it's also worse if that makes any sense? It's worth checking out at the very least, that's for sure.

https://youtu.be/xwG4tHmOkUI 

Pros:
[olist]
[*] Great to be able to dismantle everything... well, not at the beginning, but you get new tools later on, so progression is really well done!
[*] Progression with enemies are also well done, you don't get overwhelmed, well, yes if you rush in headlong into a bunch of enemies without a plan... always pick them off one-by-one if possible, otherwise, in small groups!
[*] Story is not the main hold, i.e. story is interesting but not something you need to pay attention to enjoy the game (VERY big plus on my books, when you only have short spans to play each day)
[*] Graphic style suits, it did not have very realistic graphics, and yet sufficiently provide the immersion needed
[*] Stopping a map area from respawning of enemies and re-enabling its spawning is up to you! 
[*] No Handholding, you need to figure out a lot of things on your own. But game concepts are easy to pick up.
[*] As Mic says, you might find ""zen"" moments in the game... when you are grinding for resources for the next upgrade... and the next and the next... and the next... ""oum""... 
[/olist]

Cons:
[olist]
[*] Walking... walking ... walking... especially if you miss something, or didn't take the right turn... there's A WHOLE LOT OF WALKING. There are some fast travelling, which makes it somewhat bearable, but be ready for a ****-load of WALKING!
[*] Music, or lack of it. There's almost no music during gameplay, only during the very seldom cutscenes. I know, it's post-apocalypse... but think about all the damn walking... (you can of course play spotify or whatever while playing.. but well... meh)
[*] No Handholding, not so much on the game mechanics, but about areas of map to go to... it's probably fine if THERE WEREN'T SO MUCH WALKING!!!!
[*] Need to pace yourself. Because of the incessant [b] walking [/b], forgive me pun, you need to pace yourself with this game... don't try to brute force it through... take a breather and come back... the game is long (wait, this might a pro?.. well, perhaps it is also the devs' idea to also try to convey to gamers, to take a breather every now and then?... well you decide).

As someone who is tired of systems that punish you when you die, I think the publishers really anchored in a good revival technique that doesn't feel like a big loss, but still keeps you on your toes. 
I have to admit that when I first found that going back to the camp to upgrade made all the zombies come back I was a little bit bummed, but the more you level up the less of a worry they become and they drop really important parts for crafting and let's be honest, it's not really a zombie game if you clear out all the zombies. Then it just becomes a gardening sim.
I'm having a little bit of a problem with the keys not always registering, but I've lately had that in another game too (Spirit of the North) so I'm not sure if it's the game or if I need to update my drivers. Time will tell. 
Overall I think this is going to be my game for a while and I'm pretty happy about that. Thank you Steam Summer Sale for finally allowing me to take the plunge and thank you Dysmantle makers for making a solid game! Looking forward to playing more!

EDIT - After playing 26 hours I'm still really enjoying the game. It really fits my style of collecting and just breaking everything, which I love. The game does allow you to stop zombies from spawning in areas once you unlock certain items, and you'll actually need to do that going forward because of the rewards that drop to help you progress. I am a little bummed that you can't fast travel to rest areas, only to sat towers which are few and fair between but, again, if they make it too easy you'd just finish the game and get bored. I will say it's a really good game to play if you also want to listen to a podcast, which I have been doing (sorry to all gamers that hate people that do this)",1656541639,1656886625,True,2,0,0.548872172832489014,0,True,False,False

 1) You have to fight and work hard to claim new areas and keep the monsters from coming back. This is done by installing a device on the tower for the zone. It gives you a real sense of satisfaction when you have done all the work to claim a new area/zone. I hate games where when you go back to areas they always respawn no matter what you do.
2) I like all the exploration. It is fun to find all the new areas
3) I enjoy the tombs and the puzzles. They have been fun to solve

Oh, and bit of a disclaimer (dysclaimer?) I played this while it was still in development, so some stuff might be different.

On the surface, Dysmantle is an after-the-end zombie apocalypse survival/crafting game with an emphasis on tearing apart man-made objects in the environment to aid in the ""survival"" part, where you play the role of some random knob with a beard, a backpack, and a crowbar, who had the good sense to hunker down in a bomb shelter before things went sideways. This is not a ""fast"" game. Oh, there are certainly moments where urgency is required, but for the most part you will just be breaking stuff into bits, stuffing those bits into your backpack, hauling them over to the nearest stash box to offload, perhaps purchase an upgrade or two, rinse and repeat. Every so often you'll hit a point where you can improve your ""breaking stuff"" tools to Break a better class of Stuff, or just find/craft better base tools, but outside of combat (which for the most part is handled exactly like breaking stuff) that's most of the game, which should not come as a surprise, given the name of the thing. It's a good game for ""switching off"", maybe catch up on podcasts, unwind after a day at work. Every so often you'll come across a choice of whether or not the scrap you'd get for breaking something outweighs the utility of keeping it in the environment (i.e. a stove that you can cook new recipes on, a door to a room that enemies can't get into, that sort of thing) but this doesn't constitute a major impact on gameplay.

With only one active character (i.e. You), there isn't a lot of talking in this game. Most of the voice-acting comes in prerecorded announcements on radios from the local government before Shit Hit The Fan, and when I played they were all text-to-speech, which made the few times the recordings were supposed to be an actual person a little jarring. Not sure if they fixed that. You can break the radios, however.

I mentioned cooking recipes. There are no ""survival"" meters in this game (which the blurb up there was very keen to point out), but rather you can acquire food items to craft recipes, the first of which will act as an upgrade to your character while subsequent iterations restore health. This is a plus in my book, because it seems like whenever a game has a hunger meter of some kind the ability to acquire and keep food items is quite literally either feast or famine, and I'd much rather throw out the whole distraction and be done with it. There are also abandoned farms in a few places, and farming tools that you can acquire. Feel free to put two and two together.

And speaking of tools, the acquisition and upgrading of tools and weapons follows a strange internal logic; in this game you start with a crowbar, later acquire a wooden baseball bat, and it's the bat that's the more damaging option of the two, both to enemies and the environment. This is a game where you acquire grenades before you get a gun. This isn't a make-or-break detail, but it is odd, so as long as you can shrug it off it's no issue. If you can't let that go, you may have bigger problems to deal with than a video game and should perhaps schedule an appointment with your therapist. Not judging.

Last thing I wanna touch on is the Dark Souls influence, because of course this game has a Dark Souls influence, it seems nothing is sacred anymore. This game has campfires. The campfires restore your health and consumables, as well as providing an opportunity to purchase upgrades, and finally reviving all enemies in the area. There is a way to prevent enemies from reviving, and benefits for doing so, however that takes a bit of doing so it doesn't feel like ""cheating"", and in the meantime you will be figuring out your favorite path for backstabbing zombies and otherwise minimizing combat so you can get back to Stuff and the Breaking thereof.

There are things to do in this game besides breaking stuff and the main overarching objective of ""escape the island"", but I won't say more than I have, because personally discovery is 3/4s of The Fun. And there is indeed Fun to be had here.

1. ""Survival""; This just isn't a survival game. You don't have needs like hunger or thirst, there is nothing proactively trying to hunt you down, there is no inevitable force of nature that will eventually kill you. It is no more a survival game than any other game with basic enemies that can attack and kill you.
2. ""Open World""; Of these two tags, this one baffles me much more. You are EXTREMELY limited in where you can go and explore, and those limitations very, very gradually and methodically open up over the course of the game. There are entire quest lines that are designed around and depend on the fact that this is very much not an open world game. It has basic exploration incentives, but only strictly within the area you are allowed to be in. If ever there were a tag that does NOT apply to this game, it's ""open world"". 

If I had to call it anything, I'd call it a gathering and crafting game, because those two things are absolutely core to the experience. But there are elements from many genres here. In fact, at points, it feels like the devs have added sequences to the game with the sole purpose of muddling the genre even more. Because for very brief sections of the game, you could call it a block puzzle game, or a bullet hell game, or a tower defense game, or farming game, or... you get the idea. But very few of those things are used very often, some of them appearing a number of times you could count on one hand. 

As for whether it's fun or not, well, this is certainly a game where I wish there was a neutral rating. Ultimately, I lean towards positive because I did get a fair amount of hours out of the game before I became bored of its gameplay loop. But I feel like I'm more open to these sorts of repetitious games than many people are, and even I didn't find this one engaging enough to make it through the entire game. 

It does introduce new concepts to the game little by little, but they very rarely give you new things to do or new ways to play. The vast majority of them are just... how to phrase this.... progression unblockers? They will do nothing for you except allow you to enter a type of area you couldn't before, or allow you to harvest a type of resource you couldn't before, and thereby open up new options to you. But at least after the first few times, you'll be aware of the fact that your progression is being artificially held back by this system. When you get a recipe that requires a material you haven't found yet, it doesn't mean that you have to go explore and find said material... it means you've fallen behind the main questline and need to catch up until it unlocks that material for you. 

In that sense, more than the world very much not being open, the game systems themselves are very closed. It aggressively will not allow you to get ahead of where you are ""supposed"" to be. And that's because the closed world design depends on it. If the crafting progression weren't so carefully controlled, the player could circumvent the obstacles in the world earlier than intended. So those two things, by design, must go hand in hand. It doesn't feel great to have such hard limitations in this type of game, and it's difficult to enjoy the crafting and gathering loop once you understand what's going on. 

But, again, in the end I had a reasonable amount of fun with the game. The restrictions aren't so strangling that you can't enjoy the loop for a while at least. I just ran into one too many artificial barriers with hoops that I didn't care to jump through. And I think if you temper your expectations, that will be less likely to happen to you if you decide to try this game. Because it is absolutely by no means anything close to an open world game. At every step, the game depends on being a tightly controlled closed world. I went into it expecting a lot more freedom than it actually gives you, and I think that might be why I ended up feeling so mixed about it. 

TLDR; This absolutely isn't an open world game, and I think you're more likely to enjoy the game if you go into it knowing that.",1656003281,1656003281,True,11,0,0.646533191204071045,0,True,False,False

A game with a good foundation spoiled by poor design choices and deliberate cheap shots at the player. Unless you do not mind grinding for grinding's sake, ""gotcha"" moments killing you, poorly planed out quests, and poor level design, I cannot recommend this game.

More detailed review: The game starts out great. You are given the tools you need, gently directed what to do, and then allowed to wander the impressive and expansive part of the island you have access to as you see fit. Once you hit a certain quest to fetch an item that is barring you from the rest of the island, the game goes south fast. From that point on, the developers make the deliberate decision to make the game obtuse, painful, and drawn out as possible. The open landscape becomes quite constricted with each section opening up only after you find a particular item or create a large amount of certain items. This is repeated again and again until you grind through the game or you quit in frustration due to the developers deliberate game design choices to drag the game out as much as possible. When there is a side quest titled ""The Petty King,"" you know you are in for a rough ride and the developers know exactly what they are doing. The fact there is an item that speeds up the game to 130% and you still have to grind for hours should be a huge warning of what you are getting into as far as level design and the grinding needed to complete the game and how little the designers seem to respect the player. That gun turrets can kill you with one shot and missile turrets take a couple of more hits is also a huge indication that the designers have it out for the player on several levels.

The game also commits the unforgivable sin of giving you the opportunity to gain one of the ultimate weapons (which also happens to be the only way you can break the highest tier of supply providing items and structures for blunt damage) at the last possible second in the game. This feels like a middle finger to the player in two ways: 1) you have to LEAVE THE FINAL AREA TO RETURN TO A SPOT THAT YOU HAVE ALREADY UNLOCKED THAT IS NOT CLOSE BY AND HAD TO SPEND HOURS GRINDING TO OPEN and 2) unless you just want to run around and destroy things or finish up side quests it makes a mockery of all the time you have to spend to get it.

I will not recommend a game that lures players in with a true open world only to bottle neck them and force them to grind for hours. I would be more forgiving, since the early game is so good, but there are too many in-game taunts that all but rub the fact the developers are doing such things on purpose in the player's face.",1655257026,1655514308,False,147,11,0.711093008518218994,0,True,False,False

It's a simpler, mobile-looking game, somewhat enjoyable but AWKWARD.  This game is very controller/mobile/console designed and it's a chore to control the character with the keyboard + mouse.   The standard PC key+mouse control and freedoms are missing.  The camera angle is limited too tightly, and you can't zoom the camera distance, both making it hard to see enough world to know where you are and what's around your character.   And the biggest issue is movement - the character doesn't face the mouse, only rotates by the direction of the wasd key movements.   You can't backpedal from multiple foes and choose which one to attack.   You can't use the mouse to rotate the character to dysmantle in a new direction; you have to awkwardly mash a wasd combo to rotate.   Combat is all on the left hand, except for the position-ignored mouse click from the right.   In games with the character rotation controlled by the mouse, you get precise attack-aiming and circle-strafing, both of which would improve combat in this game.   I'm trying to get used to playing this game, but wife-coop sessions in the other game make this game seem like the PC port was a minimal effort afterthought.  Not recommended for the PC.

The ark collection quest is basically little more than really boring grinding with barely any worthwhile reward, as by the time you complete it and get ''it'' you effectively finished the game in its entirety, same for the archaeologist quest, so both end up utterly useless, the fusing of mana chunk is way too slow given the quantity you need at times, so you end up waiting after it more often than not, and you might as well not bother giving stats to things like reinforced concrete because you have literally finished the game by the time you can break them.

Boy was I surprised by how quickly the game progressed to becoming more and more complex with a huge map/areas to explore, missions and really good story line.

For the money this is WELL WORTH IT!!! 
As you see my game time at around 69 hours due to the fact that I am a completionist and like to explore every possible area.

The devs put a very descent amount of work into this game and I did not find one bug at all so the game is very polished!!!
Also they did an amazing job with the way it runs, Absolutely NO issues with the graphics, which ran for me for the most part at around 110-120 fps. I never once had to go into the settings to adjust anything. Great Job Devs for doing this, considering descent graphics, animation, and the ability to rotate at all times.

All in all, Excellent game for the price and a breath of fresh air with all the other crap being sold for the same amount or more!!!

1. Fun to smash up zombies
2. Fun to smash just about anything you can think of
3. Fun to explore and find new items to craft
4. Variety of materials from smashing things that can be used for crafting

Cons:

1. Lack of enemy variety
2. Not that many things to craft with all the materials you end up with from smashing things up and many of these choices are not super meaningful aside from a few which are indeed a must
3. When you finally do get super useful items you pretty much have either finished the game or are close to finishing it

Excellent game to pass your time without stressing too much. Yes, it is a post-apocalyptic survival game, but it's a very chilled out version as compared to other 'survival' games out there. There are no hunger and thirst meters to constantly nag at you. There is however a heat and cold meter to keep track of when venturing into extreme weather territories. These can easily be countered by wearing the appropriate clothing. The game's atmosphere is bright and vibrant, not dark and gloomy. The most unique thing about this game which separates it from similar games in this genre is that almost everything you see in the game is destructible, provided you have the right tools and skills. For that you'll have to progress in the game and story, so it always keeps you engaged. The combat is decent and could do with a bit more fluidity. There's even some tower defense activity, some fishing, hunting,teleportation and lastly, lots and lots of running & dodging.

It is, unfortunately, 50 hours. You'll discover quite a bit of the game in the first 10, and then the next 30-40 hours progression slows to an absolute crawl as you wander around a map that is 5 times larger than the game needs. There's just so much filler, so many ""collect 1000 pieces of lint"" quests, that it drains a lot of the fun from destruction. Destruction is very fun. Everyone loves destruction. How does this game draw everything out so unnecessarily far?

Finally, the writing is bad. The dialogue is terrible, and the plot is nonsense. (It's nonsense that's ripped off from another game...you maybe BioShocked that they could make a nonsense plot Infinitely worse, but there it is. It barely made sense in the other game, and it truly makes no sense as an ending here.) How bad is the dialogue? At one point the main character walks by a prison and says ""I heard some really bad people were kept here."" Can you imagine an adult man saying that about a prison? That's what a child would say. Not a smart child, either. All of the dialogue veers between jokey and serious so much that it seems like you're not supposed to take any of it seriously, and then you are. Just awkward.

The map is massive.  There is a built in puzzle game with useful rewards.  The main quest is long and requires a huge amount of game play.

I enjoyed it and completed the main quest (only 10% of players thus far have finished the main quest).  But many will find it far, far to much grinding while taking far too much time to accomplish the tasks.

If they (10tons) add base building, and some type of horde spawn. Maybe even a tower defense vibe, similar to the shelters in the game. It'd be perfect.

There is a bit of farming and growing food as well as a few high end tools to create high end materials. It's super relaxing and perfect for when you're brain has been stressed to the max...stick on some nice tunes, grab a few pillows, sit back and start smashing!

The upgrades are extensive as are the tools available to you. The map is huge! I've spent 24 hours in 3 sections of the map...and there's probably around 15-20!!!

If you're brain is easily distracted expect to get nowhere fast. I need electronic parts...Ooo what's that over there...mushrooms? Cool...Is that a house over there? Oh a radio...I can listen to a message...oh a lake...i can fish!!! And so on and so on...

Combat is simple with enemies acting as an annoyance to begin with, growing in size and threat as you move through the game. Towers can be activated throughout the map and these towers can be upgraded to provide you with an enemy count for that area and you can set it so the enemies never respawn. BUT there is also an option to bring back the enemies as a harder variant, increasing the challenge. This can be done and escalated 3 times!!! So on top of discovering the whole map, upgrading tools and farming there will also be a way to increase the action/challenge (with new incentives attached to wiping them out again!) around the enemies when you feel the time is right!!

Genuinely fell in love with this game after the first session. It's just so much fun...for an over active brain. Some might find it boring but then they don't worry about every single thing under the sun 24 hours a day 7 days a week so...

The roadmap says more content is coming and even DLC so I'm pretty stoked about that...one of those games you could play forever whilst relaxing and listening to music. Thank you 10tonne

Warning: This game does feel very grindy during the late game. With a simple combat system there is only so much you can achieve so be ready for gangs of enemies and tricky setups. I really am hoping that 10ton can begin introducing a better game engine (Unreal, Crytek...or something else) and introduce better combat systems as many of their games feel and look extremely similar. The top down view, the graphics, the combat system...sure the games are fun and accessible but I can't help think that their ideas would be more realised with slightly more depth in the gameplay/combat mechanics and player movement. 

P.S. If you're interested buy full price (they deserve the money, only a small company) but it'd also be an absolute bargain in a sale if you're a bit strapped! Certainly delivers a nice amount of gameplay hours!! I'm now over 60 hours in on my first playthrough and I still have A LOT to do!!!

It has a huge open world and tons of places to explore. And you can smash everything. Seriously, EVERYTHING! Although it is more difficult to smash at the beginning, as you progress in the game, the things you can smash increase and new roads can be opened in this way. The story of the game is not magnificent, but it is nice. Some of the side missions can take a lot of time. In order to progress in the game, it is necessary to constantly collect materials and to collect some materials, it is necessary to develop your character. This significantly extends the gameplay time. I aimed to finish the game 100%, that's why it took so long, but even if you stick to the story, you will have to spend a lot of time.

Some of the fights may be tough, but after mid-game, things are going much easier. And sometimes collecting absurd numbers of specific materials can make the job tedious. In some cases, the game doesn't help you at all about where to go or what to do. This time, you may encounter the situation of wandering around the same places, wondering if I missed something behind. However, the direction of the game in the missions is quite enough.

In short, I really liked the game. Except for the last few hours, I wasn't bored at all. But if you don't like breaking things, or if you're not patient, do not buy this game.",1648465214,1648465214,True,40,2,0.810686171054840088,0,True,False,False

You start in a small town with simple tools and damage barriers to overcome.

I liked the pacing which is a result of the damage and environmental barriers in the game world.

That way you explore the whole island without much straying aside from the main path. And the leftover corners usually provide something useful.

I'm usually *so* not into craft'em'up survival games, but honestly.. this is so loosely related to a survival game, if anything it's more of an action RPG. The only ""survival"" elements are a temperature system, where some areas require you to prepare your gear to survive extreme cold or heat. The rest is all exactly what it says on the tin; dismantle. Your task is to destroy everything in sight, grab resources by the metric boatload, craft upgrades and better gear, and find a way off an increasingly bizarre island.

All whilst trying to figure out how and why you keep coming back to life when you die :D

It's a blast of game, it plays like a dream, and it's seemingly scientifically designed to deliver that perfect dopamine hit the more you play. You just want to explore one more area, fish at one more spot, light one more bonfire, destroy one more cupboard and raid it for some sweet, sweet, potatoes in order to fry up one more recipe. Destruction is satisfying, increasing your power and your equipment opens up *more* destructible parts of the environment, and you just keep on smashing.

Too repetitive.
Most annoying: you only can fast travel from tower to tower. and the towers mostly stand somewhere in the nowhere and you still have to walk the whole map.
To many ways with dead ends you dont even see on maps.
Second most annoying: When you put run on toggle, you still have to push the run button again after some actions like the powersmash.
It looks like an open world. BUT ITS ABSOLUTELY NOT! You only can go to where the game wants you to...
And its to much backtracking. so you have to WALK (cause teleport is mostly useless and more annoying, cause you have to walk more to get to theses towers, REALLY STUPID!!!!!!!)  to places where you've already been ten times.
Only positive for me: smooth gameplay and it looks pretty, thats it!

Long story:

I can clearly see that the idea is there and the developers invested a lot of effort into polishing the one central idea of a light survival, sandbox game with environmental destruction. That idea is the core of this game and is quite fun, polished and works quite well. That together with a slightly cartoonish graphic, nice zombie apocalyptic setup and a map to explore and sit-on-the-couch difficulty is what gave me the most pleasure in playing the game. After 8+ hours of work, looking over kids and doing the chores, sitting down to play 2-3 hours of Dysmantle with a controller was a very relaxing and pleasant experience.

However, I think it should be addressed that this game could have been really perfect if it would get the 20% extra effort it didn't get. While the overall feeling of this game is fine and polished, there is also a fair bit that feels either rushed/slapped on/implemented without thought. My biggest beef is that the progression in the game runs to the end when in reality there is like at least 50% of the island left to go through. Basically, you saw everything at that point, have almost all the cool toys and the rest of the game is just repeating the same over and over. There are two end-game items but they either require to get all of 2 different activities on the map or a ridiculous grind of resources. The game should at minimum have 2 additional tiers of items between the ""best"" ones and the ""ultimate"" ones. 

Secondly the item progression lacks scale. It basically just upgrades the same thing You have since minute 1 - just enables you to smash more types of items or kill a monster with less hits. There is a lack of items that would either a) expand the players options or b) give more power. It would be fantastic if during the course of the game we would get some way to destroy everything en-masse (explosives charges, craftable red barrels - hello?), or to maybe build up our own utopia shelter as in Fallout 4. There is a ""building"" tool but it's limited to basically some manufacturing and turrets that are actually almost useless outside of the few TD elements that can be found on the map. Same goes for skills You aquire with each level. Most of them is like +x% to whatever. No cool new moves, no alternative atacks, no specialisation.

Third - The game could get a little bit more of everything - more building types, more monster types, more bosses, more scripted encounters, more outfits, more music, etc. Instead, it has a lot of different things in it (fishing, farming, cooking, TD, puzzles) that are very shallow and get boring after 10 minutes of finding them out.

The title of the game says it all - Dysmantle... dismantle. You can find relief by destroying everything around you, scrapping them for parts that you need to upgrade your stuff or create more stuff that allows you to progress further through the game.

It's chill enough that there are campfires (where you can save your progress) near each other, and inventory management isn't much of an issue since these campfires have that ""shared"" stash. You can loot and scrap everything to your heart's desire, given that of course, you have the correct tools to do so.

The story is simple yet intriguing, and it has several levels of depth depending on how far you want to reach into the story. I'm almost at completion, 93% progress so far for almost all the metrics available in the game, and I'm hesitant to actually complete it :')

This is an exciting thumbs down for me in large part because there are many things this game does well. However, the total package leads me to recommend this only to a minimal subset of gamers.

first, the pros:

Smooth gameplay
Combat is slightly above average and, with in-game gear, can be made more challenging
story slightly above average
quirky sense of humor
solid looking graphics
the destructive nature of the gameplay
solid weapons/tools
Interesting world
alot of diffrent biomes

Now you would think..wow, with all those pros, how could it get a Thumbs down.

CON

the grind for materiels is insane(I focused on using gear and talents that would improve my gathering/collecting)..still horrible.
It consists of running a bit from your base, picking up a few items, and running back. Even with all the things/talents, the sheer amount of the same crap you have to pick up is far more extreme than any other survival game I have played. Here is a minor spoiler because you don't want to find out the hard way as I do; assuming you still buy this game, make sure to use the transmitter to keep mobs dead for the mana. The amount you need mid/endgame is the total middle finger to the devs on that choice...

Quests: The quest log is horrid. one tag: Main quest...okay cool...txt for it...complete game..gee thanks quest log. Everything else is stuck under the side quest..even quests you absolutely have to do to finish the main quest. While some quests under side quest are essential, that's not to mean the others, in every case, can be skipped. When you like me, who was fully aware I had gotten down the sunken time fallacy, you keep going even though you have no desire to play anymore and you're just trying to do the quests you absolutely have to do..except you can't be sure which you NEED to do. 

Bloat.. this is a dev group that had so many ideas they wanted in their game they didn't know when to stop. 
           *tower defense..check
           * arena-style mini-game..check
           *survival mech...check
           *puzzles...check
           *find the radios/feathers...check---at least it gives you a story when you do.
           *unlock the camps(campfires)...I gave up when I saw it say there were 106.
           *if you found the clutter of the maps in the newer assassins cred to be bloated w/ misc pointless things to do..ya, this is that x2. the story reason they give is not enough and not done in a way to mitigate the feeling of wasting your time. 

There is a solid game here held back by some poor dev choices that will lead anyone who buys this game to most likely not complete it. Keep an eye on the dev because there is no reason their next game can't improve over this.",1646690878,1646690878,False,5,0,0.537710130214691162,0,True,False,False

Pros
- Gameplay is pretty fun
- Lots of activity to do and discover
- This game has bosses to beat
- Better with controller
- If you like exploration, go grab this game

Cons
- No Survival elements whatsoever

The constant respawning of enemies until you get to the point when you build towers makes for some tedious game play - killing the same monsters over and over - very groundhog. You really can destroy anything if you have a powerful enough tool - it is very satisfying to go back to previous areas and harvest all the stuff that was unavailable. The combat is a little frustrating - thrown weapons take awhile to get used to, and most of your combat is close in at least for a good while.

Above was at 20 hrs. lots of fun. Now I'm about 90 hrs. Totally worth the money - it's a fun game! The caveat is at 90 hours I'm a little less than halfway through - big game! but I'm not sure there is another 90 hrs of fun in it. I'm not disappointed. It definitely forces you to backtrack a lot - the upside is that usually on the backtrack you have better tools to dysmantle more of the scenery - that mechanic is really fun. At first you have trouble breaking  stuff, but the gradual increase in your destructive potential means that the first time you have a weapon strong enough to destroy a telephone pole it is a thrill!

When I jumped in, I was looking forward to this game. The reviews looked good. The trailer looked chill.
It met expectations. 
It was a chill game.

I'd call this game a foil for hanging out. In my time playing, I did not enjoy playing solo. I got bored pretty fast and felt like I was racing to a finish line that I didn't know why I cared about crossing. 

But...

Playing with a friend is different. Playing with a friend and breaking stuff together is the real joy I found in this experience. Playing with someone else can make up for a lot, in a lot of games, but this game feels like it was made for a coop experience. Having someone watch your back goes a long way. This isn't a hard game by any metric, but an extra pair of hands in the end times goes a long way. 

I made a video to cover all of this in more detail:
https://youtu.be/sskTF0_m8JI

If you are playing alone, I gotta tell you to pass. The equipment upgrades are pretty soft. The enemies are simple. The learning curve is short and so is the depth of the world. The stuff you break is fun, but it gets old after a few hours. It's really an experience better had with a teammate.",1645817142,1645817142,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

The general loop for the melee weapons in the game is that, yeah, you do craft them like a standard game - and you raise their damage - I.E. it's like 8, then 12, then 16, etc. for the Crowbar. You start encountering different objects in the game, like first a wood fence that you can only break to harvest resources if you can do at least 12 a swing, then tables that can only be smashed apart for a better material for 20 a swing.

What got really cool and made me want to point this out is that I realized the level design itself took this standard survival-crafting harvest gameplay and turned it into Metroidvania too - at one point while travelling a new area of the map that I could have chosen to come to earlier, I saw a shortcut that wasn't necessary to get through an area, but what I realized was pretty cool was that only because I had gone out of my way to grind and overupgrade the second blunt weapon in the game that I could actually smash a path through a set of chainlink fences blocked off by a set of metal transformers. It was pretty cool to have that little moment. This game makes Metroidvania-ing really enjoyable and I hope to see other devs catch on to that idea.

Other than that, as this is a review - solid movement, nice visuals, strikes a nice balance between relaxing crafting and some engaging combat sections, plus I'm still discovering a surprising number of, well, surprises across the map that are cool too. I went all at launch price - this has definitely been worth that and I totally recommend picking it up if you ever see it on sale, and I haven't even tried out the co-op yet.

Dysmantle is a quest driven exploration action game in a world full of zombies and almost entirely destructable objects.
It also has a skill system and crafting elements to it.

Almost every object in the game can be destroyed with the right tool and enough damage. The tools are locked behind progression blocked crafting. You can destroy a wooden wall with a crowbar but for a stone wall you will need to craft a  sledgehammer which unlocks later in the game. The destruction aspect is absolutely the core of this game and is the most addictive part.
You can level entire buldings with all furniture and all walls if you want. Even a small town if you wish to. Or you can only destroy what you need and move on.

That means the game is basically using the destruction system to block and guide you through the world like a metroidvania game would do with upgrades like double jump. It works amazingly well. 
Besides that , there is a temperature system which will force you to wear hot/cold clothes to survive the environment.  (which you also need to craft). That acts as a further progression block.

You go from Area A to B to C etc, clear them of monsters and finish quests, unlock more upgrades and move to next area.
You can also do some side activities like exploring tombs (tied to the main quest), clearing out bunkers ,fishing, cooking etc.
You can even do some farming in predefined locations in the map.

As stated above, there is a cooking and temperature system in the game , but this is NOT a survival game. Food will only give permanent boosts to your stats. There is no hunger /thirst mechanic. Even sleeping is about boosting your XP gain like in a MMO rested buff.

Combat is fair and not very hard. It is almost entirely based on melee besides the ability of creating and placing some turrets.
You can also throw knives, grenades or fire a rifle. Those act as limited usables which will replenish once you rest at a campfire.
Very similiar to Souls Like games, this also respawns the monsters, unless you did take precautions to disable that behaviour.

As of now, There is no Base building in the game. Even though the destructable environment and crafting mechanics suit well to base building, it would serve no purpose in this game. You should progress, instead of bunkering down. Enemies do not come to you, you go to them. Loot is shared across all your fireplaces. Farms will be the only place you will regularly come back to, since crops need time to grow. But that alone does not merit adding a whole base building system. 

The story is interesting enough for you to not forget what you are doing but do not expect something exceptional. I would say it has many similarities to Subnautica in a way that you are trying to escape your situation while uncovering what happened , but the similarities end there.

Btw, the map is HUGE, if you explore throughly it will take a lot of time to finish the game. I did one 100% achievement run without wasting too much time and it took me 86 hours.

Side Note to Completionists : This game is perfect for you. It is very grindy, but not that hard. There is a in-ggame completion list which is way more grindy than the achievments. They perfectly excluded the most annoying grinds out of steam achievements. This way you can go 100% in steam but if you want you can also go hardcore and complete the in game list.",1645532744,1645534050,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

It's an adventure game that involves you spending a lot of time hitting things repeatedly until they break, dropping the materials off at a chest, and going back to do the same thing. This won't appeal to a lot of people.

The early game is the worst, when your tools are bad and you are trying to upgrade them. The late game relieves this a lot, not only by giving you better tools, but by that point you won't need many of the low-level resources you did before, and you will be looking for only specific high-level resources. Also, you can carry a lot more, so fewer trips back to the stockpile.

Besides breaking things, the game is primarily about exploration. There are a lot of different activities to do - there are quests, puzzles, combat trials, tower defense, and even farming and fishing. None of them are particularly challenging, but they do give a nice variety to the game. There is a story as well, which I thought was interesting, but the ending left a lot to be desired.

This game is really for those with OCD, who just have to complete everything, because everything in the game is achievable without having the reflexes of a cat on speed. You just need patience and fortitude. I really enjoyed the game, but having done everything, there's no reason to ever go back.

It is unfortunate that some of the nicest (and most fun) equipment in the game only became available right at and/or the end of the game.
Mechanics can be a little bit frustrating at times, but the experience as a whole is decent.

Dysmantle is a top-down crafting game which is likely to tickle your fancy if you're a gamer who tends to enjoy rather anal, clear-everything-out games where you destroy and/or clean up things. So for example, Viscera Clean-Up Detail and House Flipper appealed to me, and Dysmantle gives you that satisfaction of breaking stuff for personal gain, either leveling you up to get a new skill, unlocking a new equipment blueprint, or getting you components that you need to use to craft something. It's all extremely cathartic...while it lasts.

Eventually, you will run out of things to craft, but you know in your heart of hearts that in maybe 3-5 hours, the game is going to throw another piece of equipment at you to craft, and it's going to have really steep crafting requirements to make it and have it be useful. By the end of my playthrough, I discovered my fears were well-founded, and I was right to almost psychotically continue to break down tons and tons of stuff, even when it was to no real, perceivable benefit to me except ""to have more parts."" Hours of gathering transpired, and it paid off.

The combat in this game was actually far more enjoyable than I expected it to be, and there is a lot of clever stuff going on in this seemingly simplistic system. Specifically, there is a ""stealth"" aspect where you can hit an enemy from behind before you've been detected and do much, much more damage, usually instantly killing said enemy. This will likely alert or almost alert any other enemies in the immediate vicinity. When you get the timing of your weapon swings and your movement down, though, you can use the top-down perspective and a quick rush into a room to coordinate the deaths of each enemy in perfect timing. It reminded me a little bit of clearing a small room of enemies in Hotline Miami, actually. Fighting is almost entirely melee-based here, though, and ranged weapons have limited shots which replenish when resting at campfires.

Dysmantle also has a storyline. It's not 100% fleshed out so that everything is there, as there are a few bits and pieces the player has to fill in the blanks on, mentally, but there's definitely some cool narrative stuff going on. I can't say what for spoilers' sake, but I was shocked by the cool story aspect of the game. However, I will say that the pacing of the game is to the story's absolute detriment. Much of the game is optional, but given the game is clearly designed for people to get addicted to breaking stuff down for hours on end, and it has a huge map with tons of icons that need resolving a la Far Cry games, etc., most players are going to feel compelled to complete much of the optional content, ultimately dragging the story out anywhere between 50 and 100 hours. With the exception of television shows, stories tend to need resolution in under 50 hours or they lose their narrative ""punch"" a bit.

On that note, while I don't want to dishearten the developers because I get the feeling they really cared about this game when making it, I would have preferred the game have something like half as much content as it ended up having. By the time the credits rolled, I was thinking ""Thank goodness I'm done,"" because I had dumped so many hours in by that point. Heck, I still had dozens of hidden treasures left to find, and needed to kill a few hundred more monsters in different zones before I would truly hit 100% completion, and that would have taken me a fair number more hours to do all that, not to mention following a walkthrough for the hidden treasures. Much like Alien Isolation, which I also really liked, Dysmantle was quite enjoyable for me, but it ran on longer than it really needed to, and its entertainment had diminishing returns. Several regions could have been removed altogether, and any important ""set pieces"" of those regions could have been combined into a nearby region.

So I do recommend this game, but I doubt that I'll ever play it again because 100+ hours is the kind of time I expect to put into a something like Skyrim or a Fallout game; not a single player top-down crafting game, and even those other games are a heck of a commitment. Play at your own risk as it can be quite addicting, but it's largely well-made...and dang those load times are sweet, and components on the ground seem to stay forever until you pick them up.

A good example is the end game weapon, the power fist, it can break pretty much anything allowing you to harvest many materials fast/easy...cool... but...you can not unlock it until you beat the game...by the time you can unlock it, you are one button push away from rolling the end credits and uninstalling the game...So awesome weapon but completely useless and a complete waste of time gathering the materials to make it.  
I do not think they really thought a lot of this through and were mostly just looking for a way to drag the game-play out as long as possible to make it seem like there is more to the game than there really is.

The main focus of the game - a loop of destroying objects to get materials to upgrade tools to break more objects - is simple but done well, and the map and story were both significantly better than I expected. The map especially feels fully hand-crafted, with most regions being unique and containing plenty of small points of interest that stop the world from being too monotonous.
The game does have two big problems. The first is combat; lacking enemy variety, inconsistent power/stealth attacks and unfairly strong enemies (notably Mutated Hurlers and Gun Turrets) all frequently made make combat frustrating and unsatisfying. The second is pacing; though going through houses and gutting them is very satisfying, there wasn't much need to do so past the mid-point of the game, as in my case I had sizeable stockpiles of top tier materials only half way through the main quests. [spoiler] The Power Fist being locked to post-game isn't great either, as having to go through the grindfest of the Ark, only to find you don't get the reward until you've finished the game is very annoying. [/spoiler]
However, due to combat being a relatively unimportant section of the game, and the ability to cheese many of the harder encounters (through the use of [spoiler] mines or turrets [/spoiler]) does take away from the frustration. I also continued to destroy buildings even when I didn't need to because it's just that satisfying, so all in all the game is definitely worth the price and is one of few games I am likely to 100%.",1644011774,1644011774,True,1,0,0,1,True,False,False

It's one of those ""turn your brain off"" types of games, i would use it as almost a cool down after a more hardcore game. It's almost like a smash everything up therapy room simulator - you'll be smashing literally EVERYTHING in your path for materials. This does however make the game look empty the more you smash. 

There are a few things that would have made Dysmantle go from good to great - tighter combat (a bit too floaty and imprecise, but it works), more variations to combat (like dodge rolls could give you a bigger attack, or knockbacks could do added damage to enemies knocked into or thrown against a wall), and more variations to the look of items as they're upgraded (e.g. the bat could have added nails or barbed wire etc). There's a ton of items and possibilities, and the game seems technically competent at its core, so I'm sure with a little more art and design effort, these things could be achieved.

For me, one of the best strengths of the game is that the item collecting makes sense - things that you need are predictably where they should be with some exceptions. This is done really well, and something other games still can't get right with their loot systems. The game could give you a little more guidance on where to refine and find things though, but the learn as you play approach works fine. Besides, there's substantial online guides. I also like the pace of discovery, and that the ""survival"" element is very minor. It takes away a lot of annoying parts of harsher survival games, and I'm glad weapons don't need upkeep or rebuilding constantly.

The thing that would have elevated the game to ""masterpiece"" level for me is if they had included a community building and character building system like State of Decay 2, and if they had changed the control scheme to more traditional hack and slash style. But the former would involve changing up the story and writing direction the game took.

It was a satisfying playthrough, though maybe just slightly on the side of grind-ey. I have and will recommend to friends who enjoy BotW styles with a bit of salt.

I recommend at a discount (20% is enough) because the game length is great (more than twice the price) but not all the gameplay is fun. There are some redundancies and quirky mechanics that kill the joy of playing the game, so not all the playtime is actually worth playing (more details below).
Overall, I liked it, mainly for the chill post-apocalyptic ambiance, simple mechanics and good plot twists.

What put me off are as follow, with some suggestions to improve each point:
- weapons have one and only one attack each; so you play with only one or two weapon at a time, always doing the same thing again and again (no combat styles, no progression or variety). 2 strikes combo, lunges, parry, spin... anything other than just one hit would have been great.
- the UI is for the gadgets makes it that I didn’t use them at all in combat. You have to cycle through them to select one gadget out of 4 and then press a button to use that said gadget. Combining gadget in combat is a mess. Being able to bind the 4 gadget slots would have been better. Most buttons/ triggers on the controller are not used anyway so might as well.
- Movements are sometimes cringy. A small patch of grass, or a pebble, that looks like some background killed me a few times while I was dueling a few zombies, or just stopped me while exploring the wild. Being interrupt by irrelevant details while playing is no fun. Those could be removed altogether, or made as so we could step on it.
- Camera was moving on its own, while I selected precisely the option to never move the camera automatically. Maybe it was just a bug. Yet again, it s irritating to be interrupted by the game while playing.

Hope it helps.

Clearly it was Fallout 4 inspired - you start out as a survivor leaving a shelter, the perk icons every time you level up look like the pipboy, etc. I would describe Dysmantle as a casual open world RPG.

- Casual because the game is quite easy. Combat is simple hack and slash with a few items. Death is quite cheap.
- Open World because you're exploring the island and there's lots to do.
- RPG because there's a simple backstory to the island. Unfortunately, you only find out near the very end.

Though the name suggests, breaking stuff to get resources isn't the core mechanic of the game. It's mostly exploration and combat. If I wanted to play a game where I could break everything, I'd play Minecraft.

Who is this game for: players who like casual hack and slash and exploration with a bit of puzzle solving and tower defense.
This game isn't for you if you like challenging survival roguelikes with deep stories.

Things I like about the game:
- Simple mechanics
- Artwork is <3
- I like the voice. I wish I heard more of it.
- Boss fights are fun!
- Turrets are fun!

Things I don't like about the game:
- Too much grind / repetition
- Doesn't tell you where to go when you're stuck
- End game weapons are too far into the end (Powerfist would have been useful to get materials for Ark but...)
- Story is ok-ish.

Tips:
- Break only what you need. The game basically throws the materials at you eventually.
- Keep on exploring. Can't seem to progress with the main quest? Explore elsewhere.",1643165162,1643165162,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

I think this is a good game and I got a good few hours of enjoyment out of it, but I also recognize that this is not a game for everyone. It is somewhere on the spectrum of a metroidvania that requires crafting materials to create upgrades to push forward in the main quest. But...

This game has a serious grind to it - there is no way around that simple point. Which, depending on your viewpoint, is either a selling point or a major deterrent. You have to grind for just about everything. New area to explore? Need to grind. Upgrade you just unlocked? Need to grind. Mission requirement to advance? Need to grind. If you are not afraid of the grind, or it does not bother you much this will probably not be an issue. Otherwise you will probably want to look elsewhere.

On the topic of new areas and upgrades: the map is absolutely enormous. Which is fun (in a grindy way) when you need to backtrack to find more of material x in order to do some activity y. There is something strangely cathartic when you are able to level entire buildings and reap its full bounty of materials for future upgrades and unlocks. Or when you get an upgrade that allows you to finally break up object z and collect its materials.

Combat is pretty uninspired and almost feels like an afterthought. The bosses were trivial for the most part, and there are really only a couple of enemies that pose any real threat to your character as you run around.

Game ran like a dream on my system with it barely dropping below 144 fps over my play through (~50 hours - But I took my time with grinding) even as numerous explosions are happening on screen and not a single crash or error, bugs were also minor at best and were barely an annoyance. The game engine is even more impressive when you factor in that the game tracks absolutely everything that happens in the world. You chopped down some tree? That tree is gone forever. You left some materials on the floor? They stick around in that exact spot forever until you come back and pick them up.

Conclusion: Its a solid game and would give it a solid recommend if you like crafting open worlds titles and are not afraid of a little bit of a grind.

Open world exploration and crafting with minimal handholding, tons of content with a huge world to explore, loads quickly and runs great, and inexpensive at $20 compared to similar offerings. Well worth your money.

STORY
Not the deepest but definitely nowhere near the worst. Exploration rewards the player with hidden tidbits of lore that allow you to draw your own conclusions and piece together the story on your own. 7/10

GAMEPLAY
Simple but addicting. Most of the world is destructible and is used to gather resources which the player uses to get better gear, which allows them to destroy objects they previously couldn't, continuing the gameplay loop. The world is populated with hostile zombies which players can fight using a variety of weapons, and while the combat isn't incredibly deep there's just enough there that it never gets absolutely boring, and you never get to a point statswise where you can just sleepwalk through the tougher zombies. There's a Soulslike element where if you die, you lose everything you were carrying, but if you can make it back to your corpse you can retrieve all of it; if you die again before retrieving your corpse, those items are lost permanently. There are some QOL improvements that could be made but otherwise the gameplay is great. 8/10

LOOKS
The game looks solid. The artstyle balances realistic and cartoonish in a pleasing manner. I wouldn't say it's particularly outstanding, but it's fine for what it is. 7/10.

VALUE
This game has hours upon hours of gameplay in it. You can play it with your friends, you can reset areas in it for a slight difficulty bump and better loot, and it only costs $20. There are AAA open world games out there that cost 3 times as much with less satisfying gameplay. Gameplay for dollar this game's value is insane. 10/10.

OTHER NOTABLES: The game is very lightweight, takes up very little disk space and loads super fast, which I really appreciated. I have yet to encounter a bug or a glitch, and the developers are still adding content.

OVERALL: 32/40. 8. Wonderful indie game and showcases the best of what small teams of dedicated and passionate developers can achieve. This game is singlehandedly derailing my semester.",1642889378,1642889378,True,1,0,0.472972989082336426,0,True,False,False

This sums up the game pretty well. It's not a joke that you can destroy everything (except for a few exceptions) at the end of the game.
After seeing the game on youtube, I got it pretty quickly and just wanted to mine the world. The fact that there is still an interesting story in the game surprised me in a positive way. It was fun to follow the story and explore the world.
There are people who say that the gameplay is repetitive. However, I think you should expect that given the title and description of the game. Personally, I put more time into mining because it was fun to bulldoze a city, but extreme mining is not necessary. 
I got more hours of play out of the game than expected, however, you certainly could have reached the end in ~50 hours or so. It just depends on how you play the game.
The game is nice and doesn't punish heavily on e.g. death. 
Something I missed was the music. I was expecting music here and there while running through the world, but music only came in specific places. This is not to be a negative aspect of the game, as I simply turned on my own music.
The game doesn't have much replay value for me though. There is supposed to be a DLC in the future though and the developers are still working on the game.

DYSMANTLE feels like one of those pieces of media that you like a lot, but have a hard time recommending to others. It requires a very specific set of expectations, but if you approach it on its own terms, it has a lot of very unique charm to offer.

There is almost nothing in terms of a central plot to this game. The unnamed main character emerges from a prepper shelter a few years after an unidentified apocalypse turned everyone else into zombies. The main “story” of the game follows the protagonist as he tries to leave the island in the last remaining escape pod.

Under ideal circumstances, you could finish the main quest in under 5 hours. As you can see from my total playtime, the game pads this out quite a bit by limiting where you can go and what you can do based on your current equipment.

As the name implies, you will spend the vast majority of the game dismantling furniture, objects, buildings, enemies, and wildlife, collecting materials and experience and using them to invent and upgrade your gear. The equipment at your disposal is roughly divided into clothing (offers protection and helps regulate temperature in hot and cold areas), primaries (weapons and tools), secondaries (throwables and medicine), and trinkets (offering passive bonuses).

The dismantling part is the bulk of the gameplay and it is this area where the game really shines. I don’t know what it is, but there is simply something so satisfying about thwacking a piece of furniture with a baseball bat until it shatters into scrap wood. This feeling is further amplified if you’re a completionist like me - the game will actually have you looking forward to the grind of clearing one building after another, collecting resources like a hamster until you hit the next item upgrade. The cartoony graphics also help immerse you in this Wile-E.-Coyote-style destruction.

This is unfortunately also DYSMANTLE’s biggest weakness. The game doesn’t really have a lot to offer other than this treadmill of destruction and repurposing. Most sidequests require you to either kill or fetch something, and any casual exploration you might want to do is entirely dependent on and subservient to upgrading gear.

Another major issue is that other than the short initial tutorial, the game doesn’t make any effort to offer tips or suggest a direction you might take. If that sounds vague, here’s an example:

You start the game with your trusty old crowbar as the primary means of breaking down items. As you upgrade it, you realize that the damage output caps at 24. Almost immediately, you also realize that to break down most larger items, you will need a lot more damage than that.

It took me far too long to realize that you can replace the crowbar with another blunt tool that does more damage, such as a baseball bat, and use that to break down larger items. Now, the issue here may very well be that I wasn’t thinking hard enough, but the way the baseball bat is described in the inventory made me think it was a weapon rather than a viable tool.

Once I started using the baseball bat, suddenly I had access to more advanced materials, which meant I had to double back to the early game, check if I can break down any new items, and try to upgrade the rest of my gear. This ends up being the general gameplay loop, where you unlock a piece of equipment that lets you break down a whole new class of items, then spend most of your time using it to gather resources for the next upgrade.

The most egregious example of this is collecting lumber, titanium, and mana chunks, all of which require you to build a production machine (sawmill or furnace), feed it raw materials, and then wait (sometimes up to an HOUR AND A HALF) for the game to produce the resources. This would be easier to tolerate if it happened earlier in the game, so you had more exploration to do while you wait, but upgrades that require mana chunks appear at the very end of the game.

(Just for reference, each mana chunk requires 15 real-world minutes to forge. Even though you can speed this up by having your character sleep, essentially fast-forwarding time, you can’t force the character to sleep once he is no longer tired, so you end up having to wait at some point anyway. I estimate that at least 3-4 hours of my playtime were spent leaving the game on and doing something else while I wait for the resources.)

The game does (kind of) reward exploration by locking the most powerful items behind side quests and points of interest. However, by the end of the game, these feel more like something you want to do so you could 100% the game rather than something you actually need.

If it sounds like I’m trying to be hard on the game, I’m really not. For me, it scratches that primal itch in the monkey part of my brain that wants me to explore, hoard stuff, and use it to make other, cooler stuff. Also, it’s perfect if you need something to only half pay attention to while listening to a podcast or a YouTube video.

[b] TLDR: [/b] Break down stuff, use it to make other stuff, get to the end. Mildly interesting plot twist in the epilogue.
[b] Pros: [/b] Satisfying gameplay, solid graphics and sound design.
[b] Cons: [/b] Not a lot of gameplay variety, barely any story.

Not an RPG, not really, yet in a sense it's better that way: This is an open world with a large map; your progression being based on resources and crafted tools rather than on personal improvement keeps the balance under control everywhere.

No base-building either. The little building there is amounts to small episodes of Tower Defense, in which you can participate physically. Likewise, you can plan and use your own artillery support for some big fights.

What the game really is is an exploration adventure with destructible environment.
Your magical Hammer of Recycling smashes things to give you ingots and base materials.
Nearly everything is destructible, with the right tools.
Bashing open strategic shortcuts for yourself, improving the visibility of the terrain, it's easy to get carried away and raze a place in the simple elation of brutish destruction.

Most of what you can do is optional.
Moreover, nothing has to be done in a particular order; which means you can try anything immediately, or come back later with more resources and better equipment.
In effect, there is no bottleneck in your progression.

The optional content is massive.
It includes several formats of combat, the gathering of resources, fixing passages, opening shortcuts, racing against clocks, solving puzzles, etc., and the most difficult of these endeavours is finding all buried treasures; there are tons of those, the signs are easy to miss and, again, the map is immense.

An explorer should find Dysmantle instantly addicting. I know I did.

In terms of flaws, the interface is needlessly impaired with the pseudo-save system least befitting an open world: campfires. On a single-slot. You won't be replaying your favourite scene without a 3rd-party software. Fortunately, the dilettante in charge of this component had the good sense to cycle invisibly on multiple files, so you are safe from physical corruption... with a 3rd-party software, again, doing this software's job.

Another minor flaw is the respawning of mobs. Every time you save, which is the least wanted moment to do so. There is a way to stop it, however this system, designed backwards, forces you onto a certain path on each new map section, derails your own methods, devalues the fog of war, and so on. For a game that generally doesn't hold your hand, this is rather contradictory. There is even a correct version, an on-demand respawn of mobs, offered later.

Lastly, a more severe design issue is blundering the purpose of sleep. There is a day/night cycle, which is 99% cosmetic (with 1 tiny motivation for night travel.) It looks great, sure. And negates visibility, as real night does. So you'd find a campfire to wait it out, like any diurnal intelligence. If not for an inane restriction: you need a minimum time of effort between 2 rests. No typo here, minimum, not maximum. Consequently, you either waste your time walking in the dark, keep yourself busy with demolition or whatever... or let the game run idle. Easily the silliest resting system I ever witnessed.

With the exception above, Dysmantle is otherwise full of smart little ideas, smooth mechanics, surprises of all sizes, and awesome immersive details.
The controls and the GUI are great, the latter has very useful features.
The crafting is kept simple, leaving you largely out of the GUI and into the world.
The art is dandy, particularly the sound and animation.
The amount of polish is remarkable.

+ pretty game, nice animations, art style, music, etc.;
+ scavenging (dysmantling?) feels good;
+ growing up in power and then getting new resource at already visited places (re-clearing already cleared places) is interesting and quite good game mechanic;
+ huge map, I was barely ""scratching"" (maybe 10%) of what I actually can dismantle;
+ puzzles;
+ secrets and easter eggs;
+ casual difficulty, everything feels easy enough, in a good sense, with few exceptions;

- no survival elements, I like survival game and carefully managing resources may add, would be good if game had difficulty/game-mode settings;
- some places have tunnel-like maps, I prefer more open-world-like ones;
- many redundant gameplaye elements: open-water fishing (fishing pools are ok), eating food (only buffs are needed), healing via food (there are 2 healing items and resting fully heals), wishing wells (they occasionally give very wanted rare resources, but otherwise just dumb), sleeping (nights are good and useful, talking about spirit animals to example), flickering torchlight (who's idea was to make it flickering? fire the guy please >< ), etc.
- tower-defense feels primitive and unsatisfying: either enemies are way too strong or one can build too many towers which deals with everything;
- farming is poorly done (compared to many other games), planting/collecting is very slow, farms placeholders are way too far, I figured how to collect with weapon very late;
- several things (and even quests, which is very bad imho) are pretty unclear, require to google;
- unclear route, I've finished the game without being maxed, best weapons, etc. simply because I choose to go ""wrong"" way at a certain point;
- enemies shouldn't ever respawn, the game part on a new territory until reasing the tower and disabling respawn is way too stressful.

What I mean by that is that it almost feels like the developers had to research what a game was and then created a game from their notes. Later, a writer had to come in and construct a narrative to try and add meaning to the random collection of game activities from the researchers' notes. So, while other games may start with a story and then struggle with gameplay, it seems to me Dysmantle had the gameplay down and then had to figure out the reason to play it.

If this is not what happened and I am totally in the dark as to what was going on in the developers' minds --- welcome to Dysmantle. Where wondering what the heck is going on and why you should even care is a constant from beginning to end.

For me, it was one anticlimax after another and I never felt any reward other than being able to say I saw it through to the end. I am pretty sure Dysmantle warps spacetime. I would often find myself thinking I must have been playing all night and it was time for bed only to look at the clock and discover just a couple hours had passed. 

Dysmantle is relentless in its demands that players jump through just one more hoop like the dogs it thinks we are. Quests drag on and on. But it never gave me a reason to care about the character. His death was cheap and just prompted a respawn at a campfire. He even carries a bottle of pills to kill himself with. The main character was not particularly likeable. I would deliberately walk him into the water to get back to the campfire more quickly without having to switch items to his death pills. <-- Oh, by the way, he can't swim, nor can he invent the water wings he so desperately needs to keep from drowning.

I will recommend this title because, again, it nailed the gameplay. There is a mindless satisfaction in smashing an entire building down to its foundation for parts.

The core gameplay is good and fun and worth playing. I'm sure you can see other reviews to see about that, but I'd like to talk about the post game a bit. (So minor non-specific spoilers I guess)

This game has multiple completion monuments that ask you to find/complete various points of interest or deposit certain amounts of materials. The rewards for these are the ultimate tools, one for slashing and one for blunt damage. The tools are pretty cool and you can use them to destroy basically anything in the game. I do find it annoying that after delivering like 10,000 materials that I spent many hours grinding out and searching the island I then had to grind out MORE materials in order to upgrade the tool from each monument.

---More specific spoilers below---

There are a ton of great design aspects in the game but there are a lot of aspects like that that seem like the game doesn't respect your time at all. It's fine if a thing that takes a long time is fun but after finding all 10 of the Myth Tablets the rift that opens costing 5 Mana Chunks is somewhat insulting. It wouldn't be the worst thing except for the fact that I had already used up 6 or 7 mana chunks opening other rifts that led to fuck all garbage nothing areas with no valuable materials or interesting things to do. The fact that you need to use an end game tool that uses resources that require hours to grind for to open rifts and most often they only lead to a small area with a couple normal enemies and some basic materials is a big fuck you to players who spend the time to do it. If I hadn't wasted resources on those I would've already had the mana chunks needed to open that rift and it wouldn't have been an issue.

For anybody reading this who might not know, Mana Chunks cost 75 mana beads in a furnace. Each bead is dropped by any enemy killed in a zone where you've activated the no respawning signal. That means you have to kill 375 enemies to get enough beads to open the big rift. Each mana chunk also takes 15 minutes to smelt. You can speed it up a bit with a trinket that effects time but it still takes forever.

The final blunt weapon feels okay to use but could do with more range and there are times where you're hitting things with it and it only hits one object even though multiple are in range which feels kind of bad. Especially when compared the the final slashing weapon which feels GREAT to use and is pretty cool. Although it would be neat if the extra effect it has worked on everything it could break instead of most things. It would also be cool to have a tool that works on all objects possibly combining the two so that you don't need to swap between them and can really go on a fun rampage at the end of your completion quest.

---Super Secret Spoiler of a secret that really REALLY doesn't respect your time---


There is another secret in the game that requires you to do a deathless run of the game including completing one of the two completion monuments. The reward for doing it is a key that opens a secret door. In the current version of the game (Which is fully released at this point) the thing that happens when you open the door is...


...


...


It opens. That's it. It opens and then there's just an open door in the middle of the desert.

There being no significant reward for completing something so demanding is absolutely ridiculous. Maybe it'll be added in DLC but if that's the case it just shouldn't have been included in the base game at all. 

There's also a phone at the end of the other completion monument that says it isn't ringing YET which implies that there's something you need to do to make it ring. The phone is next to a map of the island that marks all the radio towers. Somebody on Reddit recently posted showing that they had gone to every tower and completed the max ascension for every one (Killing 15,292 enemies), completed all achievements, and all medals and STILL nothing happens with the phone. If this is another thing planned to be used for DLC the player should be told that when interacting with it instead of being baited into thinking it might be something interesting.

I still give the game a positive recommendation because the game is good. It's just the completion stuff that is insulting and you can choose to just not do that very easily and still enjoy the game.

P.S. The obelisks are not worth spending the big blue orbs to activate unless you have more of them than you need to deactivate respawning in all the regions already.

This game is fantastic. 

I picked this game up in early access on February of 2021 after seeing PaulsoaresJr make a video testing it out and I couldn't put it down! I binged all of the early access content I could and then I would eagerly await the next update to play through the next zone. The developers would release steady updates that kept me come back to play more and more.

The gameplay is great, post apocalyptic zombie survival in a world where you can destroy absolutely everything. If you can't ""dysmantle"" something, go find some better tools and come back later. The story is also captivating as you want to find out the mystery of what happened on this island and why you're stuck in the middle of it.

The enemies are varied enough, but the quantity of enemies is what makes the game challenging. The mutants aren't the only thing that can kill you though. You can just as easily die from the cold, the heat, poison areas, exploding barrels, or my biggest killer, walking off cliffs/into the river.

When it comes to enemies, this plays off the system that if you die or rest at a campfire, all the enemies you killed will respawn. However, when you get far enough in the game, you unlock the ability to stop that from happening, giving you that feeling of clearing out an area of mutants and walking around the zone care free. Except for those rivers I keep walking into...

The map is huge. As I mentioned, it's separated into zones, and each zone has a completion percentage showing you what you still have to discover. The map allows you to place a custom marker to plot your next step, which is great since there is SO much to do. It also shows markers for everything you still need to discover in the zone.

As you play you discover new items, or blueprints for items that allow you to invent, build, or upgrade everything you use. You also discover cooking recipes which allow you to permanently upgrade your stats. You also level up which allows you to gain new perks, and unlock new items to build.

You want to dig for hidden treasures? This game has it. You want to solve puzzles? It has it. You want to fight enemies in waves in an arena style area? You can! Do you want to tear down an entire town just because a deer looked at you funny? Raze it down to your heart's content. Did the deer look at you with doe eyes to make you forget the previous indiscretion? You can befriend it, pet it, and even make it follow you as you fight enemies.

If I had to pick one thing to complain about, it's that the map doesn't auto update as you demolish buildings, destroy cars, or cut down trees. It would be super satisfying to see the map update and have areas cleared out as you do the dirty work on the ground level.

Fantastic game. Highly recommend it!",1642066281,1642066281,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

REAL REVIEW BELOW HERE
But yeah, seriously I'm lvl 40+, explored almost the entire lower half of the island, and I haven't found lumber or a tool that can let be breach the damage barrier that would allow me to start harvesting it, and I'm still getting really meaningful level up skills and haven't even unlocked cold weather things at all. The way the harvesting progression and item balancing works in this game is MAGNIFICENT. A katana is a really early game reward, with seemingly really weak damage, but lets you face a horde as the only melee weapon I know that can hit more than 1 monster at a time and it obviously is meant to scale late game because its upgrade materials are INSANE, and with only 2 upgrades it nearly matches melee weapons 2 or 3 tiers above it. Some tools are great for harvesting, like the sickle which has the katana's unique ability of multiple targets but only for RESOURCES, and as such the sickle remains relevant to speeding up your harvesting until way later in the game than I am right now. The machete is faster swinging but shorter range and has immense crit damage plus extra damage to monsters, meaning its designed to aggresivey murder 1 monster in particular, specifically fast monsters, but a baseball bat has ENORMOUS power attack damage that put it above the machete by far as long as you can take the moment to safely charge the swing it can kill anything 2 or 3 times faster than the machete, and a normal swing is great too because its knockback combined with it's bigger range gives you more room to breathe and an easier time power attacking things. And yet, the katana has such insane damage bonus againt monsters that it can easily match a maxed out baseball bat's dps against monsters despite it being the same tir as a machet, and it's listed damage being so low that the first new weapon you get, the sickle, has higher base damage, meaning it's worthless for harvesting, but insane for killing monsters, the opposite of the sickle which you can pick up around the same time. 
The trinkets add tons of ways to play as well. You can go maximum dps and have so little health and armor that any non-basic enemy instantly kills you but you regain health on attack, you can turn the baseball bat into a freakin smash bros home run bat and instant kill anything with a number so absurd that compared to every other number you've seen so far you do a spit take, because a lot of damage in this game is 95, but you can make this thing hit 1k and I haven't even unlocked most of the map yet.

Speaking of damage, you harvest things, in fact, you harvest literally everything not attached to a specific quest, and that is not a joke in the slightest. But there are 3 types of damage, and apparently explosions which are entirely a different thing. Blunt is what you start with on the crowbar, and can harvest hard things like metal or ceramics, but not stronger spongy things,, like wood and rubber, which is what Slashing damage is good for. And these two can be used interchangeably on most things, like the cabinets in a house or walls of wooden buildings, but their exclusive materials mean you'e forced to get a specific new weapon to harvest the next resource, but then there's Piercing damage, which doesn't harvest anything (so far, I'm lless than 40% through after all) ut is instead exclusively reserved for murder, like throwing knives and A GUN, but that's incredibly late game. Certaint hings can buff certain damage types,, which actually applies to their BASE damage, meaning the kill bill bike helmet lets your slash weapons hit the next damage threshold that was designed to stonewall you with them before, and the soldier uniform boosts pierce damage on thrown weapons which is the gun and the knives, meaning the weapons that keep you safe and do tons of damage are now safer and more deadly, but both of those require titanium, a metal so rare I've had to smelt all but 2 of the stuff I've gotten, which requires you to overcome the barriers they solve before you can use them, so the buff is just a quality of life thing.

And about the damage, every object has a minimum amount of damage the weapon needs to do in order for it to take damage, meaning you can't rip a building down with a crowbar or a baseball bat if it's made of brick or  concrete, but the bat can rip apart a wooden home or knock down a telephone pole por wreckk a bus stop just fine if you reinforce it enough, but the most a crowbar could do is smash a toilet or bathroom sink and certain small metal objects. A sickle is amazing for clearing leaves off of things because thewy're right at the amount of health a siickle can do at max and it hits tons of resources at once so it's great for clearing the vines of of everything but it can't do much more than rip up a couch, but a machete can hack through a wooden wall in a house and it takes an actual axe to chop down a larger tree, but the katana cant even do what a sickle can in terms of harvesting until waaaaaay late into the game when that threshold was passed ages ago by another tool. 

The way this all combines together is just the most magnificent form of progression in any game ever. You work towards making a specific item, you horde resources, hunt for harvest spots, learn how to play around the monsters in the areas you're harvesting, work out the best paths to speed up your resource dumps, and as soon as you craft it, the tool or resource adds an entirely different effect only it in particular can give, and then almost immediately you can harvest something new if it's a weapon or have an inrecible adjantage for trinkets or throwable slot items, like landmines [b]which are the greatest thing ever and can trivialize the scary enemies if used right[/b] but have an immense amount of harvesting to get to the point they break a ton of things and learning on how to do that without diying instantly as well, grenages which are like diet landmines with waaaay more aoe and ability to clear hordes when used by an expert, bandages which are slow and heal tons or pills that are fast but heal just enough to mitigate stronger enemy attacks about 1:1 enough to save your life. No item ever eclipses the other, with the sole exception so far being the very first clothes you wear and the very first weapon the crowbar, both of which are good as the perfectly vanilla feel of the game to ease you in, which only they can give as well. Everything else has uniuye flavor and extra abilities that can turn them into sidegrades of each other in certain situations or the only logical choice for a specific task. This game has an inredible feel of having every tool do something specific in a wonderful way that they feel satisfying to use and are intuitive to figure out what works where. I have ZERO common sense and my ape brain recieved instant neuron activation using the motorcycle helmet to boost slash damage and realizing how it affected base damage in a unique way that was different from other boosts so I could use a lumberjack shirt, a board game die, a counterweight, and a machete to clearcut a forest in the amount of time that it used to take to barely farm a backpack of wood, like 6 or 7 times more with a more fun weapon that is built to occasionally do the entire tree's health in a single crit, speeding it up even faster and making it a genuine joy to run around like I'm the Schnitzel Man from Hoodwinked.

Its priced very reasonably and for the game play i thoroughly enjoyed it.
It is very grindy like some others have mentioned but you can go at your own pace and if you make it through towards end end game items it gets much easier.
I took my time uncovering all of the map area and doing as many extra side quests and levelling as possible before tackling the main questline.
Its hard to give an accurate game review as many will disagree on certain aspects. 

- I love the apocalyptic scenery and you get the feeling you're amongst it somehow.
- Campfires and link towers are a godsend and work well in the world to help navigate/fast travel
-Nearly everything in the world can be destroyed!
- Items that are destructible cannot be dysmantled if not using the proper tool and have to deal enough damage to match the hitpoints of obstacle.
- Grinding works well in this game (not for everyone)
- Coming back to areas with tools that obliterate stuff you couldnt destroy to get new materials is extremely satisfying.
- Some of the tomb puzzles were fun and easy and then theres some that were right F#####s so the balance and challenge is there.
- I love the collection screen which shows progress across the map/areas. I never bothered with it until finishing the main quest to see what i could do next.
I reckon theres a solid 80-100 hours of gameplay for those who want to take their time and play through to do everything, possibly quicker with a guide. If you're looking to speed through maybe 40 hours or something but hard to judge as im sure it could be done much quicker if you've beat the game before.

I want to say thanks to the developers for making a truly unique game which ive enjoyed. Only encountered 1 bug (which wasnt game breaking despite me thinking it was) and other than that ive had no issues at all. 
I have a below average computer and it runs really well, loads quick and i have no performance issues at all when playing. 

For me i want to give it a solid 10 out of 10. Its grindy but worth it if you stick with it and the game can be paused any time for dad duties, toilet breaks etc and not be punished.

I can't recommend this enough for anyone that likes this sort of game 

The map is HUGE. So there's tons and tons of exploration to be done and it's definitely open world. There are the few occasional smaller maps though too.

There is an interesting but somewhat thin story to it all too with a little twist at the end.

It has a nice 3rd person view with a movable camera. The camera doesn't automatically follow behind the character. Though I do wish I could get the camera down a little lower. At times I find myself craning my neck trying to look ""under the top to the screen"" :P

Almost everything in the game can be destroyed given a good enough tool/weapon which turns out to be a lot of fun.

It has some basic crafting as part of a level locked item tree. As you go up levels new items unlock and you have to destroy stuff to find the materials to make those items. Also there are places where you have to collect items to repair stuff to use them.

It has ""zombies"" :) well they're not the infectious ""one bite and you're dead"" type, but they're basically various types of zombies. I think they're supposed to be sort of plant infect or something, but that's not really that important.

It doesn't have super AAA+++ graphics but has nice stylized graphics which really should be playable even on lower end system. I like the graphics. So they fact that they're not AAA+++ is not a problem.

I played up to about 3rd of it in early access and then ""solved"" it in about 40 hours without going for 100% completion so it definitely has some decent play time to it too.

Replay value is kind of lacking though unless you finish the game without completing everything.

There's no perma-death. There are not saves really either. You have campfires that act sort of like save points. If you die you just loose the loot you were carrying and revive at the last campfire you camped at. NOTE: lighting the campfire is not the same as actually camping at it...

I don't like the melee combat that much or the fact that ranged items have a limited number of uses before having to ""recharge"" at a campfire.



as of 0.6.3 release so early access

fun for exploring but I find the controls slow and really awkward in combat. 
it's more like it fun to explore IN SPITE of the not so great combat IMO
but some areas are such a pain I'm not sure I will get the explore them... tempting to mark this as thumbs down
I'm not a huge fan of WASD combat though so YMMV 
The throwing targeting though is a little inconsistent still too
But overall I still like the game


pros:
large map... only seen 1/3 of it so far
lots to explore and discover
some crafting and nice crafting tree(s), but no consumables crafting
I like the resource systems and getting to destroy almost anything
at least they aren't called zombies even if...

cons:
""target lock"" system really doesn't work well...
default run speed is a little too slow and when you're ""sprinting"" or whatever you can't target lock I guess
the run slow/fast toggle system is really annoying
very little replay value
movement and control in combat especially is kind of awkward but then again I'm not a huge fan of wasd action games...

Dysmantle features a charming, enormous world, jam-packed with content, managing to deliver an impressively satisfying arsenal of upgrades throughout a tantalisingly unravelled story, sprinkled with humour and intrigue.

A simple concept executed in a fantastic and unique way, the island's story is teased throughout a satisfying journey of discovery which continues to entertain for 66 hours.
The pacing of equipment upgrades is balanced very well with the rate of island exploration, with both aspects significantly broader than expected! 
Combat is basic but satisfying with progression, and enough variation to fit the various biomes. A particular highlight is the wide range of customisation trinkets, allowing for a fast-paced, risky zombie massacre, or slowing the action down to suit different playstyles. On-the-go customisation is a well-appreciated addition.
The beguiling visual style of the game perfectly captures the mood of the story, with the pleasing sound effects driving the chopping of just one more tree...

I finished it because by the time I was deathly bored with the gameplay and contemplating dropping it, I read a forum walkthrough and realized I was actually close to finishing. So I finished, hoping that maybe there would be something different about the final zone that was interesting. It was OK.

There was a lot of promise at the beginning I like open world survival games, but as time went on the simple joy of hitting things with a stick was slowly drained. Grind. Grind. Grind. Grind. Over and over.

See object. Hit object until candy comes out. Drag candy back to box.

The  tower-defense segments were ok at first but way too simple. Stack sandbags and place your (two types total) turrets. Hit the monsters with the same weapon you've been grinding with.

This game would have benefited from:
- 1 or 2 more weapons. particularly in the early game, even if they represented small upgrades individually.
- a more easily-obtainable uber weapon. I gave up on the power fist quest because of the amount of time it would have taken to complete. The game would have been a little more fun and certainly wouldn't have been any worse if you were just handed the power fist for the last battle.
- related to the previous point, the mid-game weapons are the end-game weapons.
- the game can't make up its mind whether quest steps/goals are explicitly stated or whether they're discovered/explored. And for that matter, a good number of the ""side quests"" are main questlike. I ended up looking up every quest online just to figure out if what I was doing was optional or not.
- 1 or 2 more interesting (and powerful) ranged weapons. Maybe some kind of mana-based rifle? Maybe allow power attack for thrown weapons?
- greater camera max distance. An open world game that doesn't let you view and appreciate the size of the open world is a letdown. The default camera is too close.
- an extra item slot/hotkey. Making a hard choice between healing or utility or whatever  is fine gameplay, but using a single hotkey key to cycle through up to 4 different equipped items is annoying UX. It was annoying in Half-Life 1 and it's annoying here.
- why can't the stock, un-upgraded axe chop the big trees? It's an axe! That's what it does!

Things I liked:
- musical interludes. I thought they were a nice touch
- the Torchlight-esque art style
- the premise of simplified open world survival in a zombie apocalypse
- character modeling/motion/animation was nice and appropriate to the art style
- fishing isn't a minigame. Thank you.

Basically, you are a lone survivor in a post-apocalypse zombie world.  You have nothing except a backpack and crowbar and you're tasked with surviving against a large open world full of zombies.

As you play, you break apart random stuff you find in the world, collecting materials to upgrade your gear and make your way towards the end objective.

Where this game falls a bit short is the difficulty curve.  The game is at it's most difficult in the beginning few hours.  After you upgrade your gear a bit, you'll be 1-shotting most enemies except the mini bosses and area bosses.  You'll see the same types of zombies throughout different areas, and they have the same attack patterns and tendencies.

Another setback is that you'll max out your current gear and won't have anything to do with the hoards of materials you've collected until you unlock new blueprints.  The leveling is a bit slow.  I end up spending a lot of time searching for new rare materials to build new gear when I unlock the blueprint for it.

[i]DYSMANTLE[/i] does a good job taking this concept to the next level.

In this game, you not only can do what I just described above, but you can also completely destroy nearly [i]everything[/i] that you see on the map. Granted, when you first start out with your crowbar, you can only break the smallest and most fragile of objects, but as you obtain more resources and progress forward in the invention/crafting tree, you'll eventually reach the point where you can easily reduce entire cities to rubble (resources). After playing so many games like [i]Satisfactory[/i] or [i]Cities: Skylines[/i] that focus on building and upgrading structures and cities, it's refreshing to play a game like this where you can spend hours going on a frenzy of demolition.

(Also, strangely enough, I'm reminded of hole.io, a free online arcade game where you control a black hole that wanders around a city and swallows objects to increase its size. You start out only being able to engulf trash cans and other small objects like mailboxes, but by the end, you're making buildings disappear into the void.) 

With all that said, the game does have its share of flaws.

First, this game tries to do a lot. The gameplay isn't just about dismantling things - it basically has all of the activities of a modern open-world action RPG: cooking, fishing, farming, smelting, foraging, treasure hunting, building, puzzles, quests and more. While the variety is nice, the activities themselves start to feel monotonous and underwhelming after a while, and the rewards (with some exceptions) are typically things you can find by simply destroying things.

Second, and on a related note, the map of [i]DYSMANTLE[/i] is quite vast. It's exciting to have such a large world to explore, but when you start seeing settlements filled with the same (or very similar) monsters and destroyable objects over and over, it starts to get a bit dull. Occasionally you'll encounter some unique arrangements of objects such as department stores or mansions, but you'll still be fighting the same monsters and farming the same resources.

If I could change something in this game, I would nix a few of the side activities and add a greater variety of things to destroy (and tools that can be used to destroy them). With the title of the game being [i]DYSMANTLE[/i], it wouldn't hurt to bring even more attention to that aspect of the game.

Even with those criticisms in mind, though, I can recommend this game to anyone who is looking for a demolition-themed exploration game and doesn't mind having to do some grinding later on. I've explored about half of the map at this point, and while it seems like I've encountered most of what the game has to offer already, I definitely do plan to slowly continue through the remaining quests and areas.",1641262427,1641262427,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This is almost a thumbs down, but its a game that might appeal to people who just want to put a podcast on,  then play a chill game collecting resources and smacking 'zombies' around. If you'd like something more engaging than that, I would look elsewhere.

I've apparently put 50 hours into this game. I completed the main quest and a fair amount of optional content (though not all). If I played again I'd be able to shave off a little time, but I don't think I was overly slow.

Also, 36 hours in.... I have hardly dented the map?! I am already super satisfied and was about 35 hours ago to be honest. I think it may actually be my game of the year in terms of pure fun (and pure addiction lol)

Dysmantle is one of those games you play to pass the time. Having a severe case of ADHD, I can always use a game tha enraptures me, makes me focus, and help my brain to solve issues while I click my mouse around.

This game is lik this: it's the same old story for survival games with a quasi-like point-and-click ideia (some parts only unlock if you go to X to do Y while running away from Z).

The world is huge, and I mean H U G E with lots of areas connected by insanely far bridges that you have to run around to fix them or putting them back into position.

The story is mysterious enough I had to listen to all radios to start putting them together piece by piece. And now I am thinking it's a great setting for a Powered by the Apocalypse TTRPG or even FATE System.

In summary, Dysmantle made me cope better with pandemic times, specially during the 2021 holidays when wife and I could not visit others.

Temperature is used as a roadblock rather than requiring constant attention.  Focus on crafting and exploration rather than economics.

The good:
* Excellent level design.  The urge to just run to the next waypoint is checked by constant little bits to explore, or roadblocks that route you in more complicated directions.

* Good pacing. Grinding is kept to a moderate amount as you always need the next most precious commodity, and you tend to get the common stuff as you collect the rare stuff.  New recipes come with levels or waypoints, so you have to balance grinding with exploration and combat.

* Combat is solid.  A few too many enemies can be easily kited, but there's variety and challenge.  There are frequent optional challenges that reward you with exp.

* Exploration is rewarding.  Little pockets of houses, markers of buried treasure, fishing spots, single-puzzle tombs.  Usually something new around each ridge.

* Controls.  Controller support is just right.  Responsive, and the character moves quickly around the island.  There's fast travel that makes sense.

The bad:
Surprisingly empty of story.  While the island is cluttered with houses and campgrounds, there are not the diaries and letters you'd find in a lot of other games.  There are no apocalypse logs to make you feel like you're stumbling through the graveyard of other people's dreams.  You smash the computers rather then check other people's emails.

It is immersive, balanced, non-linear, and (if you like resource management + survival + building stuff + quests) very enjoyable! Some comments say it is very grinding, I respectfully disagree, there are way more grinding games out there. So far, I played 45 hours, and about 1/3rd was grinding to collect necessary resources for my own gameplay obsession. However, after you reach a certain level (i.e. about 23-26) you do not have to grind as often as before. In the end this is a survival game which facilitates different gameplay preferences, and it provides a journey from digging up for plastics to producing titanium.

The following tips are from me as someone who like to kill monsters with little damage sustained to myself while following quests:
1) always close the door after yourself; especially if you are new in the region
2) upgrade your gear, and craft as many different types of tools/weapons as possible (here you have to grind for resources, but it pays back) from the beginning
3) smash things again after each upgrade, each tool will destroy a different resource; and many things in the game are harvestable!
4) katana with all upgrades and a baseball card trinket  with all upgrades = you are set for good (almost). Now it depends on how good you are at rolling and avoiding attacks from bosses.

To be honest its all about the grind, but its satisfying and relaxing to survive (or die without real consequences).

But it's also not...

The general game play is entertaining, and the graphics are very nice with the tone almost soothing (despite it being zombie ridden).

But the general game play is also a near endless loop that never changes and the majority of the enemies are identical, or with identical attack patterns, that become increasingly dull to kill as you go on. And I mean within an hour or two, death will be pretty much non-occurring, unless you try to fight a 'boss' like enemy which could one-hit you - And this makes it feel much less survival-esque, as there's nothing really threatening... I ran into a frozen area with no warm gear, and only the gear I'd unlocked in the first 3 zones I'd cleared, and I casually cleared the entire zone without an issue.

Progressing from one area to the next is nice, but for the most part it's just, again, an endless repeat of the first house you visited - Hit items to break them apart --> Pick up materials --> Put them in storage --> And life goes on.

So yeah... it's fun... but it likely won't hold your attention for all too long. There are a few weapon upgrades and things, but again, it's just a numbers thing. Each weapon does the exact same thing - It swings - meaning there isn't much variety going on either.

Granted, the monster variety is a bit lacking, although there are several bosses and boss events that present unique challenges. But for most of this game, you’re going to be hitting stuff until it breaks so you can gather the parts and use them to build/upgrade your gear. Look forward to improving your ability to spot destructibles hidden behind vegetation, finding side paths that lead to rare resources, and learning the attack timing of your enemies so you can dodge/riposte them in the face.

Huge world, plenty of gear, tons of upgrades, and enough quests to keep you busy for a long time. I would have liked to have seen a bit more challenge, but as it stands it’s a solid bootstrapper with lots to see. B+.

It doesn't. You're meeting more powerful, unique types of enemies, including bosses. The map is HUGE. I've probably explored half of it, and not thoroughly at that.

The main loop is relatively simple, discover, destroy, upgrade and repeat. However, the game is packed full of places to explore, and is very open world. There are certain walls that prevent you going to X area until you've done Y, but none of it feels unnatural. What I like is the upgrade mechanic and it steadily allowing you to destroy more things. Take your original spot for instance, at the start, you can destroy very little, by the end of the game you can destroy basically everything there!

There is a bit of grind, but only if you want to complete in it's entirety. 

Note, this is NOT a survival game and you can not lose, in fact you will purposefully dispatch of yourself on numerous occasions to speed things up. The game plays like an ARPG with a massive focus on interacting with the world around you - mostly in destroying it.

The story isn't half bad either, not brilliant, but what I like about it is I only saw a 25min clip from Angory Tom on Youtube and decided I wanted this game. He hadn't progressed that far in the story so didn't really get any spoilers nor did I actually do any research beyond a quick skim of the store page. However, the world, or rather the lore of the island quickly develops and there are forces at hand which, from a quick video, I didn't expect.

It's not particularly hard (though there was a certain enemy spawn that sent me to my grave multiple times!) but it's challenging enough to keep you engaged while you progress.

Overall very enjoyable. I look forward to future titles/expansions in this franchise. The setup for this possibility is done very well, though in a way that isn't a cliffhanger. But, probably only noticeable if you did certain side-quests.",1640648962,1640649143,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

An almost cheerful, or as the game description says bittersweet, apocalypse wrapped into a light RPG with crafting, farming, fishing, slaying monsters, collecting tons of things, pretty much destroying everything you come across and generally being a bigger threat to the world and environment than the monsters.

A really slick, polished and competent Early Access game with an abundance of content even at this early stage. Main menu text says it's in alpha stage and the amount of content and stuff to do is huge. It's always a breath of fresh air to see a well made game that shows you what the complete product might actually feel and look like instead of throwing crumbs your way for months on end. The developers really seem to know where they want to take the game and what that path will be.

Visuals are bright, colorful and remind me of Torchlight. It may not be everyone's cup of tea, but they give those laid back, pleasant apocalypse feels. ""Yeah, everything went down the toilet, but I'm good. I'll just go whack that toaster, pull out all the electronics and then go plant me some corn."" There are no dark, creepy corners, black shadows and streaks of light through dirty windows, but the world still looks abandoned, desolate and taken over by nature. Monsters are creepy, menacing and some of them sound downright chilling and the ambience feels lonely despite cutesy visuals. Oh, one thing. The game uses emojis in some instances. That part looks overly trashy. Good thing you can turn them off, but I wouldn't raise an eyebrow if they somehow magically poofed out of the game.

Story is typical planet got vaporized by something lonely survivor material, but it takes a backseat to all the stuff you can do in-game. There are radios you can find that have a great, slightly cheeky and sarcastic, voice with helpful messages and warnings.

You start the game emerging from an underground shelter after who knows how many years of isolation into a world completely abandoned and populated by things that want to eat your face off. More importantly, populated by sooooo many things for you to smash, destroy and pulverize into pieces, collect what remains and then use those remains to craft or upgrade one of the bajillion things available to you. In the process of smashing with glee, collecting and building stuff, you'll get to whack some enemies and some wildlife. Hey, you need their skins and meat for survival, don't judge. There's enough enemy variety and each part of the map gets something new. Combat is a simple swing dodge mechanic, but it's very smooth and responsive and you do need to be careful to not get overwhelmed because enemies do hit hard.

It is sort of a light survival game, but there are no needs, you only have a health bar. You can replenish your health with bandages or food you can cook and the first time you eat a new recipe your health is permanently increased. There's no penalty for dying. You just respawn at the last campfire and can go pick up your fresh corpse with all the stuff you had on you when you died. Everything you do increases your experience and when you get a level you can pick a new skill. 

There's also light RPG mechanics, stats for items, tools you craft (crowbar, machete...), your own stats, trinkets, inventory, outfits and small quests. The game even keeps track of absolutely everything. Points of interest, creatures, kills, medals, recipes, amount of materials you have, everything is diligently tracked and you can always look it up. In-game map is excellent, very detailed and easy to read and orient yourself. The game uses campfires that you can find and use as resting points where you can store all collected materials and do a lot of different things, depending on what you have unlocked. A fast travel system exists where you can travel between radio towers you find. There's even a soulslike mechanic. Whenever you rest, it also respawns all the enemies. That can be stopped, but later in the game.

It can be argued there's a lot of grind involved in the mechanics, but there's so many things you can do and craft and the game always gives you something new to work towards. It feels like a very smooth loop of grind/reward making the progression a fun thing.

I haven't encountered any bugs or glitches in my playtime. For review purposes, played on an i7, RTX2070, 32GB of RAM and an SSD.

As mentioned, it's still in alpha Early Access and only about 1/3 of the game is accessible, but the game is very polished and so much fun even at this stage that I'm looking forward to what 10tons Ltd can accomplish when the game is completed. If you're looking for a joyful, apocalyptic, light survival/rpg/crafting game with a good amount of content, a fair price and developers that aren't overextending their ambitions, but seem to have the intended goal firmly in sight, look no further. Grab your crowbar and start smashing.

It has a (rough) storyline (“escape from the island”), it has a very clever skill tree and short missions to brighten your zombie-slashing day and upgrading a weapon and suddenly being able to fell trees or break down a whole barn with a baseball bat feels very rewarding - and then all of a sudden, you get access to frag grenades (!). You can farm crops and cook recipes for permanent skill buffs, it has a few non-threatening puzzles for short leisure breaks and just when you're fed up with killing the same (after a rest and health restore) respawning zombies over and over, it allows you to perm-kill them (in a very secluded area). Also loot doesn´t despawn, so no stress gathering a billion items. So the game is very balanced, the progress rewarding and the difficulty adequate. It also runs well on my 6 year old laptop with 2GB VRAM (and 16GB RAM).

CONS: gamepad control are non-working, also some of the keyboard/mouse setting are not accessible, e.g. try to navigate with WASD while shooting/aiming with a mouse and holding shift at the same time to run (and you can't remap run to caps-lock). Also panning the camera requires a mouse wheel - which sucks when you’re on a laptop with a trackpad. When pressing cmd-Q to quit the game, the game upon relaunch thinks it has crashed and presents a dialogue that can't be clicked away with my controller (or the return key), also disconnecting the controller doesn't switch to mouse/keyboard, so getting the game to run actually took me like 10 minutes. Cutscene dialogues are very quiet with very loud music, no matter what your settings for SFX / music are. Also I sometimes managed to click outside of the game, switching to my desktop (while being attacked by 2 Dire Wolfs, awesome), I don't know how this is possible when playing full screen.

CONCLUSION: a bit buggy, but once started, didn't crash in 13 hours straight during a very, very long live stream. Quite addictive, switches between ultra-hard/challenging when being attacked by 2 bosses at once and quite chill, when you go fishing, farming or hunting. Also I LOVE the animal trainer skill - seems superfluous to pet a deer on it's back and get  little pink hearts, but it’s so reqrding to it in the head from point-blank with a charged baseball bat attack :)",1640603742,1640603742,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

No, it's more focus on building up your tools and equipment as you explore the massive world, digging up lore (and treasures!) as you go.

It's a nice, relaxing little game about DISMANTLING pretty much everything you come across. The Zombie Apocalypse is over, and everyone's dead, except for you. Time to start crafting, killing and dismantling, to improve your arsenal of tools and gadgets. 
The map is enormous and there's a story connecting it. Progressing consists in advancing in the tech/blueprints tree, and that's done by deconstructing lots of stuff and then building new stuff with it.
Over time you get to deconstruct bigger and tougher items, improve your tools of deconstruction to do so faster, and also your weapon damgage.

There is always one more quest, recipe, upgrade or new region to get your grubby little survivalist hands into.

You wake up on an island after some kind of zombie apocalypse, and in between hours and hours of smashing things, uncover what happened to the island. The game is a huge achievement for a small studio who's previous works were low budget top-down shooters, and they're on their way to making some great games - but need to learn a bit more about balance first. The game is really polished, lovely art style and relaxing to play. Have to admit I would have enjoyed it a lot more if it was about 20 hours shorter, removed a third of the map, and reduced the material requirements by 30%. Would have felt MUCH better.

Don't get me wrong, I really enjoyed a huge part of this game. It's well made, relaxing, and it's fun to smash stuff. It's just that there's way too much of the smashing part and not enough story in between. I think if they gave you the most powerful smashing weapon DURING THE GAME instead of after you've 100%'d it, made the map smaller, and reduced the item requirements by a lot, it would have made a much better completely package. So I would recommend it, but bear in mind it takes a minimum of 60 hours to see everything (I ended up using a trainer for the Ark and the last part of the game because I was so fed up with the grinding).

[b]Pros[/b]
- Enjoyable gathering
- The combat is ok. Not brilliant, but it works
- Really nice art style
- Scalable UI and good options for ultrawidescreen
- Excellent progression system, but too grindy
- Literally everything is breakable - as long as you have the right tool / upgrades
- Huge map. Too huge.

[b]Cons[/b]
- EXTREMELY grindy. If you play it, rush the story; it unlocks stuff to smash things faster
By about 20 hours in, you're kinda hoping that there's an ultimate reward to smash things more easily in the game. Well, there is - but they only give it to you once you've 100% completed the game. After you've spent 60 hours smashing stuff, completed the Ark (which requires thousands of materials) AND completed the game and escaped the island, they give you the highest damage blunt weapon in the game, at which point it's entirely useless, you smash a few buildings and go ""huh, cool"", then close the game and never open it again.
- When you smash or gather something, the material dropped appears, but isn't picked up until you move again. Even once you get an item that auto-picks up items, it only works a second after the material appears in the world. It makes it a lot clunkier than needed to collect resources, which you'll be doing for about 90% of the game.
- The game won't let you sleep if it's less than 16 hours since the last time you slept, which means every day your sleep creeps forward ever so slightly, until you have to play through the night and day and wait for the next night
- Would like to be able to zoom in and out a bit
- Your character attacks in the direction he's facing, rather than the mouse cursor. It also locks onto distance enemies even when there's a closer one (primarily a melee game) which makes it really difficult to target the correct enemy when there are lots of them (like Obelisk challenges)
- Unexpected turrets placed off-screen that can kill you instantly are not a fun game mechanic
- Way. Too. big. The story / handcrafted bits are great; but there's so much pointless grinding and open map between them. Honestly the whole thing could be 30% shorter and smaller, and it would have felt much better designed

- Relaxing (break things then craft things to break even more things)
- Easy: Zombies are no harm; you do not get punished hard if something happens to you
- Good progression and pace early game (I'd say the first 10 hours unlocking around 66% of hidden items)
- Sightly funny somehow
- Achievements are achievable although a couple of them needs tough grinding

- Story could be richer
- Mid and late game is too grindy (you do not have the rewarding feeling of progression as the first 10 hours)

Once I got to around the 5 hour mark (when you first leave the tutorial/intro area and the credits roll), that's where I really began to question if I was really going to have a good time. I wasn't sure I was enjoying the combat. And I wasn't sure I just wanted to tediously break stuff for 120 hours.

But once I gave it some more time, it started to get its hooks in. There are more interesting enemies to find out in the open world, and the combat---while jank---does start to feel better and make more sense as the game goes on. I mean, it's still jank, but in a kinda dark soulsy ""it's kinda clunky and yet I'm into it"" sort of way.

But it was once I began working on the objective to reach and power on all of the warp points as well as activate the death signal to make it possible to permanently wipe all enemies in an area (normally they respawn every time you rest), I just got really hooked on the objectives of unlocking and clearing the map.

And even though I had just been ""mining"" furniture for 20 hours, I still felt like doing it.

MAKE SURE YOU ARE OKAY WITH MINING/CRAFTING TYPE GAMEPLAY. This game is really, really, really into mining furniture for crafting materials. It is intensely into it. This game is into breaking furniture for crafting materials the way that some people are into feet.

And although you might suspect as much by the kind of game it looks like, there really is no ""survival"" in this game. No hunger or ""sanity"" or anything like that. It's just you, your HP, and some monsters. Besides that, it's mining materials to improve your weapons and tools.

But the game is not without its criticisms either.

As much as I had a pretty good time just reaching every part of the map and wiping it free of monsters, there are other aspects of the game that just feel like tedious busy work or obvious ""material sinks"" for the ludicrous amount of broken furniture materials you end up collecting. These of course lead to objectives where you have to acquire and pay 10,000 chunks of plaster from broken toilets or something just cuz something something side mission quest. The reward for completing these kinds of objectives honestly is not even really that worth the amount of time it takes.

The game also kind of overstays its welcome a lot by the end. By the time I got all the engines to powerup the rocket to escape the island, I had reached and cleared every area of the map. I felt insanely powerful and unkillable. I was ready to be done. But the game still wants to keep adding more things for you to do, more material sinks, onto the end and I'll be honest I kinda just quit playing when I got to that point as it felt like I had pretty much digested what the game had to offer and it was trying to pull me along with filler.

But overall I had a pretty good time and it was an alright time waster for a week or two.",1637568301,1639530838,True,3,1,0.5404052734375,0,True,False,False

I did see the ending twists coming, mostly through the character's dialogue in reaction to the story snippets, but that was a good aspect. The core gameplay has a certain catharsis, almost everything can be broken for parts with the right tool, offering a nice feeling of treasurehunting and upgrading gear. Cooking, trinkets and upgrades allow a pleasant experience of gradually building your character up, food recipies give permanent bonuses, so exploring feels rewarded, always a plus.
So what are the game's downsides? The gameplay gets tedious fast. If you intend to play this game, ensure you have something to listen to, because while in the early stage the monsters are challenging, if you approach it with any amount of exploration, eventually most foes will become trivial, and once you max the research tree, which for me happened a little before half way, resource gathering becomes a grind. There are four bosses, which are reasonably fun fights. Although all four are basically the same. The enemies while varied in look aren't very varied in how you fight them. There are three ranged enemies, one of which is slow and sprays in an arc, the remaining two throw objects right at you, upgrading from toxic to explosive, and otherwise avoid you, with a power attack in close range. That's the extent of complex enemies. The remainder run at you, the only variation is how fast they run and how hard they hit, but the strategy is the same. Admittedly there is one, uncommonly seen enemy which has a dodge roll, and some turrets and mortars, but they are predictable.
The game has certain, secrets for those who want to play with deep commitment or skill. There is a special event for not dying, and one seemingly for defeating every single enemy on the map, three times. While this is something to commend in my eyes, both are drawn back by aforementioned tedious, grinding gameplay. The former especially, as the camera is not your friend and avoiding death entirely until, essentially the end of the game, is very difficult. Countless causes of instant death await you, from floor traps, to simply stumbling into a river while trying to see where you're going. I would note both of these tie into the story, and in pleasing ways, although... having listened to the audio logs of the king... I'm not sure the no death prize actually makes sense, given the, phenomena the king was supposedly studying.

Overall, I enjoyed my time in this game, and appreciate the way the gameplay mechanics were woven into the lore of the game world. I didn't expect it, but it was a very pleasant surprise.

Specially the ending is quite intriguing. I won’t list the good points here. You can experience them yourself. Despite the negative comment, it’s still worth a try.

Here are what I don’t like:

* The terrain design is pretty malice. It appears like an open world, but the map is cut into many small, enclosed blocks by all kinds of obstacles. You are forced to spend half of the game time running and circling around just to find the entrance. Then circling out. I’m talking about your being at 3 o’clock position and wanting to reach 12 o’clock, but the path between 1 and 2 o’clock is blocked. It’s all over the map. If you stretch all the paths into straight lines, you’ll find the entire map/quest/game play is linear like a tree diagram. So, it’s not an open world at all.

* Weapons are mostly used to destroy obstacles (90%+). You have to upgrade them because the obstacles have levels too. All weapons are melee type. The only firearm is a hunting rifle with max 7 rounds which has a ridiculously long reloading time. Before you can chamber the second round, the monsters are already in front of your face. So, no Rambo, Conan only. I find such setting ridiculous. Plus, by the time you obtain the most wanted, most powerful, most truly useful weapon, you are 5 minutes away to the end. That makes it more ridiculous.

* POV system is quite head-spinning. True it’s 3D, you can pan your view 360°. But there is no compass in the game. You’ll easily lose your sense of direction and go to the wrong way. After several hours try, I stopped panning and was forced to use true north isometric top-down view for the rest of the game play. Even so, I still had to open the map every several minutes to adjust my direction. 

Combining all three points above gives you one conclusion: to extend your game play time by wasting a lot of them. Despite all the good real game content, I still feel being played half of the time.

I'm really glad because I've played this game for a long time already and I've already gotten my money's worth out of it! The game is set far after some sort of apocalypse event with you coming out of your shelter after years of living in it. There are zombie like creatures all over and all you have is a crowbar and a backpack. You quickly find out the main draw of the game which is that you can whack pretty much anything in the game to pieces, like plastic chairs or picket fences, and when you do this you get materials out of them. You then use these materials at campfires which are scattered across the very large map to upgrade your crowbar and backpack. That is what you start with at least, but as you level up from getting XP from every action, your character starts inventing new ideas for tools or clothing or trinkets that boost various things such as your defense against the zombies or your chances of finding good materials.

The main core of the whole game is the destruction system and the materials, and it's really satisfying and fun to build your tools up. The coolest part of the game is that you level up the tools you create, and when you level them up, they do more damage to the objects in the world and in turn you are able to destroy bigger and more solid objects. So you get this fun loop of breaking things to upgrade your stuff with the materials, and then making stronger tools that let you break bigger objects, which then drop more valuable materials and allow you to upgrade your tools higher, again and again. And the scaling of destruction is fun. You start off only being able to break simple stuff like rusty grills or rotted picket fences, then destroying doors and cutting down trees, and finally near the end game being able to break down entire walls and street lamps, or even the cars. It's really neat and the map is really huge. I've explored 9 sections and there are still 9 sections I haven't even gone to yet.

I will say that the middle of the game felt a bit slow, with the XP feeling like it took a while to level up and was a lot of me hunting for specific objects for specific materials, although it is possibly the way I played because I mostly stayed in the same explored areas instead of branching out which seems to give a lot more XP than what I was doing. The combat is also not the most exciting thing ever, but it is fun enough and it also feels really satisfying that at the start I was terrified of the simple single zombies, and at the point I'm at, I run into a large group of multiple difficult enemies and just smack them around and dodge.

So overall I really like this game and I'm surprised that it doesn't seem to have much people talking about it which is a shame. It's an addicting loop and I'm still playing it because I want to keep exploring and destroying more stuff. I wanted to write this review because of the seemingly low buzz, and I hope I wrote it good enough that it convinces someone else to give it a shot! It's not very expensive even without the sale price, and I would have been glad to pay the full price because I've gotten so much fun out of it.",1639039775,1639039775,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It's quite challenging but definitely rewarding. You go around killing monsters and breaking up things (hence the title of the game) to collect resources. You can't dismantle everything to begin with - you have to upgrade your tools first and in some instances, create new tools to destroy certain things. This doesn't feel restricting though as I know it can in other games. Nearly everything can be destroyed eventually which really impressed me. Everything from clocks on the wall, coffee cups on the tables to toilets and big steel barrels. It feels so satisfying to break stuff which is great because it's one of the main mechanics of the game!

You need to return to a campfire to drop off the things you've gathered, claim the XP from the items and to save (you can save and quit at any time still but this is how you save and continue). This adds a risk/reward kind of mechanic - do I keep scavenging to find more items and hopefully find another campfire or do I play it safe and go back to one I've already discovered? If you do die, you can find your corpse and pick up all the items you had in your backpack when you died - so not all is lost. Every time you sit at the campfire, the monsters respawn which is good and bad - more materials to gather and XP but you will obviously need to kill them again. Healing is not something you can do straight away (it's unlocked with bandages slightly later on) so the campfire is the only way for you to replenish your health! One thing I'm super grateful for is that your items (including health items) automatically replenish at the campfire too! You also cannot die from starving or lack of sleep ect which I find fantastic! You're actually aloud to have fun and explore without always having to worry about that sort of thing. There is a cooking mechanic which allows you to add powerful permanent bonuses - like increased health for example so fishing/hunting/farming still has a reason to be included and feels worth while doing! You gather different recipes as you make your way through the game.

Progress and exploring is gradual but in the best way. New zones open up with more places to explore and the map is a pretty big which surprised me. There are plenty of quests and side quests to do too which you find organically when adventuring. I know it might sound dumb but the map shows you easily where you have and haven't explored yet because it start's out foggy and then clears where you have been. I know it's a small detail but it really helps me in games like this. You can also place waypoints which is a life saver!

Overall, I've had a fantastic time with the game so far and I highly recommend DYSMANTLE if you're looking for a post-apocalyptic game about scavenging that is tricky but rewarding. It's fair and not too punishing. Most importantly- it's FUN!",1639005205,1639005205,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

You got a crowbar, you hit shit, you upgrade to a baseball bat/axe, you hit more shit. You craft, you go through hot and cold zones. You craft clothing/trinkets to help you get through them. Trinkets can give damage, utility like item pick up radius, or faster fishing speed. You kill zombies. You make zombies stop spawning. If you don't make zombies stop spawning, they respawn every time you sit down at a campfire. And there's boss fights in almost every zone.

This game has some cutscenes, but you experience the story through things you have to find and listen to. It has nice ambience, and it was fun to do a victory lap after I beat the game to 100% each zone. That last part might not be for everyone, but I liked upgrading to destroy something I couldn't before. The only con I have is that the power fist and khopesh (end game weapons) come too late to matter to most players. They help with people trying to 100% it, but most people are going to see The Ark quest and go ""nah fuck that."" Thankfully you don't need to 100% the game for all the achievements, because some of them I just could not give enough of a fuck to do. Also, the throwables in the game make bosses really fucking easy. I nuked most bosses with a fuck ton of land mines.

Also it's criminal the music in The Ark isn't anywhere for me to listen after I beat the game.

The gameplay is exactly how it looks in the videos, and it's very simple to get used to.

The game is also very relaxing and doesn't require much effort for you to put in, but it can become a grind very quickly depending on your playstyle.

For instance, if you want to just complete the game (Of which the Story is really well done, and is absolutely worth going through) then there is not much grind, But if you are a completionist, like me, then this game will take a while as the amount of resources required to max out all your gear can be hectic, plus there is one quest in particular which rewards you with the best Dysmantling tool the game has to offer but it requires so many resources that it will have you questioning if it was really worth it (which it totally is!).

All in all though, the game has very simple gameplay, but it's diverse in its features because it offers a lot for you to do, So should you be thinking of buying it then the real question you should ask yourself is, do you enjoy breaking things? because if not then you more than likely wont like Dysmantle.

There isn't really anything new here. Collect wood, build an ax, chop down stronger things with the ax, upgrade the ax damage, repeat. Build stronger tools.  Do more of the same. Explore every inch of the ENORMOUS map. Uncover riddle tombs, combat challenges, story quests and side quests, audio tapes and documents to reveal bits of the thin story, fish, find recipes, craft and cook, fight bosses, sneak around, fight through thousands of enemies, unlock pathways. There are plenty of random events to take your from you hacking and slashing everything you can get your hands on. 

The game is a ""survival"" game in a lighter sense. You don't need to eat or drink. If you die you respawn at camp. Once you have turned off respawns in an area, you can suicide a few times if needed to clear out an area. It's not without its challenges though. Combat is a little wonky. Sometimes auto-targeting will be your nemesis. Some zombies/monsters are quite challenging, especially early on. Tip for hard challenges: drop a half dozen of the land mines and run the bosses to them. There are places where the floor falls out from under you. You can fall in holes or water if you aren't paying attention well enough. There are climate challenges where you need gear with protection from heat or cold. 

The variety of locations is good, but there is a redundancy due to the massive size of the world map and each district therein. There isn't a lot of monster variety, but each variation does have its unique traits. 

My favorite part of the game was just exploring the large world. The mini-map could be better. Fast travel between camps would be the greatest thing ever. Right now it is limited to travel between radio towers. 

I'm 40 hours in, a large section of the map is visible now, but there's still plenty to go. The price point is very reasonable. I picked it up on sale for $13.

I'm looking forward to seeing what the developers do with it in the next iterations, patches and even DLC.

Other than a few random notes there doesn't seem to be much in the world they've built except the one story line and one drive. Out of a land where thousands of people lived and died, no one seems to have left behind anything to remember them by except buildings, cars and junk. Lots of junk!

Its a survival game but somehow feels like it managed to not have all the bad parts of your typical survival.
[list]  [*] Grinding doesn't feel like grind.  Most necessary grinding can be done fast or items are easy to find.
 [*] Crafting is a good bare minimum. Debating on Whether to focus on the shirt or a tool isn't a headache at all. The list of items are one thing and no need to focus on building an upgraded version later. You make a shovel and thats the one you use for the whole game.
 [*] Management is not needed. It was nice not having to worry about shelter, food, or typical things that is your basic worry to survive.
 [*] Very forgiving.  You almost feel like failure is ok, get up and try again. Of course you will try not to fail but if you do, get back up. :)
 [*] The exploration. I guess this game is more exploration than it is survival. The exploration aspect is the focal point of all this. The map is HUGE. Considering the hours I put in and I still haven't unlocked all sections yet.  Along with that, each area does a good job of being different from the last.  Devs also put in some nice little things to reward little exlorations.

This game can be great if you love suvival but want a more casual game experience.  Its a really chill and play type of feeling game. The amount of things to do and see will keep you busy. Even if you are unsure what to do, the game will find a way to offer something until you find what you want to do. 

If I can put on a cheerleader outfit and jump around to  suggest this game, then I would be weird. Just take my suggestion if you like survival. Or even a person that wants a try for the first time.",1638760570,1638760570,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Compared to other open world crafting games however, this is VERY easy to pick up, not overly complicated and quite forgiving for players new to the genre. There are a lot of things to do, but it feels like it gives the game a sense of variety rather than suffocating you with numerous choices.

The Good:
The map is absolutely massive and curated for exploration, giving you hours of gameplay through just exploring. As you discover abandoned camps, towns, homes and other derelict structures you slowly flesh out how the world was like, pre-apocalypse. Crafting system is not overly complicated too, you won't feel overwhelmed with numerous things you need to craft in order to advance your progress as it seems very intuitive; unlike other games of the similar genre where you feel very overwhelmed and don't know where to start and you could feel like making a mistake.

The Bad:
There are times it feels like a little bit grindy, especially if you go for a day or two without any crafting or upgrading. The resources you'll be needing may be far off and you haven't discovered yet, which encourages exploration, but may take a while to get. What I like about it though is the game rewards you for gathering resources, no matter how useless they seem to you, they still give you experience towards your next level. You'll sometimes encounter situations that may seem above your level already because of this, but it quickly catches up as you move along.

The Ugly:
Since the main point of the game is gathering and you have to do some inventory management, you'll have to constantly backtrack to the nearest camp several times as you gather materials and store them in your trunk. This, I think, will consume the most of your time. As of the time of this writing I'm currently at the point of the game where I need to gather every material. Even though I have several inventory skill upgrades and have fully upgraded my backpack, I still find myself going back to camp really often.

Overall, this game is absolutely wonderful and perfect for anyone who wants to chill out in a zombie apocalypse setting. There's a co-op option as well so you can go wrecking everything with a friend or two, which I haven't tried, but for sure will be a wonderful experience, probably like Stardew Valley multiplayer. I got this during the Autumn Sale but would be willing to buy it for full price because I think it would give me hundreds of hours of gameplay - and since the game has just gotten out from EA, there are a lot of things in store as shown in their road map, so more content in planned for this game which I am looking forward to, as it may give players a reason to do another run to experience it all over again.",1638756904,1638756904,True,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

A top-down Action RPG with Open World Survival Craft elements. There is a surprisingly huge, interconnected map to explore with tons of content. Almost everything is destructible, which has a progression system behind it tied to your skills/levels/equipment. The game is more casual than difficult. Highly recommended, worth $20.


[h2]Detailed Review (Moderate spoilers)[/h2]
[h3]Gameplay[/h3]
This game has many obvious inspirations from other games, from general design choices to specific game mechanics:
[list][*]Fallout, for its apocalypse aesthetic and ""loot everything and deal with a constantly full inventory"" aspect
[*]Dark Souls, for its punishing enemy damage, bonfire checkpoint system, weapon swing delay (however, no ""Souls-like"" difficulty is found here)
[*]Breath of the Wild, for its large open world, shrine puzzles, and tower-based map region reveal and fast-travel system
[*]Diablo, for its top-down ARPG feel[/list]

You gain XP/levels from most actions and from defeating monsters. Upon leveling you can choose a permanent stat boost, and you may unlock some nodes on the skill tree, although unlocked nodes must still be purchased with materials. There are no rogue-like elements here; enemy placement, drops, and other maps aspects are all fixed and hand-placed. There seems to be very little RNG.

The crafting elements are quite limited. You generally can't craft anything that is perishable or of limited quantity. Almost every resource goes toward permanently unlocked skills, equipment upgrades, or certain elements on the map such as for backtracking shortcuts or sidequests. Food is crafted only one time each for permanent upgrades.

One of the more interesting mechanics is the destructible objects system. Almost every piece of every structure in the game can be destroyed. Each object may require a certain tool to damage it, and the tool must have a certain minimum damage value. For example, after upgrading the Baseball Bat a few times, you can now break refrigerators when looting houses, which drops new useful materials. But the Baseball Bat cannot damage vehicle wreckage; you'll have to find and upgrade a new tool in order to do so. If you choose, you can focus on upgrading certain tools early on in order to have an easier time breaking certain objects, sometimes opening a different path in the world earlier than otherwise. Furthermore, you can eventually backtrack to previous areas with stronger tools, then break and loot objects that you couldn't previously.

Even though I consider the game to be open world with a huge map, you are somewhat restricted in where you can go until gaining certain upgrades, or going around the long way and unlocking the door from the other side to create a shortcut, Dark Souls/Metroidvania style. The quests can lead you along, and in a few places are required to make progress - but for most of the game, where you go and what you do is up to you. Every map region has a Link Tower for fast travel/map unlock, and there are tombs with puzzles, obelisks with combat challenge minigames, fallout shelters with tower defense-style minigames, and more. There are a ton of things to keep you busy.

There is a temperature system where you take gradual damage in certain areas if you don't have the right upgrades or protective gear equipped - but this is mostly a soft-restriction. If you are brave and fast enough you can often run through these areas early.

However, the abundance of choices introduces a few balance issues. You may find some encounters suddenly trivialized after lots of upgrades. You may max out a few tools, then circle the entire map unable to break certain objects, until stumbling upon a quest that finally gives you the next set of materials to create the next tool - and if you had just known to go there first, life could have been easier. But perhaps this only occurs with extremely OCD gameplay styles like mine, and when unlucky. And while the game is not very challenging overall, one or two enemy types are extremely dangerous at all levels and can suddenly one-shot you, while nearly every other enemy is eventually trivialized. On that note, the variety in enemies is somewhat lacking.

This game can be extremely grindy if you let it be - if you are the type to slowly move through every abandoned house in Fallout, carefully looting almost everything, you may enjoy this game a lot.

[h3]Story & Sound[/h3]
The story is mostly delivered through small bits of lore at a time, sometimes when you stumble upon a radio or notepad in an abandoned building, or just visually when exploring, such as seeing tire tracks followed by a crashed vehicle. There is almost no music except for the title screen, although the sound design is solid and atmospheric. I found myself turning the sound down and having a stream or a movie up on the side; it's one of those games that's very good for that and doesn't require your undivided attention.

[h3]Controls[/h3]
I played this only on single player mode with mouse and keyboard. It does feel like the game was designed for gamepad first, with some small mechanics being frustrating at times on mouse and keyboard. Sometimes it's hard to control your character's exact facing direction, sometimes the attack input or sprint input get mysteriously dropped, but overall it still controlled quite well. Few keybindings are even used as the controls are very simple.

[h3]Graphics & Performance[/h3]
The graphics are decent. I appreciate the extremely fast loading times and good performance, while being pleasing to look at albeit not super high-fidelity. I do wish the UI was a bit more practical and that there were more configuration options, but it is functional and fine with the mouse and keyboard. It does feel like you should be able to rotate the camera more, and it takes a while to get used to that fact - you can't zoom out or tilt it far from the top-down orientation. Fullscreen windowed mode was the default, and I played at a 4k resolution with zero issues and no crashes.

[h3]Summary[/h3]
This took me about 75 hours to beat - but that should vary wildly depending on your style of play of these kinds of games. I did not get 100% of everything, but I went pretty deep on a few things.

Overall, I had a very satisfying time with this game. I found it quite addictive almost immediately after starting, once experiencing the destructible object system and upgrading my starting tools. Dysmantle is certainly a gem.",1638631294,1638636952,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I think it is a good experience, but it absolutely pushes the boundaries for the grind right up to the edge at every turn. It always ends up acceptable, but you'll be conscious of it. It will introduce a new mechanic arbitrarily and seldom used just to make opening a door, or accessing an area more complicated.

The only time I felt that the grind stepped over the line was, what I assume is, the very end. There is a challenge that arises as you try to escape, and it requires you to build things to help you. I have not built a single thing in this game except for when the tutorial showed me how. Did not build anything except for the tutorial, but as I'm trying to escape, I suddenly have a huge grind in front of me so I can build some things to help me with a final challenge. Maybe building will become a very integral thing at 1.0, but for now it only exists for one last grind session at the end of the game.

That is the most polished game I've played in a long time.
It's so nice to see a reasonable devs who focus on main game loop and try to make it best it can be.
Great example of how 'more' does not equal better, and how good design is about leaving stuff out.

Who is it for:
- Everyone minus people who like hardcore stuff and punish themselves with games.

For players:
- Can get a bit borish/grindy mid-late game if you rush for 2-3 days straight - so, don't do it :)
- Don't pull the ""Hinterlands mistake"" here - don't spend 20 hours clearing first zone, explore instead.
- I recommend focusing on reaching Link Tower in each zone first and buying ""kill signal"" ASAP. (Blue orbs it costs you get from tombs - so explore those right away).
- Never kill stuff if you don't have to before ""kill signal"" is installed (you will need ""mana"" that drops on perma-kills later on, so may as well start gathering it early).

For devs:
- I know it's not the kind of game focusing on the lore, but would be nice imho to have radio messages logged somewhere.
- Don't know how, but some mid-late game change of pace would be welcomed (maybe something base-building related?).

While other games give you specific spots to break to gain resources, DYSMANTLE instead makes everything breakable, provided you have the right tools, and gives you resources and xp for doing it. You use resources by inventing and upgrading tools, trinkets and features and in a way it's a grindy game, because there is a wide range of resources and the way they are distrubuted, you don't feel the grind because you'll be too busy exploring the map. The controls are also very good and there is enough options that makes for a very modular experience.

The map itself is huge(through currently only the eastern 1/3 of the map is available) and provides plenty of things to explore and discover. Finding all the Tomb, Buried Treasures, Wishing Wells, Gathering Spots, Link Towers, Obelisks, Fishing Spots, Consoles, Locked Doors, Shelters, Radios, Quests and other hidden treasures are sure to keep you exploring and providing with countless hors of entertainment.

The story and the visual style is very simple. It doesn't have an in-depth story, you are put on a secluded that has gone through the Zombie Apocalypse, sorry Ex-Human Apocalypse, and you have hidden in the shelter for a few years. You emerge to the world when you ran out of food and must escape the island. This timeline reinforces the visual style with decayed houses where parts of the walls have decayed and rest is covered in overgrown vines. The graphics are also very simple, which let me run it even in my old computer. The only voice comes from the radios and very drab, but it helps that it is established as a pre-recorded message that give quick snippets of worldbuilding. The only other comments comes from the internal monologue of the Player Character, which reacts to thing that happen around them with quick snips that helps it feel like a real character. This game style is reinforced by the gratuitous use of emoticons that comes with the PC commentary and pre-recorded radio, which reinforces the simplistic charm of the game.

I like this game. I do not say that about many games these days, but this one I will. 

Pros:

-Lots of content.
-No noticeable lag.
-Simple, yet innovative combat system.
-By simply not ""Googling"" any of the content.... this game will keep you guessing. I like that.  

Not really cons, but suggestions:
-I would like to see an overhaul to the follower system. Instead of animals just following you around it would be nice to have UI nameplates, and creature commands. Also would like to see enemy creature npc's become tamable.
-Better Audio controls. In this game we chop, salvage, and beat the heck out of nearly everything in our path, unfortunately for us the sound effect from doing so overrides other important audio features for hearing incoming attacks, and ""atmospheric presence"".

This is a well thought-out zombie thrasher in open world that tries to mix in different genres. Sort-of an arcade version (less survival) of Project Zomboid (those that have played it will notice similarities here and there). There isn`t all that great variety of mobs and combat can get a bit repetitive (apparently you can level up to lvl 300??), but the progression was well done in my opinion, using gear and key requirements to keep some form of direction without restricting you too much. I was expecting it to be a quick game but 30 hours in and I only have completed half the main story quests and less in optional quests. The story is also decent and keeps me looking forward to finding the next radio recording. My only complaints would be farming is a bit of a hassle (increase the planting action speed, filling the whole garden on my farm drags out too long) and having to backtrack to find lumber was annoying as well. I understand separating steel and lumber production to north and south makes you explored more but if you take a south path you hit fixable bridges needing lumber, unlike the north path where you don`t need steel to cross over roads (I think.... could be wrong). But hey that is a prefectly acceptable....(well it is...) map layout. 

Overall I would give the game a 8/10. A bit grindy but totally a decent game worth trying if you like zombies, hack and slash and having a storyline at the same time. You can beef up mobs after clearing zone if you like grinding/slaughtering mobs even more.

Oh and you can destroy most things on the map as you get new weapons and upgrade your gear. Thought I should throw that in since that is the point of the title. No biggy... >.>``  (see zombie in room, smash wall behind said zombie, bonk over the head with sledgehammer, move on to zombie #254,...or was that #1254??...).

P.S. Helpful hint if you want to cut back on grinding, go straight for the relay towers before exploring. Turning off monster respawn will keep you from having to re-clear areas if you die. Also explore north before south, weather is better south but I think the developers had north before south in mind when they were designing the map, progression works better that way.",1638341017,1638341775,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

In China, I heard there are places that people pay to enter and break stuff inside. Like mirrors, crystals, lumber objects and there are tools and weapons for you to have fun. People pay so they can de-stress. Pretty cool, huh?

That's what happened with me playing Dysmantled. I came home from work and crowbar things. So wonderful.

My only observation are a few things (I hope this helps):
-When you finish the game, I lost interest in breaking stuff for the ark or to get other stuff;
-We could have more new monsters in the last areas;
-The narrative is very interesting but too few elements to expose her through out the game;

That's it;

I discovered that I like to break things. Do you guys have any suggestion of similar games?

I wrote my first review at 9.5 hour playtime and now it is nearly 80 hours and I still enjoy it.

This game reminds me of Legend of Zelda Breath of The Wild since they have some similarities in terms of world exploration, puzzle, and treasure finding. There are puzzle/mini games (aka the tombs) in this game, just like the Shrines in BOWT but a much simpler version. Also, there are treasure spots where you really need to pay attention on environmental details (e.g. stones arranged in an arrow shape) to find them, just like the Koroks in BOTW.

[Review at 9.5hr playtime]

My wife and I have enjoyed playing this game so far. However, there are some game designs that can be annoying at times:

1) The character models look identical, making us mistake each other's character at times. It is a real issue when fighting mobs.

2) We can't sleep at the same time. So, I and my wife have to take turn to sleep. It might be logical in real life where one person goes to sleep and the other person stays on guard. But that logic doesn't apply in this game because once you sit at the campfire, you and your partner become invulnerable. So, why do we have to take turn to sleep?

3) There seems to be no option to destroy dropped items. We usually have to drop common items like leaf and we never want to pick them up again because we already have like a lot of them. Is there a way to permanently drop them?

UPDATE ON #3: I found a way to not automatically pickup unwanted items. You can go to the Collection menu and opt out the items that you don't want to pick up. However, I still want to see an option to destroy items so that they don't make a mess of unpicked items on the ground.",1637355439,1638243749,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Zombie apocalypse, sole survivor, open world, craft and upgrade your stuff to survive, you've heard this one before, but Dysmantle has a laid-back charm that I really appreciate.  This is not a hardcore simulation game -- you're not eating food to survive, you're cooking and eating food as an upgrade to your body just like you craft upgrades for your equipment.  As your character levels up, you learn how to craft new tools which let you harvest more resources and access more of the world (and also improve your ability to exploit the parts of the world you've already unlocked).  I (as of about four hours in) surely haven't gotten too far out of the early game, but the developers have so far kept my interest in crafting a beautiful world that feels lived in (or ""ex-lived in"", I suppose).  Combat is, as with many of these ""rogue-lite""/""souls-lite"" games, more of a puzzle than anything else, where caution is rewarded but you can build yourself into a combat tank as you advance.

I'm looking forward to the promise of transitioning out of the ""scrape a living at camps"" phase and into the ""investing in infrastructure and base-building"" phase, but I'm very glad that the camping phase doesn't feel like I'm trying to knock down a brick wall with a whiffle ball.

It's satisfying to destroy everything in sight, stopping only briefly to smash in the head of an interrupting mutant. However, don't be fooled by the 'relaxing game' category - it's stressful as heck to be ambushed by a group of mutants while carrying the only electrical equipment for miles around. 

There are some less than ideal things. The game doesn't have a steep learning curve, and takes a hands-off approach to teaching, but that meant there were a couple of things it took me a long time to figure out. Also, if you hate grinding/crafting in other games, this might not be for you. This game takes grind to a zen level - allowing you to work out your life stresses by destroying a barn with a machete, panel by panel. There are also no character options - it would be nice to at least have a female player choice.

If they had a difficulty slider for tombs I would recommend this game hands down.

It's alright. 
It is your typical game. It has crafting, fighting, surviving. The biggest complain I'd have about the game is that it is mostly about completing quests. Crafting is a secondary feature that aids you in completing those quests and in order to craft things you have to use this crowbar to smash things  f o r e v e r. 

It was alright in the beginning, but it gets tedious after a bit and then some. 
So, as I said. The game is alright. There wasn't anything super special about it. I am not even sure how they could fix that balance to prevent it from becoming so tedious smashing things. Smashing things is part of their concept and in the title itself. 

Maybe, if they made it more necessary to smash things for your very survival INSTEAD of just crafting things to finish the story-line quests then it may feel like there is more use to it. If you craft food items you don't ACTUALLY have to eat food to survive. You can replenish your HP or get a stat bonuses. You don't NEED to craft a sleeping bag to sleep, but if you do you can have a couple hour bonus to your stats as well. There are a few things that you need to survive, like a warm hat when you head into the colder regions, but you don't need it unless you go there to complete your quests. Ergo, most of the things you have to craft are only needed to finish the quest - not for your survival. 

I wish Steam allowed us to pick a neutral standpoint on our reviews instead of picking yes or no in our recommendation.

The game is SLOW, and most of the gameplay is harvesting stuff from the land(Dysmantling things!) - so long as you're aware of that, it's an absolute blast.

Everything is nice and simple, and it's not punishing at all.

The story is interesting, though some may say a bit generic, but I liked it a lot.

Pretty much every thing you do gives you xp(Yes, collecting things gives you XP, it's the name of the game), so you're always progressing no matter what you're doing. 

Combat is simple, you have two attacks and a dodge roll, but it works. Sometimes simple is better and here it clearly shows.

This game also has the best minimap / map I've ever seen. As a person who regulary gets lost both in games and in real life, i've NEVER gotten lost in Dysmantle, due to the insanely detailed map. Whoever made the map needs a raise, 10tons!

My biggest gripe with this game is the soundtrack - the fact that, there is none. I feel like with a well produced soundtrack and some steller voice acting, maybe some improvment on the writing, this game could have went from a fun little indie game to game of the year 2021 IMO.",1638002022,1638002022,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

- Game is forgiving. There's no typical survival game elements like thirst, hunger and tiredness and you can run forever. When you are slain you can go retrieve your scavenged loot. 
- Combat is rather simple. You have mostly melee weapons and tools, but I think if I play more I can have a firearm. When you nail down the simple horde rush AI you can breeze through them. Some tougher enemies only have 1 or 2 alternate attacks, and with the exception of the pitcher who wants to keep distance with you so they can spam their ranged attacks nothing can stop you and your infinite dodge rolls and spacing. 
- For my playtime there's no base building yet. You can build contraptions that help with exploring the big map, and for crafting you can break down the world's structure to build and upgrade your gear. Real rewarding when you tear down a shack with a baseball bat. 
- Game is isometric and looks great. The backstory behind it is intriguing enough. Some design elements and iconography might be a bit dull though. The enemy looks are rather utilitarian, but I like some of them.

If you don't break things down as you go and collect things, you will run into dead ends where you have to go farming items.

I really enjoy all the different types of quests.  The farming and cooking system is a nice addition while not being completely neccessary.  The temperature function is well done and not over bearing.  I like the tower defense missions.  There are fetch or find missions but they aren't the bulk in my opinion.  The flavor text is entertaining.  The enemies are varied but like any good game, they tend to build on themselves.

For instance, there's a zombie that rushes you.  Then there's one that rushes but holds back and throws poison at you. Then there's one that does the same thing but throws three balls and they land and explode.

While the enemy types don't vary tremendously, each enemy prepares you somewhat for the one in front of it.

Overall, the game hits the mark for me and I recommend it.",1637866323,1637866323,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I can recommend the game to certain types. If you enjoy Forager or collecting scrap in Fallout games or maybe liked rolling up the world in Katamari Damacy, I think this may be of interest. Effectively, if you like collecting things, you'll likely get something out of this game. I'd give the game a B or 4/5 or what ever qualifies as ""fun game to play."" I wouldn't go into expecting to 100% it, though that doesn't seem to be too hard, just a time investment (guessing 60-70 hours). A lot of bang for the buck, indeed.

The game in general in simple, and that works for and against itself. It feels well polished, because it is simple enough to not trip over itself. It is enjoyable without stressing out the player, even when the character dies from things.

The game is much larger than one would think going in, which is why I haven't finished the game yet. At this point I'm not bothering to explore as I did when I first started. I think the cause of that, is that the game has a lot of content, but the progression of the tech tree happens too quickly relatively. This causes the feel or flow of the game to change by the 20 hour mark. Initially one would want to go about, and upgrade their gear quickly, so you dismantle everything you can, so you can dismantle even more stuff down the road, and later that stuff isn't needed, so there is little reason to dismantle things. The character progression feels fun, it gives a lot of short term goals. After a while, the tools used don't change much, so the game plays differently, and that change can be jarring between expectations and what it becomes. This causes a feeling of tediousness, which is a bit misplaced.

I say it is misplaced, because the issue turns into wanting to know more of the story and to progress more in the quests, but having to get between point A and point B is a task with little reward. I'll likely continue with the game for a while yet, as I want to know more about the world, but that is the only thing that drives me now. The combat is getting more intense as I progress, but it is never overly challenging (death signal mechanic).

All in all, I do enjoy the game quite a bit. Some interesting mechanics like the perma buffs for first time cooking, I love. The death signal mechanic is great. I haven't tried the ascension mechanic, but I don't know if there is a reason to bother. Already filled The Ark. Came for the dysmantling, stayed for learning more about the world. I feel it gets more interesting the longer it is explored.

I did touch on the size of the world map before hand, and the map itself is pretty great. Each zone has its own stories, so those are fun to learn. I can't say that I want the map smaller to balance the game's progression out, as that'd be a disservice to one of the best parts. Just would like more character progression or slow down the early progression to better balance it out.

Okay, let's talk about the co-op mode. I didn't know that there was even an option to play local co-op. Gameplay is still the same but you get 2x faster exp. It is a shared inventory and you have individual health bar. Only one character gets to control the camera movement and the FOV is very small which limits a lot of movement (no change from default FOV).

The game throws you into a zombie apocalypse as a prepper who has to leave his shelter because of his dwindling ressources.
Not a very new idea.
But instead of sending you out to scrape by on dewdrops and larvae this game completely forgoes the all too common stamina, hunger and thirst meters and instead demands from you to dismantle every single thing around you in order to upgrade your gear.
Why would you upgrade your gear though? Well, to be able to dismantle even more things! And there can be a lot of fun in that! My wife stood besides me, shaking her head, while my friend and I smashed an entire graveyard's fence into pieces in order to gather iron and stone while giggling like madmen!

The game does not however lead you very well when it comes to progression. At first in seems like leveling up (you get XP for everything you smash, from chairs to houses to zombies and even some bosses) is the way to go, you unlock a tool every few levels, but at some point you have to go to a specific point on the map in order to get better materials. From what I gathered the best tools in the game are blocked by some kind of quest as well.

Speaking of quests, you have a story to lead you through the world, but some steps in you have to take detours in order to get the right tools before you can complete the next step in your journey. This lead to more or less aimlessly wandering about, doing side activities and scouting the edges of the map for hours. Even if you read guides or look at maps from more experienced players there is quite a lot of ground to cover here, after over 15 hours of play I haven't seen more than 1/3 of the map yet.
I have leveled up a lot exploring this part of the map, so I have seen most of the inventions you can discover while resting except for a few still missing at the ends of the invention trees.

I also want to mention that playing this game in coop seems to make it faster and easier, I don't know whether the game raises the enemies hitpoints when playing in coop, but the AI always seems to chase the player that last damaged it, making it a lot easier to play as a team.

Would I recommend this game?
Yes, to anyone who finds fun in standing up and completely removing your friendly neighbourhood zombie's house, so it has to respawn without a roof over its head. And to anyone who likes their apocalyptic environment without having to constantly worry about food, drink and stamina bars.
I also liked the fast loading times and the aesthetics.",1637832992,1637833401,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

[b]1.0 FULL RELEASE REVIEW[/b]

[b]DYSMANTLE[/b] is a top-down, open-world survival title with some souls-like elements. The adventure takes place in a remote country called ""The Island State"", where a mysterious disaster struck, forcing people to take shelter in various bunkers and fortifications. The protagonist appears to be the only survivor, as he exits his shelter years after the disaster to search for supplies and understand what might have happened.

[td]
- Bizarre, but ultimately functional, blend of souls-like and open-world survival mechanics.

- Enormous world filled with plenty of tasks to discover and complete.

- Enjoyable, addictive progression system.

- Interesting story with numerous lore documents and additional info.
[/td]
[td]
- Severe disproportion between progression pacing and actual content amount.

- Immense amount of boring missions, tedious tasks and grinding in the later game phases.

- Disappointing ""unique"" bosses: they often are recycled / up-scaled normal enemies.

- Several side activities eventually become redundant or useless.

[td][b]Content & Replay Value:[/b][/td]
[td]May greatly vary depending on completion and playstyle. It took me around 35 hours to get to the end of the game, while doing a good number of side activities and exploration. However, a ""100% everything"" run would take much longer: no less than 75 hours in my estimate. There are no changes or choices in a second run: replay value is negligible.[/td]
[/tr]
[tr]
[td][b]Is it worth buying?[/b][/td]
[td]For the price of 20€, the amount of content offered would be great on paper, however its tedious nature reduces the effective value significantly. I'd only (cautiously) suggest this game to grinding / completionism fanatics that do not mind protracted, extreme repetition of tasks. To anyone outside this niche, I'd suggest to move on to other titles instead.[/td]

[td][h3]Verdict: Mediocre[/h3]
[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2548409603]Rating Chart Here[/url][/td]
[td]Despite several good concepts and an initially fresh, addictive gameplay, DYSMANTLE feels dispersive, disproportionate and fails to set a proper pacing in the long run. This game falls into mind-numbing levels of tedium that become a huge chore, well past the point of non-enjoyability.[/td]

[h1]In-Depth[/h1]
[h3]Open World Survival Craft... Souls-Lite?[/h3]
First and foremost, DYSMANTLE is an open-world survival that puts material collection and crafting as central parts of its gameplay. The main thing you'll do while exploring the diverse biomes of the island, that range from snowy mountains to tropical jungle, will be tearing apart everything in sight. Trash bins, fences, trees, tents - eventually even whole houses - are just a few of the endless destructible elements present in each area. Each of them provides precious materials ranging from common scrap metal to rare circuits or alloys, always in relation to the object in question. These resources can be then employed in crafting new tools, unlocked as the character levels up, reinforce existing ones for better damage or passive bonuses, and later on build permanent facilities used to process materials. This system proves addictive and satisfactory, as the constant flow of new materials, locations and tools to experiment with is good... for a while.

The survival aspect is limited, as there's no food consumption nor stamina or necessity to sleep, however environmental hazards can be lethal, requiring specialized gear to pass. Food serves a purely passive purpose, as cooked dishes will provide one-time permanent bonuses, but little else. With all those monsters around, combat will also be a regular activity, carried out mostly in melee and with the aid of gadgets, such as mines, throwing knives and more. 

Combat takes inspiration from souls games in several ways, such as the presence of a dodge-roll, limited usage charges for items (including healing) replenished at bonfires, and even a body that stays after death, containing all your carried items - there's no stamina though. Enemies do respawn each time the character dies or rests, but there's a way to prevent this from happening and get rewards in the process. While enemies do hit fairly hard, combat overall feels clunky and unresponsive especially when it comes down to ranged attacks or gadgets, enemies later on will rarely prove dangerous and start feeling tremendously repetitive, as the game doesn't really have any ""endgame"" or ""late-game"" enemy class that can stand up to par with a maxed out players - bosses included.

[h3]An Island Full of Mysteries[/h3]
There's more than just bashing monsters and grinding resources. The island is vast, and full of secondary activities to complete. Tombs are probably the most important, awarding mission-critical materials for their completion, usually barred behind tests of agility or puzzles. Timed Crates contain heaps of resources but only open if reached in time, while Wishing Wells will require a sacrifice for a greater reward to be gained. Shelters act as a tower defense minigame instead, with special monsters attacking a transmitter you need to defend with the aid of automated defenses. Regular secondary quests, each with their little story, are also fairly frequent and often award great amounts of XP, other than sometimes useful items to access certain areas. Of all the side activities Tombs are the only really remarkable one, offering diverse and worthwhile challenges that break the gameplay loop and give needed diversity - the rest of such activities is alright but rarely exciting.

[h3]The Big, The Bad & The Grindy[/h3]
So far everything sounds pretty good, right? I thought that too, until i reached around the 17-20 hours played mark. From there onward, the tremendous pacing, progression and balance problems of this game become apparent. First of all, the world is enormous and filled to the brim with far too many activities in comparison to your actual needs. At some point, players will have upgraded everything, unlocked all levels and have hundreds upon hundreds of materials - by then, what's the point in doing any secondary activity or combat, other than achievements / completion? No point whatsoever. Not even halfway through clearing the map, I was already done with everything, just the main quest remained, anything else was pointless or redundant.

Secondly, the grind ramps up really hard especially in the latter phases of the main quest, and also in some secondary missions that require absurd amounts of materials to complete - pure grind for the sake of grinding and dismal rewards. Given that each individual object to break takes several hits to go down, and high-tier materials can only be processed with machinery (that takes a long time) or obtained by secondary missions, it all becomes a huge waiting game or tedious exploration with nothing interesting on sight anymore, looking for that hidden tomb or crate to obtain Legendary materials. You can't even sleep to skip time more than once in a while. [i]At the 25 hour mark I started watching 'The Punisher Season 2' on my second screen with the game muted - that should tell you enough of how boring this gets.[/i]",1637821673,1637824666,False,372,9,0.795693457126617432,26,True,False,False

Dysmantle is When Dying Light (Open world, loot hoarding) Meets Red Faction ( Total Destruction ) in Boderlands ( Tons of Exp grinding) at the State of Decay ( Zombie Killing, Looting , Surviving)

Tbh, this is the very 1st game that I decided to pay RM25-ish (Normally i  would just wait for a huge sale to get a game), but man, this game? It had a fk tons of content and I am still having fun

Pros:
1) Simple gameplay style, you swing at stuffs...and break them down, then get upgrades
2) Open World, there's a lot of place to visit and Revisit , take your time
3) Deep and interesting mechanics and skill tree that allow you to... turn the table of the game ( change the pacing)
4) Interesting Lore and story behind everything
5) Klondlike style gameplay but, you had full control on your character
6) There's Crafting, but you won't need to pay Microtransaction BS to speed it up
7) You don't need freaking stamina and wait for it to recharge to do EVERYTHING IN THE GAME ( Yeah, fk Klondlike again)
8) In-game challenges reward you with Exp
9) Some high tech items are locked at progression, yeah, not behind paywall
10) Tomb to explore , puzzle to solve

Cons:
1) It's quite expensive, but i can assure you, you get your money worthwhile
2) Planting animation is...too slow ( but...it's fine)
3) The lack of Replay ability like ARPG games like Grim Dawn, but still...in order to complete the game can take some time

Pros: 
- Polished feels like a finished game (I haven't hit a single bug) 
- Wide breath of fun monsters 
- Unique Story 

Cons:
- Combat is a bit simple (I haven't unlocked everything though, this could be a plus as the game is casual which I like) 
- I was hoping for more RPG elements and there is somewhat but it is not very deep. 
- Crafting could be more enjoyable

To expand on the crafting, there are a good number of items/recipes to make but not a ton. Also, upgrades to items don't do much besides up the stats. I wish maybe the items looked different or had an extra feature added after an upgrade to make it more exciting. I haven't unlocked EVERYTHING so take this with a grain of salt.

The ""smash everything"" theme is super therapeutic!,
The sound feedback is very good for everything you hit.
The content map is quite extensive and ecourages exploration.

Minor downside is the lack of music. (Like there is only one track when you rest at the bonefire)
Easily fixable if you put some background music playing.

The game itself is rough but is very much playable, giving you a world you can explore and dismantle and a variety of enemies to combat, without the thirst or hunger aspect found in some games, there is no rush to to survive, though there is food which gives bonuses.  It is souls like in the regard that if you rest the monsters you have dealt with respawn, additionally as you dismantle or attack you can alert near by enemies causing them to attack you, and death is not the end.  Only advice I will give is this, You cannot swim and there are no invisible walls around lakes/rivers or deep holes).

Now to the bad, it's early access, there are bugs(though they seem mostly limited to pathing right now, got stuck on nothing when trying to dodge), balancing that needs to be done, but the worst would be the crashing, which has happened to twice to me first when starting up the game for the first time(may have been my fault didn't realize a massive download was going on), the second happened after I exited the tomb in the cemetery.  

All in all, while still in development, the game is fun, difficult but not unfair, and better polished than many so called AAA titles that have been released in a few years.

MINOR spoiler alert but not really. Theres going to be a time where you need ""fuel"" and it blatantly says you are missing fuel. So Before you spend hours running around trying to find this fuel, trust me you HAVE  the fuel. Click on the spot and you'll understand . DEVs change that to ""choose fuel, add fuel ect. Its very misleading. Now That Ive found that, loving the game again except the biggest con to me is the constant walls you must find your way around. Or bridges you have to fix from the other side which by that time you really never use again. Other than that there's not a huge list of fixes. I love the side missions, puzzles ect.One thing that gets super repetitive is farming. DEVs please remove the planting animation. Just drop the seed.
Fixes that really  need to be addressed
Targeting. 1 if there's an enemy around, disable targeting to non threats.
2 . For some reason the game absolutely loves to target the one non moving threat in the game and when it does that you cant fight moving threats. Then when you get it to unlock, your controls are very laggy for about 5 seconds. Im not sure why they didnt give it the twin stick feel.  The problem is, that targeting unlocks sometimes when you are backing up then you end up throwing grenades or whatever in front of you instead,wasting them or killing yourself.

Also, remove waste high brush as an obstacle. you simply cant see it until you are wondering why you are not moving.

Review 1

Even though I have barely scratched the surface of this game I can easily already write a review. First it reminds me a lot of How to survive 1. If you liked that I think you'll love this. So far the game has been absolutely amazing.  THANK you for making the game fun without being obnoxious. I'm totally over the survival games where you are always out of stamina, always tired. always dying from hunger ,always having to repair weapons ect ect. There is cooking but its perks,very fun to do as well as upgrades and so on. At first its just a bit tedious having to break so much stuff but its not long before you figure out what to use and when to use it. The ability to switch off gathering basic items is a blessing.  It looks like there's A LOT to be seen. Also there are mysteries and secrets to solve and so on.
My would like to see so far only include
Ability to lower the camera a bit more. maybe as an option.
Either a timer on unused loot or the option to turn off certain loot like shrubbery and scrap wood from even spawning when you destroy items.
possibly a way to target the strongest threat. Sometimes you are trying to fight a strong enemy but the targeting locks on to the base weak ones. Thats not a huge deal though.
Im sure I'll add as I go but you all really did a great job already. As far as I can tell I might be 5 percent or less through this . The map is HUGE , thanks for fast travel and plenty of campsites so its not another running simulator.",1637438770,1637772072,True,0,0,0.553536117076873779,0,True,False,False

It is immensely enjoyable and I have obtained [spoiler] the sledgehammer and the gas mask thus far [/spoiler] without consulting the wiki once. The progression of the game feels very organic, and suddenly you can go toe to toe with enemies that used to one shot you.

It isn't gritty survival, there isn't a hunger/thirst meter, I would call it more an adventure/rpg survival. You level up, you unlock recipes, you craft recipes, you explore, find new materials/obstacles, so on so forth. Your storage box is ""magical"" in the sense that it has unlimited inventory space and shares inventory across all storage boxes, which is a godsend. Some later areas that hold important technology are giant mazes that can become frustrating since:

One of the big game play loops is enemy respawns. Everytime you rest at a campfire, all health is restored, all item/ammo is restored and the game saves, BUT all enemies (except bosses) respawn everytime you do so. You can stop this at the fast travel towers with rare materials you earn along the way. This means until you stop spawns, you really wanna pick fights.

   Fights are swingy, you have a dodge roll I-frame, and can lock on. The game does a poor job of explaining the lock on. 
[olist]
    [*]Middle mouse locks onto the nearest enemy
    [*]Middle mousing on a specific enemy locks onto that enemy
    [*]The game auto-locks on to very close enemies
    [*]If you try and lock on and the game auto-locks, you cancel the lock on
[/olist]

   The fights might feel super easy and then you will just get smoked. You and the enemies all deal high damage, even the weakest ones can still hit for 25% hp even with armor, so the difficulty can change in a matter of moments. Specifically there is [spoiler] a bomb throwing enemy that throws a cluster of 3 bombs that spread out and blink before they blow up, HOWEVER if it throws the bombs and you are in melee range, all 3 will direct hit (explode on impact) and you will be one shotted! [/spoiler]

All in all I recommend it, it speaks deeply to my inner pack rat and I like the RPG level systems and trinket system. I like the story [i] enough [/i], and the world is absolutely massive.

With each step up in capability, either through upgrading a tool or building a new one, you can destroy larger/tougher things and get more advanced resources. The only thing that mars that a little is the few objects that you basically have to beat the game to be able to dismantle, like large rocks and some trees, at which point there really isn't much reason to do so. I wish there was another tier of equipment and more to sink my resources into at the end, but by the time you get to that point you're 2/3rds of the way into the game.

The combat, while not terribly complicated, works pretty well - each enemy fights differently and different weapons have different abilities.

The story is there, but it's meh. On the plus side, you really don't have to pay attention to any of it to still have a good time.

There's ~20 hours of gameplay there if you're not a completionist.

There are some legit criticisms I can offer, but they are overwhelmed by the value proposition of what is on offer here for less than $20.

First lets clarify what this game is. Despite appearances, this is not a survival sim with an elaborate crafting system and base building. What we have here is actually something much closer to Zelda Breath of the Wild. You don't need to sleep or eat to survive, and temperature is really the only thing you need to worry about. Your goal is to escape the zombie infested island nation you're trapped on, so you're not really concerned with setting up shop or building a base. The only building you'll do is erecting a few auto turrets and barricades for the game's few mostly optional tower defense segments. Crafting is mostly reserved for cooking and tools for your character. Cooking food for the first time gives you a permanent stat bonus, while tools and gear can be upgraded incrementally to become more useful. Overall the game has an invitingly casual feel to it that makes it a pleasantly chill experience. 

The game takes its title from the fact that the majority of objects and structures in the open world can be destroyed for crafting components. Provided you have the right tools, almost any wall or barricade can be broken through. While the world was clearly built from a limited pool of assets, the developers did an excellent job of hand crafting each location. The world is absolutely massive and teeming with hidden secrets, side activities, and points of interest. While the story is somewhat minimal, it was interesting enough to keep me curious until the end and does have a few unique wrinkles from the typical zombie apocalypse tropes.

If I had to level any criticisms, it's that the game could use a lot more crafting recipes and enemy types. The devs did such an excellent job on world design, it's a shame most of it is populated with an extremely limited pool of enemies. Combat gets the job done, but it's honestly pretty bare bones, and makes fighting the same enemies for most of the game a little tedious. While I like that there's a relatively manageable pool of crafting material types, they really needed to have more recipes to spend those materials on. While there are a lot of cool accessories you can equip, there are way too few armor and weapon types to make. About 2/3 through the game I pretty much stopped actively collecting materials, as I had crafted just about every upgrade and tool at that point. 

One neutral point to make as well is that this is a 'semi' open world. Your progress through the world is often gated by a missing tool or item the game is withholding until you reach a certain point in the plot. While the first few regions are extremely open and can be tackled in any order, about half way through the game starts funneling you where it wants you to go using barriers you won't be able to break until much later in the game. Progress past this point is usually dependent on completing puzzles and side quests, which will reward you with the key or tool you need to break through the next barrier. This gives the game a more metroidvania feel at times, and while I didn't mind, you might become a bit frustrated half way through to find your free exploration constantly hampered. 

As I said at the start, these criticisms are pretty minor when considering just how much game is on offer here at a budget price. It took me just under 50 hours to almost completely explore the world and finish the main quest, although there are many secrets and an item stockpile that I have yet to complete. Overall this is an awesome little game that is well worth the asking price.",1637704537,1637704537,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

 Whole concept is that you ""D(y)smantle"" objects that exists ingame. Grind materials; craft, upgrade so you Dysmantle and grind more. You can destroy (dismantle) nearly everything in game. Which objects you can dismantle with tools you own is determined with it's damage number and it's damage type. Slashing deals damage to cloth, leather, wood type objects and blunt damage goes for metal, rock based ones. Collected materials can be stored at chests at campsite areas. Gain xp by dismantling and storing, then unlock recipes by leveling up. 

 The first 10 hours passed as me grinding the materials and having so much fun. Then I got into quests and got bored fast. The reason for it is simple: There is soooo much backtracking. If you play it like 50 hours, 20 hours of it would be backtracking. Yes, there is fast travel but only from one link tower to another and their placements on world map sucks. 

 Required tools are gated behind location based quests which is not told in game in any way. You need to look it up on google out of boredom. Puzzles are hard and kinda bad due to character's clunky control. 

 Oh, also there are cutscenes! I think it's the most annoying thing in the game. You see a boss at the edge of your screen. You watch it's movements and plan your assault. Start to move aaand cutscene takes control of your player, he moves in front of the boss and starts the boss fight. Really, fuck that.

 Despite all that, I think the game has huge potential and can easily be a fun game. They need to tweak a lot of stuff and reduce or get rid of the backtracking. I can't recommend with it's current state though.",1637689781,1637689781,False,3,1,0.519220352172851563,0,True,False,False

The world is good and mostly well designed, but too big to enjoyably explore with the current movement options, the high/isometric camera perspective often makes navigation more of a pain than it needs to be, and the combat is awful.

The game needs some more work to be good but it's got potential. I got about 15 hours of fun out of it (which is pretty good) but the scale of the map, the bad combat and the the boring way resource 'crafting' works (you convert lower quality materials into smaller amounts of high quality materials but it takes a really long time) caused me to start rushing through the main quest and then completely stop. I stopped playing when I was about level 45, upon getting to a (presumably) late game mission where I needed to deposit a bunch of mana objects, which you get from fighting enemies and then using those materials to craft higher tiers. I really don't want to have to fight enemies and/or wait around for materials to print, so I quit.

I would give this a neutral rating if I could, and would normally give a thumbs up to something that has so many good elements but the bad parts are so prevalent that they prevented me from wanting to continue playing to get back to the fun bits. I would like to come back at some point and finish the game if the devs add alternatives to grinding enemies for mana or adds combat options like permanent summons or pets that mitigate how clunky and boring combat is. They have pet-style systems in place already with the animal friend perk so hopefully this could be added without too much hassle. It's unlikely that the camera will be unlocked to allow for a more standard third person perspective to be able to see further ahead but that would also be nice.

I also think that the axe and sledgehammer should recieve at least +1 objects for their final upgrade to make smashing though buildings more fun, the scythe was the most fun I had in the game.",1637660490,1637662510,False,1,0,0.484206736087799072,0,True,False,False

    [*]I've never played anything quite like it in all this time, and that's always refreshing.
    [*]You can play for 5 minutes or 5 hours, but it's way too easy to lose hours playing this.
    [*]After about 30 hours of play, I've revealed a very small amount of the massive map.

One caveat, it's a slow burn game, progress requires you putting in the time, yet it doesn't feel grindy in nature (to me anyway, and I play WoW!), if you're looking for instant gratification and almost constant progression, this is not the game for you.

Lots of crafting recipes & lots of regions to explore after finding a way to access them. Progression is fun, upgrading your tools allows you to destroy tougher objects which in turn lets you further upgrade your gear.

Some minor downsides would be the uninspired sidequests, the controlling (especially aiming where to hit is sometimes flawed) and the relatively small variety of enemies.

My biggest problem is that the progress you make feels unrewarding. Let me explain: you've farmed the mats and finally upgraded your weapon so that it deals 70 DMG instead of the previous 50, but you still need to hit the box that has 100HP twice just the same to destroy it. Same goes for monsters, the mob that required two hits at the 5 hour mark still requires 2 hits 20 hours in, despite several weapon changes and damage upgrades. On top of that, you fight the same 2-3 mobs almost all the time, so together it makes the upgrades feel very insignificant.

It's not a terrible game, but I'm leaning towards ""Not recommended"" because for a game that's almost entirely made up of grinding, it just doesn't feel satisfying enough.

-Finally the Gameplay loop is amazing and super addictive you will hit a Zen state where you are just Exploring ,breaking crafting ,fighting Exploring ,breaking crafting ,fighting, Exploring ,breaking crafting ,fighting then add to that the awesome tombs puzzles, the time chest and the obelisk challenges.

Conclusion: Dysmantle is a gem of game well worth the asking price it may not be the prettiest or the best sounding but it makes up for it with incredible amounts of polish and addictive game play.

Final Score: 8/10

Is it Fun? Hell yea
Is it Worth it ? $20 is well worth it anything under $20 is steal

There is a lot to see and to explore and quite a diversity in scenaries and actions. I like how the story is told and the fact that you keep on discovering things and paths with great freedom.

Be warned that it can feel like a grind and that if you don't like repetition and farming, you might not enjoy it, because you often do the same things ; mostly exploring, breaking stuff, fighting, and crafting. If you enjoy the gameplay loop, you are in for a long time. If you don't, you might feel bored or exhausted before the end. I enjoy the game and like to discover the new places and grow more potent. 

I see one thing that might make the game better : 

- A wheel to choose the tools and items (press a key, wheel opens and real time slows and then you choose with mouse or joystick what you want. That would require less clicking and menu switching and be faster)

And maybe improve the lock on enemies with the gamepad, and mostly the switching between enemies. Might be me but often I try to lock a precise enemy and the lock just goes from one enemy to an other, hardly goes to the one I want (example, three enemies, right left and behind, and I want to target behind, I hit the right joystick up but two times on three it just goes the the right and to the left. In some tense fights, it can make the game harder)

The developer is also blocking a path here and there, make player rotate and making the game longer by blocking path and making the player go around. Fast travel is also pretty lame here. It is hard to get to places.  You need an item upgrade which usually locked behind grindy quest and long walk.

At 7 hours of play time I can safely say this game is worthwhile if you like the genre described. The progression is secure with plenty of free roam while still being rewarding. 

If you're a casual player, this game isn't very punishing as long as you don't die two times in a row, and even then it's only if you had good loot on your first corpse. 

If you're a completionist, you can do some extra work to disable respawn and clear regions.

If you drop an item, it will be there when you get back which I am a big fan of. If you break a wall, that wall will remain broken. Resources are limited and will not respawn other than deer and zambies, as long as you don't halt zambie revival, lol.

There is farming but I feel it is lackluster, the first time you make a meal you gain a permanent stat bonus but afterwards HP which hasn't been necessary yet. Hopefully this will be relevant late game.

But it doesn't have the kind of itch that would make me love it in the long run.

As the title of the game say, the key feature of this game is that you can dismantle almost anything in the game.
At the start, you can't do that due to your equipment isn't strong enough.

Next is, you can gain better equipment by leveling up, and this lie the issue with the game.

Because once you unlocked a powerful enough weapon,
you can gain rarer materials even in the initial area.

If you happened to be the kind of player who want to clear everything before going forward,
you'll have access to way too powerful weapons earlier in the game.

This make the game incredibly tedious during the mid-to-late game,
as the enemies no longer pose any decent threat to you.
And you can simply destroy through walls instead of trying to find your ways across the level.

--------------------------------

But despite all of this, this is not a bad game by any mean.
You can't expect to win by simply mashing your button.
The Enemies are tough when they first appeared, but not on the level of being unfair.
There are plenty of ways to customize your character.

But if you want the game to remain fun after the mid-game,
then you should focus on clearing the story 1st,
before you became too strong for the Enemies.

Admittedly, I had to do some research and spoil a few things for myself to be sure of my decision to no longer continue playing. 

I will say that this game has the grind addiction. You know what I mean if you've played Terraria, Stardew Valley, or minecraft. The grind addiction of doing something repetitive, to gain access to a new tool or power, and continuing until you get stronger and better and faster. For me, this was fun for a while. You get a weapon, you destroy stuff, get materials, build a better weapon, destroy bigger better stuff, get better materials, make a better weapon, repeat. Where this game falls short for me is that...the weapons don't really get better. They get stronger, yes. But they don't feel better. At one point you get a sickle and are able to attack more than a couple of targets at once and cleave them. That was great...until it gets outclassed very quickly and becomes useless as a weapon.

The more you level up the more recipes you unlock and the better your journey becomes. You dismantle everything you can, and use the items you gather to upgrade the gear you have or unlock new recipes. What you can't dismantle you come back to once you unlock better tools/weapons. It's a very awesome premise, and I love the amount of content that's available. I've played about 15% of the visible map(there are dungeons and hidden puzzles as well), and that was 19 hours for me. Granted I kinda wanted to do everything, and went back to break down as much as I could, and got some time trial loot boxes that took me a couple tries. You could probably rush the story line a bit faster, but that's not how I play. This game is solid as heck, zero glitches, full idea where I'm supposed to go. The groundwork is flawless for this game and seems to be getting better the further I go.
The multiplayer is local or that weird remote play. My wife and I just play local, and it's a fricken blast together. Still zero glitches that we've run into. You share the stuff you find/upgrade/craft plus twice the killing power/dismantle power. It's such a treasure to find a game for me that's actually fun and doesn't drain me from playing multiplayer. It doesn't have online play, and that's a feature I would look into adding later as a dev or in a future release if they've been talking about Dysmantle 2 at all, haha. 
They've added the last few of the updates for launch, but plan on doing more. I can't believe how jam-packed the game is already, and fully plan on playing it throughout. If you are a fan of ARPGs or Survival games I definitely recommend grabbing this title because it's a must play!

Its basically a crafting RPG, They have a decent size skill tree and a map that seems to be big enough to keep you entertained for at least 60-80 hours of game play. I have only scratched a small surface of the map.  

Recipes, upgrades for weapons/tools, side quest, main missions, etc. You can spend your time how you want. Ive mostly been leveling up my character by killing zombies and gathering materials for upgrades.

Every time you level up you get a special abilities to choose from. They give you stats on certain things. Whether its a free +1 upgrade for your backpack space or an ability that makes you roll faster; choose wisely according to your plays style.

Graphics: I cant really say much on this because Im playing this game on my Mac Desktop. When I had it on the highest setting it looked great. But had to go down to medium so I could actually play the game LOL. (MAC cant handle the high graphic settings; I need a gaming computer again)

The game is pretty smoothed out. I have been getting crashes here and there but its a known issue with Mac users and they Devs are well aware of it. So I'm not too worried. 

Last but not least the game is fairly easy to play. The mechanics are simple. The regular enemies are not that hard to kill with proper upgrades to your main & secondary weapon. But be warned there are some harder enemies that will insta kill you in certain areas of the game. You will run into them if you like to explore. Certain places you will probably want to stay away from until you get stronger.

 Map can be overwhelming at first glance with many areas to explore and good spawn point(campfire) placements, combat is fluid and encourages good dodge mechanics or pre-planed encounters.

 The game has a good variety of enemies, boss fights are challenging and entertaining, mechanics are straight forward with good placements of hints/tutorials.
Upgrades and new items are a bit meh(mediocre), enough for a launch but personally there are too many level gaps between useful tools. This however is my opinion(I'm more of a combat oriented player) as they can be considered varied depending on each others play-style(For example: fishing, digging, farming, etc.), a different tool for a different purpose.

Their early access was a joy, and aside from the final end game content being added was almost identical to the retail release. The whole process was a joy. They did extremely well in making saved compatible in that process. The devs listen and have plans for post release as well. 

A couple tips: when it comes time that you need lumber, go for the palisades. Always focus on upgrading your weapons ASAP, that opens up more things and helps you survive. 
Also, there's a collection quest with materials that take a bit to get, best place to do that is in city.

I have been playing this game for close to a year now, followed up almost through the entire Early Access period.

First of all, the devs are great, they put out new (and significant) updates almost once a month throughout this period. They listen to the fanbase, made a bunch of changes after the players suggested them and kept polishing the game indefinitely. I reported many bugs and glitches in this last year and they were ALL fixed by the following update. So, if you see anything in the game as of 1.0.0 release, just report it and I guarantee you these devs will look into it.

The gameplay isn't difficult, you see things, you dysmantle them, you use the components to craft other things. You can fish, farm and hunt. There are also enemies, of course, which you kill (each of them more than once).

As you progress, you get stronger, you learn more about the island and yourself, and you realise that some aspects which you thought were just gameplay decisions actually give information on the lore of Dysmantle. There are little easter eggs here and there and some funny little surprises.

Now, this game can be a grind if you want to finish it 100%. At the time of this review, I have 123 hours spent in it (although some were just randomly discovering the island, before all the areas were open etc.) and I think I have around 1-2 hours of gameplay left for 100% and a couple more to complete all the hidden quests.

But the grind doesn't feel boring, because I played the story as updates came out, I had to return to places I was already done with, however if you're trying the game out now, you will collect many of the items you need as you naturally progress through the storyline and the island.

Don't want to stretch this out further, but I just wanted to say that this game was clearly made by a loving team, being very open and so communicative with their players and caring about the whole process.

Give it a shot, discover the island, raid tombs, solve some puzzles, have some fun.

Some of the game mechanics are a little infuriating, like you can't climb over even the smallest obstacle.

The zombies constantly respawning seems like a poor way of forcing you to grind XP.

November 12th, 2021
Exactly 10 months ago I reviewed Dysmantle, stating how much I absolutely loved the game in its early state. I'm writing an updated review now because the game is leaving Early Access on November 16th.

Dysmantle was a great game back when I first played it, and it still is months later. The updates didn't ruin anything at all. The updates added new weapons, clothing, features, locations, tools, and so much more. Among the updates included fixes for things I never had issues with personally. Everything I said in my original review is relevant now. The visuals, animations, gameplay, world, and everything are still beautiful and work perfectly, there's more than plenty to do given all the new updates since my original review, and progression is still rewarding.

The devs said they have plans for post-release content, both free and paid, and I am super excited to be a part of the Dysmantle community. Great job on the game, 10tons!

[h1]It's games like this that make me hate the fact that Early Access exists..[/h1]
If I were ignorant to the Early Access system and picked this up to play it, I wouldn't have had any idea whatsoever that this product was incomplete until the end of the available content. There are no bugs. The visuals, animations, gameplay, world, and everything within are beautiful and work perfectly. There's plenty to do, and the progression is rewarding and everything is open to you. You can destroy nearly anything granted your weapon is capable of dealing a certain amount of damage and the mechanics in the game are awesome and fit nicely.

I have absolutely no complaints from this title whatsoever. [i][b]It's games like this that make me hate the fact that Early Access exists[/b][/i] because it's so good I want the rest, but don't want to wait! I honestly hope that when the developer releases 1.0 that they have plans for lots of future content and not just leaving it as will-be, as I am in love with this game.

But they have alot of satisfying puzzles or mini games that tie into the main game mechanics very well. I usually don't play adventure games but this game is satisfying to explore around.

The game is a bit too easy though on the zombie killing. HP healing from eating doesn't make sense cuz you can simply use bandage - suggestion is to have a hotkey for eating anything you have in inventory and it should heal you instantly, just like the pills - maybe have a slot just for food and belt area as an inventory slot - using fanny pack increases # of food can hold. This would make farming more useful. Of course if we can heal instantly, the monsters should be much tougher. 

One big gripe I have is that ascension is not rewarding enough. You have to find and kill 100% of the monsters before ascending and with that, you barely get any great benefits - the xp is not that great - I can break down walls for much faster xp. The beads drop is still 1 only. Should be 3 or something and then 5 per monster for next ascension. if it's still one, I'd rather just go in another area and kill easy monsters. I haven't gotten to the rest of the game so not sure what beads do, but I would hope it's for increased strength or dmg, making farming for beads more rewarding. Currently there's no point in ascending. 

QOL suggestion - make picking up things not have a delay when it's dropped by killing a monster. Sometimes I like to blaze through the map and kill at the same time but the drop is delayed so I have to stop and wait to pick up. Ruins the flow of running around and hacking and slashing. 

Also, make option of reloading of turret more apparent. I didn't realize I could reload until I accidentally saw it. I was struggling alot but now that I can reload, the defense mini game is way too easy, was way too hard before.",1636149393,1636151336,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,True

Not a bad game, just not my type. Portrayed as an open world survival but other than freely being able to travel between instances, the only thing that makes it open world survival is no loading screen between the segmented levels.

The Long:

I'm a huge fan of 4x games, and was hoping this would be a crafting/survival zombie game and for the most part it is, however it is incredibly shallow. The things that made me turn around and refund were the following:

Immersion breaking quests: It's not hard to word a story to make it more immersive, in this case directly telling the gamer that this quest/action will disable zombie spawning in this area is just lame. After reading that I severely lost all hope this game was going to have any interesting story, maybe word it ""once you close this gate no more zombies can get into the area"" or something along those lines. Even then, the mechanic to disable spawn removes all threat from an area and was a turn off by itself. Don't directly refer to game mechanics like spawn timers, fog of war, and respawn, imagine if tolkien put in the lord of the rings ""and throwing the one ring into the fires of mordor would disable the orc respawn and despawn the tower of the eye, and spawn the elusive eagle at position +76 x -100 y z +24 on the mordor section of the middle earth map"". There was absolutely no speck of story telling that was captivating enough for me to want to keep playing, and for me, without open world that is a necessity. This game seems to have been written by a programmer with 0 writing skill.

Gate keeping areas: This game is not true open world, at least by my standards. Only allowing progression around the map once you complete a task isn't ""open"" it's instancing without a load screen and a step above a theme park style game. 

Tedious: Combat wasn't interesting (Swing, Dodge, Swing, Dodge, Loot, Repeat) and the amount of resources I had to collect was already making the game feel dull in a hurry before leaving the starter area. Looking at the tech tree it seemed like this wasn't going to change or get better anytime soon.

Conclusion: 
The game isn't bad, in fact I would enjoy it if I was younger and/or more easily entertained but I wouldn't recommend it to an audience of adults. It seems more gauged for kids who are more inclined to simplistic mechanics and story telling. That being said, if none of my complaints bother you, then get it, but I personally can't recommend for my preferences.",1635860268,1635860268,False,79,6,0.545498490333557129,9,True,False,True

Pros:
The weapon progression that lets you destroy things as you unlock and upgrade weapons. It lets you open up the maze of a world and move around more freely, by far the best part about the game.
The combat, it's very simple, very casual, and very easy to cheese. Just what I wanted.
The map, it's very large and has a lot to do. 

Cons:
The grinding...you need around 10,000 leaves, and most bushes give you 1 leaf and require multiple hits. After 71 hours I still need thousands of leaves to finish everything. 
There are random pit falls where the ground will collapse out under your feet, which you can't see due to all the trees or hills and other things your running around.
There are auto turrets that will target you, which was a little fun at first, but they just end up draining your ammo on the 1 rifle you get, making you have to go back and camp just for more ammo repeatedly. 
You can only have 4 tools on your tool bar at once, forcing you to spend a good amount of time going through your inventory screen changing things out. 
The lock on combat system is terrible, they need to just get rid of it as a whole, it will make you miss more than it will help.

I'll update this review as i get further and maybe find more good things or maybe some bad about the game but so far i'm loving it! :D

Update: I've played a lot more since my last review and thought I'd mention I'm still LOVING this game! It keeps getting better, enemies get stronger as you do so nothing seems impossible or too hard to handle, while some zombies still present a challenge. The map has been updated a few times unlocking new areas and the game now has more items to use for fighting and breaking stuff such as a katana and sledgehammer, not to mention the new base building mechanics and turrets that were implemented.

Looking at the timeline the devs made there is still much more to come to this game and I cannot wait. I cannot recommend this game enough!",1612884718,1635691614,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

I'm roughly 70% through the available map and story so far, and there have been no game-breaking or even minor glitches, ever. No crashes. The quests run smoothly, the combat as well, and the only thing that's ever stopped my progress at all has been my own ingenuity.

That aside,

- THE MAP IS HUGE! | Fast travel is a must, and was not neglected; it could easily take an hour to traverse the map east to west. Zones and terrain types are diverse and plentiful, and the mechanics for unlocking new zones are deceptively simple on the surface.

- PROGRESS HAPPENS ORGANICALLY | The team behind this game has done a fantastic job of building a crafting system that opens up naturally as you progress through the game. Recipes are plentiful, and discovered in a variety of ways.

- A VISUAL MOOD | The developers have by their own admission been developing their own engine for DYSMANTLE, and it's clearly been working well. The 3/4 to 100% top-down view allows for both the tension of ever-changing line-of-sight, but also a good deal more flexibility than many games taking POV cues from the Diablo franchise.

- COOKING IS LIFE | Collect, Cook, Eat, Succeed, Repeat.

- THE DOWNSIDE | The only thing that I'm left wanting more of from the game is complexity; there are relatively few mob types, with few mechanics, and by (current) level cap you should find little to no challenge among most of the enemies you'll face, including bosses. This is not surprising for a game in alpha though, and given the dedication of the folks behind the game so far, I expect big things down the line.

I love grindy games and I love games with exploration, but this is just excessive grinding and a huge bland map just for the sake of drawing the gameplay out. I spent the first few hours of my time enjoying myself as I was leveling up and getting new stuff and wanting to go back to see what new items I could break to get the next tier of materials to gather. Eventually, the wonder wore off once I was able to upgrade the bat and the axe to the max level and then there was nothing else, I read that there was a Katana and a Sledgehammer which I assumed where upgrades to the tools I had already but the Katana was worse for cutting then the axe and does do some good as a weapon, but the quest to get it (and the sledgehammer) is something the game uses too damn much to pad out the gameplay. 

It basically goes like this ""Here is this quest and the location to go to"" you go to that location ""Oh, things were moved/another clue shows that now you have to go to this second location."" then you go to that one and ""Oh, we had to move things around/Another clue shows you have to go to this third location."" then there is a chance that the third location is the final location or you might have to go to a 4th location to finish the quest. For the Katana, I had to go to this motel I hadn't been to, then go to this city I hadn't been to, then go to a Salvage yard that I haven't been to then get into the office of that salvage yard to find the specific car to find the Katana. For the Sledgehammer you have to go to the Central area, but have to go to the desert first, then the pyramid in the desert, then the jungle, and then you have to solve the jungle temple puzzle to get it. Which is stupid considering the fact that even if the point is you going from Point A to Point B, it's never that simple, you usually have to go to Point C-F just to get to Point B and it has been doing this early on with the Link Relay quest and just continues it for the rest of the game.

One of the worse aspects are the controls and the bland ass map, your character moves super slow, you have to constantly move your camera to see where you're going so you're not snagged on shrubbery or a twig on the ground, sometimes the enemies bug out and the game still considers them alive and your character stays locked on to them all the while other enemies are slashing your back because the game won't let you aim towards them. I spent about 10 hours in the game and I am sure I spent at least 5-7 hours of that backtracking or circling around an easy spot because the game wants to pad out its' own gameplay. The game doesn't even make you want to explore. It doesn't have that appeal of wanting to explore the map and find things, you go to new locations because the game tells you to do so. I am sure if I went to the Jungle biome because I wanted to I would've enjoyed the hell out of it, but I went there because I was told to go there, after I was told I had to go to the Desert Area, after I was told to go to the Central Area if I wanted the sledgehammer, There is nothing organic about the exploration and it makes you feel that you're on a guided tour going where the game tells you to go rather than explore and find things out for yourself.

While I'm sure there are some of these gripes that can be fixed once out of EA, the map, movement speed, and the forced exploration are definitely things that they seem they'll keep in and make it a pain in the ass to play.",1635545840,1635545937,False,6,0,0.49102136492729187,0,True,False,True

As someone who's not too fond of combat and mainly just likes exploration and collection this hit the mark for a combat game I would play due to its balance - for the most part I just snuck past enemies until I could adequately clear an area and destroy everything. 

Even in the one instance where I thought combat was a little too difficult for anyone playing solo who struggles, (This could be played co-op) I eventually found the right combination of inventory items to win (and I'm thankful that I was able to - this is a game that understands that some people want to play co-op but not everyone does unlike some other games that put multiplayer achievements in that solo players will just never be able to achieve).

I've found the controls really easy either with a controller or the keyboard (when my controller batteries die) and having constant easy access to controls makes it so easy when I switch between the two.

I really enjoyed the visuals and at times felt like I was actually in the game itself (I especially enjoyed the trains - and the soundtrack there is awesomely utilised too). Although the instances of animals walking through things has been interesting... and the way deer and wolves walk is just mind-bogglingly the creepiest thing in the game.

Speaking of things that aren't quite right (and sorry for the grammar rant in advance): Whilst I personally have no issue with non-native English speakers, the robotic voice of the radio with an American accent is saying sentences the way a non-native would, missing out words or using connective words in the wrong context (e.g. ""to"" instead of ""for"") and as this appears to be a military/government radio station or at least military/governmental censorship (based on some of the announcements) this is especially odd as anything written by the military/government for this purpose would be expressly scrutinised and checked only allowing for the computer's mispronunciation of words the way google does.
If this is to be replaced by a human voice later I'd expect the odd error or colloquialism (e.g. y'all) so it would be understandable to see these types of errors there but I guess we'll have to see with development and updates.

Overall there's obviously a bit of cleaning up to do but ignoring that I wouldn't believe this is still early access.

This is me just hazarding a guess as well, it could be far more deep than I am giving it credit for. It is way more than worth the full price let alone the sale price. 

It is very much an emphasis on crafting and adventuring, combat isn't too difficult but it is varied well. It has a great leveling system and some fun farming features.

I will say, I didn't like how it automatically moved you across the map from the starting area to the next part of the story, but thankfully, that's the only time that that occurs. I mean, I don't like being railroaded like that, and specifically took the time to backtrack and return to the starting area so that I could get the more authentic experience, but since it's only that one time, it was both understandable and easy to work around/through.

Yet, with all this said, it's a pretty great game!

I personally love the combat as it feel nice and smooth, you can visually see the hitboxes as both you and the enemies swing so you know how close you can get to them, and you can easily sneak around all the enemies if you walk and you also are within a specific cone behind them. I also really enjoy how the enemies and AI map around obstacles. And I really enjoy the dismantling, upgrading, crafting, and cooking mechanics as this kind of game style is right up my alley!

I also really enjoy the blend of crafting, Roguelike, and action this game has, and think it really, really nice. It's a perfect game that is fun, enjoyable, and time-absorbing too, with just enough challenge and farming and exploration for me to enjoy it immensely for hours! 

Also, my friend who isn't really a gamer loves just listening to me play as it relaxes them, meaning that the sound effects and the music in the game is very soothing and relaxing (mind, fighting enemies not included, as that's different and understandably so)

Finished upto the launchpad mission

In short ...this game OK to pass time ... nothing else. No great story, no great combat or puzzle solving - just keep whacking away till you keep making progress in the story line.


Combat mechanics only favors melee ... so, get the Katana ASAP and then go to town .Ranged is useless and the camera positioning is too weird . Moreover ammo is way too low compared to the sheer number of monsters to kill. Then there is the problem of your char auto-locking on the nearest enemy even in melee mode - is a bit of a pain ( but sometimes a bit of a boon...only sometimes). Lastly you cant ""Power attack"" when not in combat mode - which means you need to keep whacking away at environmental artefacts till they break. Would have been nice if we could Power-attack the environment too .... Also min damage requirement to dysmantle any object in the game world is a bit of a pain i felt - so you need to wait for the game to progress and get the right tool..

Crafting and base building are not really essential to complete the game. Also the crop-growing mechanics is very very very tiresome and tedious. Not to mention all you need to cook to keep health up is just plain bread and tomato soup ... means out of the 8 different varieties of plants you can group, you just use 3 of them. Everything else is a waste of time apart from the one time bonus you get. The only base building i did was to get into the shelters - so that needed turrets. (Hint: get turrets )

Movement mechanics could have better coordinated ...felt the char had a lot of interia when turning or in moving. Increase speed, tighter turn radius and turn speed should be added.

Lastly, i wish there was a good soundtrack ... game has only ambient sounds but no soundtrack. I really felt very ""alone"" without some accompanying music in background ... maybe the Devs intended this way ? But it felt a bit ""weird""..

From my perspective, the developer decided to focus on what feels fun.
Beautiful, easy to understand User Interface. 
Silky smooth inventory management that lets you focus on smashing and grabbing everything.
And I mean everything. Lots of delicious clutter and fine detail.
If you hit something with your crowbar, every object will give you a damage threshold. You KNOW eventually you'll be able to take EVERYTHING.

Dysmantle nails the hording game-play loop, and as of this Early Access Review, it feels 150% polished.
Combat is dynamic. Firm, but its not a souls-like. Ranged is a bit weird, but I feel its more a 'me problem'; 8 hours in.
There is no story, but this open world sandbox works very well without one. Again, nothing gets in the way of that addictive smashing and looting.

I recommend re-binding the camera to the right mouse button. There are a lot of tight spaces, trees, cars, etc, and I felt a noticeable confidence with both combat and noticing hidden resources when I manhandled that camera.

The way the base game is designed, I could see the developer expanding the map in every direction, forever. Let some modders get all up in there, and who knows?

This game may be in alpha at the time of this review, but the mechanics are super streamlined and I wouldn't have guessed it wasn't fully released if I didn't know. Even the development of the game was presented in a super easy to understand graphic that showed the significant progress already being made. This title deserves to be in top tier lists of zombie survival and resource-management-crafting games.

DYSMANTLE is about breaking your environment to gather resources to level up your gear to kill ex-humans. A super simple concept easy to understand, and well implemented with straightforward controls and smooth visuals. The music is super nice and pairs really well in menus, and the user interface is simple and easy to navigate. Th only possible complaint I could have is to due with the limitation of camera controls - but even the use and fluidity of the camera is effortless in game.

This game isn't necessarily horror - but the cutscenes and limited main character dialogue will cue players into understanding the difficulties they will face as the world around them is uncovered. I only jump-scared myself by falling into a crag and dying. But failure is not an overwhelming set back and I found myself jumping to get back to my grave for my materials. I personally love exploration, and I was able to take my time and gather materials and uncover the map at my own pace. The introduction area does an excellent job teaching the mechanics without being intrusive or overwhelming; thus, it is very easy to slip into whatever a player finds fun about this kind of game.

At the time of this review, I have only played 6 hours, all in one sitting. But the timing of in game days is really well paced and I don't feel rushed by any crushing time limits or deadlines. There are in-game challenges that include time limited fights for players who prefer that, but are just as easily dismissed for however long I might want.

I keep coming back to this game every 3 or more months hoping for a bit more as far as weapons.   This game is grindy - and I mean real grindy to level up.  I'm level 37 and it doesnt feel much different.  The clothing doesnt offer much protect but each one provides some distinct plus to it.   The grind imo opinion can be both the fun part and negative for this game.  While it is pleasant to endless bust stuff up for parts it does become a bit tedious.    Lumber for instance takes so much material and the process to cut it takes *FOREVER.*   There is one section where you need lumber for various bridges.  The requirements are ridiculous.   Last, and biggest complaint, blue prints for weapons are SPARSE.   I'm still using an axe and bat from the beginning which are maxed and they are worthless against mobs.   Supposedly there is a sledgehammer and a sword but I've never found these.   Weapon upgrades and options should be a bit easier to obtain or find.    I have not 'googled' locations since I truely like finding stuff on my own but this game is going to force me to google how to get other weapons or find our which quest is needed.   

This game is maybe worth about $20 in current state and be prepared for the grind.   Also, the respawn of all creatures in a zone after dying gets tedious.   There are 'links' you can fix that allow you to turn off the respawn in a zone but you need a mana ball to use it.  These are worth while but worthless if the 'LINK' is across a very tedious zone;    Some zones like the jungle and deserts are not a straight walk - the developer has designed them to wind around forever making the zone even more tedious.  And if you dye, you must go back to the last camp and fight your way back.   

At this time, I do not recommend but will revisit the game later hoping weapons or gear gets better and the grind is lessened.",1630363727,1630363727,False,11,0,0.555277049541473389,0,True,False,True

In Dysmantle you are a survivor in a lost world, owned by monsters, and you need to escape!
You will start crafting your very first tool (crowbar) and you have to start to destroy objects in order to farm resources, which is the main activity of the game. Your tools will be also useful to kill monsters, hidden in every corner of the region.
The game is very close to be out of early access, but right now it feels almost like it is a full complete game, and it has now even Steam achievements!

[Map / Level Design]
The map is HUUUGE, there are so many areas to explore, and they are very well made and different from each other. There is a path to follow, yes, but often you can decide which way you go first, since sometimes you have to obtain certain tools in order to advance in certain areas. Is it possible also to skip many of these.

[Gameplay]
As I said, the primary activity of the game consists in farming resources destroying any object you see on the map, from tvs, sofas, letterboxes, to cars and even walls!! There is a very nice progression system that guides you doing this, so while you proceed into the game, you feel the desire to make your tools more powerful in order to destroy more objects! Right now there are a few objects that cannot be destroyed yes (a 5% of the object in the entire map), but devs promised that this will change at some point of the development. 
Then there are monsters. There are many types of them, with different skills and combat techniques. Progressing into the game, you'll learn different combat styles, thanks to a very well made stealth component.
There is also farming, a nice building system, puzzles, a main story, but I don't want to talk too much about it... the game for me was beautiful because it's full of surprises! :) Just don't try to spoil it to you too much, trying to avoid forums as much as you can!
I didn't finish the game yet (the end part is still in development and will be released I believe in the next few weeks), but I promise you it can give you even close to 100 hours of gameplay... depending on how fast you will be to do the most challenging quests (there is one that really asks a LOT from you).

[Graphic Style/Art/Optimization]
I bet the game will run even on cheap laptops, as it is very well optimized and with a nice graphic style touch. It is a top down game with the possibility to slightly change the camera, rotating it in all directions. Lighting is also very well made, and it has very cool moments in the morning and during the evenings. Too bad you cannot see the sky! :)

[Audio]
At this moment, there is no music during your gameplay (only in some cutscenes), so all you will hear is the sound of your tool smashing objects, and the monsters that are impatient to kill you. To be honest? I wouldn't do anything different on this.

[Conclusion]
I think I quickly covered all the aspect of the game.
I couldn't wait to finish the game to write this review, as I wasn't expecting all this content in a game like this, that is also still in development! I'm totally addicted to it right now, I stopped to play anything else.. and it wasn't happening something like this since a lot of time. If you're worried about bugs (since it's still in early access) don't worry about it.. there are just a few minor bugs right now and game is veeeery close to be finished. It's absolutely fully playable.

The game is a STEAL even at full price, for what it offers. Clap Clap to the devs...",1629975046,1629975046,True,31,1,0.740625262260437012,0,True,False,True

Although it's the zombie apocalypse the control system is your worst enemy. Your character behaves strangely, almost as if this game was designed around a controller and not keyb/mouse, and to compound matters he attacks in the direction he is facing and not where you click. To make matters even worse he doesn't prioritise enemies when swinging his whatever, so you'll frequently go to hit a zombie and instead start disassembling a chair or table.

I'd leave this on your wishlist for now. It's not quite there yet.

Edit: I've played 3 more updates. Again, I get about 10 hours in each time and I lose interest. I just can't force myself to actually reach the latest content.

side quest is so weak... all you need to do is to kill spawned enemies and unlocking unless door...
the main quest is so direct nothing special...

i already explored 1/3 of the map and my main quest percentage goal is at 45% + already... you just need to collect 4 pcs of battery and the game is finish I assume... is so happen that they place it in every corner of the map to force you to explore the map...

The map is huge and there's a lot to explore, though it's early access and some of if isn't completed yet.

It's fun to destroy things and clear out an area.

The cons:
The character's prioritization needs work.  e.g. a humanoid creature with foot-long claws runs at me screaming and I press 'attack', my character shouldn't then turn to clear a vine off a fence.  And if I drop a stack of leaves to pick something else up, my character shouldn't assume that what I want to pick up is another stack of leaves.

Sometimes it isn't clear how to open up the next area.

Farming is extremely slow and tedious.  Planting and reaping should both be at least twice as fast.

Ideas:
There should be more fauna: at least squirrels and feral cats, but also visible birds.

So that just leaves the gameplay, which consists of retreading old ground countless numbers of times, combat is simple and boring after a short period of time, a lot of enemies can be baited into attacking you after which there's a cooldown where you go in to attack them, rinse and repeat, finding a new enemy is the only interesting thing that happens but even then it's still pretty much just the same thing constantly.

[Edit] 1 The genres tags were edited by the seller, good, but my stance remains on the trailer.


Well with just one hour I already feel like giving a first impression and clearly this game while the themes presented are correct I want to say that the trailer gives another vibe of how the game play actually is. When you look at the trailer you get this Fortnite-esque feeling of destruction and sandbox element. While there is in fact a form on sandbox element, after only 1 hour this has only transpired into destruction of decor elements to collect materials. 

It's also important to note that the game right now has a Soul-like mechanic, yes I was kind of shocked when I discovered that because in the genres shown we don't see that and it kinda play a major part in the game as an early access. The game has a concept of bonfire (Campfire) to which you can rest, craft and unlock new recipes. If you use the campfire, your character is healed and all enemies previously killed are spawned back. When you die you lose the materials you had collected.

There is also a level system, with perks to unlock and recipes to learn as you level up further, kind of like a skill branch but for schematics.

So right now overall the game looks good graphically, when I play it it is very fluid, I didn't get any performance issues, only 1 crash happened. Then I was also surprised with actually fairly well made cut scenes used as transitions between zones early on. I think artistically the Dev team nailed it and I hope they keep going that way.


My only issue here is that the trailer is a little misleading in what the game play actually is about. Right now the trailer kind of gives the typical survival zombie vibes with either large or mediocre sandbox elements for construction/sheltering, except it's nothing like that. Don't expect to build walls or safe houses in this game, it's basically a very colourful and slightly different Soul-like on a Above-top camera, semi-isometric with bosses like any proper soul-like but a soft one.

Do I recommend this game ? Yes, it has its merits of looking very different of any other soul-like, graphically nice to look at as well, easy to learn as well. But once again the trailer is misleading and I hope they fix that because I wouldn't have bought this game if I knew beforehand of the bonfire mechanic being in there. That's right I don't actually like playing soul-like games, fun to watch though. But I can at least still recognise the quality of the game even after just an hour of game time.",1608764448,1627398524,True,118,3,0.789388656616210938,0,True,False,True

The full price (~£15) is about maximum I'd pay for this game, but got it on a sale a while ago and would recommend you the same.

Don't expect fast action, hard puzzles, complex tech tree or a rich story. This isn't that kind of game, and I think why some people called it a ""mobile game"". It truly feels like some time-wasters on mobiles, but something kept me coming back. For those 20 minute breaks or just to unwind after long work hours, this game gives me the peace of mind not to have to focus on jump on my seat, and that it does well.

Pros:
* Cute graphics, nice models, reasonable movements (got much better with time)
* Lots of things to destroy, different tools to destroy with
* Varied game plays (kill, destroy, heat/cold, farming, some building, foraging)
* Huge areas, different from each other (forest, desert, tundra, cities)
* Alpha progress is consistent, feedback listened, huge kudos to the dev team

Meh:
* Monsters re-spawning is a weird mechanics, should only re-spawn what you killed before saving
* Story isn't bad, but there is no thread to follow and overall it's a flat plot at best
* Most quests are local and disconnected, hopefully will improve after beta

Cons:
* Tech tree is a bit silly, hopefully will be rearranged before beta
* Materials necessary to upgrade tools are really silly, sometimes too much, sometimes too little, sometimes just wrong
* Crafting is just nonsense: splinters build into planks, iron builds into titanium?! (alchemy?)
* Quest descriptions are usually cryptic and you end up completing it by accident while destroying things

Overall, it's a nice cathartic game for time when you want your brain to shut down, and at that, it's pretty good.",1627226393,1627226393,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Each element of the loop is poorly represented as well. Gathering essentially is a grind to hold a button against everything in the game world that your damage is higher than. There isn't any refinement or processing needed. Scrap doesn't need to be smelted into iron, you get both as drops depending on the difficulty of the item destroyed.

Upgrading essentially is a linear path with incremental upgrades that add no new elements to the existing tools. For example, upgrading your crowbar doesn't do anything else beyond making the damage number go up so you can break more things to repeat the process. Unlocking new tools hasn't added any new mechanics or dimensions beyond allowing you to range further to repeat the loop.

Combat is basic, with only a single hit spam attack and a dodge. Some items add some other minor dimensions to combat (throwables for example) but do not uplift it in any meaningful way in my opinion. Enemies generally have the same AI loop, and in my time I have not encountered any enemies or bosses yet that couldn't be defeated by simply sidestepping and hitting them repeatedly.

I can still forgive shallow gameplay if the story or quests are interesting. This in my opinion is the worst and what caused me to ultimately stop playing. Without spoiling much, the first major quest has you running to all 4 corners of the map to essentially touch a button before returning to the centre. Guess what? The next major quest is the exact same thing. You'll get to run to all 4 corners of the map AGAIN to collect something, only that those corners are now further out than before. The world is also needlessly large for the amount of things you can do.

Maybe it picks up further, but combined with the boring gameplay loop, I can do better things with my time.

This is a fun game. Probably the highest quality early access game I've ever played. The different climates on the map make it interesting, and exploring never gets boring. The puzzles are tricky enough to be interesting, but not so hard as to not be fun. Crafting is very useful - the hardest part of the game (for me) is remembering to switch out my gear to suit my current needs.

There is a lot of back and forth - even with my inventory fully upgraded and quite a few perks put towards it, I do find myself running back to the nearest camp and then back out to wherever I was dysmantling, but that's the nature of the game and not much of a detraction tbh.

The map is great, the graphics are very good, the combat took me a second to get used to but it's quite good as well. Once you've maxed out your levels and gear, the combat gets a little too easy - but at that point you're far enough along that you can stop enemies from respawning so you just don't have to deal with it. Again, that's the nature of the game and not a big deal imo, but if you like enemies to scale with you, they don't quite keep up.

Loving the non-linear feel right out of the gate (okay after stepping out of the first house) - does a great job allowing space to explore and sliding in relevant things to do (for rewards!) based on where I meander (explicitly away from where I'm being directed). Weirded out that I enjoy the inventory system as a mechanic so far, I like the clever stack+slot approach, how it feels to upgrade, and how easy it is to toss it all in a magical space that I never have to worry about organizing.

It's funny, I initially found and bought this to play with my partner (suffers from pretty rough motion sickness in most first or third-person camera view games) as a nice chill survival-y type thing to do together, so after buying when we loaded it up and saw the ""co-op"" was... local-couch kinda stubbed-in (vs. something like Starbound where while you're visiting someone elses ""universe"" you are still your own entity with your own stuff, y'know?) I was initially disappointed, yet despite that it's been charming the pants off me (don't judge, BC's getting usually hot weather lately)

So we're really just playing side-by-side in our own games cause playing together's important but so is our own individuality and sense of progression. Lookin' forward to see what gets updated as the game makes it through early access!

You start from an underground bunker and you are not alone as it is occupied by very particular forms of life, some disgusting zombies that have invaded the place. The ex-humans seem to have a mystical or supernatural origin, since certain artifacts of a very ancient civilization can be located on the island.

Aspects such as the story or the skill tree do their job, but they don't stand out for their originality

[b][i]Dysmantle[/i][/b] is a game that will benefit from community criticism as it is released in Early Acess. It is a good game, entertaining and with an original approach, but it has certain shortcomings that will very possibly improve over time.

Indie games have always been characterized as being games made with a lot of love and respect from the developers and [b][i]Dysmantle[/i][/b] is one of these games.

[b]THE GOOD[/b]
- Handcrafted open world
- Craft permanent weapons, tools, outfits, and trinkets
- Build outposts
- Cool graphic
- Zombies ;)

[b]THE BAD[/b]
- Still Early Access (not always a bad thing)

On a scale out of 10, I think in it's current state it gets a solid 5. I'm only 15 hours into the game as you can see, but I think I've played enough to get a good feel of what this game has to offer.

Graphically, the game is great. It's got a great aesthetic and with fun environments and enemy designs. Sound design I'd say is average. Nothing new, but not bad. The sounds of Zombies you can't reach early on do grate on your ears a bit, but I guess that's to be expected in Zombie genre games. Early game was very fun, and I liked the ""Dark Souls""-esque feel to the campfires and enemy respawning. But my gripes with the game started to hit me at hour 10, where breaking things down began to feel more like a chore than being fun. Exploring new areas and finding items were fun for a while, but I think after hour 10 and experiencing the limited base building and temperature effects in the game, a lot of the fun started to be replaced with tedium. Lots of running back and forth to get specific resources you need to progress from your storage, lots of experiencing the same feeling of not finding that one particular resource type you need to salvage to level up your tool, lots of one-shotting weak enemies to get to new areas only to have them respawn when you need to inventory manage in a new area. Don't get me wrong, this game has a decent amount to offer but the grind feels more grindy the longer you play, and that is what killed it for me. The other major gripe I have is how you won't know what you're working towards for most of the game. The invention tree is literally blacked out until you either A. hit a certain level or B. find something requiring a specific tool in the world, with some areas of the tree not even existing until you get to a specific point in the world. Early on you see lots of ""Upgrade damage to X"" messages while trying to break stuff down, but you can only upgrade your current weapon to say 28, or 43, etc etc. The game doesn't tell you that you'll access a new tool that will work better later, it doesn't hint at that either, and that makes me as the player much less motivated during the grind in the gameplay loop. I just overall really don't know what I am working towards most of the game.

I think this game has a lot of potential, and definitely think some expanded elements like co-op or more base building would add a twist that would liven up and decrease the grindiness of the game a lot. But in it's current state, I'm not sure I'd pay $20 for it. $10-$15 feels more apt, and this is subject to change with the game's later updates. I'll come back to this review at a later date and update it if I feel the game is in a better state, but right now I'd have to give it a no at full price.

tl;dr - Buy this at half off or more, or watch some gameplay videos of it first to know if this is something you will be into.",1623626951,1623626951,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

You have no needs that you’re attending to ,, you don’t need to eat , drink , sleep. I found myself becoming bored and things getting repetitive at only less than an hour in sadly . This seemed right up my alley too. I love the look of it , but it wasn’t what I was expecting . I figured you’d be making a tool bench and from there you’d then be making a station for armor , your weapons and so on but you only go to a campfire and can unlock recipes from there and there’s very few of any sort of weapons , armor , tools to even make . It seems as though very few of these sort of items have even been added . The crowbar isn’t very useful and combat mechanics are quite clunky . I also found myself dying every 15 mins or so when running into groups of zombies which is another huge issue I had when playing this . Dealing with 1 at a time wasn’t an issue but when you’re taking on 2,3,4 and add in the stronger zombies who shoot green gas stuff at you or the zombies who shreek at the top of their lungs attracting other zombies in the area was frustrating to say the least . Definitely way too difficult for a casual player like myself . There’s definitely a decent foundation here but it needs a good year or two to really make it the type of real survival game that I would want to play . It seems to not exactly know what it wants to be. I’m sure there’s people who will enjoy the game play , but for myself I became way too uninterested in far too short of a time .

The best way I could describe it is that it feels like a Complete Package (tm.).  Like the devs have the craft & care to look at every element of design and infuse it with a level of polish & TLC that's incredibly admirable.

It comes across in every element you look at, whether it's the bright, colorful visuals, satisfying UI navigation & design, smart progression loop, ""just right"" power-curve, the butter-smooth game engine that they built from scratch (lightning-fast startup & load times on my HDD impressed).  And much, much more.

One tiny example that explains it all.  So one of the accessibility options is a toggle to change the Shift to sprint from hold-down to just tap once to keep running.  There's no stamina meter so when you start you can sprint for as long as you want.  Cool.  But what I noticed was that when you stop by letting your finger off the WASD directional keys you still have a 2 second window to press back down on the directional keys to keep sprinting without having to hit the Shift key again.  This is perfect if you get accidentally stopped by a terrain object or you're just picking up a loot item off the ground.  

It's such a small thing but the devs were thinking of character momentum & game flow when they coded that in.  It's something I've never seen before and it really speaks to the level of fine-detail that they're operating from.

I'm over 75 hours in and have only uncovered about 25% of the map (though complete deforestation is part of my gameplay style, lol).  Content updates are on a regular & consistent 2 week cycle, give or take.

It's a lighthearted take on zombie survival games with an inviting tone yet deceptively deep game systems.  Balances arcade action & depth pretty darn well so it feels fresh but isn't ""lite"".

The crafting is simple, but separated through Metroidvania style progression, so something you can't ""dysmantle"" in the beginning, will be later on through progression, which I love because it gives you incentive to revisit explored areas. The combat is simple, but surprisingly fine. It's basically a WASD movement system with a dodge roll, charge attacks, and back stab crits for your melee weapons. Then there are thrown weapons (so far) that replenish every time you visit camp, so you don't have to worry about stockpiling 300 throwing knives or kick yourself for wasting a few from missing your target. Upgrading your thrown weapons just gives you more available until camp. The enemies can easily kill you if you are careless and run in swinging, but also easy to avoid/kill if you are patient and careful. It's something that hasn't felt unfair, you know why you died. The day/night cycle is really neat as well, even if it is (so far) only for ambiance. The crafting and dysmantling is straightforward with a pleasing minimalist aesthetic. You equip a tool, smack an object until it is destroyed, then you will auto-loot the materials as you move. Storing materials is just as easy, no fiddling with an inventory screen, no dragging and dropping, no managing countless boxes you have to craft and trying to find which box you put X material in to craft. All you do is walk up to your storage box, hit E, your items move into it, and you can craft straight from your storage. Honestly, I don't know why more games don't do this. Inventory management is quite literally one of the most micromanaged annoyances games still insist on making players deal with. Another plus is that any tool you create doesn't take up inventory space, you always have all your tools available to you and you can swap between them in a very easy to understand inventory screen. 

The sound is nothing crazy, a lot of recycled sound effects you'll hear, no amazing soundtrack, zombies sound basically the same, not bad by any means, but nothing that will stand out either. The graphics are insane either, but to me that adds to it's charm, I like the minimalist vibe it has going for it.

It's hard to believe this is early access honestly, it's remarkably well polished compared to most games I've played that were barely playable, far too buggy, or there was very little game there. I really hope in the future the weapon types are more differentiated, even if it's just animations to give them some flair, like have the baseball bat be swung like a baseball bat, have the crowbar swung overhead, the machete quick slashes, and unique animations and sounds for deconstructing different materials. I also would think a sneak function would lend itself well here, as it would help immensely with hunting, but it feels a bit funny when you can have certain gear equipped and you can sprint within a foot of an enemy and they have no idea. I really want them to have some kind of ranged combat expanded on, as for now, it's only throwing weapons (throwing knives, triple throwing knives that fan out, and grenades thus far), which aren't that satisfying to use as the aiming requires a bit too much precision. Traps would also be a welcome addition so you can just lure huge groups of zombies into them or to have an escape route if things go south. They should have a lock feature when aiming similar to ""How to Survive"" Farming is also far too easy to stockpile an insane amount of materials, and cooking is almost a throwaway here as you can't cook something and take it with you for health, it's basically permanent bonuses based on the different recipes you make, so you make it a couple times and that's it for that recipe. I'd love the cooking to just give temporary perks so you have a reason to revisit recipes. I would also love to see base building in the future, as this game would be great with it!

I really did.
but it's just so incredibly boring.
within 15 minutes, the clunky and repetitive nature of the game really starts to show.
Scratch that.
Within the minute of the game, you're introduced to text-to-speech dialog rather than actual voice acting.
I thought it was just going to be the radio, which would be fine, but then the MC also spoke with TTS, which was an atrocity in itself.
if you can't/don't have voice actors, why not just keep it text only? It baffles me.
The Camera was incredibly frustrating to deal with, as well as the Tiny inventory system, where you loot for about 2 minutes before having to immediately rush back to your storage box and drop things off.
The combat is very janky. the enemies attack without an animation at times (same with the MC), and the dodge is almost worthless.
The controls in general are awful as well. Using a controller did remedy a few of the problems with the controls (such as the camera; which on KB+M is controlled with the middle mouse!?) it was still sluggish and had no feedback which was also a huge disappointment.
The missions are boring and lackluster, and the exploration is almost non-existent (small, almost arena sized maps with a few buildings to enter)

To be honest, I'm kinda fed up with most crafting games, where you die within in-game 24 hours unless you hole yourself up somewhere. Crafting involves strict recipes that has that *one* material that is so hard to get, unless you jump through a special hoop and dig it out from under the 50th monster you've had to kill with a bow and arrow that will break after another use or so.

Wait, no, it just broke, while the monster is about 1 more hit to death. Which means you die instead. And respawn hours away.

As it stands, Dysmantle is different because it's so much more casual, but yet with that crafting tree that limits where you can go and what you can do as you find more materials, upgrade, and then find more mobs to kill and places to explore. Mechanics are a little janky at times, such as no lock-on when you run, but overall, it's nothing that makes you want to throw your mouse at the screen. Art is pleasant, and the choice to turn off copyrighted music is nice (for streams).

Though that kinda turns off ALL music. Hmm.

So yeah it's not perfect, but it's fun. It's casual. It's pleasant, not over punishing, and not a game that hardcore Souls player would pride themselves on playing. But for gamers who actually want some challenge without having to grill their body parts on the roasting CPU in sacrifice to the gods of RNG, Dysmantle occupies a little satisfying niche of its own. 

I highly recommend this for people who're sick of over complex crafting games, while enjoying a saunter through a cartoony post-apocalyptic world with a crowbar in hand. 

Especially if you don't want to worry about your hunger bar, or protein bars, or any kind of bars. No alcohol seems to be present in the game. I'm allergic anyway.",1620469854,1620469854,True,16,4,0.669922471046447754,0,True,False,True

There are lots of things to break down and if you're like me, you'll want to get as much resources as possible so you're already ready for the next couple upgrades immediately when they become available.  

The game plays a lot like The Wild Eight in terms of movement, attacking, & camera angles.  In Dysmantle, you don't really settle down anywhere though like in TWE.

[b]Graphics:[/b] 6
Not really the best visuals, but it works for what it is. I wish there was just a little bit more detail, maybe some better lighting, but it honestly won't prevent you from enjoying the game.

[b]Sound:[/b] 6
Basic sound quality, again, just average. Nothing spectacular, but nothing that feels out of place. It all kind of fits in a bland way.

[b]Gameplay:[/b] 7
Pretty fun game, but also repetitive. The talent tree is still being worked on, and although there are a few cool perks here and there, it feels pretty limited. Still no guns, so it's just a melee bashfest. Upgrades will give you a huge boost to how many items you can carry at once, but it's a grind to get to that point. First half of the game is going to be spent constantly running back and forth to deposit your materials. Zombies are either incredibly easy, or ridiculously hard. Not really a middle ground yet. I really hope to see actual base building, with maybe some zombie hordes that attack at certain times, but nothing like that yet.

[b]Performance:[/b] 10
Solid performance. No FPS drops, no stuttering, and no crashes for me yet.

[b]Final Thoughts[/b]
At it's core, it's a fun game, but nowhere near complete yet. If they don't add a fully fleshed out base building mechanic and other features, then it's going to stay a simple time killer with nothing else much to offer.

+The game kind ""forces"" on exploration (even it looks like not, but it is), it's linear, you have to follow a ""quest"" make progress, otherwise your crafting system just stuck there. 
+I just realized that they said that no base building for...now, it will be in the future, but then again, with this kinda of game mechanic, I don't think that I will ever play it anytime in future. Unless devs decide to overhaul pretty the whole game, and I doubt that.
+Typically for base building, survival game, I like to explore 1 area, 1 place, then as I progress on skills, with new recipes, new stuff, I will like to explore further bit by bit myself.

Why a negative review?

Because the developers decided they are so EFFING important to add an unskippable intro/cutscene displaying their names. And they even went the extra mile not to do that right when you start a new game, because they probably knew people would hate it, but after you went through the first part of the game. At which point I was unfortunatly already over 2 hours because I followed the ingame hint to explore the area thoroughly and was distracted by some RL matters, so I couldn't refund anymore.

Dear developers. I give a flying EFF about your names, or the names of your family/friends/fanboys who you abused as a free workforce to test your game. You didn't create a milestone in human history, you just did your jobs.

If I get involved in a car crash the hospital isn't going to show me a mandatory video either before discharge displaying all the names of the first responders (police, fire department, EMT), doctors, nurses (day/night shift) and so on.

Players: Single Player

I saw the youtube ""Call Me Kevin"" play this and thought I might try it out, I'm glad I did. While I would say this is definitely an ""Early Access"" alpha release, e.g. devs still implementing and changing core/fundamental features of the game, the map content and playing the game is fun. It does take a while to get into, since the game has both a learning curve as well as a slow beginning, making it seem like you're getting nowhere fast when you start out, you'll eventually get to a point (about 4-5 hours into the game) where you're having fun exploring new areas, learning new things, crafting new items, killing bosses and whatnot. It just takes some time to get there.  I would say currently there is 20-30 hours of content available in the game, but with zero replayability, meaning that once you're done with the current content there is no good reason or incentive to play the game again until new content is implemented. So keep that in mind. Currently base buillding mechanics in this game are limited so if you're expecting that, you'll be disappointed with the current build, but it is being implemented and has a foundation that is in place. It was worth my money. The tutorial kind of sucks though, or things weren't clearly telegraphed to the player about certain mechanics in the game that would assist players in progression.",1618552283,1618552283,True,9,0,0.578720450401306152,0,True,False,True

There are a few things that are a bit nitpick-y but I'll list them:
The emojis in the game are a bit tone-deaf and out of place. They eventually grew on me but still strange.

The voice acting of anything not involving the Crown Station is text-to-speech. I suppose as time goes on they'll get a voice actor but for now it's kinda strange.

Getting stuck on bushes is frustrating. Especially in the early stages of the game where you're running from unknown or dangerous zombies.

Using the mouse wheel to turn gets a bit tiring after a while. There is an option for an auto-follow camera but in the future it would be nice to see the ability to turn the camera with Q/E..

No, that's in smashing and destroying almost everything and then hoarding all that loot. Unfortiently as of currently, you can not destroy everything. Cars and other more durable items can't be destroyed yet(at least not to my knowledge). Hoarding and looting everything is an awesome feeling.

They're also frequently updating the game which is absolutely awesome. Having a new area to explore more or less every month, well, in this day and age that's something unique. Sure, some of the updates are a tad bit hit and miss but they always bring me back for more and trust me, I want more.",1617306493,1617306493,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,True

You run around killing zombies and smash stuff up in order to collect resources to craft/upgrade your gear so that you could smash more stuff up. Rinse and repeat. Thankfully, there are no thirst, hunger, sleep meters to worry about it. It's surprisingly a pretty relaxing game.

There are some elements that can be improved upon (combat, fishing, etc) but overall it's shaping up to be a good game.

Pro: Handles well. Beautiful. Great quality. I can feel the intent of the developers to create a great game. Its way farther along in early access than many other games seem. 

Con:
Too predictable. Get a new upgrade to the weapon = destroy big thing. Get another upgrade = destroy bigger thing. Quite boring. I don't want to know what's going to come up - that takes the whole exploration feel out of it which I otherwise love with this game. 
The tombs. What are they doing there at all? How do they fit into the world? As it is they feel quite misplaced. The rest of the world doesn't hint at fantasy (aside from the obviously fatastic existance of the undead things, but that I expect we will find some explanation of... I hope.)
Also: mana? What? The existence of such strange things in an otherwise 'realistic' world requires much explatations. How do I even know it's called mana?

What I hope will be added is more texts or other which tells us the story of those who've come before us. And perhaps they could lead us on quests where we discover some people's story or fate. More involved than just treasure maps that (spoiler) leads us to points right outside the same house. Perhaps they tell us of things we need to do to better the world or give us gear. Also why not lead us to secrets, things that were happening under the citizens' feet that they had no idea about. Perhaps we can fix a dam and unflood an area.

Pros:
The game looks great, I think that the graphics and point of view are great and that's mainly why I bought it. It is unique in the destroying stuff for mats, it's also it's downfall but it's still a pro. I also only encountered a bug with text being fuzzy, which was corrected with a restart so like nothing. overall runs great.

Cons:
The game story/premise is not good. I don't want to spoil it but the story isn't long, this doesn't have 20+ missions for the main story, it's a couple then go to the four corners of the map to retrieve an item. That's all well and good if the game is setup for building/making it your own/dynamic place, but the game is far from that. In essence the games setup like a free-roam crafting survival game without much story and gives you no building/terraforming/bases or dynamic enemies (static spawn locations that respawn when you die or sleep) it's literally just don't die, break stuff to get upgrades so you can break other stuff and so on, the only crafting is upgrading your character, that's it.

First, a lot of people describe this game as a ""soulslike"", which I think is a complete mistake. Some Dark Souls inspiration is obvious (combat that focuses on rolling for iframes, resting at campfires restoring health and consumables but also reviving enemies) BUT the comparisons really stop there.

[b]Dysmantle is actually a kind of ""growth game"", like Katamari.[/b]

The primary gameplay loop of the game is this: Use your melee weapon to break stuff. Use materials dropped  from breaking stuff to create upgrades for existing equipment or make new equipment. With said upgrades, you can now break more stuff than you could before. You also get XP from all these actions, which unlocks new options for you to create for breaking stuff or killing enemies.

And the result is a pretty decent feedback loop. You start off identifying the things you can and can't break, but as you upgrade your current tools and make new ones, you start recontextualising old objects, especially once you start getting the ability to do stuff like smash through walls, or fences. It naturally creates empowering moments when you can smash apart the fences that once served as barriers, or dismantle entire houses, and that's pretty much the exact same thrill you get out of a Katamari game.


However, this game's future success is primarily in the developer's hands. For starters, Dysmantle is naturally treading new ground- Unlike Katamari, that's constantly resetting you whenever you start new levels and is primarily about getting as much done in as little time as possible, this game has infinite time and keeps your progression constant in one large world. [b]That has a lot of potential, and it's reasonably fun for the current asking price, but it's down to the developer's future decisions to make it work for a full game.[/b] My main concerns would currently be:

[list]
[*]Unlike Katamari's pretty astonishing depth, or even something like The Munchables' gratifying simplicity, Dysmantle's meat of environmental destruction is just holding M1 for your character to autoattack. IMO this [b]needs[/b] to change. Giving each weapon some unique light/heavy attack combos could create a satisfying sensation of player participation in destroying things, and ideally create a genuine skillcurve to destroying interiors as fast as possible. (ideally, this would come with the ability to keep upgrading old weapons too instead of the baseball bat being a straight upgrade to the crowbar for example)

[*]Currently Dysmantle's additional map updates for the Island (which is about 40% done IIRC currently) aren't really doing too much for its progression system. While there will certainly be a few more weapons that will introduce the ability to destroy more things than previously, I don't think just being able to destroy concrete walls and cars is going to give that same dopamine rush as previously. I would like to see new areas include a stream of new assets (and, potentially, a progression update for the earlier areas at some point, such as including rusty fences, etc?) that help

[*]Currently the game's lategame repeatable content they're using as a buffer for Early Access' incompleteness revolves around wiping an area clean of enemies and reviving them all in harder, more rewarding states. It's cool and all, but I'd like to see ideas tried in respect to environmental destruction too, as that's this game's main selling point. To go back to the Katamari thing, I think if the player could stumble upon optional mini-areas (similar to the puzzle Tombs that already exist in the game) that temporarily bar them from using their unlocks and instead forces them to embark on a mini-progression limited to that side activity would be a great way to get back some of the thrill that's at the core of this subgenre, even in the lategame.

[*]It's clear that the developers want different ways to interact with the world than solely destroying it, but some of these things lack mechanical depth. For example, you can use a Shovel to dig the ground, but it's really not good for anything other than secret-hunting. You can also fish, but you can quite literally do this AFK. There's already a minigame hidden in one area of the world, so I really don't see why fishing, digging, etc couldn't have their own abstract minigames, that give players a quick distraction.
[/list]


If you like ""growth games"" as a subgenre, this is definitely worth keeping your eye on or potentially picking up.

I really love the art style, I love how easy it is to just pick up and play, I like how easy it is to gather resources that you need, whilst still retaining a good level of challenge.

The crafting system is easy to use, enemies telegraph their attacks well, gathering is simple, farming is simple, fishing is simple. You don't need food or water to survive, instead using food to cook recipes that you find in the world will permanently upgrade your character, a nice incentive to take advantage of farming and fishing mechanics without having to groan and roll your eyes because 2 minutes passed since you last ate, which by survival game logic means you're basically starving to death.

The combat isn't super engaging, you can dodge roll, power attack, and kite around enemies to keep on attacking whilst you move. There isn't much to punish you from swinging constantly nor is there much punishment for attacking whilst walking, but that's okay. Enemy types are different enough from one another to vary how you attack each one, and if it's a mixed group of enemies you do need to be more careful. The one gripe I do have is that attacking enemies isn't prioritised when objects are around. When you swing in a building, for example, there's a chance you'll just hit a chair rather than the enemy standing right in front of you, but I can deal with that.

I first played ""The Last Stand: Aftermath"" demo. But that game was way too bloody and gritty for me, and fortunately Dysmantle was suggested. 
So far I have spent about 10 hrs in the game. I like to take my time to discover everything in games I like, which is why I only left the tutorial area after about 6 hours. This is a big plus for me, because the game gives you the time and doesn't want to push you in a certain direction.

---- Pro ----
- I like the graphic style, simple but well done
- The gameplay is easy to understand and is also explained well ingame little by little
- different monster types, each with different attack behavior
- large map, open-world
- everything can be mined, if you have the right equipment for it
Friends of looting will love this game! 

---- Cons ---- I know it's still in development
- I would like have the ability to zoom in further 
- and zoom out a bit futher with depth in field in mind
- It would be great if I would be able to take out certain items out of my stash to have add those items to my inventory to perform certain action - no spoilers
- there is a slight cooldown between being able to peform a dodge roll and to hit an enemy or object. would be great if you guys could visualize that

Its an interesting game, and at first I wasn't too sold on it, due how basic most of things are - but the more I play, the more fun it gets.

Basically - all the resources you get, you get from destroying or killing stuff. There's no 'crafting' in a way where you craft an item, its more about 'inventing' (ie. researching) new items, which are then immediately available for you to equip and upgrade.

Majority of the game is either evolving around following the storyline, or hunting down specific ingredients you need to upgrade a piece of equipment. There's some farming and some cooking as well. Combat is a bit too rudimentary to feel satisfying, so I mostly feel as if its a hindrance. Inventory and equipping are very simple and gamey - in a good way - and neither needs organization.

As you progress, you'll unlock some new things - whether because game opens up a bit, or because you upgrade your equipment, or because you find some new type of POI you haven't encountered before, OR because you find a key for previously locked POI. Either way, you'll have plenty to do.

Graphics are amazing, simple and colorful. Its enjoyable and relaxing to watch the game, even during nighttimes. Music - I can barely even remember if there's any in the game?

So, for me - it doesn't hold up to ""Overwhelmingly positive"" rating that some other games in my list have, but for sure its a good game, and it can only get better.
Plus, I played other titles that 10Tons put out (Crimsonland, the OLD one, Neon Chrome, Jydge, Tesla vs. Lovecraft), and I loved those - so I'm pretty sure this'll be awesome by the time its out too.",1612963404,1612963404,True,1,0,0.489040136337280273,0,True,False,True

I beat on things until they break, gather the materials, when my inventory is full I return to a storage container and drop everything, then go back out and do it again.

Personally, I don't use the fire until I've mostly or totally cleared a piece of the map. I have no need to return to the area after I've cleared it, so respawning zombies aren't an issue. Also, I one-shot them with a charged attack with 16 dmg on my crowbar, so they aren't a huge pain anyways. 
By being methodical, I uncover the good stuff when I'm in an area, and move on once I've sufficiently looted it.

I loved grand theft auto 2, project zomboid , those games gave great camera draw distance, playing Dymantle was like having the ability to see 5 meters around me at all times. Was like having 90 year old eye sight(but I guess it adds to the challenge).

Pros:
- Action RPG / Survival mashup that feels fresh
- Tons of space to explore
- Interesting story writing and lore
- Runs smoothly on my fully loaded potato

Needs Improvement:
- The level of debris/furniture/plants makes sense visually with the theme the developers want, but it is fairly annoying to be in combat with and have attacks destroy objects near the enemies instead of prioritizing the enemy attacking you
- That being said, combat itself needs a rework; the game has a basic ""hack and slash"" style, but stalls with only providing ""quick"" or ""power"" melee strikes, and a few throwing items. In essence, it gets dry fairly quick, and I find myself avoiding enemies more often than not to speed things along. It would be nice to have a few melee combos to mix things up and keep it interesting.
- ""Hunting"" amounts to nothing more than chasing after deer that are quicker than you, waiting for them to make a change in direction because they bumped into a tree, making a slash at them with your trusty crowbar, and repeating the cycle.
- Token unexciting fishing mini-game
- Despite the large and widespread amount of buildings, zombies (*ahem*, I mean ""monsters""), trees and plant life, the game still feels somewhat... empty? I'm not sure how else to phrase it, but it's like all the fundamentals of world building is there, but it just needs some more polish and attention with the details. This should improve as the devs move out of early access and towards full release, but it should still be mentioned.

All in all, I think it's a worthy investment at this point in time. I anticipate a lot of improvements, and would recommend to anybody who likes the exploring, gathering and crafting aspects of Subnautica, Don't Starve, and/or Fallout 4.",1612853719,1612853719,True,38,1,0.780957460403442383,0,True,False,True

its nice easy relaxed

well at the moment i couldnt think of any its all been so much fun crash'in and smash'in

what would i like to see
i dont have a gun yet as im about level 13, i think it would be great that as soon as you do unlock shooting weapons that it unlocks a multi/single player mode that allows you to get mats and items for the single player in which you could go off together, maybe even make it into a thing on the map where they can pop up as random world events that people can join and battle against the monster nest thats appeared and they have different rankings and difficulties you could click on them and do a loading screen of you all getting in a truck to battle and fight a monster nest to destroy and take away rewards from what you find there.",1612794245,1612794245,True,2,0,0.526066362857818604,0,True,False,True

""Sure I'll try it."" And I gotta say I'm feeling a little conflicted writing this. 

If the review system allowed us to rate games with scores I'd probably give it a 6/10 for being a functional early access game with a decent amount of content. But would I actually recommend this game to myself? No. 

So the big draw of the game is that you can dismantle almost everything to attain resources. However DYSMANTLE doesn't actually do anything engaging with this feature. You are literally just hammering your crowbar on all sorts of furniture waiting for the object's health to slowly deplete until you finally get it to break and drop the desired components. 

The issue is that the game doesn't have a good fight -> loot -> rearm loop. Combat puts a huge hole in that loop, it's incredibly simplistic and for my taste too easy (After 7 hours I only died once to an enemy you should be hiding from). 
But that might just be besides the point. The actual problem is a lack of intensity stemming from the combat.
Enemies are all shown on the map so they cannot sneak up on you. And there are no stakes to surviving anyway, you get respawned at your last visited campsite, and those are quite plentyful. 

As a big fan of survival (&/open-world;crafting) games, I never got the survival vibes I was hoping for. Your character has no needs such as sleep, hunger or thirst. Health is instantly restored by resting at a campfire, which is basically like a dark souls bonfire that also respawns enemies of that area. Your healing items get restored for free as well... 

See this game doesn't really have crafting either, because what you are ""crafting"" is really more so ""unlocking"" abilities. 
Yes, you do collect 5 fibers of this and 3 salve of that to ""craft"" 2 bandages. But those same two bandages can then be infinitely replenished by resting at the campfire... at no cost. So it's really more like a healing skill with charges. 

Basically this game doesn't have an item-economy, because everything is plentyful and you only ever unlock new stuff. There is only an on-going demand for resources through upgrades. There are no resource-related decisions. You don't actually pay attention to what you are consuming. Even cooked food is an upgrade to your max health (cooking it the first time.)

You never consider your options for using healing items. ""How much medicine do I want to carry on me?"" ""Should I produce more medkits or more molotows?"" ""How much ammo will suffice for my journey?"" ""can I grab another stack of electronics even if it will slow me down in combat?"" All of these survival-questions just don't exist in DYSMANTLE.

Everything is streamlined. Everything is simplified. It works; it's simple. DYSMANTLE is the quintessence of a ""casual survival game"". But it's also incredibly dumbed down and left me asking what the hell I was even doing. And above all it honestly just reminded me and made me understand what I loved about other survival games I've played in the past. 

Like Darkwood, or Don't Strave or 7 Days to die, Kenshi, The long dark,... heck even Minecraft does survival better.

The combat is a bit clumsy in close quarters as hits sometimes won't prioritize enemies, so you'll swing your axe and chop up a table instead of the crazy monster charging at you.

I haven't met a single enemy in the game I couldn't beat using a repeated Bash + Roll combo, so if you're looking for a challenging game look elsewhere.

That said, the dismantling is fun, and if you like grindy games this will be good game for you.

The game itself plays well. I find I get spikes where the game almost locks up when a creature dies from time to time, but other than that no crashes, no frame issues, and no desktop visits. That's pretty impressive for an Early Access from a developer I've never heard of.

The graphics have a great artsy feel to them and the sounds although a little repetitive, do sound professionally done. Nothing in this game screams ""I went and got assets from a store"".

The overall feel of the game, pace, and content seems spot on with what you would always WANT from a Early Access, but never get. More often than not it's a crap shoot and you're left standing there wanting more.

For $20 this is an easy buy and you'll get at least 20 hours of play out of it. I'm at almost 10 at the time of typing this and I've only explored a quarter of the map, and have a total progress of 21%. But then again, I make a habit of clearing entire towns of ALL loot before moving on to the next.

Now the issues I have with this game are few but significant. There was talk on the store about base building and that's obviously been taken out of the game or I haven't figured out how to do it yet. As it stands, there's really no reason to have a base. I would have liked a monster attack (where they're heightened and drawn to you) at night and where night lasts half the amount of time as day. Something to get you to either run home, or board yourself up somewhere. I wouldn't want monsters to spawn, so much as what's left in the town, to try and find you.

With the right transmitter you can stop monsters from respawning, but there's really no purpose with that. In fact, you'll want the little resources they drop everytime they spawn (after visiting a camp).

The main storyline is probably the killer for me. It's boring. It's almost not even worth doing. I would much prefer to have had a lone survivor that I had to aid by bringing them supplies, who then in turn screws me over and leaves me on the island instead of me completing small simple quests, then retrieving a couple items for myself. Another character to interact with would be some change to the game and potential flare.

The underground ""puzzles"" are absolutely horrendous. They're also not even worth doing as they currently stand. It's literally run through fire or laser fire, and grab something. Almost without any thought or skill. If you die, you just respawn and try again. There's absolutely no challenge to it and the guy is like, ""Well this seems normal"".

I would love to have had the option to customize my character. Change the hair, face, sex, etc. Different clothing options would have been nice to change the overall appearance. As it stands, there's only like 6 clothing pieces to craft when there should be 60.

As I said, I clear each town out as I go and almost 10 hours into the game, I'm bored to go to the next one. There's nothing new. Nothing scary. Nothing that makes me want to go there. Nothing that draws me into the game at this point and I fear I will eventually grow tired of it. I'm already looking at the newest releases on Steam to see if there's something I want to play next.

Multiplayer (Co-op) would have been an amazing addition right off the bat. Make it so everything is twice as hard with two people. Allow people to have a shared base. Shared loot. Shared story. That would make this game significantly better but also not be forced on people who want to remain solo. If the other player jumps out, reduce the monsters to normal strength.

For me, the crafting needs a revamp. Maybe I was hoping for a different game, but I would have liked to see different weapons, and even durability forcing me to craft a new one or repair it. I'd like to learn how to make things by trial and error than by using a crafting tree. Maybe that's just me.

I REALLY hated that I started out with auto lock on, which handicapped me as a player because after 10 hours I finally figured out I can turn it off and absolutely suck now... instead of starting out almost Diablo-esque and be a skilled fighter. It's a hand hold that doesn't need to be turned on at the start.

The same goes for options like dumping your materials at camps. A few times I wanted to hold onto my stuff and took a rest only to remind myself that all my loot goes to the box. But, there's an option to turn that off. Why it isn't off by default is strange to me.

I think repetitive gameplay is going to be the killer for this game. It needs more characters to make it interesting. Maybe a few lone survivors that want to start up a little village together, or something. Maybe you find one in each sector you go through. Something. ANYTHING to become different after a handful of hours. I see most of the positive reviews for this game are less than 25 hours. That's decent, but I imagine if they spent 40+ they would get bored. Most of the negative reviews are less than 5 hours. That's simply not giving the game a chance or not what they expected (which is fine, we sometimes buy something we shouldn't have).

Needless to say you guys have a great game here but it does need some work. It needs more options and content which I know will come with the development (this is an Early Access after all)... but please don't screw this up.",1611072813,1611072813,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

I am very surprised that 95% of reviews (at the time of writing) give the game a positive review. The game is fun and challenging but also has several flaws which I expected more people would complain about.

Since most reviews cover the positive aspects, here are issues I found annoying to encounter:
- Enemies respawn [b]every time[/b] you visit your camp. You visit your camp to reload distance weapons, craft, heal, upgrade gear..) so you basically constantly have enemies respawn, especially at the start of the game which is incredible bothersome if you just cleared an area, go refill ammunition, upgrade your gear and there they are again.
- Controls are clunky, especially for ranged weapons. A short right-click should auto-aim and shoot a target but this often misses or shoots a completely different direction. Middle mouse button gives you the option to manually select/switch between targets but this often doesn't work or only keeps a single target selected even if there's another enemy close.
- I enjoy the art style overall but some images of some stuff like fruit/vegetables seem so cartoonish that they feel out of place
- The game is quite grindy to get your equipment to higher quality or to craft new gear etc.
- If you walk or fall in water you drown instantly and lose all the items in your inventory with no way to recover them. In comparison, if you die on land you can walk to your corpse and recover your stuff but of course the enemies will be back again too because you spawn at your camp.

A few things that I am really happy to see for an early access indie game:
+ 4k graphics support
+ thankfully there's an option to turn off cringy emojis but unfortunately they still appear in the tech tree (thumbs up emoji), hope that gets removed too

They already have their road map laid out and it looks very promising for a small studio. Updates with new content and bug fixes seem to be released a few times a month and they also respond to questions and issues people have in the Steam discussions for DYSMANTLE. I will surely update my review in the future as changes are made and development progresses.

There's no hunger or tiredness gauge to constantly be aware of and there's no consequence (other than inconvenience) as a result of dying.  Both are subject to change in the future, however...

Yet whilst the gameplay is relaxed to the point of being horizontal, it's also compelling and well thought out. Yes, it's grindy - of course it is, but it's an enjoyable grind which is balanced really well with a feeling of progression.  Everything seems to have a purpose: You collect materials to make better gear.  With that better gear you can harvest materials from structures you couldn't previously destroy. By harvesting materials, you gain XP and level up.  Levelling up unlocks new craftables.  New craftables  help unlock new areas and skills. New skills help you deal more damage and survive.  And so on...  

At no point did I ever feel like I was simply clicking to make a number increase.  Even in this early iteration, there seemed to be a lot to accomplish and there was a logical progression from level 1 to the level cap (24 at time of review).  The combat isn't just ""click on a monster until it's dead"" and you do need to take time to learn the attack patterns and how best to deal with different types of former humans & animals.  For a survival game, the combat is quite satisfying - it's very much hands on and you'll need to master the dodge button in order to take down the faster & stronger mobs.  Monsters will back off rather than simply running into your swinging weapon and some will behave differently depending on what range you are at.  I like it!

That said, I've stopped playing for now, as I've hit a wall - quite literally. I can't continue any further because the rest of the map is blocked off until the game is developed more.  I'm at the stage where I'm fairly powerful and I'm simply finding things to do for the sake of it, rather than for continuing the progression and discovering the back story (which isn't possible at this time). There's a lot still to be unlocked and I don't want to get burned out simply wandering around looking for every last piece of pre-release content.

I'll be very much interested to see where this goes.  There is already a load of things to see & do, but I'd like to see the existing ideas improved on, such as a day & night cycle which actually matters.  Increase the spawn rate of monsters during the night, for example, or make them stronger.  Give me a reason to travel by day (or night) and bunk down at night (or during the day).  What I'm saying is, there's plenty of scope to make an already enjoyable game really shine and I look forward to the final release.",1610391583,1610391829,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

However, one day I decided to reinstall the game and WOW, I am so addicted to it! As of right now it is only 1/3 of the world but there is so much to do, so many things to kill, etc. About 90% or more of the buildings, objects, etc in teh game can be broken down into crafting parts :) It's a perfect survival game in my opinion that doesn't force you to eat every 5-10 minutes to just stay alive. 

There is so much more this company can add to this game to increase its fun level. I, for one, would love to see this game have a random world creating with a different difficulty level with a multiplayer feature where loot gets shared, stored, etc. Give Co-Op players the ability to craft their own building or secure a town on their own, build farms, and opt into a challenge mode that would bring waves of enemies towards your camp. Of course things would need to be secured, maybe create some sort of towers to shoot enemies down automatically!

But if you want a solo survival zombie game that requires a ton of exploration, quests to complete, things to craft, leveling up, etc, this game is for you. I am only about 11 hours into it, and I probably have another 10-20 hours left of exploration and killing people. I am just getting the point of needing to craft armor to survive the temps in the freezing cold (Very cool). 

I hope 10ton does not screw up an almost perfect game in my opinion. It can only go up from here :)",1610294991,1610294991,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Pro
- Completely Open World (at the start you are stuck in a starting zone until you figure out how to get out then complete freedom)

- Multiple types of enemies: humanoids, animals, plants and what has not been discovered or developed yet.  Even have Boss types.  Some have said repetitive but they are too lazy to read and discover.  There are tricks (discoveries) to learn that allow you to fight stronger monsters in the same area where low level monsters spawn.  You can even make the monsters go away forever if you don't want them to spawn anymore.  The monsters can be fast,slow, or immobile.  Different attack types of monsters: Hand to hand, projectile, immobile spikes plants, etc.

- Sporadic non-monster dangers like falling in deep holes/crevices.

- You can loot your corps

- If you leave objects on the playing field, they will still be there later

- The world is diverse.  They have climate change effects like temperate, warm/hot zones, cold zones, overgrown cities, dense jungles, you name it or discover whatever else is there.

- Interesting discoveries: Wishing well, Towers that can be upgraded in many ways (just did an upgrade that allows for quick transport to other towers) and timed locked chest.

- Quest and achievement systems

- Building, cooking, making weapons, making armor, fishing; upgrading what you would expect that can be upgraded (e.g. weapons, armor, potions (blood) etc.

-This is only alpha build so this will be Best Last Day on Earth that people always dreamed of because there is no stamina that will hold you back and no loading zones (just open world)  There is no loading other than cut scenes.

Con:
-It is not completed yet

Lots of small things need some TLC (please use an actual human for the voiceover into ... that computer voice is awful), but the gameplay is fairly flawless already.

Like most survival games, there is a grinding element that must be dealt with, but there is plenty of other gameplay to distract you from gathering wood, plastic, etc.  The tombs are a nice touch, giving you puzzle mechanics to deal with along with the the typical jump and push tactics.  One key difference from other survival games is the lack of needing to eat, drink and sleep in order to survive.  Temperature adds an interesting, if not overly lethal, twist to the game.  Get frostbite or overheat for just a few minutes and you will find your health bar depleting very quickly.

Farming is not well aligned in the game.  Crops growing in a matter of hours that never spoil doesn't make a lot of sense.  For that matter, all organic matter stays fresh forever, so another key survival game standard that doesn't exist.  Crafting is about what you would expect, though the need to camp or find a crafting table seems a bit too simplistic.

Overall I really have enjoyed the 12+ hours I have invested into the game, and I see a ton of upside with continuous expansion and updates.  For a game in alpha, I was impressed with the level of detail and just how much of the game and the map that are available.

Add some classic survival options and improve the AI fighting to give a bit more challenge and you will have an instant classic on your hands.  Either way, this will be a fun game for those new to the survival genre and maybe a bit too easy for the tenured group.",1609898062,1609898062,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

At first it looks very mobile game like and short, well its partial of those (mobile like). I thought this game was gonna be about 10-15 hours of play time until the map opened up and was a somewhat overwhelming size. I say overwhelming because I was not expecting it to be as big as it is (giggity).

 Gameplay is as expected from the photos and video above, very laid back and relaxing with some time consuming task sprinkled in. Leveling in this game is where I find it to be a little silly in my opinion. You get XP from depositing resources, killing enemies, breaking items, doing quest and also completing goals (example: destroy 500 items, kill X amount of this). The issue I have is that the XP gain for everything besides quest and goals are so little to where youre better off rushing through looking for quest and also completing the easy goals. 

Combat is ok at best with you kiting most of the enemies to not get hit and spam rolling the faster ones. I wish there was some type of ""this enemy is weaker against range"" or something to mix it up a little. 

Resource gathering is fair to a point, you can upgrade to get more from some sources but I find early hunting to be super lame. I REALLY enjoy breaking sh*t, I mean who doesnt? So walking in a house and leveling it to the ground is very fun but when having to get hide from animals as a low level is frustrating. The animals match if not are faster than you (which ok im not dumb i understand) but as a low level you have 1-2 ranged options which takes multiple hits to kill them IF they get hit by them since the deer/doe aree weaving in and out of the trees. And if you manage to kill them theres a chance they might not drop any hide at all. I see later you go get stronger ranged but early hunting was a big turnoff for me. 

This game does get a little grindy near the middle so you have to gather lots and lots of materials as well as it kinda hit a weird point for me where I was somewhat stuck by my level. I wasnt a high enough level to make proper clothing in the areas I needed to travel too so I had to just grind to get to said level to finally make better clothing, this was one of those wow it takes for ever to level from resource gathering moments. All in all the game is cool as hell and I do like it, just at this time its a lil too grindy for me. Maybe a possible XP change would make me return to finish the story, its in alpha so Im sure some if not lots will change.

I am looking forward to playing more and exploring new locations. In the mean time I'm going to uncover the entire map and find everything that's currently available. I am excited about upgrading the link towers and getting harder mobs. The game was challenging in the beginning and I appreciated that. The first mech that I encountered, I know killed me 15 times. But unlike most games where I got upset, I knew that it was my fault and I needed to learn their mechanics. 
The game runs very nicely and the AI mostly makes sense. One thing that I do find irritating is when I'm targeting a mob and I keep hitting other objects, i.e. chairs, leaves, walls, and fences. I have almost died multiple times from finding myself in situations like that. I have since learned to roll around and get out of the situation into a more favorable environment.

First of off let me say I don't write reviews, ever.  
I've did 1 review of PUBG for the Steam Badge but other than that I just don't review games.
2nd, This is the type of game I've been wanting to play & looking for, for a while now.
I felt compelled to write this review because I have enjoyed the game so much in the 30+ hours I've played it.

As a former heavy FPS/MMO (PUBG/WoW) player that I've since ""gotten old"" & no longer play those style of games (they don't really appeal much to me as they used to either & don't play them as much), I've long been searching for a relaxing game that I can just play.  I've tried Minecraft, Foxhole, 7 Days To Die & other similar style games as well as colony sims & management games all while looking for something like Dysmantel.

The thing that appeals to me about this game is that you can go @ your own pace, you don't have to micro manage your character, you can just play the game.  Generally I tend to try & stay away from EA (Early Access) games because development stalls, it ends up being a money grab or developers aren't listening to feedback from players.  That appears not to be the case with Dysmantel.

If you are looking for a game that you can relax, play at your own pace. Like crafting, farming (harvesting materials) the ability to break things while engaging in ""voluntary"" combat then this game might be for you.

As stated before I like(d) Minecraft for it's harvesting & being able to build/create your own things, Foxhole for its combat & for the lack of a better term ""Shared Gathering/harvesting"" aspect. 7 Days To Die for its overall approach to building/farming(harvesting) & base defense aspects.

Dysmantel has the potential to be a great game in my opinion because it's got all the makings of possibly being the next Minecraft even while in EA (IF the developers continue their current trend).

My pro's & con's for the game plus some things I would like to see in the game @ a later date.

Gameplay is simple and easy to understand.  I got right into it within fifteen minutes tops, and spotted a few tricks along the way.  No inventory management to worry about, and crafting just raises your baseline stats, rather than needing to be crafted over and over (from what I've seen so far), which is a very refreshing approach that I'm really liking.
There are gentle hints every now and then to make sure you don't totally miss things, which is rather nice.
I'll be curious to see how large the game world is, albeit that I don't expect the full thing at this phase.  But I've played for a couple of hours, and I can easily see picking up again tomorrow and playing a whole lot more.

Number one is generalized confusion. The basic tools are a crowbar, and eventually a blade, basically something to hit hard things with, and something to cut things with.

You'll walk around for a bit, smacking various objects to see which ones can be damaged by which tools, which is fun in itself, but you'll notice a floating text saying ""You need 55 damage to break this."" [ or something close to that. ]

So you'll seek out resources required to upgrade your tools, and quickly notice that the wrench simply can never be upgraded beyond a certain number of damage, basically indicating a couple things to the player.

1 - Out of luck, sorry, this is an Alpha, and you can't break those things yet.
2 - Maybe there's another tool?

So, option 1 causes the player to stop playing, and wait for updates [ boring ] and option 2 would cause the player to seek out the inventions tree.

With option 2, you'd look through the tree, and swiftly conclude that no such better item exists. This is because all of the new items are hidden completely behind a level wall, or there is simply a ""N/A"" [ Not available in Alpha you'd think, but you'd be wrong. ]

N/A means one of two things, it's just not implemented, or, you must encounter something, or some quest, or some scenario to unlock it.

Neither of these are ever explained in the slightest to the player. It's a complete mystery when, or if these new tools which would allow progression exist.

I eventually outgrew my wrench and unlocked the baseball bat out of boredom, and found out that it doubles as a weapon, as well as a tool, similar to the wrench, but capable of inflicting higher damage than the wrench. Naturally, I revisited all the old haunts, broke down everything I could with it, and then hit that wall again.

Should I bother playing any more? Are all these N/A options in the inventions tree really locked/non-existent, and really, is it worth my time to blindly paw my way through what could quite literally be an impossible to proceed event in the game because they're not implemented, or does some third unknown option exist?

Well, I played for about 12 hours, got to about level 23, maxed everything out, upgraded everything, built everything I could build at my current level.. Maybe one or two things left uninvented, but here I find myself at that awkward 'generalized confusion' state which I'd reached earlier.

I understand that playing a game, and figuring it out as you go is part of the fun, that's mainly why I do suggest playing this game, but what is not fun, is the total lack of direction, the unknown goals we can't even be certain exist, or if they do, are they worth putting another 12 hours in to get while the game is in Alpha?

So, what would I suggest then? Simply put, allow a preview of the things you have yet to unlock.

You could click on something behind the level 24 player level, see the item it is, but understand that you simply do not meet the requirements to craft such an item. This would motivate the player to reach that goal instead of leaving us scratching our noggins and wondering if such a goal even exists at all.

Otherwise, combat is fun, smashing everything and gathering materials is fun, progression could use some tweaks though, upgrading tools isn't rewarding enough. Getting something from tier 1 to tier 4 maybe only reduces hits required to break something by one, and then getting a new tool which should be superior also feels underpowered.

There isn't a huge variety of monsters but there will likely be more on the way. As some of them are significantly harder to deal with, bumping into the easier ones is always a nice surprise.

[h3] The game is good, but don't be fooled by tags & screenshots [/h3]

First of all - if you expect this to be something like a top-down 7 Days To Die/Dead Linger/etc - it's not. At least at current state.
I have an awkward example, but the game reminds me an old arcade game called Tasty Planet. I'll explain.

So Dysmantle is about a survivor, who is trapped on an island and needs to escape. How? By breaking down things to obtain materials to be able to craft some better tools to break down (dismantle) some larger things and so on.
Exactly like in Tasty Planet, where you had to grab smaller things to be able to devour bigger things and win the game.
So you are able to craft some weapons, trinkets and armor. You can ""cook"" to upgrade your stats and talents permanently and level-up certain aspects of your character (bigger inventory, fast travel, dodge/critical chance, etc.) That's pretty much it when we speak of RPG aspect.

Apart from that the game feels like if Candy Crash & Walking Dead had a baby. Yes, it's an Open World survival game with crafting elements but it's really [b] REAAAALY [/b] casual.
There are all sorts of arcade elements in this game (like the sokoban puzzles in the tombs (a feature that is WIP)) or heat/cold parameter that may be surpassed by a single crafted item.

So, most of the time in the game you will be breaking things down to obtain materials to upgrade stuff to be able to progress.It's very grindy, there are no ""modificators"" (yet?) to this process like Bandit Raids, Zombie Hordes or WolfPack Attacks.

The controls are nice and responsive, though aiming with projectiles can be a real pain. Also, if an enemy is standing next to a breakable thing - autotarget will let you down. Apart of that - all good and dandy.

Oh, and you gain experience for everything - breaking things, storing things to your storage chest, killing things and gaining ""milestones/achievements"". Leveling up allows you to ""invent"" new stuff like weapons, armor, etc.
Be aware that you are firmly softlocked by your level & it can be a pain to get a new one quick.

But anyways, if you are looking for a nice relaxing [b] CASUAL [/b] game about surviving in zombie infested scenery - you most probably will like it. 
10tons is a studio that is strongly associated with really fun games that are extremely short in terms of completion (at least for me).
So if you are interested - give it a try. I, personally, will leave the game for couple of months to see more features implemented and give it another try. Cheers!",1609335346,1609335346,True,2,1,0.54356849193572998,0,True,False,True

Pros: 
-The Game is a hidden Gem and there are more updates to come so the game will be live for a while.
-Enjoyable Gameplay that offers a lot of in-depth in terms of the tools to gather, upgrade, create and so on.
-The quality of the game is really good and runs smoothly.
-The longs hours of gameplay(until you hit the WiP areas).
-The combat system feels smooth and really responsive.
-You will get to destroy EVERYTHING.
-Did i say there are more features to come?.

Cons: The  Game still a WiP, so there will be areas that are off reach and the level cap is 25 (the good thing if that if you keep playing the EXP gain will move on to the next patch so you will gain those levels, so that's a small Pro).
-Autolock can be frustating is hard fight because some times you will end up dodging INTO the enemy even when you were pushing espace backwarsd.
-Some environment in house can get between your attack and the enemy and so whatever environment  piece is in between or the day you will hit it instead of the enemy.
-Lack of ambient music for the world exploration part and for boss fights.
-The Flashlight doesn't work all the time so it blinks  A LOT so it could even make someone convulsionate. (the good thing is that you don't really need the flashlight.)

- hitting zombies with a baseball bat
- destroy everything around you (and you are a meticulous hoarder like me and need to get every single available resource)
- use those resources to research everything

Pros:
+ Very easy UI and great controller compatibility
+ You can actually take down almost everything (some stuff still in Early Access)
+ Cool story and music
+ Nice aesthetics (very nice art style)
+ Early Access getting regular (almost weekly) updates and  very fluent communication between the Dev Team and the community
+ Price tag is just on point

I bought this game for €13 bucks on the current steam sale, and honestly, I understand the overwhelmingly positive reviews. It's a pretty solid game in my opinion.

Some mobs have really made it hard on me, and dying felt bullpity to me at times, Its kinda hard to fight (Certain fast mobs) in dense forests for instance, with bushes (that are destroy-able) but kinda camouflage away a bit.

So I'ma tell you, dear reader, in advance, this game might look easy, but on the get go might certainly not be an easy experience, and may be downright frustrating.

That said, I enjoy the island, I can't believe how (Potentially) big it really is, the skill system, the crafting system, everything in it just really rubs me right, and although I haven't (as far as I know) finished it in its current setting, I can honestly tell you that I like it enough to recommend it to you, if you like these types of games.

Beyond that I'd like to give you advice to read the negative reviews, and contemplate them.

+ Hardcore survival aspects don't apply here (you don't starve, need water every 5 seconds, etc)
+ Well-thought out crafting and upgrades as you progress thru the game
+ Crafting and upgrades can be ""pinned"" to your screen so you know how many of each are needed to progress 
+ Graphics are bright and colorful, with all things easy to see
+ Great map, with accurate icons and well-labeled text
+ Goals are automatically pinned to the screen so you know what you are supposed to be doing
+ Minimal sound and music is just the right amount to add atmosphere
+ Considering how early the programmers' progress is at this point, the potential for this game is fantastic

- I don't care for how the dead enemies get respawned when you sit at a campfire (there's an in-game solution to this, but I haven't gotten it yet).  Would have preferred this to be something that could be switched off on a first playthru.
- The combat is rather clunky - all hack and slash, and your character doesn't really aim well despite having a ""lock on"" button to press (I'm sure this will be fixed in future patches)

I got it during the 2020 Winter sale and it's totally worth it.

The reason I do NOT recommend it is the instability combined with the saving system. The game only saves either on exit, or when sitting at a campfire > when you sit at a campfire all enemies in the area respawn. This dark-soulsy saving system makes me want to progress and loot as much as I can in between saving so that I can make multiple trips to tear down various parts of a house or loot location and only have to clear it once. Logical right?

WELL the game randomly kills itself upon opening any menu without warning or reason that I can find. Twice now I have lost over an hours worth of gameplay and that is just frustrating when you take into account how grindy this game can feel and how simplistic the combat is. 

It's simply too frustrating to play for me knowing it may randomly turn off every time I want to check the map or peek at my inventory. This has made it for me a game not worth playing and one I would refund if Steam would let me, which sadly they will not because of the above mentioned 8 hours. If your under the 2hr mark don't wait!

It's one of those small games that wanna seem bigger through complex looking simple linear progression.
Do not get fooled by the genre tags on store page, they are just slapped on there, the game is definitely not ""open world"" but more level based and it's only ""Survival"" through mimicry no actual survival mechanics.
Basically it's an ""Indie RPGlite Scavenger game"".

Scavenging (aka hit everything with a tool) reveals how much more you need to upgrade your tools before backtracking to get that resource, this feels very clunky and designed intentionally around backtracking and grinding for the sake of grinding.
You need anything then learn it in the skill tree but nothing has alternatives so you are force to make certain ""choices"" to be able to backtrack and open that 1 building you couldn't get into or dismantle that 1 thing that'll give you the material needed to upgrade your tool and progress.
It's a very restrictive system, that at first glance doesn't seem that bad, but later reveals itself to be there only for game time padding. Gets boring very fast.

The game has potential but it needs to embrace more meaningful choices and rely less on forced backtracking to get there. As it stands grind and backtracking is the name of the game.
This title can go either way, although my experience with these types of games and EA tells me that this is it. Shallow but cozy.",1609066883,1609067596,False,8,0,0.567036330699920654,0,True,False,True

There are areas of the game that are currently inaccessible, but the current available content is still quite satisfying. I restarted my game one point because I found that dismantling EVERY possible object made the game world feel too empty, so I started being more selective about which items I broke up for resources.

One of my favorite things is not having to deal with managing inventory which tends to be a headache in similar games. In Dysmantle, you have inventory slots at the bottom of the screen that can be upgraded to hold more as you progress. These slots fill up as you break down items for resources. Every so often, you can deposit your loot into shared stashes scattered around the map. I absolutely love not having to juggle items around between bags, containers, etc.,  and just play the game.

The only thing I wish I knew how to deal with are the ""Timed Chests"". Apart from that, recommended for a single-player z-slashing survival grind.

It's grindy in that you have a list of things to build and you need to dismantle the town around you to build it.  You need to dismantle a LOT of the town around you.  Almost none of it is that hard to find though, rubber is a little annoying.  

Deer skins are the worst I think.  Not because they're hard to find, but because they run away constantly.  And they're faster than you.  I am max level with almost every damage boost  in the game and I still can't one-shot the stupid deer.  I still have to chase them down for that second hit.  

It's incomplete as only about a third of the final map is complete.  They have hard blocks obstructing the majority of the map. Several side quests in the completed areas aren't usable.  Theres a hard level cap at 25 and the tech tree is blocked at about 80% tech.  

I think the enemies could use a bit more work honestly.  The boss monsters are mostly just reused and modified normal monsters.  If Diablo can have dozens of original monsters and STILL have original boss monsters, I think you can have a bit more variety.  I think there's about a dozen monsters in the game right now.  

My biggest criticism is probably the lack of enemy variety.  Even across different biomes, the same fodder zombie keeps showing up.  At my point in the game, I just one-shot him so he just wastes my time really.  There is like one new zombie per biome, but it's really not a lot.  And it's not that those zombies don't get introduced earlier, it's just that you have to search hard to even find them.  

When I say the mechanics make no sense, I'm basically commenting on the fact that the game is completely ignoring realism.  Like it's not even trying.  You have a blunt weapon and a sharp weapon.  Each ""dismantles"" a different item(s).  In what world does it make sense that a baseball bat can dismantle a bed?  But who cares, it's a game.  

To sumarize, it's a grindy game and the biggest real criticism is a lack of enemy variety.  Everything else is just nonsense.  

For the positives.  It's a lot of mindless fun.  It's the classic progression reward system that games like Evony used to make money off of addicting people to.  Complete a milestone, get a reward.  The enemies are challenging, but fair.  The game design is thoughtful.  Nothing made me scream ""that's RNG"".  Plenty of fun side quests.

* Managing trinkets & clothing for the 'mission'

Changelog in the game even shows a little visual road map of where they're at in their forecasted plan to release.

I was impressed with the more than fair amount of content initially offered that I binged through because I was addicted to the gameplay loop. Isometric game that loosely reminds me of State of Decay (exploring and looting) and a Fortnite PvE (yes there is a PvE Fortnite and I liked it...) vibe in the smashing of your environment aspect.

The gameplay loop is a little grindy, but I haven't minded as the exploration and unlocks keep things fresh. Despite being someone who is anxious about potential enemy fights and gets easily jumpy at unexpected enemy encounters, I find the grind oddly relaxing in a way that reminds me of Diablo 3 rifting, but not so monotonous to me. I've also been pleasantly surprised by the different mechanics that are added on, such as farming and cooking for permanent upgrades. I LOVE the permanent upgrades/features .Limited-use secondary items get refreshed at campfire/safehouse areas which is very welcomed in a post-Breath of the Wild weapon breaking/Animal Crossing tool breaking world haha. Single-use items tend to make me hesitant to use them so I welcome not having to wonder on first play-through whether something should be used sparingly or not.


The AI can be pretty dumb and wonky at times, but the fodder zombies shouldn't be crazy anyway. Lots of ways the dev could potentially fix that. I only experienced one game-crashing bug that happened twice in a particularly longer and trying segment, but managed to avoid it by going a different way the third time.

Things I LOVE:
- The open world feeling so I can do WHAT I want WHEN I want
- The combat is simple for anyone to understand
- The upgrades always give me something to work towards
- The creatures concepts are really cool, I can't wait to see more
- The puzzle rooms are challenging and give the best reward, funny blue orb
- The replayability is huge, especially with the perks you can get when you level up

Only a few things I hope they add/fix:
- Difficulties (less health, maybe needing to eat food)
- More campfires in the bottom right of the map
- More Ex-Human variations (even though I do love that they all rock the same pink shirt)
- Make the wishing wells more expensive
- Make the triple-knifes do a bit more damage but spread in a wider cone
- Add voice acting eventually to give the character more personality
- Remove the emojis
- Make the challenge gauntlets a bit more challenging (quests where you fight some mobs for exp)
- Nerf farming (gives sooo much food)

There is heavy use of dodge mechanic in the game which I'm not that keen on normally - but it's ok here at least with the 5 or so types of monsters I have come across.
Dying doesn't matter much.  You don't lose any fight ability, just some materials you had collected.
You can destroy almost everything, although most things require a certain strength of crowbar to smash, so you go back later to places you have been to find you can now smash some beds / sinks etc. that you couldn't destroy before.
Very easy to dip in and out.  No excessive gore, so it was fine for my kids to watch me play.

A bit low on content for the price (for now), but what's there is some of the most fun I've had in a game in quite some time, and I'm very much looking forward to seeing where things go. The devs are also hard at work on adding more stuff, with a few updates since launch already, and more coming soon.

I rarely buy games at launch, but between what I saw in youtube videos and my experience with some of their past work (I had quite a bit of fun with Neon Chrome, Jydge, and Undead Horde), that was enough for me to take a chance on this, and I'm glad I did.

As for gameplay, I'll let the tags and various youtube videos do their work.

Chopping, wrecking, smashing, defacing, hunting innocent animals, destroying everything in your path and the occasional challenging boss this is the game for you.  Zelda taught you smashing pots was fun.  Now you as you grow more powerful in Dysmantle you can smash everything for fun!

Ranged weapons have very limited ammunition and as of 0.6.2 version there are no fireams available. This is not a game where you hunt zombies with a shotgun.

You start the game as a man who just ascend from a one man fallout shelter and starts exploring the surrounding area. Currently there is just one player model with no customization options. You seems to be the only one alive in a huge island filled with dangers with your main object to simple get out of there.

The key element of the game is replenishment of player's health and all normal enemies on the map after resting at bonfires. Just like in souls games. This feature fits perfectly in the game and encourages being even more careful with the enemies. Basic zombie creatures that you encounter first can kill you in 2 hits so you have to respect your enemies and not just going forward pushing the hit button.  You naturally get tougher with level ups and better gear.

The crafting part of the game lets you build the usual clothes, weapons, food etc stuff and upgrade them. You only eat food for permanent bonuses, you will not starve in the game. You need to protect yourself against cold/hot environment on some parts of the map. If you upgrade your gear good enough, you can destroy almost every single object in the game (fully available on 1.0 as far as I know). There is no base building elements in the game.

The explorable area is huge and new materials/enemies/recipes keeps coming up all the time in the first hours in the game. Dystmantle opens it secret in a good pace although the story is almost non-existent, just few hints here and there what has happened in the island. Bonfires aka save/health replenishment points are frequently found on the map and would prefer them to be like 1/3 of the current amount. That would give better feeling of danger and surviving in the game. 

Dystmantle is a very ambitious project that works great even in it's current early access release. Tons of things to do and explore even now. Encountered no bugs this far although just few hours in the game myself. Game is set to be release on consoles as well so I'm confident Dysmantle is not going to be one of those games to be left on early access state forever and abandoned. First impression is  positive on this one. Took me around 15 hours to finish the content available in version 0.6.2.

My estimated review score before playing: 7/10
My final review score: 8/10
Buy/Pass?: Buy. It's been incredibly fun thus far and it's hella addicting. It's also pretty relaxing.
I'm posting this review after hitting level 22. The ""as of now"" level cap. 
There is still tons more to do. Thankfully the games doesn't stop just because the leveling does.

Pros:
+The map is HUGE!!
+There's no durability on any of the tools. They don't break!
+You do run out of thrown knives/grenades
+If you want more all you do is return to a campfire and rest.
+You will probably laugh at the zombies chasing deer.
+It's especially funny when they all fall into the river & drown.
+/- With that being said, you can also die by slipping into the water.
+Staying alive isn't too hard.
+If you do die return to your corpse & pick up all your loot you were carrying.
+The sounds of the owls & whip-poor-wills at nite sound so amazing, immersive, & real.
+I personally like the emojis that pop up. They add a bit of humor, imo.
+Still, if you don't like them they can be turned off.
+I played for 31 hours. Within that time I didn't have a single CTD.

Cons:
-I'm no PC expert, but I can tell when my game is lagging.
-For some reason my game starts stalling & I have to turn it off & on to fix it.

Warnings:
!There are pills you can take to have your character kill himself
!Please like/love, respect & take care of yourself if this triggers you and do NOT play this.

There are no achievements, yet. The developer, named 10tons, has said ""Steam achievements will most likely be added near Full Release.""

Final notes:
This is a different take on post-apocalypse. Think ""Enslaved: Odyssey to the West"", not ""Fallout"", ""Mad Max"", or ""I Am Legend"". Plus, all the undead have become infected with Tiberium some how. It truly is an awesome & sad sight to see. You should check this game out if you're looking for a fun game to get into that can also cause you to relax after a stressful day.

It does get a little monotonous, going through and trying to break everything in the game to get just a little more xp but the desire to get one more level, unlock one more weapon or trinket did keep me going.  I really like how cooking dishes gives you a permanent boost and I especially like how you are able to stop the respawn.  There's clearly a lot of work still to go with this game and i look forward to coming back in a few months to see the updates.  You can only unlock about 1/3 of the map and I'm bummed the current weapon cap is not sufficient enough to break down cars/buildings but the dev(s) are responsive and keep throwing out updates so I'm sure that'll happen eventually.

A nice simple play style where you can break down pretty much anything if you've got the right tool.

It's very polished for an early access title. Smooth controls and graphics, very addicting gameplay loop, easy to get into. I just love the fact, that all the chores of normal survival games have been left out. Your gear does not break, you don't need to eat, drink, or sleep to survive, but all of those activities award you with (permanent) stat boosts.

The game let's you focus on exploring, gathering, crafting, and of course dismantling everything with your crowbar. You can literally tear down a whole village, if you feel like it. Combat is alright, but could be improved with more variation and weapons. Enemy behaviour is ok, but very predictable.

I've not met any (friendly) NPCs so far and the game starts to feel rather lonely. You do find written notes or radio transmission to learn more about the world. I would love to see other survivors or random encounters. It would also be great, if you could interact with items like computers or bookshelves. I am sure this is something that will be improved over time. There is a short in-game cutscene after you finish the first location, which shows what 10tons and their game engine is capable of in terms of storytelling. I'd love to see more of that!

If you want to read it on my website you can check it out here: https://www.gamesordie.com/dysmantle-review

Or if you can't be bothered clicking on either of those, you can read my review below:

What is it?
Dysmantle is a survival game incorporating the usual tropes that come with survival games. The title prides itself on the ability for the player to do almost anything. You can craft, gather, kill enemies, search the map, fish, cook and destroy 99% of the environment provided you have the right tools, but none of these are fun. The combat is stale and monotonous, and you never really feel like you are progressing naturally due to a frustrating leveling system. 

Story:
The story in Dysmantle is a standard affair; the world has ended, your character has come out from a vault and found the world deserted except for a variety of different monsters now prowling the streets. It's now your task to escape this island; however, you can. 

There isn't anything original or new here in terms of story. It feels more like an afterthought rather than the main focus, but that is to be expected in a survival game. In most survival games, the main focus is to survive; however, a well thought out basic storyline is always a positive, think games like Subnautica. At the moment, Dysmantle doesn't have this, and it shows. 

There is a massive map to search in the game; however, none of it feels unique, assets seem to be copied and pasted to the point where you can't tell the difference between one side of the map and the other. The massive map feels like it is large for being large sake instead of having distinct differences that keep the game fresh.

Sound, Graphics, Bugs:
Dysmantle is in early access, and yet the game ran very well. I was continually getting a steady sixty frames per second on the highest graphic settings, and I didn't come across any bugs or crashes. Graphically the game isn't going to blow your mind, but they are good enough to look at without being a noticeable hindrance. 

There is a distinct lack of ambient music in the game. When you are venturing around the map there isn't any music, there isn't any music when you are fighting monsters, there isn't any music at all, and it is very noticeable. A cinematic score with peaceful tones when fishing or farming mixed with more dark tones when fighting is desperately needed as it will add so much to the enjoyment of the environment.

Gameplay:
The gameplay in Dysmantle is where the game falls very flat. The combat in the game is a click to attack, space bar to dodge, right click to range attack system. There is nothing wrong with the combat system; the problem is with the feel of it. Melee attacks don't feel punchy, they feel soft and weak, and it is all too easy to kite enemy monsters by running away, dodging, attacking, running away, dodging attacking and then rinse and repeat. The combat just isn't fun, and for a game populated with so many monsters, this is a crucial area that needs to be well fleshed out because after only a short while I was avoiding all fighting to get to my objective because the combat was so monotonous. 

There is a relatively large amount of variety in the monsters; however the AI isn't brilliant, meaning the rinse and repeat combat is all that was needed to defeat most of the enemies. You also don't need to ""survive"" in this game, there isn't a hunger or thirst meter like most survival games, the way to survive in Dysmantle is to upgrade your gear and get stronger. This means you can run around endlessly without any prior planning and you never get any sense of worry, if you get into a tight bind you can just run away, and that lack of panic, or needing to plan makes the game boring.

There is also a Dark Souls type element in Dysmantle. To heal, you need to rest at campfires, which you can find throughout the map; this is also where you can upgrade and craft items. When you use a campfire all of the monsters, you have killed respawn. This is a horrible system for Dysmantle. The combat is not good enough or enjoyable enough to warrant this, and the map is populated with so many monsters that it just becomes a major nuisance having to kill thirty zombies again. However, to their credit 10tons have thought of almost everything. You can build technology that stops this from happening, and there is a fast travel system that you can use when you progress in the game; however, the first few hours are a real drag until you unlock these technologies.

Survival games are reliant on their progression systems. It is imperative that the player feels a strong sense of progression for them to persist and continue playing. The progression system in Dysmantle is flawed. Dysmantle's progression system is experience-based. You can get experience from killing enemies, gathering materials and finishing quests. There is nothing inherently wrong with this sort of system, however, where it falls is in the level locks. By level locks, I mean that some items cannot be crafted until the character reaches a certain level. Time and time again, I would come across something; however, I couldn't do it because I wasn't the right level to craft the item I needed even though I had all the right resources. A prime example of this was when I found a hole in the ground that looked at least a little more interesting than the bland level around me, but I couldn't build a rope to go down it until I was two levels higher. This creates a very static and stunted feeling of progression in the game because it demands that the player mindlessly gather resources or kill enemies to progress to something more interesting, and that's not fun. To add to this, a lot of quests were halted by level locks; to get through the door, I needed a key but to get the key, I needed a shovel but to build a shovel I needed to be a higher level. It just doesn't add to the aesthetic of the game, and it is more a frustrating burden than a fun sense of completion. 

You can do a lot in this game, but none of it feels worthwhile, fishing and cooking add buffs to your characters health, but it all seems a bit pointless. I can understand needing to fish if you were starving but not to get buff so that you can kill a tougher beast. It doesn't add to the games aesthetic in a meaningful way and is very repetitive. 

Multiplayer:
Dysmantle doesn't have a multiplayer component.
 
Verdict:
Dysmantle isn't fun; every element feels like a chore more than an exciting survival mechanic. The combat is bland, and the progression based on levelling up is a massive burden resulting in a stunted sense of progression and a lack of wanting to continue to play.",1605670054,1605670054,False,4,1,0.401863425970077515,0,True,False,True

You start with a crowbar, go collect these 10 items to upgrade your crowbar, now there's 5 more things you can destroy, go collect these 40 items for your next crowbar level, trick is one of the items you need most of the things that have it you can't break without upgrading your crowbar, so you have to search everywhere for the like 2 breakable items that can give you iron ingots so that you can upgrade your crowbar and get iron ingots easily...

In my 2 hours in game there was only 1 boss, and 4 enemies I seen but 2 of which were locked behind doors, so while I seen them towards the end of my 2 hours, I only got to fight 2 basic enemies. Combat is EXTREMELY basic and cheap. If you encounter 1 enemy the fight is super easy, but 2 enemies and you're looking at death, unless you know how the system works in which case you can easily beat basically infinite enemies(not technically, but basically) Basically the AI will run at you at the same speed as you can walk backwards and they have to stop to attack, you can walk backwards and just freely whack them. I was playing ring around the rosie with like 10ish enemies I aggroed and I took them out with ease doing this, but if you take the combat system seriously 2 enemies is nearly auto death.

Buttons have tutorials. Who here think buttons need tutorials? Well this game does because they even messed up something as simple as a button. If you press a button nothing happens. You have to press and hold the button for several seconds wasting your time in order to use what ever it is.

Grind on grind. If you have everything to upgrade your item? you have to camp at the fire, and reset all enemies. You leveled up? well you don't get your level until you go back to camp at the fire and reset all enemies. everything past the first upgrade is an insane grind of materials to get. 

In the end I really wanted to love this game, but the game wouldn't love me. If you would like to see my playthrough and experience check it out here.

Dysmantled bring you into a post-apocalyptic island. You're out of food in your bunker, and you must survive above ground. There are a variety of beasts both aggressive to you and fearful of you. You must move from one camp to another, gathering supplies by smashing the life out of everything that stands in your way. Upgrade your tools to do more damage and smash more things, or build trinkets to help in different ways. 

What makes this different than any other survival game?
- There is no thirst or hunger in this survival game.
- You can break down almost anything for materials. 
- There is a main objective and side quests. 
- The level system and unlocking of items is unique. 
- Multiple biomes!
- Dislike the zombies respawning? [spoiler] Build a transmitter on the tower of the area to stop them from respawning after the next time you kill them! [/spoiler]

What I disliked:
- There currently is a level cap, and once you hit that, you cannot level up anymore. They do keep track of the exp points however, so when a new update comes out, the points will count towards the new available levels.
- Minor bugs/glitching in the tombs, but was able to deal with it. This game has the least amount of bugs I've ever seen in an early access.
- There isn't more of the game available yet.

After installing it I had a few minutes to play (few as in 10). Loaded the game up and started in on the tutorial. 3.5 hours later and a previous obligation skipped because I was stuck killing and crafting my way through the map.

In all seriousness though this game is awesome. I am super excited to see where they take things. It has just the right amount of luring you into doing just a little bit more with a decent amount of incentive to actually complete the quest or challenge. You can upgrade your damage, craft new gear, find recipes for cooking, fish, farm, destroy countless objects, or just explore. You get experience for doing all of these activities and can use the experience to unlock new items, trinkets, gear, etc. 

For an Early Access title it already shows a lot of potential and has enough to keep you busy for quite some time in between updates. I have not run into any bugs as of yet but i've only put 3.5 hours into it so only time will tell. I would also love to see multiplayer but as long as new content and updates keep coming i'll be happy just to dive back in and do more even solo.

TLDR

If you are a fan of survival/crafting games you can't go wrong with this one especially for the price tag. It's worth your time to give it a try. There is enough to do in its current state that it will keep you happy for quite some time, and the dev's appear to be passionate about this project so i'm sure great things are yet to come to the game.

For an early access game, I'm surprised, as I haven't hit one bug yet. 

The mechanics are fairly easy to understand and I've died a few times, but it isn't too hard to work out why I died and to avoid it next time. I haven't been able to work out how I'm supposed to get the timed chests on the cliffs but have managed to easily get three now on the ground level. The two tombs I've done were interesting too! 

The story line is minimal, but what there is of it I'm looking forward to seeing what happens! 

My biggest thing is that I would like the ability to create my character, even if there are very minimal options.

This game is still in very Early Access, however, there were no noticeable bugs, glitches or game breaking mechanics.  What gameplay is present is relatively complete, and we get a fair sense for the direction the developers wish to go forward.

And that is where we discover the problem.  This game is very much like the late 90s/early 2000s.  It is an isometric view, and has a linear path progression.  There is a significant damage/kill/destroy grinding mechanic necessary to unlock additional weapons/tools, etc.

As the game currently stands, and based on the intended direction of the developers, I don't see much success for this title.  
It lacks engaging gameplay, it lacks anything unique.  It is a rehash of older style games, albeit with better graphics and sound.  It will remind you of Project Zomboid, although PZ had a much more robust gameplay, crafting, survival mechanics system, as well as full mod support....Dysmantle has none of those points in its' favor.

Perhaps future development will make this a much better game, but again, I don't foresee a strong future for this game.

The advancement process seems well balanced, the available clothing/trinket/weapon upgrades are meaningful and fun, and most are available on the fly, making progress well paced.  The map is big, much bigger than you expect, and while the tile set gets a little repetitive, there are three weather zones that force you to make clothing and trinket choices that limit some of your better upgrades, so some thought is required.

I love the mechanic where resting at a camp site, which are scattered throughout the map, will restore all your health, but it also respawns all the monsters!  Quicktravel is available, but there are some criteria you have to meet to open it, and other expected tropes are there, but they are implemented with craft and thought.

There are many locations and settings scattered across the map that are not active, but the framework for what could be some wonderful and exciting additions.  It has the bones of something good!

Well worth the current sub-$20 price!

9/10


My only current complaints are items that I assume will most likely be changed in future upgrades; the minimap at the bottom of the screen (which appears later) has no compass rose points (N,S,E,W) making navigation on the fly a little rough,  names of materials do not appear when you hover over the items in your item bar; spawn locations after death can be sometimes confusing, sometimes you appear at the last camp you visited, sometimes at the last camp you rested at.

I'm generally not a fan of the ""dark souls"" type games where, when you rest, it re-spawns the mobs but I got used to it and the game is a lot of fun.

Only a few things:

1. I wish there was a way to either destroy objects in inventory or else specify that you don't want to pick up that item at all. Right now, you gather up all the leaves and, when you drop them so that you can pick up something else, there is a good chance of touching the damn leaf again as you're backing away, picking it back up and putting it into the slot that you want to use for somethign else! Kind of annoying but easily worked around.

2. Food seems largely useless after you eat it the first time to get the effect. Once you get the buff, i've not found a reason to cook the same recipe again, as it just provides healing (for which i used my bandages). 

3. Farming is likewise kind of useless (as far as i can tell, feel free to correct me!). The only reason to grow the plants is for cooking and see above.

More weapons and things would be great but that might come later on.

other than that, this game operates amazingly. It loads super quick and i haven't had a crash or bug since I started playing (on release day).

It's not an action game (the ""combat"" is bare bones and best avoided). It's not a building simulator (you craft and upgrade equipment but you don't make buildings or vehicles). It's not a town/civilization game (you're alone; so alone...).

Dysmantle is all about gathering and crafting, distilled and refined to be fast and smooth. And that is basically the draw of the game. It tickles a part of my monkey brain to gather a bunch of materials, run back to a campfire, and make some new fun gizmo or upgrade my crowbar or backpack to make life easier. It's fun to cook a new recipe, make a new hat, or get good enough gear that you break even better stuff and get better materials. It's a satisfying loop: gather, craft, gather, upgrade, gather, get a little stronger, gather, go to new area.

You had better enjoy the type of thing I just described, because that's it. There's an incredibly flimsy story about a zombie apocalypse (told in bits and pieces by embarrassing text-to-speech narrations and radio messages), and occasionally you stumble on very simple quests (destroy these zombies in 60 seconds! find the key buried in the graveyard!). But these aspects are afterthoughts; the point is the crafting loop.

Even so, because this is an open world game, and because it's still in Early Access, the potential is there to add a whole hell of a lot more. Companions? Narrative quests? Actual character customization? A story that's meaningful? Deer that aren't harder to kill than the super zombies? Water that isn't instant death for no reason?

Long version:
This is very hard to decide. The game is very fun and looks good. Despite it is just pure repetitive grind, it is still very fun. Game mechanics fit well together.

The problem is I feel kind of cheated. This game is about destruction a dismantling everything around. 

The first line on feature list says: ""Break over 99% of all objects for materials with the right tools. No barrier will stop you."" Yeah, maybe in the future. Right tools you say? In fact, with currently available tools, you can destroy hardly around 30%. 

Then your eyes hit that picture described ""Craft an gear up"" with three characters and you think: ""Wow, a sledgehammer, that will be fun!"" - NO. It will not. The hammer is not yet in game. ""Ok, well, the fire axe looks great too!"" - NO. It is not in the game as well. ""And what about that rifle?"" - Sorry, the rifle isn't in the game either.

I know this is EA, alpha... But when it lacks key features presented on store page, it is bad. Its bit like a false advertisement. One third of gear techtree is locked. But in tools branch, whole half is locked and two thirds of outfits branch is locked too. So most of things you are looking forward to unlock cannot be unlocked yet. Its is very fun, but very short. After few hours you hit hard level cap and cannot unlock anything more. You can spend another hour or two to farm materials to craft everything available, even if you dont need that particular stuff, like trinkets or so. Then you can still roam the world, slash enemies, collect materials... but why, when there is nothing more to spend it for?

Considering all said above, comparing what you read a see on store page and what you really get, I must say No. Just not yet.

I believe this game will be great, but it needs more time to get more content. If you dont mind the price, buy it, you will surely enjoy it alot for few hours. If you are looking for complete experience for your money (and like the hammer and axe as I do), wait and let the devs work.",1605089892,1605089892,False,31,0,0.664214849472045898,5,True,False,True

I ended up beating 90% of available content the rest is just side quests and stuff. I have very little critiques for this game the only important one being i wish the combat was a little more engaging because as of right now its pretty low skilled and repetitive i wish there were more weapon types and attacks and such but I'm sure that is soon to come.
sucks i completed all the content but hopefully they plan on added multiplayer because this is a type of game I'd love to share with my friends.

Love:
- Sounds are gratifying, feedback from killing mobs and picking up items is sick. Will get people hooked quickly. Been there.
- Crafting/Collecting (enough upgrading to keep you interested for a couple of days, wondering how level progression is going to go when levels become more difficult to attain and you rarely get to invent new things)
- Artwork Quality
- Mobs that require a little bit of skill, but are not too hard
- No bugs so far! Good job!

What makes sense:
- Game play for the price point
- From the bottom of my heart, thank you for making a survival grinding game that doesn't siphon money from my wallet through in-game transactions

Potential things to focus on:
- Performance issues when zombies be all up on my grill
- Fishing is kinda boring because so far I've only gotten one kind of fish and a couple leaves
- Some people love to clear the map lol, and there needs to be a ""leaf"" item sink so I can get them off my hands

Potential enhancements:
- I am a big fan of the dice roll. 1) Random stats for those who love grinding for rare loot/crafting items to use for leet stats/cosmetic items. Maybe I haven't played long enough to know if Dysmantle has a rare loot table. From what I've experienced, Dysmantle Metal Rail =  Get Iron Bar every time
- Can there be skill levels for the timed chests? I'm more of a casual gamer, and hate failing those timed chests all the time. But if I can level 1 complete it, I'm pretty solid for feeling some success.
- Cooking for permanent stats is cool, but would like to see it enhanced to include temporary buffs

There's even forgotten tombs with little puzzle parts to explore. 

It's not a very hard game, but the slow and steady progress has been feeling quite rewarding and even kind of relaxing, to be honest. You get into a trance similar to games like Forager.

The progression and skill leveling feels spot on with the story. The combat is fun and can be challenging at times. 

The story if fine - its the apocalypse and you have find a way to get out of dodge, so some fetch quests in order to do so. The side quests are relevant to the area your are in.

i'm not saying the game is perfect but it's sooo fun at least for people that love post apocalyptic game
with survival and grinding aspect

The pros :
1. The environment are not boring and so colorful
2. The map are HUGE
3. There's more than 1 type of zombies / infected and animals
4. There's a lot of secret that you can unravel in this huge map
5. Once you cooked the new recipe the bonus stays forever unlike some other games that it's just temporary
6. Inventory and crafting is simple and won't make people have a headache

The cons : 

1. hunting for deer and caribou is so frustrating ( i might change my mind once i found a non melee weapon i suppose )
2. i hope on the future update there will be a hint of what to do with the timed box because there's no hint about it in game ( unless we just have to guess all the time it unlocked )
3. there's a baseball bat to replace the crowbar but nothing to replace the Machete yet ( But this is a bit of nitpicking tbh XD )
4. hoping there will be a hint wether we can find the green fish ( unless this is supposed to be determined by RNG and luck )

but all in all i LOVE the game
if i don't have to work or sleep i could see myself playing the game nonstop
i hope the devs keep working and delivering a really good update everytime
keep up the good work guys

It made me feel like my survival was up to me and me alone.  It did this not by being immersive; its a largely top down experience and there is a distinct lack of moody lighting or creepy shadows.  However, this game does grab you by the genitalia and challenge you to explore, build, fight and survive.  Despite the fact that most of your time is spent bashing stuff for materials, the pace of the game is incredible.  All of a sudden there is a new thing to craft, a new material you couldn't get before, a new area, a new puzzle, a progression of background story, a new skill that makes a genuine difference to your experience.  It keeps you hooked.  If the game continues to deepen and progress at this pace... I am sure we will be looking at an all time classic here.  I'm really excited.  This game is a great example of a lot of things done right.  There is a minor point that taints the experience though.  Its an expertly realised apocalyptic world and the mobs are great.  And every time you rest or sleep the world repopulates with new nasties which works both as a timely penalty and fits with an alive, infested world.  However, they spawn in the same place making it all feel contrived and repetitive.  Its a small point but one that should be easily resolved.  If the number/type/position of mobs had some variance it would all feel much more dynamic and would make it feel more like an experience than a game.  Also, if we really are after perfection... I am thinking it would be great if nighttime had more impact on the game.   Perhaps night time can be more scary, more meaningful and more zombies.  regardless, a great game that everyone should buy whilst it is so damn cheap.",1604956023,1604956023,True,6,0,0.598784208297729492,0,True,False,True

It is one of the few early access games i don't feel like came out too early and is a scam. Dysmantle for what it is, is a great entertaining game. I have 10 hours into it and i have not had a single bug. For an early access title there seems to be tons to do and explore and the progression is addicting as well as the looting/ exploring. Combat is nothing special HOWEVER there are enemies and times where you need to plan how to approach a situation. Graphics are nothing special, but that doesn't mean they are bad by any means and i actually think the graphics fit the game perfectly. The price for the game (i got it on sale) is perfect in my opinion and offers a great and enjoyable value. I feel for an early access title i would easily give this a 8/10.

There are some quality of life changes i would like to see implemented such as the ability to filter loot so you don't auto pick up things you don't need and are constantly dropping and battling the auto loot to not pick them back up (leafs) there are a couple of little things here and there besides that, but there is still plenty of time.

The story actually seems to be engaging as well as entertaining. There are also things implemented that take some brain work to figure out which is nice and helps break up the kill and loot grind a little bit. 

I would also like to see a form of base building put into the game, and what i mean by that is craftables and items that can be used to say fortify a house, which right now there isn't much need because the spawns of the enemies are mostly static, however an awesome feature they could add into the game that would make it an even greater time is maybe during the night hours after few hours a horde comes to attack your location.

Some of the things i would like to see implemented may actually be in the game and i just haven't got there yet, as i only have 10 hours in or they could already be things the dev team are working on (i didn't research)

anyways TLDR  - Game is great, price is great, not many if any bugs that i have had, and if you like games like How to survive, you will love this.

If you're the kind of person who likes the grinding in RPGs this game is for you, it almost has everything (puzzles (mini games - pretty basic so far, but they get the job done), some sort of crafting in the skill tree(I'm expecting to see more in the future), RPG feel, pretty big skill tree for the state of the game, farming, survival (although I would like to see some resource management - currently it only has cold and heat that you need to watch out for, the survival feel is definitely there), story, etc)

If I had to rate this game based on the things that it offers it would be like this:

RPG - 4/5
Crafting - 3.5/5
Survival - 3/5
Fighting - 4.5/5
Grinding (in the good way) - 4/5
Misc. (puzzles, farming, things to do in game) - 4/5
Load time (since it's EA game) - 5/5 (it took me less than 1s for any load time that I encountered)
Would I recommend this game to anyone? - 5/5

To be honest the worst part about this game is that it's kind of fast to finish it (early access bit at least), but for sure devs are doing heck of a job in trying to keep this game up to date and add more features (e.g - first patch came only 2 days after the release and changed a few things)

To sum-up, for an early access game this will provide you around 20h of pure entertainment in the current state. I you like to break stuff as in 7days to die or minecraft, but without the ability to craft back (yet at least) then this is definitely a game for you.

Things I would like to see in the future:
- to be able to reset puzzles in case you mess it up (not to have to exit and enter again or suicide where the puzzle allows this)
- more things to enhance the survival feel
- base building would be awesome, with the ability of smelting stuff, or crafting some higher tier materials.
- maybe some sort of pet system or the ability to tame the animals in order to harvest the meat/hide from them.
- achievements added in steam, not only in game

I don't think the title does anything outstanding and it doesn't break any ground, but it doesn't really do anything outright offensive to the games and genres it took inspiration from. I fear that as a result, it might just drift right down the middle and be forgotten. Everyone remembers the shitshow that was No Man's Sky or Battlefront 2, or the immense success of pioneering titles like World of Warcraft and Minecraft, but nobody remembers titles that just kind of exist.

I think this title is quite enjoyable. It takes the plant-based zombies concepts from The Last of Us, slaps it in an isometric view and then adds survival game elements. There's not a lot else to say, and for the recipe with the measurements of each influence, you'll have to watch a video.

The survival game elements are all there with one possibly crucial omission and that's base building. No one wants to spend 30 hours hitting trees with an axe unless they can retreat to their autism fort after a hard day's clicking. That's how it has and will always be, and I think it's folly for a game with such strong survival and crafting elements to omit that. Perhaps it will become available in future releases, but for now it's incredibly apparently missing.

The game's combat is... Well it's there. You spend a lot of time backpedalling and clicking on things that can't attack and move at the same time but also move faster than you in an endless cycle, but some spicy enemy variants are able to keep you on your toes including ranged attackers and vomiters who retreat while firing or control the combat zone. It's nothing outstanding, but it's not at all janky or unusable like other similar titles. It's alright.

The game has what I'm going to describe as an eccentric lead designer, and I'm not sure if that's good or bad. For example, the enemy designs, while fairly simplistic, are clean and very well themed. I love the idea of plants and zombies fused together like Harold in Fallout. The juxtaposition of the approaching horde of slathering undead, some of them adorned with the most beautiful rainforest flowers that exist, blooming from their rotting skulls, emerging like hats. Or the deeper philosophical concept of a zombie that is covered in a symbiotic fungus that allows it to harness energy into it's rotting muscles long after the food has been devoured, simply from the sunlight alone is terrifying. And then your character has onscreen internal dialogue and it has emojis in it and I just have to sigh and rub my temples and wonder if this designer is some kind of genius who has thought about the deeper concepts of what they're displaying onscreen who just made an extremely strange design decision or if they're literally just copying everyone else's homework. C'mon. No one's internal monologue has emojis in it.

I recommend this title because it's quite fun. It's easy to lose hours breaking apart the materials of a house even if I can't then build some horrific post apocalyptic contraption out of the scrap. I would personally prefer if the tools were perhaps a little more difficult to upgrade, using much rarer or even materials placed by the dev specifically at content gates and if the materials could be used to make a base, either to improve the bunker or fortify specific locations out in the world, but as it stands, the game is fairly enjoyable and the gameplay loop is solid. If it manages to capture me for the long term will largely depend on future developments. If I'm going to spend 20 hours hitting nodes in a videogame, I want to do something more with the materials than make my crowbar do 16 damage instead of 14 and that concept alone will make or break the playtime many players will be able to extract from the title.",1604924275,1604924275,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,True

In a way it reminds me of years ago when Fallout 4 was announced and they talked about collecting junk to repurpose into materials. I think fallout 4 missed a big point that dismantle hits perfectly, if it's the apocalypse I don't care about keeping it intact in many cases. I can rip through a cabinet for wood or crush pipes for iron or shred tires for rubber. It's not just about finding items that you can pick up it's breaking down the big objects all around. When it's going well this leads to a really compelling loop of figuring what you can break and wear to find that sort of material. When I needed more iron I started looking for more industrial areas to break down lockers and pipes, when I needed fabric I looked for houses with couches and beds. At its best the system makes you explore and always trying to get the supplies you need to make better tools to get new places or break down new objects for better supplies.

There still are definitely flaws in the system right now though. For one there are some materials that you will have hundreds more than you can use which while it makes sense, a lack of motivation to confirm to harvest any plants or wood (the two that became completely out mixed for me) made me not want to waste time on breaking things down. Yes you get experience for everything you break but since you have to do everything one object at a time right now a table and chairs for example can feel really tedious for no big reward.

As well I found myself with a sudden lack of progression around level 9. I had just about finished upgrading all of my equipment and the only things I was unlocking were passives. It wasn't until level 15 that I unlocked the bat which needs to be upgraded four times to even beat the crowbar anyway. There's absolutely room for some more upgrades in this game if you ask me. Side grades could be preferable picking faster hitting weapons or wide reaching ones with the same damage to objects as an example. The current level cap is 21 but the locked skills say 99 so I am left to wonder what the intended final cap will be. As well the game could put side grades or just some interesting buff options in specifically crafted areas to make the exploration worth it for more than just materials. The game has an arpg torchlight diablo kinda vibe with the perspective so since there's some clear magic elements it could be very fun to start showing a skill tree like this games but I don't think that's the plan, just a weird observation I had.

Overall I think the game is a really good start and fills a good spot in the market for survival games. I definitely think the building aspect is gonna be something I need to fully invest myself in the game, but I understand it being left til last because it would probably slow down a lot of the core loop that needs to be worked on the most. If you like a game that's got a fairly satisfying grind to it then you should be able to find some good fun it the current state of the game.

I do think the game has the potential to be really really good. I would rather have a ""Maybe"" option rather than a yes or no.
I will say yes, because I don't think it's gonna be a bad game and I know myself well enough to know I wouldn't come back to change the review later on. But I wouldn't recommend buying it if you want a fleshed out game with lots to do.

As is, the game seems very much in early stages of development. The bit of voice acting that's present sounds like the TTS bots some streamers use, the game feels grindy right from the beginning instead of easing you into it a bit. The fighting seems very basic but honestly it works, so I won't complain about that, it's good for this type of game.

I will however focus more on how grindy it is.

Now mind you, I don't buy a game that's all about gathering everything around you, crafting and surviving without expecting to grind for stuff. But some stuff it just  feels... Weird to take so long, and some others just feel unnecessary. Perhaps this could be streamlined drastically if there was an option to do things like... Turn scrap metal into iron, or fiber plants into scrap fabric (I think that's what it's called, I'm blanking) and that kind of stuff. You know, what's often in similar games.

This game -is- in early access, and I didn't forget that. But I did go in with some hype, and that was my mistake. It's a respectable game, but you need to have reasonable expectations.

The stronger enemies are fairly interesting, so I'm sure it'll get even better in that sense. But while lots of games have a pretty quick early-game, this one is definitely different. You can barely break anything until you upgrade your tool, which makes getting the materials to upgrade it kinda frustrating at first, and after you upgrade it and are able to easily gather the materials you needed originally, now you need a new material that you can't find any of until you go to a new section of the map entirely.

I'm a fan of skill trees and this game has one that seems to be kind of in-depth, so there's that.

[b]The Pros[/b]
Gameplay is solid, have not encountered any significant bugs to date.
Graphics are nice, performance is crisp.
Game is either well explained or intuitive at points.
Hints towards storyline are interesting at this point.
Sounds are good.

[b]The Cons[/b]
Combat seems pretty easy to date with the exception being the skinless mobs.  Most mobs can be easily defeated by moving backwards while using light attacks.
Game is super grindy at the moment, where you spend most of your time trashing stuff and running back to the storage box.
Monsters can detect you but if there isn't an obvious path (closed doors for example), they can't attack you.

[b]Suggestions[/b]
-Unsure of tools beyond the baseball bat, but can harvesting tools do AOE attacks on harvestables?  This would reduce the grind of continually chipping away at one item and allow for area destruction?  Note that exploding barrels do AOE damage to harvestables.
-Allow monsters to move during their swing animation, putting the onus on the user to dodge more rather than just edging backwards (trivialises most melee and fat spitter mobs at the mo').  I've defeated the first boss and the twins with literally no effort just by backing up from them when they attack.
-Allow monsters to attack through destroyable environments to get to you once they detect you

Still playing but I'm getting close to hitting the level cap and likely running out of content for the time being, but otherwise things are shaping up okay.

It did take a while to get used to the control scheme of moving the camera around as I was used to using the right mouse button to click and hold to move it from other games but once I got the hang of that everything else was really smooth. There is so much depth to this game outside of just smashing things and killing zombies. I just broke the surface and can see myself playing tons of hours of this game.

Great job to the Team of Developers for this sure to be hit.

Update::: Now that I have played this game a great amount of time my overall opinion hasnt changed much.

The only issues I have now are that I hit level cap, Ive gotten 2 of the fuel canisters but now I am locked out from the rest of the map. I understand its an early access game but allow us to continue to gain experience and levels. At this point I dont have much to do. I have acquired the Baseball bat and maxed out its damage and have went through the entire map thats available and broken every item I could find then i thought oh great all that wasted EXP. Now when the cap does raise I wont have anything to farm for EXP. Also had I thought about it ahead of time I wouldnt have invested in perks to increase EXP since there is a cap in place.
At this point I will sadly put the game down until more content is added for fear of not being able to play the new content due to overplaying the old (meaning not having anything left to destroy for EXP when new content launches)


Wish List:
 Allow us to continue to gain EXP all the way to 99 if we want while you work on loading new things in the game

Allow us to reset our perks for those of us that invested in EXP gain perks when we could have toyed around with other things

Allow continued damage upgrades on existing items.

They responded to a forum post and stated, "" The Early Access development will take roughly 6 months and before that time the game can be considered unfinished."" That is much clearer than what most developers say. They also have a bug report system built into the game that I've already used. It takes a screenshot and provides a space for a description.

Too Long, Not Gonna Read (TLNGR) - Great game, great features, still early but well polished.  Worth the buy.

I've got hundreds of hours into similar post-apocalyptic titles, and truly enjoy the scavenge, build, upgrade, and exploration aspect of these types of games.  Dysmantle takes a really cool perspective on having a fully destructable world to explore.  

Need metal?  Cool - rip apart that trashcan.  
Not the metal you wanted?  Cool - tear apart the kitchen sink!

Fighting off zombies in the apocalypse too much work?  Take a break to farm or fish.  Who says you can't eat healthy during the end-of-the-word?

The RPG elements of the game that allow you to upgrade your character (perks and construction progression through a leveling system), equipment (make that crowbar stronger, machete stronger, and learn to carry more throwing knives).  It's a great game, and for an early access title really doesn't have many issues in the lines of bugs.  In the 4-hours I've played, I've made it through the first few days, and completed what I'd consider the first major story arch.

It's very polished and ran smoothly on the highest graphics setting.  No glitches or bugs from the two hours I invested, which is a good sign with any game these days.

The combat is serviceable, but a little wonky with the auto-target doing whatever the hell it wants.  Your protagonist will swing in seemingly random directions if not locked on to what you're swinging at, or in the direction of your mouse cursor despite the direction your character is facing.

Rotating the screen seems to be locked to the middle mouse button, which is also used to manually target enemies.  Remap the auto-target to a different key as soon as possible.  My freaking finger was going numb from holding down the middle mouse button after about 30 minutes of play, with how much rotating is required while navigating the map.  Sadly, there's no way that I could find to remap screen rotation to a different key.

I was bored out of my mind within the first hour of mindlessly gathered the materials I needed for upgrades to advance the story.

7- a bigger tech tree would come in handy

9- Ranged weapons (bow, slingers, crossbows etc)

It just works in my opinion.


However, there are some things that could definitely improve or be implement:

A cleaving option/toggle key would be nice - at the moment (day after release) you just attack 1 thing or 1 enemy even tho there is a cleave-like animation for most tools/weapons.

A toggle sprint/walk that remains in respectively sprint/walk. Currently whenever I have the toggle option set for the sprint key (shift) and I stand still for a moment to check on something, I get in to the walking animation. I've turned off the toggle to sprint and now only constantly press shift instead.

When you find a crafting table in the wild, you should be able to craft/invent and not just upgrade your items - at least that's my opinion.

People are expecting to build huge bases and have tons of guns and a million things to do...thats not what this game is right now. Theres plenty of space to explore and things to do and gather to keep you busy. Dont rush the game..relax..enjoy it. Yes there are a few things that annoy me right away like only being able to hit one thing at a time..including zombies...and the mouse tracking is a little weird sometimes but again..If you go into it expecting what it IS riht now and NOT what it can be..youll have fun.

You can tell there are still a lot of place holder elements here and there. The progression isn't as smooth as it I would like it as far as items and their upgradeability. As this is early release I can't really fault it too much on that. I would be nice for the graphic asset to progress along with the stats(this is a nit pick really). More lowly enemies and more bosses are a must, again early access so not too much to complaint about and just wait. Probably even introduce more wearables like boots and gloves and rings ;), full rpg it I guess. Some mobs are missing their sound, one I know for sure is the fat vomiters.

Game runs and looks good. 

Combat is okay, a bit predictable making the fighting a bit to easy. Would be nice with an increase of mobs and the damage they do(Harder difficulty). Would like to see dangers you would need to avoid, ""zombie swarms with is faster zombies/dogs and"" as an example

Material drops could use a rng buff instead of just 1, could be 1-3. Feels a bit to grindy right now. Costs for items im fine with, if they buff the drops that is.

Maps big wich i really like.

Skill tree feels a bit smal, this is my biggest concern, that it wont offer enough intressting stuff while exploring such a big map.

Looking forward to see how the build-able stuff is going to play out.

But as it is now i feel its lacking intressting stuff to make one keep on playing it for a longer amount of time 

Not a bad game over all tho for a early access game, looking forward to see how it turns out.",1604698112,1604698112,True,4,0,0.54356849193572998,0,True,False,True

In most games you have to break and collect stuff to build other stuff, here it seems breaking stuff is the source of pleasure itself so having to stop to craft something is like a chore and i can't wait getting back to breaking stuff.

It's a clever innovation on the usual XP system of most ARPG's. The bonfire system from Dark Souls is here too, when you rest at a campfire all your health and ammo will replenish, and all the enemies in the world will respawn.
