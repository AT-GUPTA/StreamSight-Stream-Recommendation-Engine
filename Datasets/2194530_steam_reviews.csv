Translation Quality: it's a little awkward but nothing that really interrupts the flow of the story or prevents understanding. In case, like me, you're picky about the quality of translation you're willing to accept, there's a couple of videos on the community hub that should give you an idea of what it's like

Gameplay: as a casual gamer, I found the gameplay to be extremely easy. It's moderate at the start, but becomes trivial around halfway through.

Story: there's a good amount of background world building that supports an interesting cast of characters. If you like the stories you might find in a typical jrpg or light novel, then there's a good chance you will like this. On the whole, due to the easy gameplay, this tends more to the visual novel end of the scale in my opinion.

这是一款模拟经营+galgame混合的游戏。

先说说剧情吧。
评论区有人希望有大团圆结局，这是不可能有的。4个女主，每个都有不同的认知，走向分离是必然的。特莉波卡没有人类的善恶是非，在特莉波卡眼里，捕获灵魂，维持死神塔的运作才是重中之重。主角选择了特莉波卡，自然会和嫉恶如仇的露璐灵走向分离。而耶芙娜，也有自己对炼金术的追求。除了小叶子是白纸系，其他3位的分道扬镳是必然的。
再来说说剧情本身。剧情带有克苏鲁要素，但并不理解这些要素在整篇故事里的重要性所在，似乎只是作者自己的个人喜好。整篇玩下来，就仿佛第三人称视角在模拟经营菜馆，菜单里加了爆炒眼珠，香煎触手之类的。但菜是给客人吃的，与你无关。

再来说说模拟经营部分。
1. 先是旅馆，旅馆的目的是拉人入住，前期比较容易。
2. 然后是餐厅，餐厅的目的是赚金币，餐厅经营好了金币就不缺了。餐厅被设计成了菜品消耗不同的食材，玩家就得及时更换菜谱调节食材消耗。随着餐厅客人的增加，食材是不够的，游戏中期加入了商店刷新机制。但商店里购买食材挺繁琐的，没有一键购买，部分食材也没有用武之地。
3. 再然后是炼金，炼金是游戏里的重中之重，在金币堆积成山之后，炼金获取的高级素材才是游戏里重要的内容，炼金的产物灵魂就是游戏里的高阶货币。游戏里对行动力的限制非常严重，想要提升收益就得炼金，炼金是无需行动力消耗的。但炼金的点击操作非常繁琐，炼金需求量还特别大。
4. 再聊一聊行动力。基础行动力非常低，很多操作都得消耗行动力，真是建议取消掉。整体感觉作者希望给与玩家行动力的限制，让玩家一周目只能刷一个女主的好感度，走一条线。
5. 回归旅馆，游戏后期解锁了里旅馆。里旅馆如同克系生物密集的眼球一般，装修花费的行动力和材料都是惊人的。离谱
6. 神预系统。游戏4周一轮，每一轮都得重新抽神谕，这就导致经营上每一轮早期都在摸鱼，中后期发力。这个设计没什么好坏之说。但问题是神预是随机抽的，玩家并不能控制自己想抽的神预(经营方向)，除非大量S/L。这点是非常差的。

整体感觉就是，好坏参半，各方面好坏参半。剧情方面，没什么瑕疵，但缺乏代入感。模拟经营方面，内容很丰富，但毛病很多。如果是从能不能对得起售价来说，应该是打好评的。",1707901812,1707901812,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Little Leaf Good Ending 1 - How about call me Senior Sister - Declined eternal life. Stay with Little Leaf. Follow own thoughts and return to university together with Little Leaf and study Meteorite Together.
Little Leaf Good Ending 2 - Morning call - Declined eternal life. Continue running hotel with Little Leaf.

Tlipoca Bad Ending - Crown of the Night - Accepted eternal life. Stay with Tlipoca. Eternal love in infinite darness
Tlipoca Good Ending - Video Game Girl - Accepted eternal life. Possibly godhood. Created a new universe with Tlipoca and play video games with her.

Ling Bad Ending - Exterminate Evil - Accepted eternal life. Ling leaves and go on a journey to exterminate Evil. Someday in the forest... maybe they will meet again.

Initially, I expected some sort of construction management simulator, but I was disappointed when I had to read a lot of tedious text right from the beginning of the game. A lot of it. Honestly, I even quit the game at times. However, I came back and kept reading, hoping to get to the ""game"" itself.

The gameplay mechanics were fun and interesting only for the first half hour; then it became a tedious routine. By the middle of the game and beyond, the meaning in the mechanical aspect of the game was completely lost. Fortunately, by that point, I had already immersed myself in the game's plot.

Essentially, the game is a visual novel with clicker elements where you have to improve relationships with a selected character throughout the entire game (there are a total of 4 characters). The Evil parameter feels entirely useless, as it only determines the outcome at one moment in the entire game.
But I must give credit to how the authors described the ""philosophy"" of spirits, monsters, death, and other worlds. The plot twists in the middle and, especially, at the end of the game hooked me onto the completion, although even after finishing, there remained a sense of deprivation concerning some key characters like Uncle Cat and Senior Brother.

the translation is also extremely exhausting to read but i'll give that a pass because i saw that it's a small team and it's serviceable. i play a lot of Chinese games with rough translations though. the intrigue of the story has dropped off a cliff for me after the first hour though and i don't believe that's the translation's fault. 

i'm hoping that at least in the future if it gets an upgraded translation it'll be more fun to play, like my experience with lobotomy corp.

Other than some wack translations i have absolutely no gripes with this game. In general the translations are a lot better than what i usually expect from chinese titles.

The best part is the pacing, new mechanics are introduced right when you think you figured everything out keeping you occupied with experimentation and preventing the game from becoming stale all the while keeping an air of mystery around what you are actually doing.

The only real negative in regards to gameplay so far is that some thing can't be automated which then becomes a chore you must complete every turn.

Some people have called the story segments very long, While true especially early on it was not that big o a deal for me personaly. 

Based on the in game timer i should be about 1/4th through the game as of writing this review meaning it should be around 40 to 50 hours of play time if you play somewhat relaxed like me. Based on the way decisions shaped the game so far i definetly can see myself do a second playthrough afterwards as well.",1698143526,1698143526,True,2,0,0.511771440505981445,0,True,False,False

I am positively surprised by the quality of the english translation, given that the original language is Chinese and in many cases, the translation feels clunky. Here I never saw a spelling or grammatical mistake and the sentences and dialogues are cohesive.
People are complaining about the story in the first 30 mins(you can skip it), but I liked it, even if it wasn't really original, it set the tone for the game. There is also quite some story in between the days, which I also like, since the characters are getting development.

I do think this game has a lot in common with Volcano Princess, since there are months and like days and you get certain amount of turns and you have many different activities, that you can do to earn money. Also this game is not really about the managing of residents type of game, which I appreciate, here you more or less have to use your resources to invest in better equipment or you can specialise in alchemy etc. 


The music is really well fitting with the tone and theme.

I am not really sure about the ""roguelite"" element, I don't believe it's correct to call it so, since it really is more about just choosing where to invest. Maybe there is more to it after you finish the game, but I have yet to do it.

To start, I highly recommend skipping the ENTIRE beginning story scene with the >> button.  You will NOT want to struggle through the drawn-out-long-winded story that's clearly Chinese in origin. I implore you to do this, the game is actually well designed, very unique and fun. With that said, the story IS good too!!! Just hard to get through for those with lower attention spans or that have lives, etc. You will only want to actually read through it when you've already fallen in love with the game and its characters. 

Hard to describe exactly what's good about this game. It is a mix of genres that many will likely NOT appreciate. I for one, DO appreciate this game, as it is a blend of game play characteristics that are well balanced and CLEARLY made with MUCH LOVE from its development team. Plus as an added bonus, they are actually responsive here on Steam. They clearly want their game to be a success. 

Visually the game is beautiful. The characters are well drawn lovable. The visual novel aspect (while long winded), is NOT poorly translated and has quirky-fun 2D sprites that (while not Live2D animated), have their movements executed well to keep the reader entertained.",1697889775,1697963838,True,0,1,0.338524043560028076,0,True,False,False

The pacing can also feel off, and the long prologue was a little hard to get through (there is fast forwarding, though).

With those said, I've found it fairly addicting, and it keeps adding plenty more to do with new systems as you go. Upgrading rooms/the hotel, exploration, cooking and managing the restaurant are just some of things you need to keep track of.

Translation:
It's clear that this was a game meant for Chinese audiences, but the translation is serviceable. It has a bit of that jank that makes your head hurt a little bit if you read too much of it (mainly in the visual novel parts) but it's generally good enough to understand what's going on or what the intention was. I've definitely played worse. Some things are labeled weirdly, there's misspells and typos, but honestly it is good enough to enjoy the visual novel and use the UI just fine so it's not bad.

When I say it's clearly meant for Chinese audiences, some lines don't make any sense in English without the context that the original version is Chinese (for example characters saying Chinese proverbs in English, the wordplay doesn't work) but it's to be expected since sometimes jokes and things like that just don't translate well. You shouldn't have any real problems with this translation but it certainly isn't perfect.

Mechanics:
I thought the descriptions of the gameplay mechanics wasn't the clearest from reviews/the description so here's everything I've unlocked so far:
-Days
Each day you have a certain number of ap which essentially acts as your 'moves', and they recharge each time (once in the morning and once in the evening) and you start with 1 ap. Things like upgrading rooms, gathering materials, and bringing in new guests cost ap, but not everything does.
-Sanity and Oracles
Oracles are basically modifier cards you can get, like in a rougelike with cards. You get at least one opportunity to get one each part of the day and sometimes you can get multiple, but this costs your sanity. I believe losing all your sanity is game over, and you can choose to rest if you have ap to regain around 6 sanity (oracles seem to cost 1-6 sanity). Oracles can do things like boost guests you get, money earned, even clean your hotel. At the end of each month a blood moon occurs and consumes all your oracles, but if you have more than 10 you can choose a supreme oracle which is permanent.
-Alchemy
Alchemy works like the periodic table, each item has a value and you can fuse them together to get a new item with the value of the items added together. If you get a specific item you can level up your alchemy level (I think it boosts your chances to get rarer items but I'm not 100% sure). You can then also use alchemy items to bring in a bunch of guests to your hotel. You can get alchemy items from guests for free or you can buy them.
-Building your hotel
You can upgrade rooms in your hotel, usually for money and some materials you get from cleaning (cleaning requires ap). Usually it just boosts some stats but it also changes the appearance of the room which is really cute.
-Tasks
You get main tasks and side tasks, I believe if you fail main tasks you get a game over but I haven't failed any yet. They're generally related to earning enough, performing a certain action, or upgrading your rooms.

There's other mechanics too but I think those are the main ones (that I've gotten so far anyways). The game has a fun mix of chill idle style management and some legitimate strategy.

Plot:
A basic summary of the plot is that you are the adopted heir of a mysterious professor who died? Disappeared? I'm not sure and I don't remember but the bottom line is he's gone, and you receive his stuff (including the yard/hotel and a mysterious 'biodroid'). It's clear he was involved in some shady stuff and hosted auctions for rich nonhuman creatures who are all quite powerful. Some of them tried to have you killed so you couldn't claim your inheritance but that instead ended up in you basically becoming a werecat (yes every night you turn into a little one eyed cat). So far I really like the spooky vibe and characterization, and the story is definitely kind of out there which fits the aesthetic, so it goes along with the gameplay pretty well. The prologue is pretty long though, I think it took me almost an hour to get through. It's worth it but you can just fast forward if you want.

I think those are the main points I wanted to cover so I hope the review helps any other curious English speakers!",1697853761,1697853761,True,165,1,0.919476449489593506,0,True,False,False
