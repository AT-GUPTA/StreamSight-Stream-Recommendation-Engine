Beside the Graphics, Its not Tekken anymore the way it used to be.
Yes, games change over time, but this series is just different.
No additional games like bowling, beach ball none of the Fun stage fight stuff
is here anymore. This is buy this, by that instead.
and GRIND as hell.

My advice for the Old School players : Move on, and play the old games instead.

The Story is cut short. Its not that interesting anymore as it used to be.
This is focused on Multiplayer especially grind.
Fancy fighter here, fancy clothing there, fancy buy this.

It looks good,but thats it. Gameplay is so and so.
I cant say that this game here is good, and if i could get my money back, i would rather have that instead of keeping this game in my library forever just because i paid money for it.
Cant recommend, unless you want grind, grind, and no good story.",1703940768,1708699286,False,1,0,0.498199284076690674,0,True,False,False

This game has no competition for being the best fighting game on PC. One character in this game has more depth than 10 Shotos in SFV

I'm a hardcore Feng main, I've played him for 60 hours. Just one single character for 60 hours and guess what? I have barely any knowledge of him! I know what most move's inputs are but that's about it. I can't do 1 dash 1 df 4,2,1+2, his staple ender. I can't add BT mixups into my natural gameplan. But I CAN spend hours in the lab perfecting my play and getting to the next level, the next rank, to beat someone else who is also on a similar journey. Maybe in 250 hours of Feng I will know him well enough to confidently say I'm good with him and could maybe win a tournament. And then ya look at the roster and what do you know? There are 40 more characters, all with the same insane level of depth as Feng, or more. Feng is a simple character to learn and he has 99 moves! Lei Wulong has the most in the game at like 160!!! But more realistically a character like Akuma can take months of practice to perfect. Heihachi? You need to learn to wavedash, backdash, electrics (frame perfect input of FDF1), and soooo much more. The only characters remotely similar to each other are the Mishimas, with their fF3, electrics, wavedashing, twin pistons, etc. I only said ""remotely similar"" as opposed to copy paste which is so insanely far from realistic.

Now look at SFV. My main man Gill has like, 10 unique moves. And only half of them are actually real as they're just Fire and Ice versions. Characters like Kage, Akuma, Ryu, Ken, Dan, Oni, all have pretty much the same movesets except for 4-5 moves. SHOTOS ARE COPY PASTE. They are pretty much only distinguished by frames.

My rage and vengeance finally have an outlet where I can release some stress. 
This game is a true test of skill. No potions, no cowardice, and no cheap tricks/spells.

It is a damn shame that sewage waste such as Overwatch, Apex Legends, Dead by Daylight and other similar games exist. An endless cycle of soulless action and Acedia designed for the masses.

In Tekken 7 matches are going to vary from difficulty and at times may be unforgiving. It only gets stable through learning and timing. One wrong move and everything is over. Only through skill and patience can victory be achieved.

Playing Tekken 7 brings me nostalgia of playing older games such as Starcraft: Broodwar due to the difficulty and how  the mechanics relied on multiple actions rather than one single command.

               [PROS]
+ Best Tekken Game Ever Better in everything except customization.
+ Gameplay and Combo mechanics are Really Good.
+ Characters are Much More Balanced

             [CONS]
- Bad Online Slow and Laggy.
- Loading took ages to load.
- Game Crashes too much and also Stutter.
- There still few Character Which I Consider Broken or I should say Overpower Like Akuma, Leo,Howarang,Nina,Geese. Few of them only Spam you don't even get a chance to hit and few of them will take your whole health in one combo.

Updated Review: It was the best tekken game and now the worst tekken game after patch 5.00 Devil jin is my main. i mean what were developers thinking why tf they killed devil jin like that now the worst character ever i cannot even defeat low rank players now even though my rank is TGO.I've been playing dvj since tekken 5 which was my first tekken and he was strong in tekken 7 season 3 but not that strong but then got more stronger in season 4 his wallcombo is so strong they can nerf it but they removed it but it does not matter the thing is matter his main game 50 50 why tf they took it away from him he has no mids only little moves now that does not do dmg means low damage/poor damage but i still play him and jin is my 2nd main which is a lot stronger also 100 times stronger than devil jin and for me its the worst tekken now i wont recommend it hats off to you Harada for your great legendary thinking.

[i]- Sexy graphics
- Beautiful arenas
- Awesome music
- Large diverse cast
- Many interesting and surprising guests (even Negan from TWD, so wild)
- Cool story mode bro (srsly so awesome that they added a guest character to the story)
- The cinematic into gameplay transitions in story mode, are just *chef's kiss*, perfect
- TEKKEN's on brand weird and funny character cutscenes
- Loads of customization options
- Tight controls and smooth performance, awesome PC port
- Fun satisfying combos and an impressive array of badass moves
- And you can even view cutscenes and artworks from all the previous games![/i]

Negatives:
- Story mode's journalist narrator was honestly hard to listen to, very monotone
- Playable Kazumi doesn't have a Devil form like Kazuya.., would be cool, just saying..

Tekken 8 is out, but I can still get games online. Which is good because I really like the roster in this one.
We have Geese Howard and Akuma in a Tekken game! The roster is huge!

By the time I'm writing this review, Tekken 8 is already out and exploding in success leaving its antecessor to rot quickly, and I'm writing this review as a way to say goodbye.

Even if this review finds you in an era where T7 has already became a relic, it's still worth the experience due to how great is the personality of this game and how expressive it is in terms of design and gameplay. Definitely a game that will leave a mark in history of fighting games communities and development.

DLCs are a great part of this game (be it a good thing or a bad thing) and I wouldn't recommend you buying a dead game without them. Guest characters is a great example and is something T7 excels at, throwing punches against Akuma and Geese is already crazy enough, but when you add Noctis to the equation you suddenly find yourself in an anime fight, just to play against Negan from TWD in the next match and not be able to stop thinking how badass this character is in the game.

Akuma and Geese already blew my mind regarding how they feel like your are playing their respective games without feeling like you are not playing Tekken (there is some controversy about that), but Negan and Noctis I actually got to know AFTER T7 and I was perplexed on how similar they are in the game compared to their own respective universe. The best cross over game I've ever seen.

I'm extremely thankful to the experiences this game provided me and I wish I had just a little more time with it.",1578350063,1707665142,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

For one, there is no proper tutorial to this game. Nothing to tell you how the combos work, when to use certain universal moves, and the likes. They pretty much throw you in there, and you're supposed to figure out how to play against all these other players who have many years of experience. They gate frame data behind a paywall, and learning what you can or cannot do while actively fighting in game is exceedingly difficult. Certain animations are also atrociously ambiguous, making moves look different than their actual hit properties (ex: A low that looks like a mid).",1699053321,1706939962,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[list]
[*] Story
The story tells the end of the longing Mishima father-son feud, and while it did a decent job of concluding it -- the execution from prior scenes are stale. You follow a vengeful journalist's research on the Mishimas, narrated throughout by his calming and disheartening voice. It feels like a visual novel, more than a fighting game. Akuma was apparently a significant part of the story, which doesn't make sense other than a crossover opportunity than lore. Not the worst, but it could be better.

[*] Gameplay
Tekken 7 has so many mechanics. This game is not for casuals, I can tell you that. With the addition of 2 more mechanics than its initial version, the gameplay could not be any more complex as of current. This game will take you days to getting used to, but once you've got the hang of it, you'll quite enjoy the overall gameplay. Characters have so much moves to memorize, it's intimidating. But variation begets opportunities, especially on combos. 

[*] File Size
The game has 80GBs. I recommend finding a file compressor for this problem.

[*] Graphics Compability
Unreal Engine games are usually demanding, so I'd recommend bench-marking your computer for this game. There's a mod somewhere that removes graphics in maps, so I'd recommend that downloading that too.
My computer specifications are: Intel i7 11th Gen (CPU) & Intel IrisXe Graphics (GPU), 16GB RAM. With the mods installed, I have a steady 57-60 fps rate. All graphics settings are set to low, with a 80% graphics resolution and 1600x900 screen resolution.

Here are some tips to try:
- Try not to search up any combo guides. Experiment and indulge in your own way, and you might find your own playstyle.

-  If you pressure yourself by saying, ""Oh, it's not optimal -- this combo sucks!"" - Stop it. The game will seem boring if you rely on optimal combos always, it's Tekken, darn it. Have some variety and have fun, even if its not optimal -- it may even open your mind for more things to explore.

Pleasing to and easy on the eyes. Enough offline content. Very simple menu and settings.

Once you find the right character and you can work out their quirks and how their moves hit, the best juggle options, master class.  Or, fuck it, you can just use assists for one button death fists and it's still funny as fuck.  This game grew on me, for a while I was not a fan, I put some hours in and just could not get it to click.  Then I found the funny sumo man and the fun finally happened.

The main critique I have, and I know this will be in Tekken 8 because of course it is so I'm resigned to it, is having the save data including ranks be accessible client-side (i.e - your PC, not on a server) is just asking for cheating to happen.  People can find it, edit their save with the right tools, and boom - TGO with max prowess.

I previously only had casual/limited experience playing fighting games but in July 2019 I bought Tekken 7 for PlayStation 4 on a whim and can honestly say that the decision to do so completely changed my life. I subsequently bought both the Xbox One and PC versions of the game just so I could play against as many different people as possible. I've put in well over 1,800 hours of gameplay across all three versions (1,350 of which are on Xbox) and have gone from being a total noob to reaching the online rank of True Tekken God (rank 35) with my main (Kuma) -- there are 37 ranks in Tekken 7, each one exponentially more difficult to achieve than the last as you must defeat opponents within two ranks of yourself to rank up, but losses to opponents within two ranks of yourself will cause you to rank down. Never before have I spent so much time outside of a game looking to improve my skills by reading strategies online and watching videos of professionals in an effort to become ranked as highly as I possibly can.

Tekken 7 gives back as much as you put in and even over 22,000 matches later there are still numerous techniques I'm yet to master and moves I'm yet to commit to memory with the character I main -- consider the fact that there are 50 characters on the roster and you have one hell of a deep fighting game. There is never a moment wasted whilst playing as you're always learning something new and honing your skills. The way the momentum can instantly shift due to a perfectly-timed counter hit or whiff punish makes each match so dynamic and exhilarating, and it means that epic comebacks are never out of the question.

However, that's not to suggest that the game is perfect. The load times are very lengthy (made more frustrating by the inability to instant rematch), the netcode is poor, the user interface is dull, the visuals are dated, there are very few modes, there is no proper tutorial, and rage quitters are common as there is minimal punishment for doing so. So, to put it another way, the game has clear flaws but none of them relate to the actual core gameplay which is truly sublime and as close to perfection as I've ever come across in a video game. 

Tekken 7 is an absolute masterpiece and has become, without question, my favourite competitive multiplayer game of all time. I'm 33 years old and have been a hardcore gamer all my life but no other game has even come close to the enjoyment, adrenaline, satisfaction, and sense of achievement that winning a single close-fought round in Tekken 7 can give me. If you're considering this game for its single-player then there are certainly better options out there, but when it comes to multiplayer fighting games then Tekken 7 simply has no equal.",1599777792,1706175746,True,47,1,0.801209747791290283,0,True,False,False

- Netcode has been improved starting from Season 4 release.

But Tekken 7 on steam also has :
- Crashes from time to time during the ""vs"" loading screen when you fight people in player vs player mode - online mode. Unstable. There are days you won't get a crash. But most of the time, you will get crashes during the ""vs"" loading screen.

Edit : Climbed to higher ranks as a few characters (Kazuya, Lee, Jin, Lars) to find out for sure it doesn't get better. You get more points for winning than you lose for losing for the very large majority of ranks in the game so the skill level doesn't change much anyway. The shell of what is possibly my favorite game ever is in here somewhere but, in my opinion, the ability to have fun will almost never line up. 50+ characters and single digit ""honest"" characters who actually require learning a neutral game (no, your favorite way to mash into a flowchart doesn't count) or respecting your opponent. Overly evasive launchers on one button inputs, half health stealing knowledge checks that require hours of tedious homework to learn one matchup, or hand breaking movement techniques so that you can sit around and play whiff punish instead is the name of the game. Pick one and jump into ranked. Possibly forgivable, depending on your perspective and character choice, but that combined with this game's flaws almost everybody agrees on spoil the whole experience. Greedy DLC practices, terrible netcode, slow loading without good graphics to back it up, janky hitboxes, a complete lack of decent single player content, the ability to use ""save states"" for your rank on top of several exciting and classic ways to cheat, an antiquated lobby system, (subjectively) frustrating gameplay, a couple bangers but a very disappointing soundtrack compared to the old games, clear advantages for control schemes the game wasn't originally designed for, takes up half the space on your computer and takes hours to download so you'll never convince people to play it with you for more than a few sessions, and an objectively bad story (in this one, i like the old ones). You can't ask Bandai Namco ""for shit"" so maybe keep walking if they ask you for your hard earned cash on this one. Then again, this one sold so well that it regularly goes on sale for dirt cheap. Doesn't bode well for 8, but maybe worth a shot if the price is right. I wish I didn't agree 2300 hours ago.

So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he let me borrow his controller. Me and my son then played in turns and I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died.

TEKKEN 7, the latest installment in the renowned fighting game franchise, fails to live up to the high expectations set by its predecessors. Despite its impressive graphics and legacy, this game falls short on several fronts, leaving players more frustrated than entertained.

Uninspired Storyline:
One of the glaring weaknesses of TEKKEN 7 is its lackluster storyline. The narrative feels like a convoluted mess, attempting to tie up loose ends from previous games but ultimately failing to provide a compelling and coherent plot. Players may find themselves struggling to stay engaged, wondering if the convoluted story is even worth the effort.

Underwhelming Character Development:
While the game boasts a diverse roster of characters, the development of these fighters leaves much to be desired. Many characters lack depth, and the attempts at injecting personality often come across as forced or clich√©d. This lack of meaningful character development makes it challenging for players to form any real attachment to the fighters.

Questionable Balancing Issues:
TEKKEN 7 suffers from noticeable balancing problems, with certain characters dominating the playing field. This lack of balance undermines the competitive aspect of the game, leaving players frustrated when facing opponents who exploit these imbalances. The failure to address these issues through updates reflects a lack of commitment to creating a fair and enjoyable gaming experience.

Cumbersome Online Experience:
The online component of TEKKEN 7 is a source of considerable disappointment. Laggy matches, frequent disconnections, and a lack of dedicated servers contribute to a subpar online experience. This is a significant letdown for a game that heavily relies on its competitive multiplayer aspect.

Arcade Mode Repetition:
Arcade mode, a staple in fighting games, offers little variety in TEKKEN 7. The repetitive nature of battles and lack of innovation within this mode make it feel like a chore rather than an exciting part of the gameplay experience. The absence of meaningful rewards or incentives further diminishes the motivation to engage in this mode repeatedly.

In summary, TEKKEN 7 disappoints on multiple fronts, from its uninspired storyline and underdeveloped characters to balancing issues and a lackluster online experience. Fans of the franchise may find themselves longing for the days when TEKKEN was synonymous with cutting-edge fighting game excellence. Unfortunately, TEKKEN 7 fails to deliver the knockout punch it promised, leaving players grappling with disappointment rather than the thrill of victory.

all you do is combos

then when you get low health you save your ass with a rage art

- Still a Tekken entry - good polish with slightly different timing of inputs and good follow-up mechanically.
- Local vs as well as unranked online with friends is working correctly.
- Accessible but challenging achievements (probably get a friend or two to make finding tournaments easier)

Cons:
- Nowhere near as rich in story as previous Tekken titles.
- Riddled with DLC microtransaction bloat, even in competitive.
- Online ranked matches suffer from a lot of lag. (No way to filter opponents by quality of connection)

I mostly play Tekken titles for the story, I have enough other multiplayer competitive stressful experiences. In that regard, this barely has any. The story takes ~5 hours to finish and is told from a rather boring perspective. Only one main storyline is fully finished with some one-off story beats accessible as well. The fights on normal difficulty would be challenging were it not for the typical weakness of nearly every fight being quick jab spam. Multiplayer is fun with friends, probably the only reason to get this title, any other kind suffers greatly from a lack of filtering options. Most ranked online matches are basically powerpoint presentations with 1-2 second input delay (Might've been a fluke? I haven't played much but I did try to play multiple different opponents and ~70% of unique match-ups ended up in what I described above) Tourneys are hard to come by with not much of a choice in terms of skill based matchmaking. This title might have at most been worth 20 bucks at release, with player pools saturated in different skill levels and with many more players with good connection. Now, this title would be worth about 5-10 bucks depending on how much you wanna play with friends.",1705373273,1705373273,False,0,0,0.491228044033050537,0,True,False,False

Thinking of your opponent‚Äôs actions to fight,
Reading your opponent‚Äôs inner thoughts to fight,
Planning attacks that will hit your opponent to fight,
And then transmitting your thoughts with those attacks,
The more you think of your own advantage, at the same time you think of your opponent,
In the instant you mix with your opponent, a passionate feeling arises, and blood boils,
Reality is hurt, and you wound your opponent,
Hostility is akin to love.

You can tell they've really changed up the fighting style to still have a lot of the core Tekken traits, but also making it kind of Street Fighter-y because of a special someone newcomer Akuma from the Street Fighter franchise and it's honestly a nice change of pace. I used to have a problem with how I felt the block was a lot less effective than the previous installments but once you get into the groove of matches the fast-paced action really pays off in an amazing way.

impressively large roster of fighters.

You have to double tap forward to not move at a crawl. (enragingly annoying).
Characters have no common move set besides standard throws and 3low punch ""combo"". by the time i was 1/4 through the roster, i had already forgotten all the moves of the first few fighters i tried... down+h kick = sweep? hell no! but we did give a character a move that makes her fall asleep...

That being said, it has some of the all time best characters, aesthetics and combat flow, as well as some of the absolute worst story modes in any game ever made. The narration and narrator in Tekken 7's story mode is by far the worst thing to ever happen in any form of interactive media and I fully recommend you play it at least once, for the few good parts, albeit muting all the inbetweens.

As a fighting game, Tekken 7 is absolutely great and entirely unfair. Anyone can play it, anyone can win and that makes it brilliant, but also very scary. I love the game, but it really can bring the worst out of yourself and your friends. It is a fun game to genuinely enjoy with people in the same room. Family, friends, the like. I highly recommend playing it like a party game. 3-4 people, taking turns in versus, is absolutely the best way to play the game. 2 people in a room with Tekken 7 means that the third player is the Devil. Nothing bad bad blood can occur.

Lucky Chloe was a character that many did not like, whereas she is my main and has brought me to the top of competitive play in arguably one of my strongest Tekken debuts of all time.

Earlier this year, some young people were playing it competitively at a convention hall. I asked them who was the best among them, as that is who I wanted to play. They assumed I was much older than I was and asked ""What was the last one you played?"" Like, what the hell, THIS one.

Either way, I was humbled but I came extremely close. The downside was that I was playing against a sweaty Law player with his own controller deck (these men shall never taste the humble glories of heaven and will know no salvation from the horrors of the material world), but it was great to make these guys get so hyped over seeing Lucky Chloe literally dance all over Law for a few rounds. In the end, Law meta cheese won but it was hard to be mad. Losing in Tekken is frustrating, yes, but it is a lot like having a fist fight in a busy highway and being mad a car hit you and killed you instantly. Some of the best Tekken victories are entirely accidental.

Now, the bowling.

Tekken bowling is one of the best things of this entire package. It can be utterly frustrating because it literally is, nothing but character meta and some characters simply should never have a bowling ball in their hands, let alone be allowed at a Bowling Alley in the first place.

But getting a Turkey, three strikes in a row, in this game is exhilarating. When you find a character who works well, when you understand who is best a power shooter and who is best at curve balling, this game ends up having a surprising amount of depth and honestly, Tekken bowling NEEDS its own standalone, like how Gwent from Witcher 3 did.

I promise you, Tekken Bowling is worth getting this older Tekken 7 for cheap, on the eve of Tekken 8. But only if you have IRL friends over frequently enough or family who enjoy what is the TRUE home-breaking party game.

For real though, the main story is absolutely horrible, besides like three set pieces and fights that are some of the best in the series. But everything else is truly amazing.",1704290731,1704290731,True,1,0,0.504950463771820068,0,True,False,False

Idk if it's worth getting when 8 is out (going to be).  I'm sure there will still be a fair few people playing it, tho mostly higher ranked (People still play Tekken 6 and TTT2 to this day).  Just make sure it's cheap before you get it.  It's a fun game that I've spent playing on and off since release.  Wide variety of characters, dope stages and music.  Very satisfying game to learn.

It feels like everything good about this game has strings attached.

One good thing about Tekken is that it is a complex game. There's a lot of options both offensively and defensively. It allows for a great amount of player expression. and has a wide and varied enough roster to give a reasonably fun character for pretty much everybody.
If you like reading people's timings and playing aggressively, there's a character - if you like reading timings and playing defensively, there's a character for that, too. Same goes for pretty much every archetype. You don't have the issue you have in some games where you don't have any character that's quite you.

BUT..

While there are characters for everybody, that complexity comes right back to bite you in the ass. Learning even one character to a semi-playable level takes atleast an hour just to go through your movelist and learn some basic combos. When you have a roster of over 30 characters, no character descriptions whatsoever and no moveset organization, it makes it very hard to find the character that you actually enjoy. My favorite character is Bryan, but it took me over 100 hours (played on 2 accounts) to find him, and I'm still uncertain about him. 

The monetization of this game is pretty egregious - locking valuable frame data and labbing certain characters behind a paywall. While that data *can* be accessed online, it's much more inconvenient (especially if you have 1 monitor) and, at least for me, harder to internalize than if it is shown ingame.

Little to no singleplayer content 

No tutorial or guides whatsoever

- You can't ban players that you don't like
- In Casual matches you can't set level of your opponent
- You can't ban certain imbalanced characters
- Controls are terrible. For example you press double down to step aside, but you just duck. You want to duck and then kick, you press down and kick, but you don't duck, you just low kick.
- This fighting is close combat oriented but there are characters that have projectiles like in 2D fightings
- 3D fighting? Where? I see 2D fihgting with 2D logic. You can step aside? Uhu, then why punches reaches me when i step aside? Hitboxes? Then why do we even need this mechanic? Just get good? Are you willing to pay for my time?
- The fighting stick is not a matter of preference, but of necessity. For example there is such thing as korean back dash, it is mostly impossible to execute on keyboard, hard on gamepad and only on fighting stick it is somewhat comfortable.

- Some characters are too unbalanced and unfair to play, even after the nerfs, see: Leroy, Fakuram (the ugliest and flat char in a Tekken game ever), etc...
- The game it's in his EOL, so maybe at the end of this year or the next a new Tekken will come.

+Tekken gameplay at it's sharpest
+soundtrack is fire (though I wish we had a jukebox option like the Playstation version...)
+tightest tier list of any AAA fighting game ever (oh panda's bottom tier? some guy just won EVO playing as her)
+Netcode has seen some serious improvements since launch
+Story mode was... entertaining. I guess. but...

-Okay the story mode was kinda butt. The whole idea of going with some narrator who doesn't seem to matter at all was weird. On too of that, maybe an 8th of the cast even shows up.
-NO TUTORIALS (""sample combos"" were added later, but if you're new, you're gonna need you a whole lotta youtube)
-BE WARNED: there ARE some cheaters in the MUCH higher ranks in certain server areas.
-kinda pricey if you want all the characters

If you've been looking to get into Tekken, this ain't a bad time to do it. If you're new to fighting games, I do recommend starting somewhere else. If you've been through the basics of Street Fighter, Guilty Gear, etc. and you're down for a hell of an initial learning curve, come one in.",1645147451,1702715748,True,0,0,0.483221471309661865,0,True,False,False

Maybe you should wait for Tekken 8 to come out next year but if you want to play a fighting game now you can't go wrong with Tekken 7 and it will prepare you for 8.

Not even the middle class commonly had any sort of practically usable ""Internet"". Our Wikipedia was some sad collection of CD's called ""Microsoft Encarta/Enciclopedia"". I would actually sit for countless hours practicing Tekken 3 combos from printed, expensive guide books in front of the cold glow of our analog CRT TV. Maybe I'm just too ""oldschool"", ""rigid"", melancholic or whatever... but already after briefly checking out one of the Tekken Tag-Tournaments in itself, AGES ago I noticed many combos/chains I still remember 25+ years later, the artstyle, fluidity and general vibe dramatically changed.

In the case of Tekken 3 I don't think it's mere nostalgia or ""relative"" amazement for a novel game in those olden days or experiencing things at such young age. The innovation, quality, vibe was simply superior. The artistic vibe and satisfaction from it's minimal b-mup story, actual oldschool CGI videos at the end of each Arcade-playthrough and even the soundtrack were all clearly made with incredible passion. Compare this to being greeted with a lazy ""Game Over"" after just 4-5 Arcade Mode opponents in this current installation and maybe you might somewhat believe second-hand that this talk might be about more than just romantic ""nostalgia"".

It might just be personal preference: but imho not much changed for the better - to be quite honest.
I was somehow hoping that maybe the series miraculously shifted somewhat back to it's origins after Tekken TT, 5 and 6? - I quickly checked out my main/favourite characters and their original combos/vibe; Lei, Jin, King etc. Only fractions appear to remain; And that's not even the very best bits.

""Kids"" or newer gen might just react stereotypically ""Aw just another rigid, old geezer, unable to 'adapt' git gud! l2p!""... but I think in some occasions old/original kinds of quality have their very own, maybe even very factual and objective merit and reason: Just listen to the super-nervous, cheezy/cheap and nauseating, extremely annoying soundtracks on many T7 occasions. What's going on? What happened?

I'll try to make a very basic example on Jin. One of my favourite/original combos with Jin in T3 was Square, Triangle, (faster) Cross, Circle. (slower) -> Two fast punches followed by Taekwondo'esque, scissoring top to bottom head-kicks or high-kicks. It used to be quite a simple/efficient and fast combo. But moreover it actually had a lot of style and physical ""impact"" in it's feel: it would truly come from the very top, hitting opponents on their head, collapsing their torsos downwards to be knocked back and up again. It would somewhat remind of the flexibility of Hwoarang's actual Taekwondo style, but it was still more linear, less swung and somewhat slower, i.e. more in Jin's cooler/powerful way. Very unique as all the moves, animations and vibes of all the characters.

Compared this basic example to T7; It's merely a 3-hit combo. And the remaining kick is replaced with extremely sloppy, inflexible front-kick without much of an organic or less so any sort of ""martial arts"" vibe to it. His (and many others') animations, fluidity and fighting style seem extremely rigid, sloppy... often comparable to some drunkard winding up for some meaningless brawl in a lousy bar.

On a sidenote and talking about uniqueness, details and quality: Jun, Jin's mother, being family actually had some rather cool ""wheel"" styled combos starting with simultaneous forward + Square + circle... to be continued with triangle, Square iirc. that were almost identical to Jin's ""wheel"" combo, as sort of a family thing, but even then each with their own twist and style. Pretty sure those combos (or even characters) no longer exist either, therefore that neat and very cool pattern and sort of family-vibe, is gone as well.

Obviously this just a basic, single example of great combos and things completely missing. I just watched a couple seconds of an old, pixelated  Hwoarang T3 video on YT and it takes less than 5-10 seconds to realize that something much more fluent, speedy and impressive is going on compared to what I witnessed, hoped for and still refunded today:

I might be very wrong but I somehow suspect a technical/artistic 3D gaming pipeline kind of issue. If you look at the textures in T3 with the graphics capabilities and techniques used in those days - they don't even seem like actual textures, but rather polygonal albedo-colors. Somewhat akin to the older Sega Virtua Fighter almost. ""Lowpoly texture and model style"". And I actually believe that, aside from inferior quality standards and modern greed might be a very core reason: I think in terms of flexibility with modern, more detailed standards or expectations in terms of 3D and textures specifically... the extremely fast and flexible moves from an old T3 would simply not even be possible with more modern standards, or at least the ""realistic""/Fancy style and texturing used: Even if it's end result and extremely cheap and cheesy use for costumes/""style"" is imho questionable, from and artistic and stylistic POV.

You see in 3D modelling, rigging, texturing and animation characters it's actually quite challenging, often impossible to move joints, limbs to extreme angles: as the detailed, high-quality textures would severely distort or even rip up the actual model. The texture, i.e. visual skin of the 3d model... has limitations.

I wouldn't be surprised if this technical difference between T3 and later releases had an actual impact on flexibility/angles and a way more impressive, impactful and fun implementation of characters, their combos movements and animations. For lower poly models with barely any textures that limitation should be much less of a problem.

What I wouldn't be surprised about either is if the olden T3 devs and publisher simply poured in more passion, time and money into their work... as well as actually consulting with martial arts pros and experts. As the movement and combat styles seem way more organic, dynamic, fluid and at least something that seems actually reminiscent of some sorts of martial arts.

What the devs should imho do is forget about many of the simply cheesy and awful cosmetics, costumes, DLC's and soundtrack and actually try some sort of modernized remaster, or better an entire, low-poly overhaul but based on Tekken 3 and in obvious high-res... obviously that wish or thought is somewhat ridiculous, but yea. It's what they should actually do, imho. And simply bash out the best modern fighting game to date. In T3's lowpoly heritage, but modernized style!

Tekken 3 was an absolute blast. And I don't mean to offend; But objectively, artistically and most importantly: from a gameplay, style, vibe and fun perspective - these new releases are merely a mediocre and pale shadow of what once was: I should grab my old PSX from the cellar or check on an emu and fire up T3. Maybe you should too - Especially if you never have... before. :) Even it's soundtrack is literally better than the entirety of this modern game.",1702253605,1702254556,False,0,0,0.463985860347747803,0,True,False,False

[h1]IGNORE TEKKEN 7[/h1]


[h2]A truly great fighting game, a travesty compared to the past TEKKEN games[/h2]

This needs some explanation.
When it comes to battle mechanics and the gameplay, TEKKEN 7 appears extraordinary. The battle system is incredibly fun and the amount of customization it gives you, while not Soul Calibur levels of amazing, is pretty varied. However, the game has miserable amounts of in-game content due to its esports influences.

Ever since TEKKEN 3, the games of this series were loaded with tons of extra content; with Tekken Force, Tekken Ball, Tekken Bowl and Devil Within to name a few. But for some reason, which is what speculate to be more focus on esports, TEKKEN 7 has the most miserable amount of content in the history of the series and not only that, it downgrades the other modes it already has in favor of a disappointing story mode.

[h2]We really don't need a Mortal Kombat-esque story mode in all of our fighting games[/h2]

When Mortal Kombat 9 came out, everyone was mesmerized by its story mode and how well it narrated the story. That game managed to pull such a feat off with its vast amount of lore and the well-established history of the series. But it seems like everyone started to take wrong lessons from it. All of a sudden, everyone roared for story modes in fighting games and companies became desperate to put them in their games, no matter the cost. And this caused huge issues.

The thing is, not every game needs a story mode to be enjoyable. And adding a proper story mode to a fighting game, and one that never had such a mode, would take a lot of preparation. For example, TEKKEN and Street Fighter both have a story, but that story was told through arcade modes and opening/ending animations. SF6 did the transition well by the means of a custom character. And TEKKEN... well... it's not very good. Because not only the storyline feels uninteresting as a whole, but it also came at the cost of other modes of the game being lackluster.

[h2]How can a game released in ARCADES have such a miserable arcade mode?[/h2]

I don't know about you, but having 4-5 fights and then ending the whole thing without a cinematic or even a single picture, doesn't make for a good arcade mode. And don't get me started on the Character Episodes where the devs take the goofy, yet fun endings of the past TEKKEN games and turn it into pure cringe.

TEKKEN 7 has a big focus on appealing to the masses and online warriors and in doing so, has stopped being like what its predecessors were. Not only the arcade mode is heavily nerfed for a game that premiered on the arcades, none of the past modes return except for Treasure Battle and Tekken Bowl which the latter is locked behind a paywall. This means TEKKEN 7 is an online experience which is to the benefit of the publisher as they went on with tournaments, but doesn't help the casual audience; as they no longer have a simple way to pass time or train with the AI, will get demolished by experienced online players, and the game by itself will have no significant value when it's abandoned.


[h2]TL;DR[/h2]
TEKKEN 7 is a great fighting game, yet a miserable TEKKEN. It ditches & downgrades the series' iconic modes in favor of online and story modes, making for an inferior experience compared to past games.",1592914624,1702127770,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Harada and Murray have no respect for the players or the game's integrity as a competitive fighter. Thats why they released Leroy and Fahk purposefully overpowered, why they made Zafina an auto win button, why they overbuffed Kunimitsu into being the perfect character.

Also balance aside, this game is unfun as fuck. Heavily mix up focused and the nonsensical ""just hold back"" idea Tekken players tried to push for a while back is utter bullshit, you NEED to learn how to side step every character to avoid safe low and mid poke spam or worse yet launching and knockdown mix ups like Kazuya's or Jin's.

I've played this game since it came out, I'm a pretty big fan of fighting games in general, and Tekken is the second series I attempted to be competitive in. I have 25+ years of Tekken experience, and 7 years trying to improve at being competitive.

The positives :
- Game mechanics : Rage Drive is a huge bonus to the Tekken formula. Rage Arts are cool but some get old quick.
- Impacts & hit effects are very satisfying in this game with shaky camera effects and great animations overall (despite some old Tekken 1-4 animations that would need to be updated)
- Easy to pick up & play but takes extremely long to master (due to the sheer amount of characters & moves)
- Pretty big roster (even without the DLCs), with a lot of different fighting styles
- Player matches are super fun, very easy to get into, and is a great way to find people to play with, and improve at the game.
- Probably the best roster in the whole series, and it still stands as one of the most balanced fighting games there is (although certain DLC characters) do have some advantages.

The negatives :
- The 3d models & graphics are subpar, even for the time it came out (Feb 18, 2015 in Arcades)
- Way too many characters with all the DLCs for a one on one fighting game (to me, less is more).
- Learning to counter every character in the roster is extremely tedious.
- Online has extremely bad issues (rank savers, cheaters, desyncs and crashes mid game). They added a few frames of rollback in the 4th season but when there are cheaters around ? I don't think it matters.
- Ranked match mode is pretty much done after red ranks at this time.
- Single player content is the worst in the whole series in my opinion. Practice, Arcade, a quite boring Story mode (both the main story & the character endings which are abysmal), & maybe some snooze fest of a Tekken Bowl mode DLC that gives you a title & hit effects ? Not worth the time.

In conclusion, the excellent gameplay of Tekken 7 saves it, despite the lackluster single player modes and the
aging graphics. The animations, the new Rage mechanics, the great guest characters easily make up for this when playing online, or in Versus mode with a bunch of friends. All in all, fun times indeed.

Notes : 
*This game can be extremely frustrating if you don't know what you're losing to, and there's so much stuff to learn that it takes years to learn it (I'm still getting blown up by both Nina & Noctis players haha).
*Best advice for starting out in the game is to go to ranked match at first (mashing some buttons is always fun in Tekken) and after you get some experience and reach red ranks, you can start doing player matches.",1701787514,1701787514,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Okay so I finally (hopefully) understood TEKKEN and what it's suppose to be as a game.
TEKKEN 7 is often perceived as this intimidating super-competitive and stressful game that requires razor-sharp focus with no flaws or balancing mistakes. However, this is not entirely true. Like any other game, TEKKEN 7 has its flaws and features. The primary objective is to have fun, and you can start by selecting a main character that suits you and practicing with them.
DON'T PLAY TEKKEN TOO EMOTIONALLY to the point of not having fun because you will ruin your experience and mental health.
The whole point is to have fun and that's it. 
First you choose a main, someone who fits you personally and you like or think looks cool since practicing with your favorite character is a great way to stay motivated and make some progress. Discovering cool new things about your character that you can do, keeps it fresh along the way and helps you improve in the long run. Don't be afraid to change that character anytime you want.
However, sometimes the game can be frustrating when faced with unfair or overly punishing characters or moves. In those cases, it's essential to take a break and cool off since the whole point is to have fun.
With time and practice, you'll begin to notice the flaws in characters you previously thought were unbeatable. You'll learn new ways to counter their moves and playstyle, eventually beating them. This can be an incredibly satisfying experience that helps build up your confidence. You feel the rush, you feel like you're more capable now. The top tier pros that looked impossible to comprehend, now start to look more human. You get a feel for the game. Your first response to seeing something ""op"" or ""unfair"" is to find a way to counter it and style on the person using them. It's important to have a positive attitude and not to insult people or spam cheap moves. Remember, the objective is to have fun, not to win at all costs all the time. The game has its flaws, such as long loading times and an annoying soundtrack. However, you can always turn down the volume or play your music if that helps.

The characters have undergone changes to balance the gameplay which is great. TEKKEN 7 is the most balanced fighting game right now (not going to mention the other fighting games that are imbalanced). The story mode is easy to understand but just as most players have said. It has a cliffhanger ending which we will expect in TEKKEN 8 in the future. The gameplay and graphics of this game is top notch. In terms of controls, you can pick a peripheral you like; Keyboards, Arcade Stick, DualShock 4 and others that are supported in the game. This game is beginner friendly but the game lacks tutorial and new players will have to research to improve their play.


With the recent updates, TEKKEN 7 is still the best fighting game to grace in this generation. With graphics, controls and gameplay that the beginners and experts like.

Guest characters from other franchises make the game more interesting and fun.

Leroy is based off IP Man, Lee from Bruce Lee and Lei Wu long from Jackie Chan. Then there's the 2D characters, Akuma, Geese and Eliza. With some tweaks they could balance them better but for the most part I think they make the meta a little more interesting. Honestly Eliza is kinda lame and I wish she had a better personality and play style but Geese and Akuma are cool. There are some things I dislike about the game. Julia is the corniest character of any fighting game, they need to give her a better identity in 8 or remove her. Also there are a wide range of cheap moves that need to be tweaked. The community is also quite toxic, and i'm not referencing baggers and ki charging. Personally I don't care if people do that, grow some balls. I mean the people who cheat to keep their ranks and plugging. If your gonna be toxic, at least man up and face your defeats, don't leave it makes you look like a baby.

This game has vastly superior graphics, mechanics in the form of chains and juggles, and a decent story line. I can wholeheartedly say that this is one of the most, if not the most complex fighting game. 
All the combo mechanics flow like clockwork, and have a satisfying blow on each hit or punish. Both the community and mainstream support is growing far more than the days of old, hell, even the development of season 3 years after the original release is due to the tournament popularity. You'll find hundreds of guides and/or weird customization mods all over the place. However, in my opinion the biggest detriment to this game is its huge paywall. Even legacy characters (which were promised to be free) are [b]paid[/b] DLC.

[*]Good enough story (with a summary of all past Tekken games included to help you understand it)

This game, a staple in the fighting game community, offered a captivating journey that intrigued me far beyond my usual gaming repertoire.[/b]
[list]
[*]The first thing that struck me was the sheer visual brilliance. The character animations, detailed environments, and vibrant colors painted a mesmerizing picture, akin to watching an intricately choreographed martial arts film. Despite my limited expertise in fighting games, I found myself captivated by the stunning visual spectacle this game presented.

[*]Beyond its visual allure, Tekken 7's accessibility surprised me. As someone who doesn't often delve into complex fighting mechanics, the game's initial simplicity allowed for an easy entry. However, beneath this simplicity lies a depth that I only began to scratch the surface of during my playtime. The strategic depth of timing, combos, and character selection became apparent as I delved deeper.

[*]The character roster was another intriguing aspect. Each character felt unique, with their own storyline, moveset, and depth that added a layer of complexity and made me want to explore more. Whether I was trying out the iconic Mishima family members or the newer additions, each character felt like a journey into a different fighting style.

[*]Tekken 7's storyline, although entangled in the Mishima family saga, managed to keep me engaged despite my limited familiarity with the series. The cinematic story mode felt like stepping into an immersive narrative, even though I didn't grasp all the nuances of the lore.

[*]While my exposure to online battles was brief, the competitive spirit of the game was palpable. I could sense the thrill and challenge of facing opponents worldwide, which I imagine would offer immense satisfaction to those who invest time mastering its mechanics.

[b]In conclusion, Tekken 7 surprised me with its visual prowess, accessibility, and depth, offering a glimpse into the captivating world of fighting games. For someone like me, a casual player in this genre, it was a journey that broadened my gaming horizons and left me impressed with its intricacies. Whether you're a fighting game enthusiast or a novice like me, Tekken 7's allure is undeniable and worth exploring.[/b]",1610511004,1700797630,True,5,0,0.509766042232513428,2,True,False,False

characters that can do more then 1 power crash and have power crashes that allow for continuing the combo
let's not forget that a lot of chars have broken moves that are way to fast and barely anyone can react to them
idiotic psychotic, sadistic forcing of wasting peoples' time (my average that i calculated was 7.45s, some can go up to 13s) and you are forced to watch it, because they give the power over you to the player that won. From 4200 battle in RM i have like 2150W and I skipped every one of them, except 2 times...
The services are forwarded to Steam... so you are on the whims of steam on disconnections Steam doesn't even have their own servers (as far as i know). Still renting

Plain and simple, do not buy this unless you are fine with pathetic C+ game that is overpriced really high, still not as bad as the B-- DOA6 game that costs 300+$

Some other random stuff i can think of-
badly designed loading screen, that relies on Bink video loop time, the game cannot even keep the last stage in VRAM, it actually releases the data and reads it from the Drive again... 
no unlockable characters, I'm fine with paying for chars but not at these dumb prices

It's like a chess game, you really have to learn all basic moves, combos, punishments and defends to play this game. Because when you have decided to play the game in online mode, you'll need more stamina on your body to be prepared, it won't only make you tired by hitting buttons on your stick or d-pad, but also need to be more concentrate and use your brain before deciding to attack your opponent. One wrong step you made, then your opponent will break you down and demote your rank.
Yes, it's a little bit frustrating but also make you addicted to keep playing and trying. The graphics, the background music, and everything in this game it's almost perfect to all fighting gamers.

If rank match makes you tired, you can try other modes like treasure battle or even story mode. Treasure battle is really really fun, some other battle types such as turbo battle, double damage battle, etc. that you can't play those battle types in normal battle will make you feel relieved.
Also the story mode, I believe some of you guys will love the character of Heihachi. He taught me that as a man, we really need to have soft heart, but also hard skin. Just check it guys, I won't spoil it why Heihachi has a really father material here.

And to be fair, I really need to give my opinion to Bandai Namco about Tekken 7 save methods, I think it'll be better if rank data is saved on cloud saver than local folder. A week ago I got those bad moments when my PC shut down while playing Tekken 7, and unfortunately all my data was corrupted. I haven't backed up all my data yet, so I needed to restart everything, even my rank started on Beginner again. I hope this problem will get the best solution on next update or may be next Tekken series. So guys, if you wanna buy this game, don't forget to always back up your data every time you have done playing the game. You can always back up your saves data here:
C:\Users\User\AppData\Local\TekkenGame\Saved

This is my first game review, and my first best review I give it to this really nostalgic game, yes it is Tekken7.
My Rating: 9.5/10

However, hacking is pinching it its online battles. Many of cheaters and lazy players are there who not only plug when they are to loose but many of them use cheating tools which is still an unsolved problem even it has completed about 6 years.

Single player content, it's lacking. I'm disappointed Tekken Force doesn't make it because they are focusing on story mode and improving the fighting system from what I heard. Then again I appreciate they re-imagining T4 Honmaru battle. Watching T5 intro was epic enough, experiencing the battle itself? That was incredibly fun! For treasure battle, while it's fun getting loot, it doesn't feel as fun as ghost battle in T6. I want to change it to 3 rounds-to-win with very hard diff but apparently game setting doesn't affect it. I don't know, 2 rounds game feels too short. Arcade mode is useless and hopefully the new game mode gives some replayability.

Customization, a wasted potential. With plethora of items (and t-shirts) it doesn't have some common items. I want to customize Jin with black business suit so I can look dapper when kicking butts but nope. Shaheen has it but it seems exclusive to him? We could have uniques but for common stuff like this it shouldn't be. And they could really add extra hair styles like seriously. They are probably aiming for DLC but yeah I guess I have to wait. EDIT: Missing costume set like Asuka Dojo outfit. it's unique and defines her as the Kazama-style practicioner.


Character specific story, it's embarrassing. They could've just do it like traditional arcade mode, a set of match with some cutscenes here and there and I'll be fine with it. Instead we only have a SINGLE match. Getting ending story after trashing Jinpachi or tryharding Azazel feels way more satisfying even all I get is cheesy ending because at least I put some effort into it.

Tutorial mode. While practice mode is fleshed out, it's raw. Newbie players usually like this: Play online > get rekt > take refuge in Practice Mode > test combos against unmoving target practice or spar with overly aggressive AI > come up online again > still get rekt > quit. Tutorial mode is great for basic fundamentals like getting up from the ground, spacing, etc. It helps to make new people get better and results more players online. EDIT: [b]Record my own combo.[/b] Mortal Kombat X had it and it useful to showcase combos. [b]Option to pick last round music/stage in Practice Mode.[/b] Some of those music are really good and I want to practice in Devil's Pit infinite stage because Azure is getting boring.

Online mode
-Recent player list so if you fought with good players you can add them to practice with you.
-Replay feature. I'd like to watch my losing match so I could figure out what needs to be improved or just want to show off that one close match. Street Fighter V which also use Unreal Engine 4 has this feature so no reason for Tekken 7 to exclude this one.
-An interface that show your friends that also playing so you can invite them to 1v1 or tournament.
-EDIT: This doesn't apply only to online mode but option to remember side fight (Left/Right/Always Ask/Random). 

Gallery
While I appreciate the extensive artwork/movie gallery, there is no Tekken Music Player. Tekken 7 features double music every stage resulting in more awesome music from Namco Sound Team and yet there is no player for that. I get that we're on PC so you might suggest just turn on Youtube? Yeah, we shouldn't need 3rd party for that. But then again, I really appreciate for putting artwork from every Tekken series. I can't believe Tekken game is 20 years old and counting!

TL;DR Tekken 7 is a must-play for fighting game fans. There won't be new Tekken for at least next 5 years so play this one!",1496931327,1700654726,True,6,0,0.605657279491424561,0,True,False,False

[b]PROS[/b]
[list]
    [*]Wide characters with even wider movelists
    [*]Treasure Battle is loads of fun
    [*]Character Customization is decent
    [*]The 8 second lag present in console versions DOES NOT EXIST ON PC
    [*]Decent netcode and online presence - except torunament mode, you can easily find match on other online modes
    [*]Helpful community - places such as r/tekken and tekken federation are eager to help you
[/list]

[b]CONS[/b]
[list]
    [*]Siginificantly fewer characters than the last entry (TAG 2). Though this was done to prevent newcomers from alegedly feeling overwhelmed
    [*]Customization lacking, though there is a promise of future free dlc adding characters and customization items
    [*]Game is difficult later on in ranked matches if you refuse to learn how to [strike]git gud[/strike] play decently
    [*]Story mode is underwhelming, and doesn't actually end the Mishima saga
    [*]DLC so far has been lack lusture and apart from Eliza, not worth your moolah
    [*]Some may argue that Rage Drives and Rage Arts (basically finisher moves) do not belong in a more realistic fighter such as TEKKEN (though i disagree, it adds great challenge and blocking them us fun)
[/list]

TL;DR
Great fighting game, plenty of fun for everyone.

AUTUMN 2019: DLC Situation is still bad; they're charging for legacy characters and basic features such as frame data now. I cannot in good faith support Harada and his team anymore and this might've just been my last Tekken purchase. And that makes me sad.

AUTUMN 2023: Who am i kidding? Already pre-ordered Tekken 8 thanks to the amazing CBT.",1506276172,1700504523,True,1,1,0.53061223030090332,0,True,False,False

You have a man who has a jimmy neutron haircut and everyone takes him seriously, we havea wrestler who only communicates in growls, and the characters are the obvious standouts of the game as well as their designs. The designs for many of the characters have that magical design and personality to them that it is shame some of them are not gonna be in the base roster of the next game. Fighting itself is challenging and it really does feel like you need to learn the character thoroughly in order to succeed. What sucks about this game is the online community, I feel like this applies to any multiplayer game but I feel like most people who you find in Tekken online are complete assholes and egotistical. I just wish that there would be some sort of way to differentiate problem people in this game so that I dont have to fight with some weirdo who ki charges and tea bags. The soundtrack is electric and while some songs do blare and just become noise at some point, heat haze shadow nullifies any complaint with the soundtrack.

Pros:
Great core game mechanic
Gorgeous graphic
Unique characters with their own fighting styles. Even Mishimas have different tempo despite both having hellsweep and EWGF

Cons: 
Paid frame data display
Emphasis on close-quarter brawling means every match is solely MU quiz instead of being creative with supposed game mechanic like movements, which seems less effective in 7 compared to previous iteration of Tekken
Comeback mechanics like Rage Art and Rage Drive changes game dynamic way too much
Mostly boring and terrible OST
Mostly boring stages
Huge lack of single play experience
Story mode is laughably bad
Individual character stories are disjointed or complete joke
Unstable online experience


Overall: If you've been playing Tekken franchise for so long or beginner that intends to spend 10 years of your life dedicated to nothing but Tekken, then this game is definitely recommended. For casuals or people with very little time to commit towards training and learning MU painstakingly, this is not for you.",1611530760,1700012363,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

+Looks amazing. Stages, lighting, and new story cut-scenes look especially good graphically. 

+/-  The DLC characters are interesting, but y'know, ...

-Most of the new non-dlc characters are really uninteresting both in being move-set-clones and story lore wise. 

-Speaking of which, the story is really short this time too and the fights are full of cheesing there (probably to hide the cheesing already present in the normal mechanics...), but at least there are some seriously epic moments even if it is rich with spams

-The new rage art system kinda overwhelms some of the truthfully good base mechanics improvement especially with easily spammed special moves and huge dmg buffs that make fights feeling far too short and less like the long epic battles I used to have. 

-A lot of this game's download time is due to being crammed with re-releases of nearly every cut-scene from nearly every previous Tekken game. YouTube exists, so this seems like game filler to me. 

 -There's so many iconic characters missing at launch. I mean, how do you have Law but not Lei or worse yet Nina but without Anna?? They complete each other and classics should stop being behind DLC paywalls. It's frankly a bit elitist aside from being obviously greedy. 
  
     **Where is Baek or his clone character!?  I'm a Baek main out in the cold here.  Baek has been in Tekken since Tekken 2. C'mon!


-No interesting side modes.  Seriously and straight-faced tell me you like Tekken for the bowling. Smh. 

-Customization is a huge joke with very little variety being mostly, well, just a lot of joke accessory garbage and not enough to make some look-alike or highly-detailed character like you can in Bamco's Soul Calibur games. 

-The season passes are a bit over-priced for what you actually get. 

-Even the soundtrack is uninspired this time with some seriously tedious dubstep loops.


tl;dr :  not a ""terrible game"" necessarily, and sometimes down right badass even in the visuals, but as a Tekken sequel (and let's be real, fighting game sequels theses days are more like updates) and for a game so pro-esports and mainstream, it's terribly unbalanced and over-hyped",1496394573,1699783767,False,7,1,0.560322165489196777,0,True,False,False

I can play Tekken for hours and never really get bored since the online features provide lots of replay value.

My only two complaints are:
- The offline content could be better, like Tekken 6's scenario campaign. 
- The loading times are insanely long, even if you're quick matching/rematching someone in a lobby.

Overall, Tekken 7 is a solid addition to the Tekken series and whilst it is a difficult game to pick up, once you learn the mechanics, it is so enjoyable.",1699452771,1699452771,True,2,0,0.519685029983520508,0,True,False,False

PC port sucks, will crash on alt-tab consistently. Frame drops on either side lead to bad lag spikes during online matches.

Online is bad: long queue times, filters often ignored, bad connections, no hardware display for the opponent. Also de-syncs are pretty common where the match will have to be cancelled after a few minutes.

Generally overpowered DLC: this speaks for itself at this point. Balance is pretty poor in general.

All fundamental aspects of Tekken are worse than in past entries. High combo damage, low punishment damage, bloated movelists, and bad movement. The game is very scrubby at most levels of play due to this.

Customization is somehow significantly worse than Tag 2, the previous entry. Outfits and clothing pieces don't fit the character properly, and often clip through the model or the character or other clothing pieces.

Paid frame data. Lol.


If you want a decent Tekken experience, emulate a past entry like Tag 2 or Tekken 6, or wait for Tekken 8, which will hopefully be good, but given the Tekken Team's decision making skills I don't count on it.",1699219714,1699219714,False,11,3,0.549130260944366455,0,True,False,False

1. Story Mode is enough for you as an Offline content. Though story is somewhat boring it is better to just skip to fights.
2. You are a veteran.
3. You are okay with paid Frame Data,DLC Characters(lot of which appeared in previous title).
4. You are willing to spend a lot of time in practice mode to lab characters if you want to win due to too many moves or strings to remember, some mids looking like lows,some lows looking like mids and some highs looking like mids etc. 500hrs(including AFK,430 with ingame timer) you see here is nothing,if this is your first proper Tekken or FG in general,like is the case for me.

Anyways as of now, there are not a lot of players online so chances are you would be pitted against same players over and over again. So where's the variety of fighting different people? Waiting time more than 3 minutes if you set connection to be +3 bar, lots of smurfs or veterans or alternate characters on low ranks. Though latter could be fixed if you were ranked up globally. Edit: Also expect lag switchers,overlay,auto blockers,auto punish,speed boost and outside macro users in ranked mode. And there being no ingame tool to blacklist such players from being matched(if the game can use ML algorithm to detect those with high efficiency,it should give us an option to blacklist them,else don't because it can be abused to duck matches otherwise, or save replay with similar lag levels so that it can be reported to devs later but none of that).

If you are a new player at this point of time you might get beat a lot since you might be playing with experienced players.  

Then if you search up for Tournaments,it is empty most of the times and when searching for lobby matches expect players who create public lobbies who kick you for no reason as if private lobbies aren't a thing. Toxicity also exceeds to where someone will trash talk you after you win or lose when they play some execution heavy characters.

Offline doesn't have much content apart from arcade(which has very few fights),story mode and treasure battle, customization seems to be lacking compared to previous titles.",1689051254,1697214267,False,3,0,0.549763858318328857,0,True,False,False

I really enjoy the ability to customize characters and the return of some of the previous game's characters. While some characters require purchasing, there are plenty of characters to start with, so it's not a major issue. The graphics are stunning and the combos are impressive. 

‚ô° The graphics, maps, and music of this slightly older game are impressive. However, it requires a considerable amount of computer power, so it's advisable to have a decent computer or to play it on a console that can handle it. If you want to play with friends, you can use remote play, or play online or alone locally. The game offers great options, and the storyline is also interesting.

‚ô° The character selection for customization is excellent, and I've always been impressed by Tekken games. However, the price is a bit high, so I recommend waiting for a sale, especially since a new version is coming out. The only downside I've noticed is the inclusion of Rage Arts, but it seems to be a common feature in newer fighting games.",1647780227,1696234071,True,6,0,0.540632784366607666,0,True,False,False

My first experience was Tekken 6 on PSP when I was still little and I loved it just for the variety of characters as well as for it's atmosphere. I was unable to figure out the inputs for the harder moves and throws, but I still loved it and to be honest it was my only exposure to fighting games till teenage years anyway. I also got to experience Tekken 5 on PSP as well as my friend gifted if to me, those were really fun times. 

Now in my late teens after having tried multiple 2D fighting games like Guilty Gear and Skullgirls and whatnot I once again set my eyes on Tekken. I was mildly aware of there being a sequel, but I couldn't have possibly imagined it had a full-blown huge multiplayer scene now as well as a continuation to the awesome glimpse of a story I witnessed in TK5 and 6. 

After like 400 hours I can definitely say that this is the fighting game that I have sunk the most hours of my life into and although I still suck and it can sometimes make me rage I still love it as that same bizarre fighting game with bears, space samurais and weird-hair guys from my childhood. TK7 is much more fleshed out than it's predecessors in gameplay sense and although it puts much less focus to individual characters' stories which makes me sad - it still mostly maintains it's identity and I'm very excited to see what Tekken 8 brings. I can definitely call myself a Tekken fan now.",1696113152,1696113152,True,1,0,0.507042229175567627,1,True,False,False

One broken controller and 34 hours later and I'm well-versed in the hieroglyphics-like language of Tekken jargon and combos, tens of wins in and I'm addicted to the game with a feeling  of accomplishment and steady improvement. 

The single-player is barely existent and this now 8 year old game is due to be replaced by is sequel in January but the online is still very populated and learning resources are plentiful. Great music, perfect gameplay, decent net code and well-aged graphics amount to what is my current favourite fighting game, even as other series have already upgraded.

The learning curve is more of a learning spike, losing can be infuriating and disheartening, wins sometimes feel more fluke than skill and you will learn to hate seeing certain characters and moves but persevere and I guarantee you will learn to love this unforgiving beast.",1695965373,1695965373,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my son many happy memories.

I Love making videos about this game and this franchise.
I even like the community.

I think some people take this game way too seriously though. I don't mind getting beat by someone much better than me every now and then, a fight is a fight, you win some you lose some, but sometimes you run into a player that will hunt you down just to curse you out over a match, or they'll force advice on you and call it ""criticism"" when it's really another way of saying ""this is why I'm better than you."" It's this kind of interaction with the community that makes Tekken not so fun.

Aside from the downsides, I have a lot of fun with Tekken.
Tekken's my favorite franchise. I will continue to support it.

The game is fun, graphics are nice, story is kind of boring but they kept individual character campaigns which are a treat. they still have customisation for each character and its actually more simple than in the old games. Decent game, will revisit it from time to time untill tekken 8 is out. i just wish you could unlock some characters without paying for them but its a frequent trend in fighting games these days so i guess i dont mind. if i was an active tekken player i would buy them but for now i see no need. so i cannot really comment on any paid content",1692581020,1693236623,True,2,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False

Intermediate Level as well (Emperor to Tekken God Omega level). Played competitively since 2019 and returned to the game in 2021 after I finally got a PC of my own. Characters I play are Lars, Dragunov and Kazumi

This game is not Tekken nor is it even a 3D Fighting game, its a 2.5D game and its barely that. Anyways, lets get to the reasons as to why this game sucks:

- Extreme balancing issues (particularly since Season 3)
- Hoards of incredibly frustrating and noob friendly mechanics (Rage Art, Rage Drive, Power Crush etc.)
- Movement being terrible (already explained above prior to listing my cons with this stupidly retarded ungodly game) 
- Not being able to practice against DLC characters in Practice Mode which consequentially brings me to...
- DLC characters being hyper carry machines getting people to the Intermediate ranks with zero effort, knowledge or experience required
- Hitboxes being atrociously large enforcing buttons over movement (counter intuitive to what Tekken has been known for, even those outside of the Tekken sphere)
- Moves with ridiculously disgusting properties (e.g. Paul df2, safe on block, high crush)
*Imagine removing Lars' old T6/TTT2 style df2 (the fcdf2 in Tekken 7 does not count) only to add moves that are even better than Lars' df2 across the board, with even better risk reward ratio in  a game where safety is priority
- Ridiculous strings, everything jails
- Every move is literally a homing move
- All the characters have hyper wall-carry when it used to be confined to a few characters (Nina, Bryan, Lars, Lee, Dragunov and Kazumi) to name a few, and wall-carry with damage combined is confined to even fewer characters
- Due to movement being bad and everything being tracking, ""big plays""(enforcing 50/50's, mixups, and generally chunky attacks that skips neutral) are enforced rather than intricate mindgames and movement 
- Terrible Netcode, ""5 bars"" is inconsistent and ""4 bars"" is unplayable
- Panic moves with skewed risk/reward ratio that are also horrendously difficult to punish (e.g. Devil Jin uf4, Lars uf3)
- The oversimplification and overhomogenization of characters due to bad balancing
- Ridiculous favoritism towards certain characters in terms of balacing (e.g. Bryan, Mishimas, Feng, Waifus etc.)

Don't play this game if you're even decent, go play T5,T6, TTT2 or even T7 Vanilla if you want to still play T7",1674136246,1693129607,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[*]there are no substantial single player modes and content
[*]customization is bad
[*]graphics, character models are bad
[*]paid frame data

[*]netcode is garbage
[*]when you alt+tab in this game you are basically playing roulette

[*]game has one of the best animations i've seen in FGs, many characters are using real life martial arts
[*]OST in t7 is good most of the time (but t5 one is unbeatable)
[*]community has some weirdos, but overall i can't say it's that bad. There are a lot of people who are really passionate about this game and franchise (me included)

Since Tekken 7 as been out I kinda lost my love for it I been playing tekken basically all my live sine my dad put me onto it when the first tekken came out. before it was a game base on skill and if you didnt like something or wouldn't win then you was force to over come and figure it out. that's not the case now as the creators is clearly doing what everyone else is doing and that is just focusing on the money. Not only that they let the offend me movement/Cancel culture come into play here, but they really lost me when they started nerfing or basically killing characters just to please the general public instead of standing on something. Last I hate how they did the 2 new characters Leroy and Fahkumram as I felt like nothing was wrong with them when they first came out. leroy is basically old character Wang and Fahkumram is Bruce, when they first came out i had now issues beating them after i figured out some of the moves but the public didn't feel the same as they was mad to many folks was using when they launched and then because that couldn't just shit on a character that they knew nothing about. basically didnt even give them a chance and tekken not wanting to lose money nerf the balls of em. I'm just going to end it with this... folks was saying and looking for anything and everything to discredited the 2 characters from to much range, to looks, and even to its not really fighting (as if they ass ever even been in a fist fight...) but when your saying and looking for things like that you lose credibility because that's something else... I'm sorry but I can't also cant help but see that theirs was 2 new characters that came after them and they was clearly more OP then both and no one said anything in fact the public loved them.... Deep down I know why and many other like me do to, Leroy and fahkumram share one similarity..... that's all i'm going to say for now but I'm very disappointed.",1623174827,1691554779,False,0,0,0.476651787757873535,1,True,False,False

I'd start off by saying that I don't touch the online portion of Tekken 7  much because I'm not that good at this game (yet?) especially with the movement (backdash/wavedash) and I'm trying to learn this game again with stick just to see how far I can get with it, I don't enjoy whiffing and getting juggled to oblivion.

I played this the boys and it was a ton of fun. This game also has Tekken Bowling but I don't have it. There are also crossover characters: Akuma, Geese Howard, Noctis from FFXV and Negan from TWD, I don't have them either, except Akuma. Because of this sometimes it would feel like you're playing a different game but personally I don't mind--except Noctis, fuck Noctis and I really like the new Tekken characters, especially Lidia. Now onto things I don't like about this game. The customization leaves a lot to be desired, there's a lot of t-shirt just with different prints and the prints are not unique to each character, each of them has the same t-shirt. The DLC characters never got character story in story mode (probably because people didn't care much about it but cmon it's new characters!), I learned of this when I bought Lidia. The frame data, which should be free, especially in a fighting game is a DLC here, unless you get an edition that comes with it, I didn't. Personally I would have liked it if we could at least grind for some of the characters to unlock them similar to SFV but that's probably just me. 

[h1] PROS [/h1]
+ Different Play Modes (Story, Arcade, Treasure Battle, Online, etc.).
+ Guest characters (Akuma, Geese Howard, Noctis Lucis Caelum and Negan).
+ New Tekken characters (Lidia being my favorite).

[h1] CONS [/h1]
*UPDATE* - requires 80GB of storage, meanwhile SF6 only requires 60 GB storage
- Customization leaves a lot to be desired (T-shirt galore).
- DLC characters have no character story in story mode.
-- Frame Data is a DLC (unless you get an edition that comes with it).

7/10. Buy if you like Tekken, but won't change your mind if you don't.
Warning: online is slowly dying, so only get on sale or wait for Tekken 8.
I've played 643.9 hours at this point and I'm in the Red ranks, so I don't know tournament or expert play that well.
## Pros ##
- Regular patches have generally been pretty good at balancing the game
- Large diversity of characters means there is probably a character with moves to suit you
- There's always more to learn, which I find fun
- Legacy players are rewarded
## Neutral ##
- For a 2017 game, environments look good but faces and expression could be alot better so overall graphics are okay
- Decent music, could be more diverse and distinctive but the vibe is basically RAVE RAVE RAVE which is fine
- I overall have a meh opinion on stages. There's few are distinctive and functional stages (examples: Vermillion Gates and Souj) and a few that are too distracting and busy (example: Arena and Mishima Building). Most are just meh though. Generally designs are limited to infinite (no walls) or small (many walls) or 2 small stages between one balcony break with the odd exception. This is serviceable to play but not very diverse.
## Cons ##
In order:
- Netcode is slow - be prepared to wait
- Punishments for pluggers are too arbitrary (hitting legit players) and are generally ineffective
- Lack of modes. Bring back Team Battle!
- Lack of fresh features to fights. Rage Arts and Rage Drive do add something but everything else we've seen before.
- Some DLC should clearly be included in the base game like paying extra for legacy characters and paying for offline only stages. Also Tekken Bowl sucks (3/5 on the scumometer)
- Round breaking weird glitches at the wall
- Hard for beginners e.g. no tutorial, AI is trash so you can't really get a good start offline
- Story mode is TERRIBLE - short (around 4 hours), bad story, bad AI, predictable. Again, hard for beginners.",1691242101,1691242101,True,0,0,0,1,True,False,False

So close they actually on top of each other. Its very intimate....

Anyhow, the number of combo choices for each character in this game is greater than the price to buy nootropics that you'll definitely need just to process how to do the 99th combo for the first character choice. Between playing this game or a gun I recommend I go see a psychiatrist or brain surgeon before recommending anything for the next few years to come.

My professional tip to you is button mash until your keyboard breaks from the shock wave caused by your muscular fingers after spending 900 hours perfecting great art of who knows what u were doing while looking at those street fighter 6 female characters designs. I know Vergil doesn't approve it.

It's extremely different from Street Fighter, Guilty Gear, Dragon Ball FighterZ, or any other 2D fighter you can name. The pacing is more deliberate, the mechanics reward thoughtfulness and knowledge in a way that other games can't match, and there's a definite feeling of reward when you learn to master even basic skills like whiff and block punishing, which are virtually required for solid technique. The game isn't easy, but when you start to get a feel for the movement, the 3D environment, and the way combos string together, it becomes very addicting.

But try taking that online on the PC and you're bound to run into a lot of frustrating experiences, including smurfing, save data hacking (which allows higher ranked players to stay in lower ranks and grief opponents), mid-match disconnects, actual macro cheating that the developers have done almost nothing to stop (instant low guard, instant low parry, flawless counter-hits, macros in general, overlays that provide frame data, etc.) and some of the cheesiest cheese you're bound to see in any fighting game anywhere. The latter is a problem in a lot of fighting games and arguably a hurdle you have to surmount no matter what game you're playing. But the cheese options in Tekken 7 make SF6 Blanka look like 19th century poetry. New to the game? It's extremely likely some characters can beat you with just two moves. Not joking. Taht stuff is punishable, but do you want to spend your time memorizing frame data for one character's moveset when every character in the game has 60+ moves? And don't count on getting a rematch if you figure someone out. The second you bust up their goofy strings, they bail. It's not much fun.

Even if there were no cheese or cheating, good luck finding a competitive match in the low ranks right now because if you don't fight a smurf with years of experience, you're likely to fight someone who will pull the plug on their Internet connection the moment they start losing. Even in higher ranks, there's an awful lot of toxicity. 

Other games have these problems too, at least to some extent, but in Tekken 7 on the PC... it sticks out like a gigantic sore thumb.",1690039517,1690039517,False,67,8,0.742771565914154053,0,True,False,False

Those testimonies are a mixture of both unrequited love and seething hatred. Tekken 7 has been a different game at different stages in its' development just as we are different people at various points in our lives! Anyway,here's a review from a total scrub whom likes fighters but doesn't pursue them as an e-sport career choice!

I'll level, I'm not a fan of the current business model when it comes to fighting games. You put down money for the core foundation and then season passes get released adding characters,modes,and outfits. In my day there was no way for a game to receive internet updates so it came to us in a much more complete state. ""Extra content"" was unlocked
merely by meeting certain requirements whilst playing. While certain fighters did have those annoying ""super turbo alpha editions"" releases a few months to a year later the price was quickly reduced because the devs and corpos knew they had to throw us a complimentary bone for buying the previous iterations. It was still a bit shady and a bit anti-consumer but compared to how things are now I wish we could jump into a time-machine and travel back to the friggin 90's!

Having gotten that off my chest,Bandai Namco make great fighting games. At the very least if you can weather the storm and wait until the penultimate definitive version drops then goes on sale you are in for a very good time. I did that previously with Soul Calibur 6 and it is one of the rare gems that stayed on my pc consistently after I downloaded it. I've put around 33+ hours into that tale of souls and swords without being a super competitive ""FGC"" champion.

Tekken 7 Definitive edition will offer you the following.....

+An enormous  roster. Many old favorites and many brand new faces. You will not be left wanting when it comes to variety.

+A beautiful presentation. Characters look great,backgrounds look great,""everything"" looks great. 

+ The fighting game mechanics are easy to understand. You do not have to feel intimidated. The tutorials and even the story mode lay it all out in simple terms. However, though Tekken is noob friendly it is still a momentous task to master. Be aware of that before choosing a higher difficulty or going online.

+Guest characters play just like they do in their respective franchises. I was pleasantly surprised by that after taking Akuma for a spin. 

+By the way, I thought the plot and narrative were presented better than certain people give them credit for. If you like cyberpunk,mysterious shadowy organizations,scary Japanese folk-lore,supernatural shenanigans,messed up family dramas,and epic biblical revelations tier end-of-the world scenarios Tekken 7 certainly goes hard...

+Treasure mode is my jam. Earning in game gold to unlock a wealth of extra content has always appealed to my inner dragon. (Get it? Dragons like hoards of plundered riches!)

+Most of the men are masculine. Most of the women are feminine. There's also diverse representation without sycophantic pointless pandering. Sexy and cool looking outfits can be unlocked for both genders. And you know what? No normal people in any demographic have a beef with this. (Perfectly balanced as all things should be!) 

+There are certain sequences in story mode where you can mow down incoming baddies with actual guns. No joke! (America,frick yeah!)

+Narcoleptic sleepy goth vampire girl ended up being more endearing than I thought she would be!

+You have your throws,reversals,high jabs,low jabs,high kicks,low kicks,mid attacks,juggles,pins,side-steps,holds,grapples,and near-death desperation specials.  Despite Tekken being equal parts ""SCP"",robot-wars,horror themed family soap opera,bear-brawling,and monster-mash the moment to moment fisticuffs are grounded in realistic martial arts fundamentals. (Er,mostly!)

+One of the better Tekken soundtracks to date. Props to the composers! 

Gripes

-Julia Chang has become a youtuber. (Like and subscribe!) Why? Wasn't she originally a humble ecologist outdoors tom-boy type?

-Kazumi is gonna knock you out! Kazumi gonna scream and shout! Kazumi gonna let her tiger roam about!
 
-""Bro,that's not my final devil form! ""This"" is! Peeeeeeeeeeeew!""

-Tekken bowling? (Suppresses Iori-like maniacal laughter) Alright I'll level,it's ""kinda"" fun! But y'know,we could have gotten a refined ""beat em up mode"" similar to the one in Tekken 6 with more polish! Yeah,that would have been swell.

-No tag-team mode. I realize this isn't a Tekken-Tag entry but it would have been so easy to include. I briefly played the tag-mode in DOA 5 and it was a delight. Shame something similar is missing here.

-Story mode despite its' high production values is ""short"". Enjoyable but short. Additionally not every character got a fleshed out prologue/epilogue. I feel as if previous Tekken games handled this better. The Mishima saga stuff has top tier production values and visual spectacle in spades but the ball was dropped elsewhere. I compare all this to an entertaining block-buster movie you see with your friends. Fun was had by all but if you take a moment to  think about it ""honestly"" the presentation was much better than the overall plot and the character development.

-Certain outfits cost ""a lot of money"" when in comparison to others without rhyme or reason.

-Negan. Negan?! He fits well enough into Tekken's war-torn world whilst simultaneously sticking out like a sore thumb. Was there that much overlap between fighting fans and Walking Dead fans? You have to admit,Negan is an odd inclusion. I mean we could have had Mai Shiranui,Jun,Jinpachi,Iori Yagami,Cammy White,Chun Li,Terry Bogard,or ""anyone else"" instead....

(Glad they at least put in Armor-King. I thought he was left out but then realized he made the cut!)

Neutral

+/- ""Smurfing"" in the competitive online circuit. That's when someone logs out at the cusp of defeat so they don't drop in their ranking. To some folks that is going to be infuriating.

However, if you enjoy fighters non-competitively and would not be caught dead at an EVO event even if someone paid you then it's not an issue.

To me ""rank and trophies"" only mean something if you train at the gym and win in a ""real"" martial arts tournament. That takes dedication and skill. Not just of mind but of body and spirit too.

When I play a fighting game it is just a hobby. It's escapism. Its' letting my inner child let off some steam so I can better cope with the harshness of the real world. It is something I do but it does not define my value. As such I do not take it seriously!

Brief summary of my history with Tekken

Played every entry starting with 2 onward. Yes, I even remember when Bonk was an unlockable character! (The little orange dinosaur!) 

My favorite entry ever was Tekken 5. 4 and 6 were alright but presented new fledgling ideas in awkward ways that were hit or miss. (2,Tag,and 3 were also pinnacles of the series at its' best.)

So far for me Tekken 7 Definitive edition is almost tied with Tekken 5. It is certainly better in most ways compared to 4 and 6.

PS: Love what you do Bandai/Namco! Word of advice. Don't update your games years later with unnecessary censorship just to appeal to ""The modern audience"". The blood in the water you are now seeing is from new Skull-Girls devs clowning around doing just that.

if you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding Chilli con carne recipe you've come to the right place,

Ingredients

1 large onion
1 red pepper
2 garlic cloves
1 tbsp oil
1 heaped tsp hot chilli powder (or 1 level tbsp if you only have mild)

1 tsp paprika
1 tsp ground cumin
500g lean minced beef
1 beef stock cube
400g can chopped tomatoes
¬Ω tsp dried marjoram
1 tsp sugar (or add a thumbnail-sized piece of dark chocolate along with the beans instead, see tip)

2 tbsp tomato pur√©e
410g can red kidney beans
plain boiled long grain rice, to serve
soured cream, to serve

Directions

STEP 1
Prepare your vegetables. Chop 1 large onion into small dice, about 5mm square. The easiest way to do this is to cut the onion in half from root to tip, peel it and slice each half into thick matchsticks lengthways, not quite cutting all the way to the root end so they are still held together. Slice across the matchsticks into neat dice.

STEP 2
Cut 1 red pepper in half lengthways, remove stalk and wash the seeds away, then chop. Peel and finely chop 2 garlic cloves.

STEP 3
Start cooking. Put your pan on the hob over a medium heat. Add 1 tbsp oil and leave it for 1-2 minutes until hot (a little longer for an electric hob).

STEP 4
Add the onion and cook, stirring fairly frequently, for about 5 minutes, or until the onion is soft, squidgy and slightly translucent.

STEP 5
Tip in the garlic, red pepper, 1 heaped tsp hot chilli powder or 1 level tbsp mild chilli powder, 1 tsp paprika and 1 tsp ground cumin.

STEP 6
Give it a good stir, then leave it to cook for another 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.

STEP 7
Brown 500g lean minced beef. Turn the heat up a bit, add the meat to the pan and break it up with your spoon or spatula. The mix should sizzle a bit when you add the mince.

STEP 8
Keep stirring and prodding for at least 5 minutes, until all the mince is in uniform, mince-sized lumps and there are no more pink bits. Make sure you keep the heat hot enough for the meat to fry and become brown, rather than just stew.

STEP 9
Make the sauce. Crumble 1 beef stock cube into 300ml hot water. Pour this into the pan with the mince mixture.

But how the heck did Bandai Namco manage to devolve this thing? First of all, the character roster is fine albeit having some weird guest appearances here like frickin Negan from The Walking Dead. 

But the real problem lies within the moveset, I swear the Rage Art is too OP and feels like a cheap way to win against opponents, and I think it should be removed from future games. Another thing would be that most of the characters, specifically the newer ones like Negan, Kunimitsu II, Akuma and especially Leroy (and good God so much more) have such braindead, button-mashy movesets that requires no effort to pull off ridiculous combos, and it just feels so unfair because it does not feel earned to be able to do these moves for someone that can't even perform a 10 hit combo like myself. I feel like there should be some changes to how these characters perform their attacks, perhaps make it harder? or more varied? like come on Kunimitsu can initiate a 5 to 6 hit combo for just spamming Triangle for crying out loud, and it ends with enemy faceplanting making them vulnerable to another barrage of unfair attacks.

And I haven't even started on Leroy! I read somewhere a dude won a tournament despite only using Leroy for a week... A WEEK.

Next, the story. Now the main story is fine, I don't keep up much with Tekken lore but form what I saw, it's fine. But what is with the story mode for the other characters? Why is it only limited to a few characters? In past games, every character had a story mode, complete with a prologue and an epilogue, but now we just get a few of them. 

Next is online... don't. 

Lastly, the customization. What the hell happened here? Why is it so limited? most of the clothes suck and you can't really make anything wacky or outstanding with them. I don't know man, it just doesn't have the same freedom that we used to get in older entries of the series.

The only reason I will ever tell someone to get this is that it's kinda fun to play with your friends at home. At full price, it's just not worth it. Get it on sale. Or just wait for Tekken 8, hopefully it's good.",1689165287,1689165287,False,1,0,0.516778528690338135,1,True,False,False

With the recent announcement of Tekken 8, the hype train for the franchise‚Äôs upcoming installment has been kicked into high gear. Although Tekken 8 deserves all the hype that it‚Äôs getting, maybe it‚Äôs also time we took a look back at Tekken 7 and asked ourselves, ‚ÄúHow good was it?‚Äù

In this review, we‚Äôll be taking a look at all the changes that Tekken 7 has undergone throughout its lifespan and see whether or not it‚Äôs still worth getting in 2023. I‚Äôve been playing Tekken since year 1, so rest assured I‚Äôll be providing an unbiased and highly critical review of the game that will highlight all the pros and cons.

[h1]About Tekken 7[/h1]

Originally released in February 2015, Tekken 7 is the latest installment in the highly acclaimed Tekken franchise by Bandai Namco. Tekken 7 is a 3D fighting game that puts a high emphasis on character movement and character knowledge, emphasizing the unique characteristics of each fighter (and surprise, 2 bears).

This release features a long-awaited crossover in the form of Street Fighter‚Äôs own raging demon: Akuma. Of course, this has raised everyone‚Äôs hopes for the long-awaited Tekken x Street Fighter, but it seems this is the closest we‚Äôre getting to that dream.

Regardless, Tekken 7 stands as one of the best selling entries into the franchise with over 9 million sales, and only 2 million of those sales coming in 2021 alone. The game is still going strong following the latest update (version 5.00) released in August 2022, which introduced a new wall combo mechanic and tons of balance changes to go along with it.

So now the question is: Should you join the 5,000 players still playing the game?

[h1]Tekken 7 Story[/h1]

Following where Tekken 6 left off, Jin Kazama started a global conflict in order to summon and ultimately defeat the origin of the devil gene, hoping to finally rid himself of this genetic curse. Unfortunately, as with every other attempt to eliminate the devil gene, this plan failed  leaving Jin Kazama exhausted and on the sidelines.

Tekken 7 follows the lives of the present-day Mishima family through the eyes of a third-person character, simply named ‚ÄúThe Journalist‚Äù. It follows the father-son relationship of Heihachi Mishima and Kazuya Mishima and the origin of their grudge against each other.

Tekken 7‚Äôs main story mode is entertaining but leaves a lot to be desired. The flow of events and motivations for each character is unorganized and often confusing. The story is made even more confusing by adding the element of The Journalist‚Äôs personal story, something that I‚Äôm sure most fans (including myself) have no interest in at all. I mean, who cares about a random journalist when there are a bunch of martial artists fighting around the world?

Although the Mishima bloodline story is very interesting, part of me wishes that they also emphasized the other characters‚Äô stories. Out of the 51 characters in Tekken 7‚Äôs final roster, only 10 are featured in the main campaign.

The Mishima bloodline elements of the story were still very entertaining and worth playing through, but please just trim off all the fat and just give us the characters that we‚Äôre already familiar with. We just want to see muscular fighters punching each other!
 
[h1]Tekken 7 Gameplay[/h1]

Tekken 7‚Äôs online mode features both unranked and ranked matches that test your skills against an opponent from anywhere in the world. The offline mode features just as much satisfaction, featuring the Treasure Battle mode, which pits you against CPU opponents that reward you cosmetics or in-game currency on a defeat.

Each player plays a different version of their character, both technically and aesthetically. Tekken 7 offers a robust customization mode featuring unique cosmetics across all characters to ensure that your character looks the way that you want them to look. Want your character to look like Link from The Legend of Zelda? You can! Want to bring a gun to a fistfight? Go right ahead!

The only thing missing would be a proper tutorial mode. Any random player could pick up Tekken 7 with absolutely no experience with the past Tekken games and still have a blast, and that entertainment will only get better as their knowledge of character moves increases. It just so happens that in order to increase your character knowledge, you have to reach out to 3rd party sources to fully interpret all the tools that your character has.
 
[h1]Tekken 7 Combat[/h1]

Tekken 7 is a 3D fighting game, which means, unlike games like Street Fighter or Mortal Kombat, you can move around the foreground and background. Tekken 7 also offers a satisfying combo system that rewards technical skill with flashy combos. That said, the move list for each character can be quite lengthy and overwhelming especially for new players.

Learning a character involves knowing the punishes, pokes, and combos of each character. Once you‚Äôve got the knowledge, next comes the application. Put your knowledge to the test to poke and punish your way to victory!
 
[h1]Tekken 7 Quest/Mission System[/h1]

To be the best, just like in everything, you have to be willing to put in the work. Grind your way to the very top of the rank mountain, all the way from the ‚ÄúBeginner‚Äù rank to Tekken God Omega by stomping on anyone that dares stand in your way. No one likes getting steamrolled online, especially in Tekken. With the high skill ceiling, it‚Äôs easy to feel helpless during a match. Thankfully, Bandai Namco‚Äôs ranking system makes sure that you‚Äôre matched with a player who is on your skill level.

[h1]Tekken 7 Graphics[/h1]

Tekken 7 is the first entry in the franchise to be created in Unreal Engine 4, and the graphics live up to the name. Character models look the best that they have ever been, even featuring cool little details like fabric simulations and costumes that change throughout the fight. But characters aren‚Äôt the only thing you‚Äôll be feasting your eyes on: there are also the beautiful stages to fight on. Mishima Dojo remains a personal favorite because of the progressive damage the stage undergoes throughout the battle.

[h1]Tekken 7 Developer[/h1]

Bandai Namco first announced the development of Tekken 7 at EVO 2014, and the game has been taken care of ever since. Bandai Namco is also famous for games such as the Naruto fighting games, Ace Combat, and Soul Calibur. Bandai Namco, or Bamco for short, has rolled out tons of additional content to increase the longevity of the game in the form of new characters, stages, and game modes. Although all that extra content does come at a price, the free balance updates are amazing enough on their own. Fair warning though, if you plan on getting Tekken 7 right now, prepare for a lack of updates in the future. It seems that while Tekken 7 has gone strong for multiple years since release, its life as the main focus of Bamco‚Äôs development team could be coming to an end.

[h1]Tekken 7 Price[/h1]

Tekken 7 base game without all the DLC costs $25, while the Definitive Edition will cost you around $72 for Steam, Xbox, and PS4. Personally? I would go with Tekken 7 base game and just buy the DLC characters and stages that interest me. This is ideal because some Tekken 7 characters on release are broken and overpowered, making the game pay to win for a while. Fortunately for us, Bandai Namco balances these overpowered characters quickly. Thank you, Bandai Namco!

If you have the DLC there is also an extremely fun bowling mode! There is a ton of extra content that can be unlocked in game such as artwork and movie clips from previous titles.

Pros:
- It's Tekken, one of the best fighting game series for competitive players.
- Online works great.

Cons:
- Frame data is paid DLC.
- You cannot even practice against DLC characters in training mode without buying the character DLC's.
- Random crashes between matches can be incredibly aggravating.",1582523373,1688603340,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

My pet rock got this game for Christmas in 2022 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my pet rock, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my pet rock for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my pet rock since my goldfish died. This game has ever since brought me and my pet rock closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my pet rock many happy memories.

This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died.

if you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding pancakes recipe you've come to the right place,

Ingredients

100g plain flour

2 large eggs

300ml milk

1 tbsp sunflower or vegetable oil, plus a little extra for frying

optional
lemon wedges to serve (optional)
caster sugar to serve (optional)


Directions

STEP 1
Put 100g plain flour, 2 large eggs, 300ml milk, 1 tbsp sunflower or vegetable oil and a pinch of salt into a bowl or large jug, then whisk to a smooth batter.

STEP 2
Set aside for 30 mins to rest if you have time, or start cooking straight away.

STEP 3
Set a medium frying pan or cr√™pe pan over a medium heat and carefully wipe it with some oiled kitchen paper.

STEP 4
When hot, cook your pancakes for 1 min on each side until golden, keeping them warm in a low oven as you go.

STEP 5
Serve with lemon wedges and caster sugar, or your favourite filling. Once cold, you can layer the pancakes between baking parchment, then wrap in cling film and freeze for up to 2 months:-


Tip :)
Sift the flour in (ie. pour the flour into a sieve and then tap or gently shake the sieve until all the flour has gone through it. Some larger clumps of flour may require you to rub them between your fingers or against the sieve grating to break them up) this will vastly reduce the number of clumps of flour and make it much easier to whisk it together.",1688231151,1688231151,True,112,26,0.739166557788848877,9,True,False,False

It is super complex, but for those somewhat experienced in fighting games it isn't that hard to get into. The combo system is amazing, and every time you hit a massive move or a big counter-hit launcher the game makes sure you know you did a good thing. Every character is super different in playstyles, even if some of them have similar moves (Mishima/Law types). And has (almost) no projectiles to be seen, and even in the 2 exceptions sidestepping is an option. Essentially, all the stupid shit from many fighting games today aren't really present.

and tons of peripheral support  this is a perfect example of a series transitioning to pc if you like fightinggames  this is an absolute mustbuy   fantastic mechanics that are fun for all   tekken has a low barrier to entry  but a massive skillceiling  you can buy this game and have a fantastic time even if you have never played a fighting game before  for the serious player the game features insane depth and a lot to enjoy  tekken 7 has changed things such as throwbreaking and made things generally more streamlined  but maintained it's complexety and depth  this really is the best tekken has ever been    optimized roster   while not perfect  the roster is tightened up  your favorite is most likely still in the game and the newcomers are generally good  each character feels unique and i feel namco has made good decisions on which characters to keep    hype as ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• final boss   just play the story and see for yourself    lack of content in general   i would like to underline that this game has already been out for 2 years in arcades  while not the frversion  the game has techinally been complete  this begs the question of what in the ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• namco has been doing for 2 years  customization is a joke compared to tekken 6 and there are very few modes  there is also no replaymode or anything outside the basic ranked online    the storymode is very short and the scenarios for other characters are just abysmal  these scenarios are basically a random fight with an inengine cutcene that does the bare minimum of fanservice  every tekkengame before this has had far more fleshed out content storywise in general  also  the customization is especially sadening considering that there are so few characters and one would assume this means more options for each one    mediocre storymode   the storymode is short and nothing to really brag about  it has some cool moments (and akuma)  but it's basically a bunch of cgcutcenes tied together with a terrible narrator and a hamfisted plot  the story makes no sense  but i can't really fault the game for it  tekken has always been bonkers  however  compared to many other fighters it really falls flat and it has to be pointed out considering that the game offers very little other content    no tutorials or help for newcomers   the game has absolutely no tutorial and it's honestly baffling  tekken is not an easy game to get into  sure you can mash buttons as eddy  but there is only a question of time until someone bodies you  it's easy to feel lost in this game  yet the game makes very little effort to teach you anything  you are going to end up on youtube and other sites to figure out combos  framedata etc  and that isn't good  there should at least be something here to teach new players the basics    online has flaws   as of writing this there are several big problems with online that will hopefully be fixed soon  first of all  ragequitting is a serious problem  there is basically no punishment for quitting and if a player disconnects on you  you don't get the win  this becomes an even bigger problem in tekkens tournamentmode  if the host gets mad he can kick you immediately or outright leave to shut down the entire lobby  as a result  playing tournamentmode is rather difficult    connecting to other players is also very difficult as of right now  connecting through the matchlist is almost hopeless and filled with error messages  the best option is using warmup and wait for a match to be suggested by the matchmaking system  however  this is also frustratingly difficult  it can take 34 requests before you can accept a request to fight that actually works  as a result you will often end up in games with 3bar connections because the game has not been able to connect to the players that fit the criteria you searched for  most of the time you will be told that ""the connection to the opponent has been lost""  you might think that this is your potential opponent declining your request  but in the majority of times it is in fact the game struggling to connect  however  this will most likely be fixed and when it happens i will remove this from the review the game follows the events of the king of iron fist tournament hosted by the mishima zaibatsu where players control a plethora of characters to win the tournament and gain control of the company the conflict between the mishima family serves as the main focus of the series plot while players explore other characters motivations in aiming to control the zaibatsu   gameplay focuses on handtohand combat with an opponent with the gameplay system including blocks throws escapes and ground fighting. the series later introduced combos and special moves with characters also able to stage break arenas  it was also revealed that heihachi killed his wife kazumi in selfdefense because of her possession of the devil gene and the fact that she had gained a split personality because of it shortly after kazuya was

bad online.

[Decent]
- The Max Level difficulty in story mode is unbelievably hard (of course) but the satisfaction you get from beating it is amazing.
- The customisation options are top notch as usual - if not even more in depth than in previous games.
- The main story and the way it's told from a sort of outside perspective is really intriguing and detailed.
- Perfect game to play while waiting for your friends to get on and play some other multiplayer games.

[Bad]
- The game features an easy combo system; where you hold L1/Left Bumper/whatever it is on PC, and press any of the 4 buttons to do 4 different easy combos that would otherwise take practise to perform in a fight, or has a lot of buttons to execute (and you can link them together of course). 
You can do this in the ONLINE mode... Why in the absolute fkn world are you able to do this? It makes the online fights completely stale and not even remotely entertaining - just full well knowing you are getting deleted purely by somebody pressing singular buttons like it's a QTE. I genuinely cannot get over how ridiculous this is. I would pass this even if you could only do it in the casual/non-ranked mode, but you can do it competitive matches.

- The individual character stories are insanely uninspired and makes some of the coolest rivalries, seem extremely redundant. It often features the two characters (lets say for example Hwoarang and Devil Jin) that are next to each other in the menu. You play one, a bunch of text comes up, you enter the fight, you win, and a cheesy cutscene plays. You then select the other character, a bunch of text comes up, you enter the fight, you win, and then see a different cheesy cutscene. It's painful compared to some of the scenes we have seen before in previous Tekken games. It's still sort of cool, but becomes completely unforgivable when you realise what they could have been.

Don't buy this game looking for a good online experience. 
It's perfect if you care about the Mishima storyline, and that's honestly about it.

Stop releasing DLC and come out with a new game, it's been 4 years.

[EDIT: 56 Hrs Total]

Ignore Decent points 2 & 3. I went back and played T6 and TTT2 and the customisation of this game PALES in comparison. Also rescinding my take on the story; specifically the Mishima storyline - purely because they made Akuma canon. Unbelievable.

I take back my entire 'Bad' point about the easy combos. Yes, it's so cheap and still frustrating to see it happen - but it's literally a skill issue. I just learned the match ups and counter most of them when the other player is just spamming them. I'm still bad but am getting better.

but, when compared to tekken tag 2 which was the most frustrating game in the entire series, due to it being the first video game with over four billion characters, all of which having 500 thousand moves you'd have to figure out and learn how to defend against with your own pair of two characters with 500 thousand moves. annoying bruce eddy teams/very fun double capo hypertension dead at 24 yo. teams, or playing against the absurd mishimas, which - if i remember correctly - were awful to play against due to ridiculous TTT2 movement, and tag electric combos which did an unusually high amount of damage to red health when compared to most other tag combos. there was also the very fun tag assault mechanic which ensured that you at minimum took 60% of your health in one combo at all times. i think this game's netcode was better than tekken 7's however.


now, compared to tekken 6, which was the most frustrating game in the entire series - but that was more so due to bob, law and lars, and how oppressive they could be online and offline. as well as most characters having a way to blow you up totally randomly if the wrong things were to happen - it's still fairly frustrating.

(tekken 7 mysteriously somehow had a top 8 with more of a single character than this game too. 4 bobs in T6 evo 2011 top 8, and 6 leroys in T7 evo japan 2020 top 8. and you know what else is funny? tekken 7's bob is absolutely way stronger than tekken 6's bob, he never got nerfed accordingly, he's just not very good compared to everyone else in this game. leroy was nerfed accordingly, however. he's no longer nearly as oppressive.)

still, when compared to games like tekken revolution, which stats' system made it the most frustrating game in the entire series, it's pretty good.

however, tekken 7 on the other hand? this is my favorite game in the series.",1635829898,1687879847,False,13,15,0.507576882839202881,0,True,False,False

Ingredients:

6 tablespoons unsalted butter

1/2 cup white sugar

1/2 cup brown sugar

1/4 cup water

1/4 teaspoon cinnamon

1 pinch salt

5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced

1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).

Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.

Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.

Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.

Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.

Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes.

From the moment I fired it up on Steam, I knew I was in for a hilarious journey of triumphs, defeats, and accidental button presses that would make any pro-gamer cringe.

Let's start with the character selection screen. It's like a buffet of pure awesomeness, but instead of food, you're choosing between a sword fielding alien, a flamboyant breakdancer, and an angry panda with martial arts skills. I mean, who needs logic when you can unleash a bear on your opponent, right?

Now, let's talk about the fighting mechanics. It's a delicate dance between timing, strategy, and plain old button mashing. I couldn't help but feel like a genius when I pulled off an epic combo, even though I had no clue what I was doing. And when I lost? Well, it was clearly because my fingers didn't possess the superhuman speed required to pull off those devastating moves. Yeah, let's blame it on the fingers!

The graphics in Tekken 7 are stunning. Every character is so detailed that you can practically count the pixels in their sweat droplets. It's truly a marvel to watch as your favorite fighter gets punched in the face so hard that their hair flies in slow motion. Who needs realistic physics when you can have gravity-defying hairstyles?

The game modes provide endless entertainment. Story mode offers a narrative that's more convoluted than a telenovela, but hey, we're not here for deep storytelling, are we? We're here to punch our way through a roster of colorful characters and pretend we're a legendary warrior. And don't even get me started on the online multiplayer battles. Nothing says ""friendship"" like beating your best buddy to a pulp from the comfort of your own home.

But let's address the elephant in the room: the rage quits. Tekken 7 has the power to turn the most serene individuals into raging beasts. The satisfaction of landing a perfect combo and watching your opponent's health bar deplete rapidly is unparalleled. Unfortunately, that feeling is swiftly replaced by the sound of a controller smashing against the wall when your friend suddenly disconnects because they can't handle your superior fighting skills.

In conclusion, Tekken 7 is a hilarious and addictive fighting game that will make you question your sanity and your reflexes. It's a button-mashing extravaganza filled with outrageous characters, gravity-defying hairstyles, and enough rage quits to make your therapist proud. So, gather your friends, stock up on spare controllers, and prepare to unleash your inner button masher!

Rage Drive is an easy option with dire consequences, seems balanced enough, Rage Art on the other hand is a crutch that is just button press away, removing any tention or skill from the end of rounds.

All in all this game is fun when it works, but usually it just doesn't work.

Constant crashes since day one still persist in this pathetic pile of shite that once was the tekken franchise.

I guess deep game mechanics were thrown of a cliff together with kazuya in this one.

EDIT:

Game is even fucking worse now, it just crashes for no reason all the time, no error logs anywhere, zero fucking support, utter garbage.

It's the only Tekken currently in Steam.  Lots of awesome characters and great graphics.  I hope there were other modes such as Tekken Tag (I know this is a different game but for sure, at this point, it can be an option).  Also, there were too many micro transactions to get other characters.  I am a Lei main in previous Tekken games, so even if they added Lei in the later updates, I believe he should have been in the base game - regardless if he was popular or not.  I just assumed he was planned to be added at a later date to increase hype and also subsequent DLC sales which didn't really sit well with me.

[h3][b]Conclusion:[/b][/h3]

Tekken 7 is a fighting game that boasts stunning visuals and animations, as well as a diverse cast of characters with unique fighting styles and move sets. The gameplay mechanics are deep and complex, rewarding mastery and skill. In addition to the classic arcade and versus modes, Tekken 7 also features a variety of game modes, including a tournament mode, which can be a lot of fun for players who enjoy competing against others.

One downside of the game is its lackluster story mode, which fails to provide a meaningful experience for players. Additionally, the game's online matchmaking can be slow and lead to long wait times, and the netcode can be inconsistent, leading to laggy online matches. Some players may also find the game's DLC practices to be excessive, with additional characters and costumes locked behind paywalls.

The game's difficulty can also be daunting for newcomers, making it hard to get into the game. The single player content can also be repetitive and lackluster, with little to do outside of practicing and training. Furthermore, the game's community can be toxic and unwelcoming to new players, which can make it hard for players to feel comfortable playing online.

Overall, while Tekken 7 has many strengths, including its stunning visuals, diverse cast of characters, and deep gameplay mechanics, it also has several downsides, including a lackluster story mode, slow online matchmaking, and a toxic community. However, for players who enjoy competitive fighting games, Tekken 7 is definitely worth checking out.",1681572806,1686094170,True,26,0,0.759888529777526855,3,True,False,False

Even though learning this game is hella fun, it can be frustating at the same time. My only problem is that you can only learn how to play the game just from your own experience. There's no tutorial or guide to help you understand the game mechanics at all. I really hope they will add a tutorial of some kind in the future tekken game.

A solid Tekken game that has been ported relatively well for PC since forever.
Let's start with the negatives.
---------------------------------------------------------
Cons:
[list]
 [*][b] DLC favoritism [/b] - If you like the base roster and have no interest in any of the DLC characters made available, then you're going to have a hard time labbing/learning them as Bandai Namco does not allow training mode against them unless you purchase them first.
 [*][b] Somewhat terrible latency issue [/b] - With the most recent updates, the game's already shaky latency issue exacerbated with laggier matches and frequent frame loss.
 [*][b] Frame Data behind a paywall [/b] - A feature that should be available for everyone is behind a paywall for Tekken 7. You need to buy Season Pass 3 in order to get access to the data.
 [*][b] Terrible, I mean, TERRIBLE customization [/b] - Remember when you could make your main character into cool cyber ninjas, medieval knights and sexy nurses in the past? Well, Tekken 7 is mostly recycled pieces with 70% of the options being plain T-shirts. Pathetic.
[/list]
---------------------------------------------------------
Pros:
[list]
 [*][b] Huge roster [/b] - Familiar faces, new faces, guest characters, you name it, Tekken 7 has it. I'm a Zafina player since Tekken 6 and was genuinely surprised when they reintroduced her in 7. The reason why I came back to the franchise.
 [*][b] Average~Good porting [/b] - Most Japanese games have terrible porting since they port a console game into a PC. But Tekken 7 have relatively okay-ish porting with pretty good optimization (except for the Alt + Tab bug).
 [*][b] Decent graphics [/b] - For a game that was made in 2015, the game still holds up to this very day.
 [*][b] TERRIBLE Network [/b] - The network of this game is getting worse update after update. The constant jitters and lags with laughable semi-rollback makes the game more unplayable than playable.

The game is ""apparently"" dead online. That means top-level players aren't there to annihilate the rest of us mere mortals. I played online recently. Won some, lost some, didn't get destroyed. It was fun. It's the first time I've ever played online. Not as bad as I thought. Probably because all the monsters are gone now lol

The game is cool. Just be aware of the ""steam cloud out of date"" and ""steam cloud error"" sync issues. Some people experience them, others don't, apparently. I've tried everything to fix it, to no avail. Hope there's a patch released for it some day because it is annoying as f**k.

applying potato mods and low graphics gets this game running really well on lower end laptops and PCs, unlike most other games i've tried to play on my sh1tbox laptop this one loads fast and very rarely crashes (ths only time it crashes is when the stag is infinite azure 2 i have no idea how to fix that)
story mode looks cool but that's when it's focused on Kazuya and Heihachi (the end of the story)

Customization is decent, but any universal clothing looks like trash.

-Has weird but okay Tekken Force style segments.
-Combat is more like Punishment and Dodge training.
-Kazumi and Heihachi's failed relationship is poorly explained and forced.
-Akuma is a cool addition to the plot.

[h1]The Craft of a Singular Style in a Big Roster[/h1]
[b]TEKKEN 7[/b] features an extensive roster with 49 characters! Each of them shares some common ground in their basic gameplay but has unique styles in handling the combat based on their strengths. [b]Noctis[/b], for example, has a high reach that allows him to defend against attacks or keep opponents at bay. In contrast, other fighters as [b]Eliza[/b], can fill bars to increase the power of their moves and behave more erratically. Playing each character, you would realize that despite some singularities, how you move and face opponents will change drastically.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2118894727

In contrast to the gameplay of its roster, I enjoyed the story less in my time with the game; it is not bad itself, but it was pretty short and lacked more content. Overall it did a stable job in terms of quality. Still, it ends up being more of a ""discounted"" experience rather than a fully immersive one. I enjoyed that characters speak in their associated language, even though it broke the flow at times since it looks like everyone knows how to talk in about every language. Like when [b]Heihachi[/b] speaks in Japanese and [b]Nina[/b] says in English. 

[h1]An Intricate Dance with Your Opponent [/h1]
The fights in the game are dynamic; they can be fast-paced or have a slow tempo depending on each player's action. It is an intricate dance as [b] TEKKEN[/b] focuses more on figuring out your opponent in 3 rounds. It is about figuring out how your adversary thinks. The more you can predict and adapt on the fly to their play style, the better you will do. Some combos can be extended with walls or [b]Rage Arts[/b] to deal more damage. Also, each character has particular moves, such as projectiles, gap closers, dodging attacks, or movements that cannot be interrupted.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2118895889

Graphically speaking, [b]TEKKEN[/b] leaves something to be desired. Characters' hair can, at times, look bad. At the same time, its visuals fail to impress, feeling more like a title from an older generation. The game carries out as a service with content that is being added to it so. Still, there are titles of the same category looking better. I wish they would have thoroughly worked on this aspect to utilize its stages and character customization.

[h1]Music that Breathes Air and Fire[/h1]
Something I see few people talk about is the fantastic soundtrack that [b]TEKKEN[/b] has. The music is outstanding as it pumps you up, reflecting the energy of combat. Its weight is noticeable as its rhythm changes during the last rounds to exhibit the emotion of the fight. It goes even beyond that as it creates an environment for the players. An example is fan-favorite [b]Infinite Azure[/b], which is harmonic and a track perfect for listening to while in training mode, developing one craft. Meanwhile, [b]Heat Haze[/b] gives the aura of a ""final battle"" or ""betting everything"" with the high pumping, melodic singing, and explosiveness of the song!

Customization is another excellent aspect of [b]TEKKEN[/b]! The only thing I noticed that I didn't like is that all items are locked to [b]Treasure Battle.[/b] The mode itself could be better, as it can become pretty stale quickly as you only fight versus the CPU. Getting clothes and accessories to make your characters stand out more becomes tedious grinding. It can serve as some practice in the meantime, and the modifiers are fun at first, but my interest in it died out quickly as it was tedious at best.

[h1] Strong and Weak Points[/h1]
The strong point of this title, in addition to all the gameplay elements, is customization. While, as stated before, the grinding can be tedious, the options at the player's disposal are limitless! From butterfly wings to having a [b]Jenga[/b] on top of your head that keeps crumbling every time you are hit. They can give birth to some incredible characters and glamour and personalize them to your taste. Whenever you want to make your golden warriors, cute fighters, or the most strange ideas, there is a lot to try, and it is a lot of fun!

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2118897082

The weak point of [b]TEKKEN[/b] is the barrier for newbies to enter the game. It is easy to get into but hard to master, and the depth of its combat, combos, and characters can be too much for a newer player to wrap their head around. It doesn't help that it has an arcade formula, meaning that there are few flashy moves or assists in helping newbies. There is nothing wrong with any of those elements. It might be daring for newcomers, and lacking tutorials doesn't help. 

[h1]X Notes[/h1]
A fascinating aspect is that rather than making a new entry into the game, [b]Bandai Namco[/b] opted to carry it out as a service and kept adding content. There are guest characters such as [b]Noctis[/b] from [b]Final Fantasy XV,[/b] and [b]Negan[/b] from the [b]Walking Dead[/b] while favorites such as [b]Ganryu[/b] come back! In addition, extra modes and customization options are released as DLC, along with stages. 

Acquiring all of that content can be pretty pricey. For a total of $80, it is quite a high price for all of it. Characters have different prices assigned to them, with guest characters being a bit more expensive. At the same time, modes such a [b]TEKKEN BOWL[/b] can cost the same as up to 3 additional characters while being lacking. They also made the terrible decision of locking frame data behind a paywall, as you have to pay to unlock it when it should have been free. 

The game ran well on a GTX 1060 with an Intel Core i7-8750H resulting in a locked 60FPS with the setting set to max and the render scale of 200%; there are three different season passes.

[h1] Finally‚Ä¶[/h1]
[b] TEKKEN 7[/b] is a fantastic game if you are looking for a fighting game with a lot of depth and are okay with learning and practicing your craft to perfect it. It is more demanding than its peers in the dedication that needs to be put into it. Still, with a lot of content on the base game plus the DLC and the online being solid, it is a good buy for anyone interested in it and for fans of fighting games. If you want to get into the genre for the first time, consider other options or get into it with a lot of patience. A great game overall, with a lot going for it despite some failed decisions; I had a good time with [b]TEKKEN 7![/b]

My son recently downloaded Tekken 7 and in less than a week, he had already played for over 20 hours. This was terrible for me, as it was already hard enough for me to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching videos on Tiktok. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, did the tutorial but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought my son and I closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.

I am rusty and not very good at it, but it is fun. I recommend the game to anyone who has a passing interest in the series. There are lots of characters, plenty of them are paid DLC and I would recommend waiting for sales, but there is a nice variety and they all represent different types of fighting styles. From boxing to taekwondo, you will easily find someone who fits your play style.

The single player content is adequate, but nothing truly special. The main story is a standout but there is some repetition at points. I don‚Äôt really care that much for the story of Tekken, but from a gameplay perspective, having me play Heihachi three separate times felt unnecessary and the ‚Äúkill x amount of continually spawning Jack‚Äôs and guys with guns‚Äù scenario was a little overplayed. As a casual observer of the overarching narrative of Tekken, I really could not care about what was actually happening between the fighting and I was fine with this. I just wanted an excuse to beat up a few CPU opponents and the game delivered.

The online modes (when they work, that is) are generally fun and the core gameplay is solid and entertaining at any skill level.

I think you should buy it, but here are a few small things I think are worth noting before you take the plunge:

The tutorial is unsurprisingly bad. It doesn't really exist at all and there are practically no systems to guide less experienced players, if you are entirely new to Tekken you will need to google basic information. It is easy enough to find online but I hope Tekken 8 takes steps forward to address this.

The game also has a fairly steep learning curve. There are lots of characters and even more impressively, they managed to map dozens and dozens of moves to just 4 action buttons. There are several characters that have move lists that are double, sometimes triple the standard in other fighting games. In some ways, the game having only 4 instead of the traditional 6 button layout makes it less technical on a very superficial level, but do not be deceived by this. The game is actually pretty demanding and complex in ways that other fighters are not, even more so when you consider this is a 3D fighter and you can move into the foreground. I did spend a bit of time in training to memorise the move list for my character to do basic punishes, but knowing how these moves interact and how they can snuff out other players moves is equally important. It is demanding and it can be overwhelming, even for the best of players. I actually like the technical nature of Tekken, but it might be a turn off if you can't invest a lot of time to learn the intricacies of both your own character and others. Knowledge is everything in any fighting game, but even more so in Tekken when compared to other contemporary fighting games.

In the brief amount of time I played ranked matches, there was also a huge amount of smurfing. This is where more experienced players use alternative accounts to game the system, specifically to fight newcomers who they can obviously obliterate in under 12 seconds each round because they‚Äôve already spent hundreds or even thousands of hours playing Tekken 7.

I don‚Äôt have any evidence that this is widespread and I could‚Äôve been a bit unlucky, but it was a common enough issue that I think it‚Äôs worth mentioning. You will likely come across players in the beginner league that have far greater experience than you do, which will make fights feel unfair at times. It probably doesn‚Äôt help that the game is several years old now and is probably front loaded with experienced players in the highest leagues the games offers, thus reducing the chances of coming across genuinely new players. It sucks and smurfing ruins the spirit of competition but there isn‚Äôt anything practical that can be done about it at this point in time, just get ready for a world of pain and be patient if you plan on playing ranked matchmaking. I hope Tekken 8 also takes steps to reduce smurfing when it eventually comes out.

Tekken 7 is otherwise a pretty good fighting game and is easily worth playing, especially if you have friends to play it with.",1685041699,1685041911,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

**Story: The Mishima Saga & Character Episodes**

Good: 
  - The story has some cool fight scenes.
  - In many fighting games, the way the characters start a fight feels awkwardly forced. In Tekken 7, it has an interesting 
    and a unique way to start a fight. My favourite ones are when Akuma VS Kazuya on the G.Corp Helipad stage (Day) and 
    Heihachi VS Kazuya in the Brimstone and Fire stage.
  - Story CPU characters and enemies can be quite challenging if you try the story on the hardest difficulty. Shin Akuma on 
    the other hand...
  - The has some emotion because you can actually feel some sympathy when Heihachi he killed Kazumi. This is a good 
    thing because Tekken 6's story mode (Scenario Campaign) lacked by a lot.
  - It is neatly organized into chapters with interesting titles.
  - Some of the character episodes in this game are good, the rest...
  - Best part; You get to relive the intro from Tekken 5 and can actually play the destroyed Honmaru temple while fighting 
    the JACK-4 squad (Which also explains why JACK-4 was not a playable character in Tekken 4).

Bad:
  - The story was short, more could have been done.
  - The narrator made the story so boring, I couldn't last a second by listening to the narrator. Imagine someone in real says 
    this to you, in such a monotone and robotic voice, ""My home got burnt to the ground and family died in the war"".
  - Most of the character episodes are short and terrible.
  - Shin Akuma is annoying to fight against.
  - Some of the characters like Jin and Lars had less screen time because it was all focused on Heihachi and Kazuya.
  - Kazuya, my favourite character, had terrible writing.
  - The DLC characters, except Eliza, do not have an ending.


**Online**

Good:
  - The first Tekken game to have a rematch option.
  - The first Tekken game to have an online tournament mode.
  - The first Tekken game to have a rank points system (added in season 2).
  - We have suffered in past for not having rematch option and rank points system, so it is a blessing to have these features.
  - Tekken Prowess (added in season 4) encourages you to try other characters to increase your prowess.
  - Internet Indication (added in season 4) can allow players to see if their opponents are using an Ethernet cable or or WiFI.
  - The camera system has a unique way of allowing players to play on one side. For example, if both players are playing on 
    the same side, the camera system will adjust both of your screens for enhanced playability.
  - On the online VS screen, you can see the player's stats like Rage Usage, Combo Damage, Aggressiveness, etc.
  - The colour of your name changes, depending on your Tekken Prowess.

Bad:
  - The netcode is bad.
  - When an opponent disconnects on the online vs screen, that opponent will jump straight to the menu while you're stuck 
    on the vs screen for an eternity.
  - No actual consequences for disconnecting. Giving a penalty is nothing. At least Street Fighter V is doing something 
    about this.
  - No dedicated servers, considering that this game was made on a small budget. This is all due to the commercial failure 
    of Tekken Tag Tournament 2.
  - For some reason, your online rank, not being saved in an online sever, but on your hard drive where it contains files that 
    requires no encryption. What this means is that if you get demoted online, you can backup your rank by copy-pasting 
    your old save file into a new one and you'll get your rank back like nothing, as if your previous losses never happened. 
    We call this ""safe-scumming"".
  - When an opponent disconnects during a match, in an online tournament, either you win by default, or the whole 
    tournament gets disbanded.
  - Online is filled with hackers, cheaters and boosters.
  - Online leaderboards are definitely contaminated with boosters and fake ranks.
  - The online waiting room has no options for practice like in offline practice mode and you cannot pick a stage of 
    your own choice. Instead, you will be playing in an infinite stage (similar to the online waiting room in Tekken Tag 
    Tournament 2) and the music the same from the Geometric Plane stage.
  - The host of an online player session room should have the ability to choose which opponent to fight.
  - For some reason, you cannot back out of the character select screen in online after picking a side. All you can do is pick 
    a character, exit out of online training and will be directed back to the online menu mode.


**Offline**

Good:
  - Practice mode has a lot of options like punishment training (added in season 3).
  - Playing Treasure Battle allows you to unlock items.
  - Inputs can be shown for Rage Art and Rage Drive on the offline versus screen.

Bad:
  - Arcade mod is lacklustre. It only has five stages to complete.
  - The AI is weak, which makes Arcade and Treasure Battle boring.
  - Missing game modes like Survival and Team Battle.
  - General lack of offline modes.


**My Replay and Tips**

Good:
  - You can see replays of your previous battles and learn from your losses.
  - Has a lot of options like input display, frame data, attack info, etc., while watching your replay.
  - Replays can be saved.

Bad:
  - It was added in season 3. We had to wait for a very long time for this feature to be added.
  - Regular replays and saved replays get deleted after an update.


**Customization**

Good:
  - Ability to customize the border of the healthbar.
  - Character panels can be customized further and can be seen on the online VS screen.

Bad:
 - Poor character customization.
 - Most of the characters panels are awful.
 - Lacks a lot of options like decals from Tekken Tag Tournament 2 and many options of clothing from Tekken 6. Thankfully, 
   we have mods for that.
 - Healthbar customization should have had more options.


**Gallery**

Good:
  - Contains artwork and short music video clips (PACHI Slot) you have likely never seen before.
  - You get to watch character endings and look at artwork from previous Tekken titles.

Bad:
  - No option for pausing, going backwards or fast-forwarding when watching the cutscenes If you exit out of a curscene by 
    mistake, you will be taken back to the beginning. Just watch the endings on YouTube.


**ULTIMATE TEKKEN BOWL**

Good:
  - Relive the memories of playing Tekken Bowl from Tekken Tag Tournament.
  - A lot of fun.

Bad:
  - This mode should have been made for online as well.


**General**

Good:
  - The music is amazing
  - The new combo extender, referred to as 'screw' or 'tailspin', makes the combos more fun than 'bound' from Tekken 6. 
    Bound from Tekken 6 still exists, but the new combo extender makes your combos look better.
  - The graphics look amazing.
  - The first Tekken to be on PC.
  - The first Tekken to have controller setup on the character select screen.
  - Controller setup is way better and easy than in previous Tekken titles.
  - Unique character intros occur when you pick specific characters (e.g, Kazuya VS Kazumi or Akuma VS Jin/Devil Jin).
  - The first Tekken to have guest characters like Geese Howard from Fatal Fury/King of Fighters, Noctis Lucis Caelum from 
    Final Fantasy and Negan from the TV series; The Walking Dead.
  - Akuma and Geese look better in Tekken 7 than in their original games.
  - The first Tekken to have frame data display.

Bad:
  - No tutorial
  - Fight money can be used to unlock customization items and content from the gallery. But once you unlock everything, 
    the fight money is completely useless.
  - If you do not want to use fight money, you can still unlock everything by playing nearly 2,000 matches in total.
  - OG characters are locked behind a paywall.
  - Frame Data was added in season 3 and you have to pay for it.
  - Akuma and the rest of the DLC characters are broken.",1684952502,1684952502,True,33,0,0.776957511901855469,3,True,False,False

- It doesn't have Jukebox.

- It doesn't have King retro and Jin T5 outfit.

- Colors are too vibrant.

I am having a hard time liking this game. I feel the controls are ""over tuned"", in that if you are not hitting your combos dead on they fail. Frustrated with NPCs not taking proper damage wile not blocking but supposedly they are (Maybe there is some new mechanic I don't understand or an old on I forgot). If a fight is lost, you are stuck watching the intro each time you fail. I feel the story line has dropped off quite a bit. To me this is not the Tekken I knew and loved, maybe I am old and rusty and fall in the ""git gud scrub"".   For a modern game, the fight scene to schematic is clunky at best. I don't feel the mechanic are as intuitive as past games I've played. I have not looked into any of the dlc or payed services, but I doubt they are worth it.

Tekken 7 is an excellent game with character designs, gameplay, and overall depth. A legendary series and its quality is still unmatched in 3D fighters. The game offers a wide range of characters to choose from. Each character has a distinct feel and playstyle. The roster has hundreds of moves and is capable of rich player expression. There are great in-game learning tools (replay system/punishment training) and plenty of guides to watch online. Other than these positives, there are significant drawbacks to consider.

-The Netcode of this game is not the best. Connection issues are common. You will be dealing with lag at times. 

-Also, please consider some people love to ""plug"" (disconnect) whenever they lose a heated battle. So they don't lose points while losing credibility. (The game scores a player's disconnect rate. You can see it before you get into a match with them.) Double-checking before accepting players who have a high disconnect rate should do it. (Anything above %2.0 if you ask me.)

-You'll feel hopeless at times. After facing smurfs / literal cheaters (auto block/auto punish etc.) and lag cheaters (lag created by the opponent whenever you attack or have to defend a throw). 

-Although in quick and ranked matches, players won't see their opponent's name until both parties accept the matchup. There are three indicators to distinguish players from one another before getting into the match. The indicators are Region / Language / Disconnection Rate. These could help you to avoid certain matchups or players in your play session. Said regions have six colors (red, blue, yellow, purple, pink, and grey).

-Until you learn how to deal with them, characters with gimmicky moves, mashers, and spammers will test your mental endurance.

Even if you survive this unpleasant environment and keep playing (especially) ranked mode, I have one last thing to share.

-After hitting ""Ruler Ranks"" (17th / 20th rank) you will most likely be facing top-ranked (29th / 30th rank) players who want to rank up their side characters. The first reason is they play the game more than other players do. The second reason is when you hit the highest rank, every other character you haven't played will jump to ruler ranks automatically. This scaling works on lower-ranked players as well.

Hopefully, Tekken 8 will resolve most of these issues. 

Still, Tekken 7 can be an incredible experience if you match up with people who have some dignity or whenever you play with your friends for fun <3",1677003502,1684598805,False,64,4,0.799791991710662842,0,True,False,False

The game can be a lot of fun, I think it best suits someone who enjoys practicing combos over and over. There is good character customization with lots of unlockables. If you are a completionist it's gonna be a long journey. Some of the achievements are not so bad, but the one requiring you to win an online tournament will require skill, and luck for getting that many people to play.
[Original first impressions review]
Four hours in and I have laughed more and had more tense moments than I have in many other games in recent years. Buy this if you like battle versus games. The combos are complex and take a great deal of time to master which is exactly what I love.

Few cons to be aware of, you must play during peak times to get a good online match flow, otherwise you could wait a while.

this game has nothing

i mean online mode is the only thing that i engage if there is no online mode is game is dead as hell

Bowling mode(who care we can play bowling game in android mode for free why t-e-k-k-e-n gave this bad mode)
Treasure Battle (Survival mode like Gold Rush t-e-k-k-e-n has before)
Arcade mode with 3 or 4 matches not like 10 or 8
if there is good thing in offline mode so there is Story Mode Only nothing else.

and most big thing about game is D-L-C

YOU can buy D-L-C character from store and you will get it but bad thing about d-l-c characters that they do not have back story and future story .they just playable nothing else bad thing about d-L-c
Only 1 d-L-c character has story and other do not have the prologue Epilogue not ending story of d-L-c


this game for t-e-k-k-en fan could be good but for those whose willing to enjoy offline mode so there is no enjoyable until you have buddy to play with offline that will be cool otherwise as solo game is game is not good according to me",1640869152,1682949588,False,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

story. not that i care to watch the videos, im thankfull there is a skip however it still takes a while to skip them, i prefer a challenge so i have to refight a lot, im annoyed with the talking, it takes more time for the damn toons to talk then it does for the computer to execute 3 combos  as the match starts

online matchmaking is beyond broken due to lack of player base

cool game to punch a few times, beyond a waste of money in my opinion if paying more then a few $ on sale, games like this need to be priced much lower at launch to draw in crowds such as myself who would play them casually but in terms of refined gameplay it just doesnt suit my abilities, regardless of how i try i find i just cant execute the right comands on time effectively to enjoy the game how its designed, it seems if i miss a command by even a millisecond i end up fighting the computer 57 times or playing against someone online who has invested countless hours into the game, i think my first online fight was against someone who was 10x my initial rank, and earlier today i went against someone 100x times higher, i managed to hit them once",1682431459,1682431459,False,1,1,0.434650003910064697,0,True,False,False

* the first [i]Tekken[/i] on PC and the gameplay was good;
* the game ran smoothly, there were no technical errors and the graphics were good enough;
* in online game mode, everyone else is almost always a million times better than you (keeps you focused and encourages to practice).

What I didn't like:
* the story mode competes in the heavyweight of telenovelas;
* soundtrack;
* for some cool characters and stages you have to pay to unlock them;
* in online game mode, everyone else is almost always a million times better than you (it can get annoying if there are no equal opponents to be found for a longer time period);
* your fingers must be made of iron or rubber or some other durable material if you want to play at a good level for more than half an hour (I played both with a contoller and a joystick, and though joystick clearly has advantages, it can still make your fingers numb).

1-Cheaters
Various of players cheating Using Scripts, Macros,and prb Software that conflict with in game Play
You will face players with 80 wins and no Looses ,Players that can Perfectely Backdash ,Combo u and Parry u.Players who mess with your Inputs, delay them , freeze them ,predict them.
There are going to be Players that could Make your gameplay lagg and in the end the get the Win out of it etc.

2-Pluggers 
Rage Quiters , that unplug their Network Connenction so they wont loose against u in real matches and could save their ranked Points from demoting them.They get a Penalty out of it But nothing too serious to make them quit of doing it again.  

3-Communication Error
You would encouter this type of error during Online extendeed matches with the prb beeing Various from Internet adapters , opponent misscommunication , etc . It will keep u waiting there for 5mins Synch Looping till eventually takes u back to Lobby

4-Lack Of Players In Tekken God , Prime and Omega Ranks
Matchmaking will make u wait in a lobby for a lott of minutes till it finds a player on those ranks to Match with. Prb beeing that less and less people reach this High Rank in this Game making the playerbase small and inactive.

5-Balacing Its A Huge Disaster
A lott of people will say that This may be a skill Issue ,but when it comes to DLC characters they have the Upper Hand when it comes having the worst balance of this game.Frames a lott of times are something to deal with as well. Balancing and Combo dmg is crazy ,Characters do 80% hp dmg leaving u with that 20 left in a single Combo but wise Balaning its better than past Tekken Games .

Do i reccommend this Game ?

Well as a hard fan and a Casual Player Tekken 7 is a very Competitive game that for new people in the series would make them confused and quit this game because of lack of starter wise Gameplay. The Story for me is a 10/10 but when it comes to starters mashing buttons will do its work but eventually they will get bored because  of inexperience.A Lott of people would want to learn how to play and practice mode is just perfect for them but in the end it isnt as ez and appeling to the Starter Eye.Menus are Complicated and one of the essential features the Frame Graph that needed to be Free ,so starter players can learn the game curve ,u have to pay for it.
In the end i would totally reccommend this game to play it ,but before u do so try do some research to see if u are innterested in . (I Wouldnt reccommend buy it as Tekken 8 its around the Corner ,Money Wise)",1681560501,1681560501,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,1,True,False,False

Tekken 7 is not an exception, in fact, is what it got me back on the series. Sure it has some issues like limited customization when looking at T6 or TTT2 or longer loading screen between matches than the modern standard on other fighting games but the complexity and the pure fun factor of the game play is too engaging to care for these details. The never-ending learning of the extensive move list, screw combos, wall combos, wall carry, etc is very entertaining. Online play is still alive and the community is good, like any other game it has it's share of ragequitters, pluggers, and other types of troll-like personalities but also very nice people that will help you improve.

Street Fighter 5 is fully loading of crappy because that's since I started up and installed SFV since it been crashed; before SF6 coming out in two months. But I'm mostly focusing on Tekken 7 before Tekken 8 coming out soon! 

You can offensive my reviews, or laughed on my review. Feeling free to being trashing talking on me.



I really enjoying with Tekken's combat, because I once playing on 'Xbox One' and been grinding it very a-lot, were used to professional combat in multiplayer. Sometime I getting sucked and sometime I getting better and more on the victory. 


I mostly mainly 'Alisa' because it's easier combat for my Playstation 5 to hitting to my opponent, and being toxicity to them. Because Alisa is most fun playing with to. In my opinion, has great screenshot when you're getting victory with poses.

If I could blast you with my Null Ray for not buying Tekken 7 already, I would! But alas, I cannot. i[/i] Seriously though, why are you even reading this? Get the game already! This is a monumental masterpiece.

[h1]GRAPHICS[/h1]

HOLY SCRAP! ARE YOU KIDDING ME RIGHT NOW?? FOUR Ks? FOUR! That's - KKKK! (No offense intended to our Cybertronian brethren). This game looks absolutely gorgeous! The shadows and lighting effects are just mind-blowing. Sparks fly everywhere when you land a powerful attack, and the level of detail on character clothing, hair, and other effects is simply incredible.

[h1]SOUND[/h1]

Imagine if you trapped lightning in a bottle, and every time you execute an electric wind godfist, that bottle opens up for a moment. If you don't have quadraphonic-prologic dolby surround pound, then you need to get it! Every punch to the face, every kick to the gut, you can feel the impact! [i](transforms and fires his Null Ray for emphasis)[/i] DOOOYAAA - DOOYAAAA - CRACKLE CRACKLE! Stage music is sick as usual, and if you want to pause the game and get down to some grooves while doing house work, then no problem! It's a piece of cake.

[h1]GAMEPLAY[/h1]

Didn't I already mention the lengths gone to balance this thing out? THIS GAME IS TIGHT! What's that? Street Fighter has three or four moves per character? Pffft, forget that noise, boy! This game has like a hundred moves EACH!? And you can reverse every move! YOU CAN EVEN REVERSE A REVERSE! [i](laughs maniacally)[/i] ""Chicken!""

[h1]REPLAY VALUE[/h1]

HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! [i](transforms and flies around in excitement)[/i] Sorry, thought that was a joke. This game will easily have the most hours on my Steam account a month from now. It's so competitive that if all you want to do is get better and better, you will never get bored. In fact, most people who have already bought this game probably played the last Tekken up until last night. If they did not, then they lack discipline.

[h1]STORY[/h1]

I'm not going to say anything about the actual story itself, spoilers and all that jazz, but trust me, it's really good. It has a great dark tone that fits perfectly with the game. And if you know Tekken, you know Namco takes a lot of time making cutscenes and doing voice acting. This is top-notch stuff as far as fighting games go.

[h1]AKUMA[/h1]

Damn straight, he has his own heading! What the frag, how is he even here? He's so badass that Street Fighter couldn't contain him! Obviously, Asuka reached out to her ex, Akuma, when her current man, Heihachi, was mistreating her. Now, even though Akuma has no time for a woman's fragging nonsense - hence why he gapped in the first place to go to the mountains to train - he couldn't tolerate a woman being mistreated, hence his arrival. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if Kazuya was Akuma's son. It makes sense! Why else would Heihachi throw him into a volcano? And how else would Kazuya survive? Of course he's Akuma's son! Kazuya's Devil Gene is actually pure Satsui no Hado, and that's why he's so powerful. Are you scared yet? You should be! Because with Akuma's presence, things just got even more intense in Tekken 7. So what are you waiting for? Get this game now and experience the power of Akuma for yourself!",1496357615,1680794046,True,17,1,0.526467382907867432,5,True,False,False

very excited for tekken 8 :)

OLD REVIEW:

I will continue playing, since I do like the game. But it has 3 major flaws that should keep you away. Don't waste your money until they fix them.

1. Locally stored rank, so smurfs can delete their high ranks whenever they would like and grief people still learning.

2. Not being able to enter practice mode with DLC characters to learn counters is a move to grab money with no concern to the player. I have no interest in playing the characters, but I can only practice when I see them online.

3. No penalty vs rage quitters.

As someone that is interested in learning, both of these things would be valid excuses in me quitting. I don't rage quit, and I've never saved my rank file to reload after a loss. I don't because that is the point of a rank. To earn it, not cheese it.

And also in the interest of learning, they require you to pay full price for characters to practice against even when you have no intention of playing them. I only play 1 character, and if I want to take the DLC ones to matches, I understand paying. But not for practice mode. I tweeted at the director when he was in Q&A, no reply. It is very selfish thinking on their behalf.

Don't spend money until they earn it, because you will just get frustrated losing progress to people with thousands of hours of experience.",1573114293,1680259949,True,0,0,0.749271750450134277,14,True,False,False

It's not ""Tekken"" anymore. Making Street Fighter X Tekken put the finishing nail it. We all wanted Tekken X Street Fighter because let's be real here for the a moment, it would have been a better game. It would have open the door to becoming the ultimate fighting game, but instead took an easier route so they could fuel the babies. Adding someone like Bob was a insult. This used to be about actual fighting styles that made sense not only to the character but you know the people playing it. Lets remove a real Muay Thai fighter {Bruce} and add a flimsy plastic barbie busty mock version to add diversity that wasn't needed {Joise} just as an example. Let's not even talk about the DLC characters because that's a slap to the face I don't need to acknowledge on all fronts of them from the old characters that should have been base to the wacky parallel universe this and most other fighting games have gone to.. Riddled with none sense over powered moves mixed with air juggling and ground pounding to the point where fighting doesn't seem fun anymore. Tekken always had these mechanics but was never defined by them and then made it the; most do or don't do at all mentality. Instead of fighting and just having fun and enjoying a nice brutal fight of strategy, it became a 1 shot wonder fandom reality for those who practice 1 singular combo and hope it works for them, even though there are sooooooo many combos and ways to chain them. If it's not a youtuber showing 1 shot methods it's must be lame. The Community is absolute swamp water. Do you think fight pads make a better fighter or does the 30% speed boost you get make you feel empowered? Does pulling the cord on a fight so you don't loss rank make you a smarter fighter or does running away like a digital Mayweather give you a sense of wellness? It must, because cheats like this plus auto block and counters, and players somehow being god tier at everything they do no matter the rank. I will crush a high ranking fight but loss in a low ranking fight like I've never even played the game before. Having a terrible previous record of fights but then comes crashing down on you like that wasn't a factor. Severe lag issues almost most fights that don't have a perfect connection rating. Hit Boxes are beyond my reason of thinking when you watch a mid attack scoop you off the ground like these people are professional dairymen. It's truly a shame too, because I have had some tremendous fights with some really cool random people, but as of right now those moments come fewer and fewer. Unless you like watching a great series turn to a pile of toxic **** stay away. I will have my eyes on Tekken 8 in hopes that they fix these issues and goes back to the king of fighters!!!",1680196239,1680196239,False,44,13,0.572622954845428467,0,True,False,False

First of all unless you are playing single player be prepared for 5 minutes (minimum) of loading and repetitive unnecessary kinda cool the first time you see it cutscene garbage. 
Also when you play a kid from Uganda or anyone with a lag switch or remotely struggling connection, they will hold left trigger and unleash one button combo's on you while you can't even block an obvious low because of lag (its deadass eddie gordo 2000's mashing trash escalated 1000000 percent.)

Half the characters on the roster are behind a paywall. I fully expect Tekken 8 to be all cutscenes on the initial download and mokujin as the only playable character at launch with 50 more to come behind paywalls.

Basically if you are a fan of tekken 1-4 and any of the tag games just avoid this dogshiii. everything you practiced for to learn up to this point will be given to new players as a 1 button move.

PLAYERS WITH 100 WINS OR LESS SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO DO THE MOST DAMAGING COMBOS IN THE GAME BECAUSE THEY SHOULD BE BEHIND A SKILL WALL NOT A PAYWALL YOU GREEDY CAPITALIST SCUMBAGS.

It was a worthwhile purchase, and I'm now excited for Tekken 8.

Great gameplay, an alluring soundtrack, lovely visuals, a robust netcode, a training mode equipped with frame data (that you had to buy, LOL), a replay feature where the game TELLS you what combos to use for max damage in certain situations, and a fantastic roster. All of these things go together for a great fighting game.

Fascinatingly, it even has a tutorial built inside the story mode. Although I personally would have preferred for the tutorial to have a mode all to itself, so it could offer more insight on the game mechanics than what is seen in the story.

And please, for the love of god, make the frame data part of the base package for ALL Tekken games going forward. That information is too valuable for the sake of learning how to use our characters to their fullest potential. Such a thing should NEVER be locked behind a paywall, low price or not. It's absurd.

It's a game that is easy to learn and hard to master. Growing up playing 3D fighter Tekken series is always the game I really love to play. Since the dev focusing on competitive playerbase on making their contents and it really paid off making it the highest sale they've made for this series, they also sacrifice casual game contents that some would love to see.

The PC version of this has so many little problems that just add up, to make the overall experience not very great.
Depending on what controller you use there is about a 50% chance that you'll have to restart the game for it to work. 
Loading times for online are horrible unless you use a mod, which both players need to have installed. And if you don't, be prepared to wait 3-5 minutes to load into every match. (An SSD won't help you here)
Content wise this belongs to the pre Street Fighter 6 era of japanese Fighting Games, so you basically only have a few barebones single player modes.
Although to give credit where credit is due, the character cutomization is pretty good
The netcode sometimes works pretty good but other times it just doesn't work at all.
They sold Frame Data as paid DLC (you can't make this shit up)
Also being an Unreal Engine game, the game stutters a lot. Usually this only happens for around the first 30-45 minutes of play depending on what you do, but it's annoying nonetheless",1679399844,1679399844,False,2,0,0,0,True,False,False

* This game does not want new players. 20+ years of legacy mechanics and skill yet zero tutorial outside of loading screen tips you can easily miss. 
* Netcode sucks to the point where even two full-bar wired connections will lag and slow to a crawl. 
* Ranked system makes no sense in which you can beat someone 3 ranks higher and only get 80 points but lose to someone at your own rank and lose 1700. 
* The game and its players don't respect your time. Got about 500 hours between here and PS4 and the reception from others is ""oh that's barely any time at all, you're still just starting out"" from people who spent 2000 hours in practice mode alone just to perfect wavedashing and electrics.
* Community is toxic as hell and will send you hate messages for playing a character you like. 
* Only way to learn the depth of the game is to join Discord servers where those same jerkoffs that sent you hate messages are now posting swastika stickers and ascii art.  

It's not worth it. I'm not doing 1 hour drills every day in practice mode just learn backdash cancelling just to be able to basic movement to get out of pressure. I'm not going to dig through movelists to lab the handful of strings that are blowing me up: movelists are 80-100+ moves per character -- now multiply that by 50. That is asinine. I've done it all and it wasn't fun and any incremental improvement is overshadowed by getting stomped out by strings and set-ups you cannot visually see a counter for in the moment of the match.

Video games shouldn't be homework. You shouldn't have to do daily drills like it's some sports try-out.

I've been a Tekken fan my whole life & to see it become nothing but a grind is just saddening. There is next to nothing to actually do in game. Story mode has it's moments but is crap overall, characters don't have a proper arcade mode as all they get is a single fight with minimal thought & effort put into their bare-bone stories (that is if you can call them ""stories""), barely any game modes (no survival, team battle, Tekken force, Tekken ball) & they don't allow you to do the special conditions seen in treasure battle in vs. mode (double damage, turbo mode, juggle battle). Speaking of treasure battle, it sucks. You get rewarded for fights with clothes & money, money that you'll most likely spend on clothes so what's the point? Especially when winning the fight itself gets you money. And the loading- oh, goodness gracious, the loading. Despite the arena & my character staying the same, it takes forever to load in my new opponent. I spend more time on loading screens then I do playing the game & sometimes it even crashes during load screens.
I understand that after the commercial failure of Tag Tournament 2 the budget was lower but that's no excuse for the game to be this lacking in content. There IS a Tekken Museum in the game (which is the other place to spend your money) but what that means is they are relying on the content from past games to make up for the nothing in this one. The story blows so hard that I took it upon myself to write (non-publicly available) fan-fiction to make up for sad feeling I was getting every time I looked at the new & legacy characters in the character selection screen. The gameplay, as good as it might be, won't bring people back to it when the next game comes out unlike Tekken 3, 4, 5, 6, Tag 2 & to some people Tekken 2 & Tag 1.
The cross promotional stuff has been fantastic, though. Akuma: Not the 1st time we've seen Tekken & Street Fighter cross paths but still good, Noctis: A bit weird but that's what makes it great, Geese: Excellent, Negan: The same as Noctis but 10x & as a fan NJPW I really liked the shirts & seeing King do the Rainmaker, even if I think he should have referenced Suzuki Minoru as he works at NJPW & did the motion capture for King.",1678673602,1678673653,False,1,0,0,1,True,False,False

The updated graphics were one of the first things that drew my attention. Character models are extremely detailed, and the environments are stunningly rendered. It's as if you're in the middle of a high-stakes fight.

The gameplay is also excellent. The combat is fast-paced and intuitive, with many different moves and combos to learn. I particularly liked the addition of new mechanics like Rage Arts and Power Crushes, which add depth to the already complex fighting system.

But the roster of characters is perhaps my favourite aspect of Tekken 7. There's something for everyone among the over 30 fighters available, each with their own distinct playstyle and backstory. Whether you prefer fast characters like Hwoarang or hard-hitting powerhouses like King, you'll be able to find a fighter who matches your preferences.


Overall, I'd recommend Tekken 7 to anyone looking for a rewarding and challenging fighting game. The graphics are stunning, the gameplay is excellent, and the cast of characters is diverse and exciting.

What the fuck is the whole point of the rank system if I keep getting matched up with someone who are far superior than me?
Also, why would the ranking based matchmaking based on the character rank?
Why not based the matchmaking on Tekken Prowess???
It makes no sense whenever I play ranked, the character I played is initiate, and I got matched with a character with the same rank, but have 150+ wins, with a far higher Tekken prowess than me in which, they are incredibly superior than me.
I genuinely don't get it.
It sucked so much.
Also, going back to the warmup lobby to find a new player is useless.

I lost 5 times in a row because I played with a Kazuya who was far superior than me so I decided to return to the warmup room or even go back to the online menu because I knew I have 0 chance of beating him, but got rematched with him again and again and again and lost a lot of my rank. I declined/cancel some of the upcoming matches because I was afraid that I'll be playing with that Kazuya again but guess what? He keeps coming back.
Like god damn how is that fair?
I don't blame this on the Kazuya but it's baffling that a system where I can choose to either battle the same person again or to go back to the menu/warmup room to find another opponent, fails to do what it meant to do.

Lastly, there's a weird system that idk if it's related to the ranked based matchmaking but everytime I won at least once, twice being the most, and I beat my opponent easily, the next match I got would be 1000x harder than before, once again, making it almost impossible to rank up

I'm no Tekken Pro, nor anything near it, I do suck, but why would you make a system that demotivate someone to get good? I want to play online and I want to get good, but this terrible system confuses me. I don't know if I'm actually good because I just beat two players very easily, or am I bad because the next 5 matches I'm totally  F  U  C  K  E  D.

Update: easy to say that this game have the worst matchmaking I've ever experienced. Imagine yourself playing Geese Howard, Brawler Rank, your Tekken Prowess is 60k+, and you play pretty well get a few wins, then instantly get matched up with a Grandmaster King but have 20 wins (meaning that the King played insanely good because he's on a win streak) and his Tekken Prowess is 100k+(meaning that the player playing that King is just good in general and have superior experience and skill not in playing King, but in Tekken in general)....Like, HOLY SHIT THE MATCHMAKING IS TOTAL GARBAGE.
As I said, why tf is the matchmaking based on the character rank??? And not based on Tekken Prowess? It's totally pointless. A really good player that has been playing for a long time might try out a new character and (obviously) have an Initiate Rank but of course, since they probably already play for a long time, they probably have an easier time understanding the character they're playing, as well as playing the character in general even though it's their first time playing said character. Thus it's almost impossible for me to beat that player. It's so absurd. I'd rather play with someone who is equal to me, then we keep rematching one another, having a win-lose cycle and leads to me going up and down in ranks. If that's the case at least it's fun. If any of you reading this might say that I'm just trash, it's because I am. I'm not a complete trash, I still know how to punish, do combos and even create combos, but the players I played against are insanely skilled in various ways. From learning Korean Backdash, rapid sidestepping and even do death combos.

So is this game good? Yes it's a masterpiece, 10/10 best game ever made. Flawless. Would recommend. Truly, one of the games of all time.",1678111840,1678474021,True,1,0,0.510593235492706299,0,True,False,False

Tekken 7 is not only one of the best currently active fighting games but probably the most active one out there. Once you get into it you're trapped. The learning curve manages to be low without sacrificing depth (looking at ""You gotta practice for 2 years to do anything irl"" Melee), so a new player can feel accomplished after a couple hours of practice while looking up to a whole community of players because of the high skill ceiling.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes.

If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead, murdered by my brother-in-law Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, Hank came to me with a rather, shocking proposition. He asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using his connections in the drug world. Connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded, I... I always thought that Hank was a very moral man and I was... thrown, confused, but I was also particularly vulnerable at the time, something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me on a ride along, and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin so I agreed. Every day, I think back at that moment with regret. I quickly realized that I was in way over my head, and Hank had a partner, a man named Gustavo Fring, a businessman. Hank essentially sold me into servitude to this man, and when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn. Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling out. From what I can gather, Hank was always pushing for a greater share of the business, to which Fring flatly refused to give him, and things escalated. Fring was able to arrange, uh I guess I guess you call it a ""hit"" on my brother-in-law, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured, and I wound up paying his medical bills which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge, working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring, and did so. In fact, the bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen in the ranks to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA, and about that time, to keep me in line, he took my children from me. For 3 months he kept them. My wife, who up until that point, had no idea of my criminal activities, was horrified to learn what I had done, why Hank had taken our children. We were scared. I was in Hell, I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, to end this nightmare, and in response, he gave me this. I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. I... All I could think to do was to make this video in hope that the world will finally see this man, for what he really is.",1562527928,1677664265,True,3,1,0.54356849193572998,0,True,False,False

Here's a snippet of gameplay on the steam deck: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxKqdKtRt34

In this seventh part the conclusion of the Mishima saga is told. The story is told through a reporter and you also play the story mode with characters that the story is being told about.
It all starts quietly through some kind of introduction where it started.
Little Kazuya is pissed because Heihachi killed his mother.

When you are done with the story mode there is another mode where you can perform a player story battle.
These are short fights of 2 rounds against a rival from the series. Jin vs Hwoarang for example.
For example, these fights have a short intro with a small cut scene and you no longer have to defeat 10 or 20 enemies to see the story per character.

Tekken 7 tries to make up for its lack of a superlative single player with sophistication and nostalgia.
For example, the game lets you create playlists with the music from all previous Tekken games, for example.
And the Gallery is the biggest nostalgia bomb since a Smash Bros. game; for example, I really enjoyed watching all Tekken 3 ending movies a little too much.

Another smaller addition to the combat system is the Power Crush.
These are normal attacks, but with one big advantage: they are not interrupted by high and mid attacks.
So the only way to stop a Power Crush is to perform a low attack or a roll.
Among other things, it made me stay a little closer to my opponent than usual, so that I could immediately perform a low kick or throw if I saw him or her perform a Power Crush animation.",1677450904,1677450904,True,27,2,0.697547256946563721,1,True,False,False

But as I grew up and life got busy, we stopped playing together, and eventually, the game became just a memory. That is until I stumbled upon Tekken 7 and decided to give it a try.

I had no idea that this decision would change everything. As I played the game, memories of my childhood with my father came flooding back, and I was filled with nostalgia. I couldn't help but feel a little sad that those days were gone.

But as I continued playing, something amazing happened. My father saw me playing the game and was thrilled that I had picked it up again. He told me stories about our time playing together, and before I knew it, he was sitting next to me, controller in hand, and we were playing together once again.

Tekken was just as I remembered it, but now, playing it with my father, it was even better. We laughed, joked, and bonded over the game, just like old times. I felt like a kid again, and I could see the joy in my father's eyes as we played together.

It's amazing how a video game can bring people together. Tekken 7 not only allowed me to relive my childhood but also gave me the opportunity to reconnect with my father. The game is more than just a sequel; it's a symbol of the bond between a father and son.

Overall, I highly recommend this game to anyone who wants to relive their childhood memories and reconnect with their loved ones. For newcomers to the game, be prepared for a challenge, but don't let that discourage you. With persistence, patience, and a willingness to learn from mistakes, you'll find that the difficulty only adds to the satisfaction. And who knows, you might just find a new way to bond with a loved one",1619327023,1677438913,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

Tekken 7 is praised to be the best of the series by many long time Tekken veterans. Coming into this game only every playing casually before, I was drawn to Hwoarang because I grew up watching my old mans brothers play him in Tekken 3, 4, 5, Tag, Tag2. So naturally. I became a Hwo main. 

Tekken is regarded by many as the most complex 3D figher out to date currently. That is an opinion that I believe I can stand behind, as the higher in the ranks you go, you realize, there is some kind of barrier you need to break. Whether that be, learning Frame Data, understanding a matchups magic 4, you never realized before, etc. If you play Tekken 7 competitively in the Ranked Mode, you will be in for many hours of enjoyment/frustration. The game will become a skill. It is seriously a skill that you hone and learn but what's amazing about Tekken, is every character is so deep with their own preferred playstyle, moveset, and character design that you will spend HOURS learning a second character. 
Then you glance at the whole roster. 

Learning how to play Tekken is like learning how to play music. Say you can play guitar, very well. you can play with a Trumpet, you know how to make it work, right. Lets say that guitar is your main character, and the trumpet is your opponent. You can play with the trumpet, but if you pick up the trumpet never have doing so before, youre gonna struggle playing.

Thats why I love Tekken.

EDIT: 

After 4k more hours, I still play it. but SAVE your money, wouldn't get this anymore, do something else until Tekken 8 comes out. TEKKEN 8 HYPE BABY",1533410994,1677137250,True,14,0,0.622303307056427002,0,True,False,False

I know a lot of people get stressed playing this game and I wont act like I don't but, I kind of come online in Tekken to get stressed and play challenging matches. I don't rematch everyone, im not a pro not trying to be. Its a very fun game and it reminds me of arcade games a lot. Tekken 8 might remove the arcadic feeling of the game I hope they don't but this game is weirdly the best mix of old and new. Idc about graphics, Tekken 4 still looks good to me compared to this, I don't care about rage art. It's fine, once you rank up its not a problem. Small problems don't bother me.

My advice to someone considering to play this: Get a stick, its 100% worth it. I am ranking up with genuinely a week of practice and that is it. I don't religiously practice the game, maybe it might be a genetic factor I have good dexterity but, I can't imagine this game being impossible to learn.

Its fighting! I sometimes imagine backdashing and electric irl when I box for fun, I mean fuck its a fun game and it goes on sale a lot.

I bought the definitive edition for $20. 

It was a pretty good deal considering the definitive edition included all characters, all stages, and all DLC that would have costed me over $200 to get.

I think what happened is this company tried to pull of a ""Street Fighter 5"" trick. Where you buy the game and think you have a full game but find out everything is behind a paywall and you can't earn characters in game unless you put on a advertisement suit or watch ads in between fights.

Yeah, Capcom tried to pull that bullshit off.

It is why I am not expecting much from Street Fighter 6, but onwards to this game, they tried to pull the same shit off here by the fanbase of fighting games were already wise to the bullshit and didn't buy into this time.

Tekken 7 failed in my opinion because it had a HUGE paywall that kept players from enjoying their favorite fighters.

In the beginning, and yes I was around during the beginning of Tekken and was a huge game fanatic then, this game had all character unlockable through playing the game.

It was great. 

But... NOTHING has changed. The same clunky fighting style that we dealt with in the 1990s is being displayed 30 years later in Tekken 7.

I get it. New graphics, new types of fighting modes and online play, but the moves haven't changed in 30 years. The game has not really evolved much at all.

I am not saying it isn't fun in some way, but honestly I am sad to say I wasn't all that excited to play it.

You can just mash buttons and as long as you mash them first before your opponent you win.

I guess it is kind of comparable to playing a game of ""whack a mole"". 

It is kind of annoying a way when your opponent just juggles you in the air for 7 or 8 hits and you have already lost the match.

I am not saying it isn't fun buy the dynamic that you can simply juggle somebody in the air hit after hit just seems lazy.

If you compare it to Street Fighter 5 it is a no contest.

SF5 is probably the best fighting EVER RELEASED in the HISTORY of gaming. I shit you not, and you have to pay out of your ass for it. 

That sucks, and I won't so it again, but I CERTAINLY won't do it for a half ass clunky, air juggling, button mashing mess of a game like Tekken 7. 

I hope they do it better in Tekken 8, but I am going to doubt it.

I would recommend this game for $20, yes. But that is the only reason.

It is a good game to have in you library especially for those that grew up playing it. 

I only like this game for nostalgic reasons, but as a fighter game it just doesn't do it for me in the modern era.

But, get it anyways for $20. I don't know if the company that developed the game is in on the sale or in some way prompted it, but if they did I would take the olive branch to mean maybe they won't be so greedy in their monetization like they did here in their next game.

Here is too hoping that is lol.

Season 5 patch since its launch in 2017 makes Tekken 7 one of the most balanced fighting games, and now previously powerful characters like Leroy, Fahkumram and Lidia were nerfed and balanced well against the base roster.
 
It's just that there is very little single player content if you prefer these modes in games.
Let's wait for better and improved rollback so that player and ranked matches are smoother.

However, the Mishima Saga's final boss is b******* on hardest level. I get that it's supposed to be challenging, I knew it wasn't going to be easy, but it's completely unfaIr. Game doesn't follow its own rules, and if the boss gets to rage art, you lost.

Rage art is cool, but it seems like something ripped off from Mortal Kombat -games. And then the micro transactions. WHY is there lot of original characters locked away as DLC? Oh, and it costs 6$ per character to unlock.

Akuma is OK if you had to bring someone from the Street Fighter -franchise, but Ruy, Guile or Ken would have been awesome. Walking Dead guy and Final Fantasy characters are lame tbh. Oh, and they cost 8$ each to unlock.

Online battles with friends seems impossible due to all communication errors.

It will look very difficult in the beginning but once you get into it, I feel it is more rewarding than other fighting games. Choose a character that looks cool and play them, watch a guide on how their play style works etc. Do not get influenced by people saying this or that character is bad. They are mostly talking about professional levels of play. All characters can reach the highest online rank, what matters is the player.

Online has been good for the most part, and pretty populated, depending on where you live. For some reason however if your opponent alt+f4s you get stuck there loading forever. I don't understand why this happens. By the time you stop loading, the person who left has probably played a whole other match. Fortunately alt+f4s are rare. Unless you play Marduk.

Story is alright, I don't buy a fighting game for the story, but if you care about that, it's there.

Customization is ok. Some characters have a lot of creative potential, while others can only change colors, everything else looks bad. Not even mentioning the items that are shared for all characters. They all look terrible unless you're trying to make a ""funny"" customization.

Tournaments are good, the rewards could be better.

Offline mode is cool. Playing a character in treasure mode should only give you items for that character, or at least significantly raise the chances. I've played so many games as Julia trying to get a certain outfit, but keep getting stuff for other characters instead.

Training mode should have a lot more tutorials for newer players. Punishment training is a good start. Training should be teaching new players about fundamentals, when to use certain moves, wall breaks, floor breaks, counter hits, rage drives etc. You are free to train all of these things by yourself of course, but some guidelines would be nice.

The game itself could be better optimized. I can't count how many times the game crashed, because I alt tabbed during a loading screen and I have a pretty good PC.

Overall I definitely recommend this game. Don't buy it full price though, wait for a sale.",1675215563,1675215563,True,0,0,0,4,True,False,False
