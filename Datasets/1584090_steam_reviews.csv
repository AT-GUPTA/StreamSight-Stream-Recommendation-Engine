The dialogue between the characters are also hilarious and capture the whimsical feel of the Touhou universe. There are also lots of character cameos and it's great that the game focuses on one of the lesser known characters and her friend.

Absolute must-have if you are a Touhou fan. Also an amazing game if you are interested in restaurant simulators with cute comfy storylines. It's a relaxing game that does offer some challenge to keep your brain engaged as you explore Gensokyo.

And I've never being happier to have been proven wrong.

This game is quite simple in it's gameplay loop: collect ingredients, speak with Touhou characters to deepen your friendship with them and, at night, serve your customers at your izakaya to pay your debts and, hopefully, earn some cash to make the concert of your dreams turn into a reality. But it's that simple loop that makes it so enjoyable to play. The game goes easy on the player. It's quite easy to become filthy rich once you unlock a couple of the izakaya upgrades (for example, I finished the game with 60K yen after buying every single possible upgrade I could find).

Another of it's stronger points is in it's ambience: warm, cozy, gorgeous pixelart accompanied by a wonderful OST, all great stuff. Despite some broken English (which I can overlook, this is a fangame and is translated by fans for fans after all), it's writing is another of it's stronger parts, if not the strongest. Chatting with every character always felt distinct and special, no matter who it was.

And, need I remind you, all of this is just the main game. I still have to tackle all the DLCs.
Of which there are 6.
And it's a FANGAME.

It's an honest to god bargain of an amazing game (I even think I didn't pay enough for what it actually is), and I highly recommend it to anyone interested in either Touhou Project as a whole or anyone looking for a cozy experience, since you need basically almost zero Touhou knowledge to join in on the fun, the game is very good in it's writing that you'll get the gist of almost everything without needing to look for info outside the game.

Price isn't something I usually bring up immediately. But, this game is SIX. DOLLARS. And regularly goes on sale for under five dollars.

That is utterly absurd price to content ratio, only matched by a game like hollow knight. Even if you pick this game up and only complete half of the basegame content, you are still making out like a bandit. And it's not just the basegame- The DLCs, each of which contains a hefty amount of content in their own right, are three dollars, and themselves go on sale for two dollars.

At the time of writing, I have 122 hours in this game, and have experienced all the content in the basegame, 3 of the dlcs, and most of the fourth dlc. If you really enjoy this game, you can get the game and all its dlcs for under twenty five dollars. That is absurd, to the point where I almost feel like I'm cheating the devs out of money!

Beyond the absolute steal of a price, the game's presentation is phenomenal. Beautiful, stylized pixel art with great detail, including full-page art at many points during the base game and dlcs. Lively and upbeat music that arranges touhou tracks in great ways. This game has a very distinct style that is very good, and very comfy.

Furthermore, the story is fantastic. If you're a fan of touhou's world and its characters, you will love this game. Across the basegame and DLCs, there's very few characters I'd say are presented out of character, which is a rarity for touhou fangames. But it goes above and beyond just matching how the characters are portrayed- it expands on them. This game has given me an appreciation for certain characters I didn't care for before, just based on how it writes them. This game also excels at character variety, giving love to underrepresented touhou characters too!

There's a staggering amount of attention to detail here- it's very clear the devs are very passionate about touhou, and that love for the series oozes into every part of this game. It's amazing how characters will organically talk about things in their conversations, only for me to realize that they were referencing an obscure part of a touhou written work or game- the devs clearly know their stuff in regards to touhou.

There are certain parts of Gensokyo's world and characters they modify slightly for this game's premise, so if you're a huge lore fan, don't be surprised by that. It's not out of ignorance- I feel like these are intentional changes the devs made to keep this games cozy atmosphere, in a world that can somewhat dark at times. But, I don't think that's a bad thing. In this comfy rendition of Gensokyo, Yokai don't eat humans, more sinister characters are less devious, and the friction between humans and yokai is overall much less intense.

Last: Gameplay. There's a reason I bring it up last, and that's because, compared to what I mentioned above, it's this games weakest link. Don't get me wrong; I don't think the gameplay is bad. Rather, it is only ""Very good"". Only, that ""Very Good"" Seems worse in comparison to the absolutely overflowing quality present everywhere else in this game.

The game is very comfy, and satisfying. The restaurant sections, the main gameplay draw, usually wont be demanding your full attention, but they are still fun- and during certain busier nights, it begins to become hectic in a very fun way.

That being said, the difficulty is a concern. I would say that in general the game is too easy, but still enjoyable despite that. (I wouldn't call it boring...) With just a few changes- most notably , a nerf to the buffs you gain from doing the rhythm minigames, I feel like it could be a lot more challenging in a rewarding way, but I also understand that a big draw of this game is its casual, comfy nature, and I wouldn't want to take that away.

So, if I must be greedy, and ask for more from this game already overloaded with content... A hardmode would be nice. I don't think it's going to happen, but its one of the small changes I'd make if I could.

That being said, if you want the game to be a little more challenging, there's plenty of restrictions you can impose on yourself to do that. (Restrictions that would be active automatically in a proposed hardmode) Stuff like being unable to give the same rare guest the same dish twice in a sitting, or having restrictions on the partners you have available. 

Beyond the restaurant sections, this also extends into other aspects of the game- most notably, the budgetary concerns. There's realistically no way to not make your debt off (You often make that much money in just one night) so the threat of a game over is sort of superficial. But, that's honestly not a big deal.

Despite the game being pretty easy elsewhere, the boss fights are legitimately challenging, and there's one for each DLC, too, so it's not completely without difficulty. If you're finding parts of the game too easy for your liking, look forward to them!

So yeah, I recommend the HECK out of this game.",1708265838,1708265838,True,6,0,0.556977331638336182,0,True,False,False

Pros:
Controllable difficulty via gameplay freedom
Art is cute - food and characters
Music gud 
Extra costumes worth getting, and I hate extra cosmetics normally - done via gameplay
Has consumed my life for the last 2 weeks
Can scratch the micro-manage itch, or the Zen itch - your choice.
Even has a mini rhythm game to scratch that itch too
Smol birb conquers gods and demons that could kill you with a cough with food.

Cons:
UI clarity can be awkward when there are a lot of things happening on screen - almost thematic to its bullet hell source material?
Epilepsy warning - probably mentioned in game somewhere, but putting it here just in case
Crashes- hard and soft seemingly at random - devs give instructions how to report bugs directly, first time I've actually bothered reporting things wrong in a game
Saves are hard locked after each day - not a problem if stability was perfect - however due to the freedom allowed in game to change things up, frustration when crashing was lower as I'd just choose something different so repetition didn't sour it overall.

Note: This game has liberated me from AAA malaise, now part of indie religion. Gonna get DLC because game has earned it.

This is a very cute restaurant management game where you'll spend half of the time gathering ingredients, and another half preparing food/serving your customers. It may sound simple, but the variety of your ingredient stock and quests will force you to tweak your menu and shop setup quite frequently, and then there are some mini-games on top to keep you busy. There are mini-games as side activities as well, including one very extensive rhythm game similar to Taiko the tatsujin.

All the touhou girls are super cute, and the dialogs are hilarious. There's tons of events and optional things to unlock. But at the same time, you can always scale down if you feel overwhelmed.

The save system is a bit weird and may be inconvenient: the only time you can save your progress is before you start the next day, which can take quite some time to complete (especially if you have some special event). Cloud saves are also implemented weirdly and may fail to work (often an issue if you have Steam Deck).",1708022809,1708069039,True,17,0,0.691276490688323975,0,True,False,False

Touhou universe, restaurant management gameplay, with a few gimmicks here and there and sprinkled with a good amount of funny interactions between the loveable characters in this cute setting.

This is no danmaku, unlike other Touhou games but it's just as entertaining and satisfying once you master it.

You are playing as Mystia, a bird-youkai that resides in ""Youkai Trail"" and opens up her small Izakaya at night.
One thing lead to another and you see yourself all of a sudden in debt, a running joke until the end of the game.

The gameplay-loop is to gather and buy resources during the day and then make money during the night, throughout the game you'll encounter more and more characters which will eventually visit your Izakaya as ""Rare Guests"". Here you need to learn what they like and dislike, you are given small hints each time they order and if you successfully match what they ask for you are being rewarded with spellcards. There are some crazy combinations that can be done, that'll help you fill up your pockets faster.

The graphics are cute and the restaurant gameplay is pretty intensive. The rhythm aspect, which happens sporadically, gets old quickly as your mind is probably more preoccupied with thinking about making orders. The game also does a good job of changing things up, with events affecting cuisine demand (like Recettear).

The controls are clunky though, especially playing with a controller. Opening a menu/window doesn't guarantee the highlighted box is where you'll expect it to be (starts at random places), screen/control labels vibrate intensely if you try to use your mouse to get around the clunky controls, and sometimes the interface freezes. During the dining rushes, it's frustrating dealing with the controls problems and rhythm game when I'm just trying to fulfill orders. I've found that just exiting and reentering the interface until it works tends to be the most simplest way to address the issue.

As far as I know, I'm not super far into the game as of writing this review, but so far the gameplay hasn't been too challenging. It's not mindless by any means, but even when managing a lot of stations + large menu, and a full-size izakaya, it's actually surprisingly manageable even if you do start to feel the tension. 

It's a cute, relaxing game that keeps you engaged with a satisfying gameplay loop. 

The only vice I can think of is that keyboard controls are a little clunky. Even though they are fully customizable, some actions are bound to each other for no reason, and sometimes a binding for one key would be more logical in one gameplay mode (when you're just exploring and gathering ingredients) rather than the other (when you're running the restaurant). This is, however, an extremely minor complaint given that I have a USB controller and it is much more comfortable that way (the game seems to be optimized for that moreso than keyboard) -- I highly recommend using one if you have one.

If you are only using a keyboard, I would actually recommend mapping the controls to something more old-school that uses the arrow keys for movement and the rest of the keyboard for all of the other functions.

-The art is very nice and the locations you unlock as you progress are very well made, and the cutscene art is also great.
-The music completely steals the show with how amazing it is. Every track is unique and are bangers through and through. One of the very few times I've bought the soundtrack for a video game at full price.
-The story isn't too deep but doesn't really need to be. It's serviceable but certainly not dull. The character dialog is really endearing and the conversations feel very natural.

This will probably be fixed in the future but I really wish you could associate favorite foods to characters and properly attach those food items to those characters in a menu in some way. You're kinda stuck having the memorize what food each character likes otherwise. The tags to search up also aren't in alphabetical order so it's hard to find the right descriptor for a food in the menu sometimes.

Art: 5/5
Super cute! As an artist I'm usually pretty nit-picky about what I play but I absolutely love the art style for this game! Front facing Mei does scare me though.

The story for this game is very cute! But I wouldn't say it's anything spectacular, but that's ok! I don't think the story in this game is supposed to be anything special and it doesn't need to be!

I really love the music, the pixel art is candy to look at, gameplay is enjoyable, and there's many hours of content for such a cheap price. Can be pretty relaxing, but things can quickly get chaotic in the kitchen at times.
Highly recommend this game if you're even slightly interested. You don't have to know anything about Touhou either, and there's a lot of in-game information about the characters and locations you can check out anyway.

[h1] GAMEPLAY [/h1]
Your day is divided into two sections;
Daytime: where you go around collecting ingredients, bonding with characters and running some errands for them, you have an ingame clock that starts at 10:00 in the morning, each time you collect something or ask someone to do something for you time advances by 30 minutes, at 18 the daytime ends.
Nighttime: Here is where the game really starts; you set up your Izakaya (Food stand) by choosing a location, the recipes you want to serve that night and drinks, and your goal is to satisfy all of your costumers AKA ""Guests"" from 18:00 to midnight. normal guests will ask you for food that you have selected for that night, but every once in a while a RARE guest will appear, they are characters from the Touhou Project series this fan game is based on, and rather than asking for a recipe on the menu they will vaguely tell you what flavor they want to eat, and if you manage to satisfy their demands they'll reward you by casting a SPELLCARD, these will give you various benefits ranging from giving you free ingredients to other passive boosts that will generally help you out, on the other side serving them stuff they dislike will trigger a negative Spellcard that will harm you in some way.
Aside from the main story you get a ""mini"" story of sorts with your rare guests, each character has 5 level of ""Bond"" that increased each time you serve them dishes they like at your Izakaya, each time you max out a level of bond, you need to carry out some errands for them to unlock the next level, by bonding with them you can unlock new recipes and passive abilities and the option to ask them to come over to your Izakaya or to gather stuff like food and drinks for you.

[h1] STORY AND CHARACTERS [/h1]
I won't spoil the story, but it is a light-hearted and wholesome one, the characters are well written, despite the fact that this game is not bound by the canon of Touhou because of its nature as a fan work, the characters are most of the time in line with their canon counterparts, with the occasional small deviation but nothing too drastic.

[h1] SOUNDTRACK [/h1]
The OST of this game mainly consists of remixes of songs from Touhou, and they're all great at that, i have yet to find a track that i dislike! Each location explorable during daytime has its own theme, you will be also listening to 3 different tracks during different situation in your Izakaya while you serve tasty food.

[h1] DLC CONTENT [/h1]
The game has currently 5 DLCs with a 6 and final one that is planned for release in 2024
these are DLC1 through 4 and  DLC 2.5 which adds a rhythm minigame for all the OST of the game.
Each of DLC1, 2, 3 and 4 will add the following;
2 new locations with new ingredients and their respective new OSTs for daytime and nighttime gameplay
6 new bond characters, with new dish recipes and passive abilities as rewards tied to their bond levels
2 new unlockable partners
A ""Boss"" fight that once beaten, can be re-challenged with a greater difficulty in case the base game is too easy for one's taste
These DLCs add around 15-20 hours of extra gameplay, but they can be played alongside the main story without finishing the game, this holds true for all of them but DLC1, which has to be played after you beat the main game. For the price of 2.81 € i highly recommend them if you've finished the game and still yearn for more.

[h1] CLOSING THOUGHTS [/h1]
Mystia's Izakaya offers around 25-30 hours of gameplay without counting its DLCs, for its full price of 5,81 € it is worth every cent, this is without questions one of the absolute best Touhou fan games out there, and it is completely enjoyable even without prior knowledge of the series or characters, while Touhou fans will still get their honey with the care and love that the dev has for the series' lore.

[h2]  Gameplay: [/h2] 
  A very charming & fun cooking game with some light rythm game mechanics that can get quite a bit harder later in the story when you upgrade your izakaya.
You are not forced to use the upgraded izakayas if you want the experience to be more relaxing.

[h2] Story & Characters: [/h2] 
  The game has a lighthearted story that isn't very complex. The game has a lot of different characters with their own pieces of story.

[h2] Music & Sound: [/h2] 
  The soundtrack while is quite enjoyable and fits the game very well. The sound effects while cooking are actually very good and make the experience a whole lot more fun.

[h2] Downsides: [/h2] 
  The only downside I can think of is that you can only save at the end of each day but that is not a deal breaker and it is there to prevent players from softlocking themselves.

[b] tldr: [/b]
Overall if you like a game with a relaxing atmosphere and cute and quirky characters alongside some pretty 2D art this is the game for you. I recommend the game even if you are not familiar with Touhou characters, though you might miss some references.

1584090,153855733,76561199403447206,0,1,7730,0,4552,1706628157,"This is a game about plundering the world of its natural resources and stealing the crops of others' labour, before throwing said resources onto a cutting board and conjuring vile amalgamations of rice, the moulted shells of cicadas, raw egg and uncooked meat, which you then proceed to serve to your closest friends for profit (friends do NOT get discounts) so as to keep your kneecaps intact and pay off debt after debt whose value is constantly increasing, ostensibly due to inflation.

Build up superficial relationships with your favourite Touhou characters, and when they can comfortably consider you one of their best friends, waste no time in exploiting them by sending them on plundering expeditions, rewarding them for their efforts with nothing but a brief thank you. If they for any reason exhibit hesitation towards being exploited thus, always remember that their insecurities work to your advantage.

Jokes aside, this is a cute and charming game with incredible pixel graphics and great music. Sure, one might find it repetitive at times, but this is, after all, a casual game, and it's relaxing and enjoyable nonetheless. The dialogue is wholesome, and interacting and bonding with the characters within the world is fun and rewarding. As you browse through your album of in-game friends and gaze in satisfaction at your various max bond levels, you are reminded of the cruel reality that you do not possess any friends in the real world, and must resort to seeking respite within a fictional one.

Anyway, I would genuinely highly recommend this game to anyone, regardless of their familiarity with the Touhou universe. I personally knew next to nothing about Touhou when I bought this game, but found great enjoyment in playing it nonetheless, so much so that I went ahead and purchased every one of the DLCs.

By the way, if you are planning to buy and 100% the game, here's a quick but important tip:
Be sure to keep save files at 03/14 and 03/24 (MM/DD). Also, Mystia's house has a basement! I only discovered that halfway through my playthrough.",1702905604,1702905604,True,63,20,0.827816665172576904,0,True,False,False

- Extensive use of Touhou characters and their interactions with each other, even the lesser used ones
- Gorgeous pixel art
- Food descriptions and RPing as a successful restaurant/bar owner
- Satisfying to get into the flow of serving customers and remembering the regular's orders

Complains:
- After reaching some point in the game, you might end sticking to the same few recipes and slapping ingredients on with the needed preferences, As a result, you end up ignoring most of the new recipes you get.
- Repetition also sets in around this time as you converge on your harvesting/buying schedule and run out of unique interactions with characters.

It's easily one of the most charming and engaging Touhou fan-games I've played in a while. Whether it be managing multiple customers or strengthening your bond with Sanae Kochiya, this game never stops getting boring, especially after you get out of the Youkai Trail and start opening up more shops in other familiar locations in Gensokyo. The music is relaxing, the mechanics regarding certain customers are (mostly) brilliant, the punishments are funny (and cruel when it's one of your favs that punishes you 😭), and the partners you can unlock (especially in the DLCs) is great. Also gotta love the random pop-culture references they just sprinkle into the game and also the PC-98 representation here.

My only gripe is that the translation can sometimes be confusing for some of the rare customers and their needs (unless you use a guide, which I'd highly recommend if you care about maxing out your bonds. Trust me, it's worth it), but I can let it slide 'cuz it ain't easy to get a game translated if you're not primarily an English speaker (I know how bad translations can be as a Mega Man fan. lmao).

The game opens with a hook that some incident is going on in Gensokyo (again) but this time everything somehow hinges on Mystia and her... izakaya?! What could cooking has to do with saving Gensokyo? That's for the player needs to find out through the story.

The game got a well-paced tutorials with both main and side objectives that really aren't too difficult, the game accommodates players who just want to chill and make food as a youkai bird well, stress-free!.... even if the story puts Mystia into debt. There's a wide variety of characters you can interact with including both popular and lesser known Touhou characters with their own personality. 

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
For those looking for a nice, chill and warming experience, Mystia's Izakaya is a great fit, almost like a slice-of-life anime in restaurant management game form.

If you're looking to get stressed out by debts and responsibilities, you can play the game like that, too, but then you'll get drowned in money unlike real life. 

Sidenote, the developers have been keeping this game updated with new contents for very reasonable prices, the developers showed that they love this game and want give the player even more to play with! Even in 2023, so much more contents have been added!

[h1]Extra thoughts[/h1]
[b]Narratively[/b], you're not going to find any major WTF twists and turns here, most people probably can guess the general plot of the game within the first 10 minutes! But that's not a bad thing, the story is a slice-of-life for the most parts, where Mystia just interacts with other characters both through the story and also just by talking to them as she collects ingredients. The comedy and fluff never gets stale (for me, anyway) right until the end.

[b]Mechanically[/b], each in game day is split into 30-minutes segments. Don't worry if this sounds complicated, the game takes you through each new mechanic slowly! Overall, it's just the matter of serving the right food and drink and make money, feel free to skip the list because I just summarised the game's tutorials.
[list]
[*]The first phase, starting from 10:00 and ending at 18:00 will have Mystia going around the map, collecting ingredients, talking to people and visiting shops with more areas will unlock over time. Collecting ingredients and moving between areas will cost you 30 minutes, so it's good to prioritise tasks that don't cost time first!
[*]The second phase goes up to midnight, which is when Mystia will open her Izakaya. Before opening, though, you'll need to pick menu items, drinks and cookware to use on the day (you can level up and upgrade the Izakaya to get more slots). You'll be able to pick partners, too, to help running the Izakaya, either by serving food, drink or cooking (though personally I find having partners serve is more efficient than cooking). 
[*]Normal guests can be satisfied by just giving the right items, but you'll rare guests (Touhou characters) that give you their preferences for food and drinks, then you have to cook the right food (not necessarily on the menu that day) with perhaps extra ingredients and drinks. 
[*]Rare guests will reward you with Spell Cards (buffs) or Punishments (debuffs) that may make your night better (or worse). 
[*]Oh, and there's also a rhythm minigame when cooking that you can do to get buffs, but once you get all buffs, you'll get one big super buff called Hyper Mode and won't have to do the minigame again until the effect expires.
[/list]

[b]Graphically[/b], the game uses pixel arts, from the sprites to portraits to the environments, everyone and everything looks amazing, from cute to cool, take your pick. Nothing to complain about there, there are story artworks that looks amazing as well that you could even use as wallpapers.

[b]Audio[/b]... the music is just great, played through the entire game and I never got tired of the music, having a Touhou fangame with great music just feels perfect. The music is generally cute and cheerful for the most part, some other parts calming and peaceful. It probably can help cheering you up. All the sound effects are nice and fitting, nothing extraordinary but nothing to complain about, either!",1659157110,1701054963,True,11,0,0.623553693294525146,0,True,False,False

I eagerly wait to play the first DLC when it's translated.  While the translation was a bit rough/incomplete when I first started playing, I got to see it improving in real time with how I stretched playing the game out (to finish Fantasy Maiden Wars NG+).

Thanks for the fun times!

Simple and relaxing game, complimented by the game soundtrack. I love the music in the game. I could listen to it all day and wind down. The gameplay loop is addictive. I find myself wanting to play another in-game day right after the next and eventually find myself playing the whole day. The game has a day and night cycle. During the day, you get to freeroam Gensokyo to gather ingredients, do quest, buy new cooking tools or get to know the Touhou characters. At night, the game becomes a dinner dash type of game where you serve customer's orders. 

The real fun begins when the Touhou characters visit your stall making a vague food request and you'll have to figure out what they want and satisfy their cravings. Feel free to try out different ingredients as their likes and dislikes will be jotted down in the notebook as you unlock them. Satisfy the 2hus and they'll give you a reward spell helping you out or give them stuff they hate and they'll cast a punishment spell getting in the way of your business. 

The game is pretty easy and its hard to mess up unless you deliberately give them food they dislike. I went out of my way to purposely fail story mode just to see what happens and the game was still very forgiving [spoiler] reverting back a few days before and letting you keep all your money and items.

After coming back to the game and actually giving it a good try thanks to a friend, I found one of my favourite relaxing games to play during my free-time.

It's fairly simple, but monotonous at first with a lot of running around until you unlock the Sparrow Song minigame for cooking, which gives one of the best buffs in the game, letting you throw food across the Izakaya right to the customers table, truly a time saver, and lets you serve more guests if combined with the instant eating buff.

Overall from what I've played thus far. The game is incredibly fun, enticing and relaxing once you get into the rhythm of it. The artwork of the main, rare and special characters is absolutely adorable, and the costumes that become available to unlock or purchase if you missed the initial time frame to get them letting you play dress-up with Mystia in a bunch of adorable costumes. The music is equally fantastic and calming, and I've listened to it on repeat while doing some cooking as well just to get in the mood.

It's a sweet game that I just enjoy playing.

I'm not even a fan of Touhou, but man... Playing this game makes me want to learn about Touhou and play other Touhou games alongside this one.
I even purchased all the DLC as it adds to the game for a cheap price, and I won't ever say I regret that decision. Even DLC 4, which recently came out with no english translation. I definitely will wait patiently for it and have fun playing it again when I can read it.

I just love the gameplay and the art style, especially for the characters.
I don't really play cooking simulators, but I can say that I enjoy cooking for the customers in this game and delivering the orders.
Even giving special customers specially prepared food to suit their taste to get a nice buff to help you.
Or even the cooking minigame that gives you buffs, too.

I also like talking to the characters in each area before heading off to open the izakaya.

I had wanted to get into Touhou for a while now and saw this game in a recommendation somewhere. I thought it looked cute and so I bought it. After playing for a while, I got hooked!

Sure, this game may not be for everyone, but I'd say to just give it a try.

To start with, I have never played a Touhou game and have never been into shmups. So I don't know the characters from that series or any other media. If you have any attachment to the series already, you might like this. There's clearly a lot of character history already present from the start of the game, but it doesn't detract from the experience if you're not familiar with it like me.
While a business sim at its core, Touhou Mystia's Izakaya is incredibly charming in its presentation and has a constant flow of interesting and varied content to keep you coming. 20 hours in, I'm still looking forward to the next day to see what happens and what recipes I'll unlock.

It's... bland... 
You manage a Izakaya/Small restaurant with guests coming in, ordering a couple drinks and foods with some variety in wishes (you basically just match their wishes with the Tags on each ingredient (Sweet, Low alcohol, etc)) and that's it.
I'm sure at some point it just gets a little more hectic with more tables, more foods and more ingredients and maybe a couple annoying features that just make everything convoluted.

I havn't seen much, but what I saw was the clunky UI, weird keyboard controls and english translations which sound, well, not really native.
For the price it's okay, but I nonetheless was heavily disappointed that the overwhelmingly positive rating apparently stems from an overabundance of Touhou fans just recommending out of love for the franchise.

Edit after the developers response:
Not sure if it's very valid to quantify fans of a franchise by how much they bought a previous title, as there's basically always a certain previous appeal there, like: Is my favorite character present, what is the gameplay, is there music to my liking, etc
With this game there's certainly a ton of characters present, it's a simple gameplay loop, and the music is actually decent.

Nonetheless, I'm more or less overwhelmed by the DLC3 being pointed out there.
It's astonishing that there are already THREE PAID DLCs out and the main game doesn't feel as polished as you'd expect at that point. As said, the UI baaadly needs a rework (it just occured to me that maybe it is just meant to be played with a controller as Mouse+Keyboard just felt horrible), the translations of the main game should definitely be a priority, instead of releasing paid DLC to a half-baked experience for every english-speaking player. The tutorial for the UI was also a huge drag. That Tutorial consists of roughly 70 text blocks, appearing all one after another, explaining every single bit of the UI instead of slowly introducing it throughout gameplay.",1672624658,1693499129,False,6,0,0.46708834171295166,0,True,False,False

Gameplay: Touhou Mystia's Izakaya is not a difficult game but it is a bit repetitive so I would recommend pacing yourself. Ingredient spoilage doesn't exist in this game so the only downside to buying more ingredients than you need is that you have less money; Speaking of money, it stops being an object once you get all the upgrades you need (actually shortly before that). The game's difficulty comes mostly from two things menu planning and serving customers, while you can save the former; the latter requires proactive cooking which (to avoid meal spoilage) means you need to understand what each of the customer types will likely order from your menu (a poorly planned menu may mean they won't order at all).

Art: The game consistently looks nice and artworks are all pretty.

Story: I liked the story and you get it from three things in the game, story events, bonds, and the Bunbunmaru.

Nitpicks: Salmon steak isn't a meat, Western food doesn't have bamboo in it, and I disliked the alternate outfits (they generally don't fit Mystia and none of them look like something that would be worn while cooking).

DLC1 expands the base game and story, if you enjoyed Mystia's Izakaya then I recommend buying DLC1.

DLC2.5 is only for you if you like the cooking rhythm minigame (if you're using a gamepad you can't rebind the rhythm keys and have to use a keyboard).

I've been loosely playing this game for over a year and I've had to restart a couple of times because i kept losing my saves in my steam cloud (my fault!) but i actually didn't mind at all. This game to me never gets boring or repetitive and there are always interesting stories, side quests and happenings in this game which i honestly didn't expect when i started. I thought it was just going to be a casual restaurant sim which technically it is but its so much more interesting than that in my opinion. You really get to know the characters and its really nice seeing some less popular Touhou characters getting some attention. The game play isn't too challenging and it's just such a nice chill relaxing game but its fun enough to keep you interested. Its definitely a comfort game for me that i can play no matter what mood I'm in. I think the reason i keep playing at least for me is the cute but super well done art style, the characters, the chill game play, and the story.

Resource Management.

This part put so much more stress on me than was necessary and I didn't initially think about this feature when buying the game so it really gave me whiplash when it came to trying to satisfy the special customers and finding out I didn't have the right drink in stock or the right kind of ingredient to add the flavor they wanted.

The game was simple enough and I saw the appeal immediately with the controls and basic mechanics of cooking and serving. I was all for it at first, but as soon as the game threw several special characters my way and expected me to satisfy them with an ingredient or drink that I didn't have, I wanted to quit. So I did.

It's a great game, has great music and overall design. I just can't deal with this particular mechanic in any way, plus I saw that I was slowly running out of my Lamprey, which every common customer loves to eat.

For real, I haven't felt such happy vibes and tranquility in a game in years... The gameplay is repetitive but even then it keeps you wanting to see more, and the game indeed delivers: New recipes, new locations, new characters... The feeling of reaching max bond level with your fav 2hu girl and her giving you a cute outfit is so cute, but then you see how Mystia looks while wearing it at the izakaya and man, she surely looks beautiful in any costume she wears.

On another note: THE MUSIC. I cant stress this enough, THE MUSIC IS BEAUTIFUL. Getting a big order streak only for the music to change and you notice its a remix of iconic Touhou songs... You know the feel of going to the last boss fight and you hear bits of the main theme? Well, exactly like that, but it has mixes of characters themes or even stages themes, and i'll never get tired of it.

The game even has DLCs if you want more, so what are you waiting for?

There are lots of cute outfits to put on Mystia. The music is also lovely, though with only one track per overworld zone and three tracks per izakaya location, they get stale after a few cycles. It's a relaxing experience, a good chill game. The singing mini-game also helps this vibe feeling. I found myself rocking my head to tunes every time the game popped up. The Touhou characters are represented adorably, but they are definitely their 'fanon' incarnations. The dialogue can be a little stale at times, but it's endearing nonetheless. The game has an extremely strong first impression...

... but the negatives become very grating quite early on.

Frankly, this game is extremely repetitive. Once you've served the first few guests, you've served them all. There is no deeper system than what you access in the first two or three hours of the game, and this game has a solid 40-50 hours of gameplay in the base game. It can feel extremely repetitive, collecting the same ingredients in the same couple of zones day after day. There really should have been more special dining events like the final encounter and [spoiler]the Remilia challenge[/spoiler] to add some variety to the daily grind. Speaking of repetitive, the level 3 izakaya has the same interior at all locations. This was a missed opportunity in my opinion. It would be great if there was some way to decorate the interiors of the izakaya beyond [spoiler]the gifts that you are given for reaching max bond level with some of the rare guests[/spoiler] or some way to add some flair to Mystia's house. The basic guests are uninspired. There is very little reason to please them, so despite having a way to increase their satisfaction by tailoring each dish to their species, I ended up just slinging out the basic version of every recipe to them whenever they ordered. They will tip slightly more if they are very satisfied, but money is a non-issue even when splurging day after day. I wish there was some more variety in the basic guests.

It is an extremely easy game with almost no options to increase the challenge. The only way to make the game more difficult is to have no staff member working with you at the izakaya, and this is not that much of a bump. I never once had a guest get impatient and leave. Displeasing rare guests enough to get their punishment cards requires conscious effort. Money is not a problem after the first hour or two of gameplay. [spoiler]There was never a real concern that I would miss one of the game's debt deadlines. I usually made enough to pay Chen back in a night or two, and she gives you a very long time to earn enough to pay her.[/spoiler] I never felt compelled to buy the upgraded cooking tools despite having more than enough money to do so. 

While I enjoyed the rhythm game aspect for the chill factor, it was also a very easy element. I'm an osu! player so that might have something to do with my perception of its difficulty. I never felt challenged by it until I bought DLC 2.5, which in addition to being a separate purchase, is entirely removed from the main gameplay loop. It does expand on the system, but if you play a lot of rhythm games it is easily mastered. It also offers no additional rewards afaik. 

I did enjoy playing the game enough to finish it and get all of the achievements, but I felt that I should leave this review to highlight some of these pain points. The price is low enough that I would recommend at least trying the game out. However, do not expect a significant challenge, a robust narrative, meaningful customization, or anything beyond seeing cute Touhou pixel art and making some questionable onigiri.

The best way to summarize this is, it's almost like a more chill reimagining of VA-11 Hall-A. It has a similar general theme and gameplay loop, talk to people, serve the correct food items. There is the small gimmick of gathering resources in the daytime, but otherwise, it actually plays a lot like a faster-paced, more laid-back version of the aforementioned.

In terms of its standing as a Touhou game, I feel like this is actually one of the better jumping-off points for newbie Touhou fans. Touhou, as a series, is pretty notoriously hard to get into, with so much overlapping lore and so many characters all doing different things, it's nice to have a game - even a fan game - that can serve as something of an introduction to the series. I don't know if everything in this game is necessarily portrayed as accurately as possible, but it seems to be faithful enough to the original lore that you can get a sense for the characters shown in this game and use that as a base to begin to expand your knowledge on the series in general - I often found myself feeling like booting up one of the mainline Touhou games after I'd had my fill of Izakaya.

The art in this game is gorgeous, and the translation, from what I've seen, is pretty top-notch. Only a few small errors here and there, which is more than impressive for a game translated from Chinese.

While the game isn't difficult by any stretch of the imagination, I hesitate to call it easy, either. A more fitting term for it is casual, because while there is some degree of challenge, and it's more than welcome, the game never tries to really ratchet things up or make things arbitrarily difficult, which suits it quite well.

Going in, I expected a cute, short game, without much depth, about running around in Gensokyo serving food. I instead found a game that inspired me to play more Touhou, and it quickly ended up taking VA-11 Hall-A's place as that game I'd play at the end of the night to wind down. Thoroughly quality experience, whether you're into Touhou or not.

The only things I can really complain about are the sometimes unclear food tags (For example, Japanese/Chinese/Western dishes are an entirely different thing from ""Cultural"" dishes, and the game doesn't properly convey what will exactly turn your food into dark matter, although the system is easily learned through trial and error, it'd be nice for the game to let you know) and the occasional scarcity of resources.

As for the former, that's really kind of a nitpick, but the latter is something I feel should be at least addressed - After the first two days of playing, I've consistently been dangerously low on lamprey, because they can only be obtained in rivers, from random spawn points, which will sometimes despawn if they move off-screen, and have a random chance of dropping once harvested. Maybe I just have awful luck, but I don't think I've ever had more than ~50 lampreys in my inventory at any given time. It's like this for a couple of specific ingredients, namely, pork and mushrooms, and I'd like to see some other way of reliably obtaining these things, if possible. Even despite this, I don't feel like that problem is in any way something that stopped me from enjoying the game, moreso, it stopped me from experimenting as much as I'd have liked to with certain food combinations.

Overall, I can confidently call Izakaya a hidden gem - If you're looking for a very chill, but very engaging restaurant-type game, this is absolutely worth the money.",1691900243,1691900243,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

- you can get lots of lovely new characters and places with very cheap DLC.s
- very addictive!
- this game makes me always on a good mood :)
- price is super affordable (i even bought it on sale, almost free!!)

CONS:
- some characters feel a bit shallow, and i would want some of them to have a bit deeper personality/character growth. for example there is this one character that loves bugs, and their whole personality has been built around that and communicating with them feels very repeatable. but i think that is the only con in this lovely game so 10/10!!",1691486966,1691486966,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

mystia's izakaya is the cutest fangame for people who love touhou, but don't love bullet hell. this is truly a game for the girls and the gays. you don't need to know the lore! i am enjoying this game SOOOO freaking much and all the characters are so cute. a tip i have is to play with the resolution at 720p as the art is calibrated for that resolution <3 
the only critique i have is that you can only save at the end of each day, so around every 15 minutes? :( reworking the save mechanic would take forever, so knowing that i'm ok with the save function being the way - it's similar to saving in stardew valley where it only saves during the night <3",1690686592,1690686592,True,2,0,0.511873364448547363,0,True,False,False

Overall, it's a fun experience. Like many management sims it's relaxing up until you encounter something you don't know how to deal with, but once you get how things work and learn how to manage it it's a very chill game.

The gameplay effectively works on a day cycle; During day you forage and shop for ingredients and drinks, interact with known characters across Touhou to raise your bonds with them, and do side-quests for new recipes and resources. It's worth noting that time only progresses based on your actions, not an actual timer.
During night you run your restaurant. You setup a menu for food, drinks, as well as what cookware you're bringing (certain food needs certain wares, and sometimes you may want to bring extras for something that's popular too cook more). Regular customers come in, you cook, you serve their food. The better and faster you do it, the more tips you get. You can even store extra dishes ahead of time if you expect something to be popular. Plus you get assistants to assist in serving food, drink, or cooking. And then there's the named guests (the actual cast of the games), where they will ask for a specific type of food, and you have to learn their likes, dislikes, etc. to fulfill both their request and their tastes. Doing so well enough gives you extra rewards and improves your bond, doing miserably will hurt your bond and have them punish you. You don't have to necessarily pull from the menu for these rare guests, as you can manually input ingredients, letting you find what works well for each individual guests' likes.
Ultimately, you have to make sure you make enough money by the in-game deadline. As such you have to balance spending, as well as improve your income to make sure you succeed there.

Overall, it's an addicting loop as you try to improve your relationships with everybody, both to gain new recipes and items, but also just to see what happens when everybody starts opening up with eachother.

Story is fun and goofy, artstyle is very gorgeous and adorable, music is fantastic remixes that work very well for the settings. Overall, lots to enjoy~

It's a very wholesome and heartwarming game overall. A great case on time management, but very easy to get into a flow with and not feel overwhelmed by anything beyond insane challenges.



I will note one mild complaint; despite being WONDERFUL on Steam Deck, the directional arrows work really weird; if you press left/right or up/down, and then without letting go of the D-Pad hit the opposite, it won't actually change direction. This can make movement a bit awkward, but it's fairly minor and alleviated by the joystick.",1690432702,1690432702,True,11,0,0.643958151340484619,0,True,False,False

The incident Mystia encounters is ridiculous (in the style of the series), but the game itself is well written. Each character has something to say, they don't deviate from their canonical images, and they mention events from the games, manga, and books, which is very cool. The cute art conveys Zun's style well.  The music is beautiful. 

The gameplay consists of two components: during the day the player collects or buys ingredients for dishes, performs tasks, and develops relationships with characters. At night opens his izakaya and cooks for both regular visitors (humans and youkai) and special guests (Touhou Project characters). As time goes on, the conditions will change - there will be new challenges and places to stop the izakaya. All in all it may seem a bit repetitive, which will be true to some extent, but it's still fun. The DLC is almost better than the main game. All the time new scenery, interesting situations in which the player finds himself (especially on bosses)

There are three categories of fan games in franchises: 
1. Mediocre, even for fans.
2. a good game, but only for fans.
3. a good game that may appeal to more than just fans.

So Mystia Izakaya falls into the fourth type: Amazing game for fans and newcomer alike. A great entry into the franchise if you don't want to suffer through Shoot 'em up and you just want to relax.",1689431885,1689432540,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

As a person born and raised in the United States, the interactions between characters and their thought processes intrigued me, providing a unique and interesting experience.

While the translation may have some occasional oddities, the overall meaning and directions remain clear. The characters in the game are undeniably cute, and the storyline is filled with fun and enjoyment. One aspect that particularly impressed me was the presence of a time limit, which added a sense of urgency, but what I loved even more was the ability to pause at any moment without feeling rushed. This feature allowed me to take my time, consult my in-game book for answers, and effectively freeze time. While some might find this lack of tension frustrating, I personally adored this aspect, as it allowed me to thoroughly enjoy the game without feeling anxious or stressed.

The art in Touhou Mystia's Izakaya is nothing short of magical, and the characters are brimming with charm. The world portrayed in the game is incredibly unique, offering me a glimpse into another culture. Through my interactions with the game, I've not only been entertained but also learned new words and gained an understanding of concepts I hadn't encountered before. Although these insights may not have a significant impact on my day-to-day life, they are still interesting and greatly appreciated.

In conclusion, Touhou Mystia's Izakaya has been a delightful journey for me. Its adorable characters, enjoyable storyline, and the freedom to pause and explore at my own pace have made it a game that I've thoroughly enjoyed restarting to improve my performance. The game's art and cultural elements further enhance its appeal, making it a wonderful experience overall. If you're looking for a game that offers both cuteness and a unique window into another world, I highly recommend giving Touhou Mystia's Izakaya a try.",1689337261,1689337261,True,2,0,0.54356849193572998,0,True,False,False

GAMEPLAY: 
Totally unlike your typical Touhou shooter game. This one is a slow paced, mostly very easy, resource gathering and cooking simulator. You spend much of the time looking for ingredients and developing relationships with other characters of the game. At night, you cook for customers who visit your place, and eventually you may not even need a lot to do that since you get other characters to help you cook and deliver food to the customers.

Lots of recipes, ingredients, and customer preferences gives quite a bit of variety. That being said, as a resource gathering game with an extensive story and NPC backgrounds, this game may feel grindy at times. Moreover, saves are restricted only after the end of every ingame day.

STORY: 
Very Touhou-like: protagonist must save Gensokyo, this time through the culinary way. A rather different and innovative approach, compared to the shoot and kill gameplay of other games of the Touhou world. Besides Mystia, plenty of other Touhou characters do appear in the game, of course, all of them with their typical stereotypes, such as cheap Reimu or mushroom loving Marisa, both along story lines and gameplay preferences.

GRAPHICS and ARTWORK: 
Pixelated and gives a GBA vibe. Lots of CGs included along the way. Looks very cute, though I would have preferred more ""full resolution"" CGs and character artwork.

MUSIC: 
Lovely and relaxing, and fits very well with the game style.

SUMMARY:
Excellent and creative Touhou-fan made game with a rather low full price. Cannot recommend enough, especially for resource gathering players and fans of the Touhou series. 9/10",1689292970,1689292970,True,14,1,0.615599513053894043,4,True,False,False

A cooking simulator that will spare you if you prefer a more casual approach, but will greatly reward you if you choose to give it your all.

Also a great find for comletionists, as this game was well over a hundred achievements.

Aside from a couple (ahem, looking at you, Little Errand Lv. 3 and The Million Pound Note), they are mostly nice and fun.

The only ""issue"" (kinda) it has is that it can feel a little repetitive after 30ish hours in. But then again that is subjective. But it's definitely not a game I recommend to play for 8 hours straight.

With its undeniable charm and engaging gameplay, it offers a truly pleasant experience. The game's captivating story, accompanied by a cast of unique characters, adds a superb layer of depth, while the mouthwatering food and diverse ingredients further enhance the immersive experience.

One aspect worth noting is the game's affordability, priced at a mere $6. For this modest sum, players are treated to a remarkable journey through the world of Touhou Mystia's Izakaya. The value offered in terms of content and enjoyment far outweighs the price tag.

However, it's important to address a couple of minor gripes. Occasionally, finding effective help for certain missions can be a challenge, particularly the task of providing a food with a cultural tag. Despite unlocking multiple new areas, the recipe needed to complete this mission has eluded me for a significant duration. It would be beneficial to have a clearer progression path or increased accessibility to unlock the required recipe.

Additionally, while the sound sprites initially add to the game's charm, they can become repetitive over time. It would be great to see more variety in the audio department to keep the experience fresh throughout extended play sessions.

Despite these small challenges, Touhou Mystia's Izakaya remains a delightful and worthwhile investment. Its endearing charm, engaging story, and mouthwatering culinary adventures make it a standout game in its genre. For those seeking a relaxing and immersive experience at an affordable price, this game is a must-try.

Whether you're a fan of the Touhou universe or simply enjoy engaging storytelling and delectable virtual cuisine, Touhou Mystia's Izakaya promises to satisfy your cravings.

I was playing for three days straight and only progressed a bit, only opened the new areas just now and still have a lvl2 cart with 6 seats.

The game consists of:
1. gathering materials during the day (time management)
2. opening izakaya at night and serve customers.
3. special events with other touhou characters, cute stories, likable even for ppl who don't know touhou (me)

The special elements for cooking:
1. usual customers they order from menu
2. food, drinks and ingredients have properties (like raw, meat, strange, sweet, salty, etc)
3. rare customers only give you hint of what they like. you need to come up with the dish with properties that they like to lvl up the relationship, but after figuring out their fav dish, you can just make that every time they come.
4. there's music game during cooking where you click based on the beat, it gives you special skills like throwing dish at customer table. (I need to figure out how to choose tables to throw at)

so far really love the art and stories and how fast I can make money without trying too hard. It's super addictive.

Tough parts that I'm struggling rn:
1. I haven't figure out a specific recipe for each rare customer ( there's more special customer, not sure if they're in the free version or in dlc), therefore I need to check the customer's likings (dish and drink) and food's properties for every special customer so it's very tiring. I think once I figure out, I'll just brainlessly make those for them and I'll be good. Or I can use those dishes as my menu so I don't need to manually make the food, and just click the dish and it'll autofill the ingredients.
I'm also greedy that I want to sell the most expensive food, so trying to do that while satisfying rare customer needs is harder. So I might just not do that.
2. More areas open up and I'm unsure how to best use my time when I want to go to all areas and talk to everyone and collect every resource XD
3. If you make stuff ppl really like, they'll be really happy. (eg. add meat in every dish you sell to the usual customer that likes it) but it's a lot of work. I might just do it as simply as possible and see if i still make profit.

The basic premise seems to be a fantasy world where humans and different types of monsters live.  Some humans and all monsters appear to have some sort of special ability they can use.  The main character is a sparrow monster that runs a little food cart in the mountains with one of her friends.  The game starts with them both opening a restaurant and a particularly angry ghost shows up, demands a bunch of food all at once, and then trashes the place after getting impatient.  Time then goes back a few months to when you're just running your food cart in the mountains.  You get roped into taking on several debts and start running your izakaya



The gameplay consists of day and night phases.  During the day you can buy ingredients, forage for ingredients in each location, or talk to the inhabitants of the area.  Some inhabitants will have quests for you to do for them, others are what are called ""rare guests"".  These people have a friendship level and at each milestone will teach you a new recipe and a request to serve that recipe to them.  Talking to them once a day increases friendship, but the best way to raise friendship is during the night phase when your restaurant is open.  Maxing out friendship levels can get you some nice benefits, so it can be worth it to hang around an old area til you finish making friends with everyone before moving on to the next one.  One of the first rare guests you meet will also upgrade your Izakaya so that you can have more guests and cooking space.  Another shopkeeper you meet later on can upgrade your cooking equipment.

During the night phase, you choose workers to help you.  You'll only really have one at the start, but you'll get more as you get further into the game.  You can also choose to work alone, as helpers take a small cut of each night's pay as well.  Each helper can be set to serve drinks, serve meals, or help cook.  You can have up to three helping out and can put every single one on serve drinks if you really want to.

When you open your izakaya each night, you pick a menu for guests to choose from.  You can put a set amount of meals and a set amount of drinks.  Then you pick your cooking equipment for the night as well.  The basic food cart can't hold every type, so you'll want to make sure your menu isn't too diverse at first.  Once you've finished your setup, the izakaya opens and customers can start showing up.  Each customer has a preference for type of food they like so they'll tend to order that food more often than others, but they'll always pick something from your set menu.  They are pretty simple to deal with, you pick the menu item and drink they want and serve it to them before they run out of patience.  The game is very generous on customer patience, and I've never seen it even reach halfway on the meter.

The more complex orders come from the rare guests that live in each region.  Rare guests don't really know what food or drink they want, they just want something with a specific taste.  They have a variety of flavors they like, but will only ever tell you one of them at a time.  This is where you start to customize your cooking.  Every single ingredient you have can be added to a menu item.  The most basic food item rice ball just consists of seaweed(Where she gets the rice from, who knows).  That leaves 4 slots of ingredients open for customization.  Riceballs are vegetarian, cheap, and taste like homecooking.  One of the characters, Reimu, loves these flavors, but if she requests something sweet for example, the plain riceball is going to be good for her, but it won't get the best rating since it doesn't have what she requested.  So I can make a riceball, and with one of the four other ingredient slots I can add honey to make the riceball also taste sweet.  Getting the best food rating on rare guests comes with a bonus.  They will use their own special power to provide a buff for you for a time.  For example the first few rare guests will give you random meat items, random fish items, or increase the likelihood of guests appearing for a time.  Likewise, giving a rare guest a dish that they absolutely hate will have them use their power to punish you.  Scaring away guests, restricting your cooking ability, or simply stealing ingredients from your pantry.

After a set time, the shop will close for the night and show you a tally of everything you've sold and the money you made for the day.

Now your character also can buff themselves while cooking too.  For the first couple days you'll have fairly basic operations, but eventually your character will start to sing while cooking as well.  This takes the form of a very small rythm minigame that provides notes on beat with the music of the area.  These are very simple and are actually very generous.  Sometimes you won't even see a note pop up.  Each time you sing while cooking you can buff yourself.  These can come in the form of unlimited patience for guests for a time.  Guests finishing meals immediately.  And the ability to throw food and drinks to a table without having to walk to them.  If you have all three buffs, they combine into a super buff called hyper mode and reset the buff timer to full.  In hyper mode, you no longer get the rythm minigame, and certain cooking utensils actually have special functions while you're in it.

Daily restaurant openings are actually fairly simple and relaxing compared to most other cooking games.  However there is a story in the game that pushes you to certain challenges.  There's a time limit to pay off your weekly debt until you get to the last part of the main story.  Once you get to the end of the main story, it halts until you decide to take on the final challenge.  And while I've mentioned the game is fairly simple and relaxing, this final challenge is an actual challenge and becomes quite hectic.  You get minichallenges throughout the main story that give you an idea of what it will be like, but they aren't quite the same as the real thing.  And while I enjoy the basic gameplay loop, I really like the challenge that came with this and the end of each of the DLCs.

The game's artstyle works well for it, nothing really seemed incongruent when I played and there definitely seems like some good care went into making the environments.  The music, like the bits of touhou music I've heard before, is very good and gives each area its own unique feel to it.  In particular the final challenge music while sounding somber and dire really fit well in its context in the game.

The story was easy to follow, even without knowing who these chars were, the game did well in explaining in the world and each characters place in it.  It did well in selling the main story beat of a conflict that only a master chef could resolve.

Definitely recommend this game if it sounds at all interesting to you.  Its fairly cheap.  I got 100 hours total from the base game and the three DLCs that were out at the time of this review.  There is a fourth one on the way that I will probably pick up when it gets translated.  If you like the base game, each of the DLCs adds 2 new zones with 3 rare guests each and a challenge at the end similar to the end of the base game.  Each of the challenges work well with altering what you know about how the game works.  They all felt pretty fun with DLC3 in particular giving you a challenge for those that want more on the rythm minigame side of things, though it also adds a cool new cooking challenge too where you get to play as other characters that have their own set of buffs different from Mystia's.",1687735280,1687735280,True,62,1,0.865964293479919434,0,True,False,False

Arguably the best Touhou fangame out there, or at least in the running in what is a very fierce competition. Even factoring out the gameplay, if you just like seeing some of your favorite characters interacting with one another in ways beyond out-styling each other with spellcards, this is packed full of characterization that hits right. You're near constantly getting new friends to buy things from you, new friends to find things for you, new friends to give things to you. And it never feels like one-sided exchanges because they write Mystia as a far too wholesome protagonist for a game that starts with a threat of broken kneecaps.

Base Game is a wholesome fun story that also has high stakes, and has my fullest recommendation.
DLC1 feels like a proper 'extra stage', complete with its own boss, and has my fullest recommendation.
DLC2 feels more disconnected and is the weakest entry, but it has Parsee and Yamame, so it has my fullest recommendation.
DLC3 feels like a victory lap, and is the best part of the entire game, and has my fullest recommendation.

Buy it. Buy the soundtracks too while you're at it. It's all great.",1685743648,1685743698,True,6,0,0.588633716106414795,0,True,False,False

Even though I don't have many hours in this game it's become one of my favorite games of all time as well as one of the only games I come back to consistently. Since you probably haven't played the game I'll use a simpler explanation. So, imagine animal crossing but you're in a shit ton of debt and run a restaurant. One of the best parts of this game is probably the atmosphere, the world and the characters are all so charming and the game just gives off a homey feeling overall. One thing that definitely helps with this is the soundtrack, the cheery and relaxing soundtrack of this game is a complete masterpiece, especially during the night segment. Go take a listen they have it in some of the videos on the store page its complete fire.

Also, I just dont understand the meaning of the tag ”Japanese Cuisine (和風)“

Another problem is the Japanese translation as I play this with Japanese which is the inconsistency. It is still beta when I writing this review, I can't remember them all but here is some examples:

1. Inconsistency for writing, which sometime use 仮名, sometime use 漢字.
「阿吽」「あうん」

2. Some of the translation still in Chinese/English. It make it very hard to read especially for English , i.e. the 旧地獄‘s quest.

3. Inconsistency for translation, i.e.
「アリス」「アーリス」
「漁師の味噌汁」「海鮮味噌汁」
「蟲の知らせ」「昆虫のお知らせ」？

You gather ingredients, explore Gensokoyo and interact with characters during the day, accepting quests and so on. Actions taken during this phase can impact your business later at night.

At night, you manage an Izakaya (a mobile stall restaurant that serves tasty snacks, meals and drinks), much like a restaurant game sim. You can hire other Touhou characters to help serve drinks and food but never both, so you always have to proactive somewhere in the game unless you hire a full team. Many Touhou characters will appear as special guests with unique tastes that you have to accommodate personally for. If you don't have a dish that quiet fits their needs, you can add extra ingredients to make it more palpable to their taste buds. Satisfy the special guest, and they shower you with rewarding spell cards. Disappoint them, and they punish you with negative spell cards!

It's a surprisingly complex and fun for an indie game, defo worth a purchase; 100% buy it on sale if you're a Touhou fan.

The only negatives are getting used to controls aren't really explained well; esp the rhythm mini-game parts. Minor dialogue typos and errors, and word wrapping when using English on some menus (such as the save menu). The game also saves day-to-day, so you have to see through a full day to play.

Something about this game just makes you ""FEEL GOOD"" It can be casual or intense! But mostly casual...
From the charming characters and art style, to the funny story, or maybe it's just the fact that it's Touhou.

Unlike a lot of other Touhou games this one really plays on getting the know the characters. Your journal is vital and pulling it up will pause the game so you can take your time to read, the more you learn about anybody, the more notes on said person will be added to the game. 

There are the general mob NPC's who are just the filler but also all have there likes and wants as a group.
Then there are the main Touhou cast along with some guest characters, these are the vip's and they will only give you a veg sense of what they want, so getting to know them is vital, and that's when your journal comes in! Preform Well and they will use a spell card that gives you a bonus! Neutral, and nothing really happens. Upset them and your given a penalty which can really throw you off your game.

Pros:
- Addictive game-play loop. 

- The game offers a lax tutorial without telling you too much, only keeping the basics. This allows you to experiment and figure out new parts everyday, keeping the experience fresh and enjoyable!

- Cute story. Personally, I have not followed along too hard but its just silly fun!

- Bonding with the rare characters is simple and strays away from complex systems. I like this simple approach more since some games with a very complex bonding system makes it too tedious and annoying for me. 

Cons:
- Not many hints, forcing you to go through trial and error. Which I think is more of a good thing, I enjoy this process of figuring out how maximize my profits, but I know some people will not like this.

- Extremely simple rhythm game mechanics. Clearly or unclearly, this is not a rhythm focused game and the tiny ""rhythm"" aspect is a simple and cute addition. If you are here for a new rhythm game, this ain't it for you chief. 

- Too easy. Sometimes the game can feel a little easy or simple, especially once you get to the higher levels when it should feel more difficult. That said, this is a more relaxed game and it should not stress you out, but you will never completely deplete a customers patience level. I personally wish there was a hyper or hard mode where failure is more common and punishing.

It starts out simple but evolves into something more intricate as you collect ingredients that you can later use for more elaborate dishes. These lead up to finding the right mix to serve rare guests whom will buff your restaurant for additional revenue. In addition you can interact with guests while not running the restaurant, to learn more about them and even get new recipes or services they can provide. Overall it is a very chill game with great Touhou music and a lots of wacky dishes you can make.

GAMEPLAY

The game has two different modes in one ""day"". On the first half of everyday, Mystia (the owner) have 16 actions (30 minute time slots from 10:00 to 18:00) to explore the world. These include farming resources on the overworld, buying more resources (this doesn't use up time) or interacting with folks. The goal is to prepare yourself for the night and as you advance the plot, you get a lot more options between what to serve, what to collect and who you want to interact.

The better part of the game is the cooking side where you serve customers. For the usual regulars, they will order off the menu but for any rare guest (the named characters from Touhou), you will have fun combining ingredients to make exactly what they want. As you continue to do so, Mystia records notes so you can start serving wacky but desired combinations to hit all their needs such as salad with honey and cicada shells to Cirno since she like strange, sweet and cool in a food. These lead to better ratings and ultimate for rare guests to their spell card to help your business. There's also a music mini game you unlock early on to tap to the beat to provides a buff to improve your restaurant when you cook. This is fitting for Mystia, a bird youkai who sings and cooks. This adds a nice touch and nod to the Touhou series for its very strong soundtracks.

While each part isn't unique, the game has a very smooth flow and connection between both sides and makes for a harmonious experience. Like the dish and drink you serve together, its a strong pairing. 8/10

GRAPHICS

I'm a personal fan of pixel art and love all the CG scenes and art of each of the characters. They are simple but provide a lot of detail. The main issue I have is that Mystia has a lot of different outfits you can unlock but during story plots, she always wears her default one while her overworld sprite does not match that. This doesn't impact all other conversations but is an odd disconnect to everything else that fits.
9/10

MUSIC

This is Touhou's strength so it is no surprise that these are amazing. They're more on the simpler side with their tunes but fits with the games more calm, peaceful gameplay. What is nice is that the songs do change as you get to the second half to the cooking game as more customers show up closer to closing.  In addition, you can support the artists by buying the tracks as they are available as DLC. 10/10

STORY

The story is something out of Touhou, that is to said it's another ""incident"" where something bad happens and it is up to the main character, Mystia rather than the usual Reimu or Marisa, to solve it. If you know the series, its no surprise who is the final boss but there aren't much unique twists and turns along the way. The transition to later regions works but doesn't add anything new for anyone who has played or know the series. For those that don't know, I feel you may be lost at times as most Touhou games assume you're aware of the characters in some form and their personality and traits. That said, the game does teach the player about the characters and their basic traits at the end of it so all is not lost. 6/10

REPLAYABILITY

I actually don't mind playing all the DLCs even though the core game is the same and the main differences are the ingredients and dishes. There isn't a lot added if you play the game from the start again as the same dishes will mostly satisfy the same guests (normal or rare). The only randomness is who shows up and thus the order of the spell cards. There is also a bit of randomness when farming on the overworld and what rare ingredients may show up in the store. Even so I don't mind playing since it is a very chill game where one just cooks and experiments with dishes. 7/10

SUMMARY

While not the strongest game, its a very fun, peaceful game where Mystia cooks every night to serve guests from different parts of Gensokyo (the setting of Touhou). If you're a fan of the series, you'll fit right in from the music to the lore of the game and even the wacky dishes. If not, there's still quite a lot of enjoy from the music and really the large forte of dishes you can make and serve to guests. It is not the most engaging or demanding (until you get a rush of guests) but not every game has to be for it to be enjoyable. 43/50",1679620228,1682363918,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

It has more depth than expected with adding ingredients serving as another way to fulfil the orders without having the 'correct' recipe and many was of serving the special/rare customers. It's definitely worth it for this gameplay loop. Collect ingredients and recipies by day, play a really fun little minigame in the evening.

The art and music are both amazing, in particular the larger scenes - pixel art at it's most gorgeous. 
The music is full of great bops - so much so I've decided to buy the entire OST as well.

The only thing I don't much care for is the amount of dialogue - there's just a lot of really vapid, vacuous back and forth between characters reiterating things they already said dozen of times before (usually really one-note jokes about 'bird brain' main character which, while funny the first time, did not become any funnier after the 20th). I do admit, though, that it might be because I don't really know anything about Touhou - I really didn't care for most of the characters besides maybe Mystia herself, who did have some few chuckle-worthy lines (like the joke about the cost of the new izakaya being higher and higher despite it being the same cart every time).

The story is pretty surface level but it does keep the story going at a nice pace. At the very end, the game basically allows you to complete all the dlc before choosing to go into the final fight, which is nice.

The dlc add more areas, which have fantastic music, and more characters whom honestly feel mostly forgettable (again I'm sure being a fan of the Touhou would change this, but their in-game stories and presentation is nothing special whatsoever). I would say all the dlc is worth the price, however, because of the music, ambience of the izakaya in these areas, the new recipes and, in case of dlc 2 and 3 - the challenges that become available once you hit lvl 5 with all the introduced bond-characters. 

Dlc 2.5 introduces a fun little rhythm game to be played at any map through interaction with a jukebox - which is quite delightful. It's honestly a great timewaster.

Overall, other than the fact I felt obliged to skip most of the dialogue, I'd say this game was absolutely a delight - music was amazing, art was appealing, gameplay loop is incredibly satisfying.

The gameplay loop is quite addictive too, The game is not particularly challenging, but rewards mastery in a snow-balling fashion. There's good amount of variety and complexity, it caters to a few different playstyles and difficulty levels. But the more challenge you take on, the more you can make, and the more you can invest back and make even more. It's that sort of game. Also do prioritize leveling up bond with characters to maximum, they give really sweet rewards, recipes and of course more cute interactions! 
The game is also just great for learning about the Touhou world and characters. I mean, you have to get to know the characters to know what to cook for them! Absolutely recommended!

The ONLY gripe I have with the game is a technical one, it's stuck to 50hz. It may claim whatever 240fps+ framerate but they're all repeat frames, with only an updated cursor. But also, if you don't use a 50/100hz display, you'll have motion judder. If you use a BFI OLED, ULMB LCD or a good-old CRT, you'll find you cannot get clear smooth motion with this game.

if you need more, let me tell you a bit about me and my partner. this is relevant, b/c the most we know about Touhou is the ""Bad Apple"" music video and that there is some pervy stuff out there related to the property, to be honest, i can't believe i found this awesome game randomly in my discovery tab... and since playing it, i get a deluge of pervy games recommended to me. aside from having to bash every pubescent themed porn game that now comes up on my discovery out of existence, it's crazy that getting all of this around $10 so far has been something i've usually poured this much time into something like *Persona* games. it's really a shame the rep this fandom gets in this one specific case, i had to talk my partner into giving this a shot after he blasted through *Recettear* a year ago on my recommendation, and it was a bit of a sell b/c he thought there was gonna be a deluge of pervy shit in this game. so far the only thing besides doll-like girls prancing in cute dresses is a girl providing a pin up on her exposing her leg. still on the creepy meter, but it's Japanese; we'll take what self discipline the creators are capable of when depicting literal children.

the only other problem i've encountered is that this is a project that requires some heavy translation. that means we have to wait for DLCs that have been out in their native language to get localized. as of this time, the mainline DLCs, numbers 1-3 are available. the other thing i've noticed is that while usually the translation is pretty good, w/ some weirdness and strange turns of phrases aside, but rarely there is some notable bad grammar. bad grammar and a little strangeness still means this game is still absolutely understandable and it has not proven a hurdle to enjoying this game. if this were a game that demanded more money i would be more bothered, but i can't overstate how great of a deal this game is.

the overworld game is a little of a letdown, does look like some RPG maker cash grab. i'm sure it was another reason my partner was skeptical that this is a game worth tens of hours. i've come to believe that the little rough edges on this game actually help. i just quit playing *Harvestella* on the Switch, b/c the framerate is SO BAD it's all i think about while the characters are talking about is that the framerate is a quiet additional character, always making itself known. this game is great on the Deck b/c the overworld isn't the main focus, it's just a means of getting what you need until the next night to open your izakaya. this is a game that begs to have nearly every performance bar tweaked down, making this a game that is absolutely entertaining while being a battery sipper. to boot it runs perfectly on the system, no tweaking required.

it's also a game that knows what its gameplay loop is and doesn't bother you w/ extraneous RPG bullshit. although this game will live or die for you based on if you are entertained by the banter between the girls and the meta story. as someone who is prone to turning cute Japanese stuff off (who the fuck started this rumor that *Fire Emblem: Three Houses* has FUN social link cutscenes??) i really like the strange relationships and personalities these girls have and look forward to finding out what recipes these weirdos have for me. and yes, the main villain of the main game is a mukbanging ghost, totally here for it. 

and now for the meat of the game. like i said, this game has so much going for it for the price point, i'm only just getting to the real draw of this game. the nightly izakaya openings prove to be a surprisingly customizable business experience once you start opening up more. the *Recettear* comparison i made for this game really comes through w/ the fact that you're a girl saddled w/ debt. but where that game featured one big lump of horrible debt incurred by a disappearing papa, this game is driven by both the main character's dreams and ambitions and a villain she slowly becomes aware of that she must learn to be a peerless restaurateur to satiate a bottomless pit of a customer whose hunger is literally world ending awaiting her someday in her future. the gameplay loop is waking each day and you usually get a choice of where to go and what to do. you gather ingredients (try to harvest as much crap off the ground for free to feed scrub customers and get ingredients w/ special tags to make special guests happy enough to rain free gifts and buffs on you) and talk to people to progress your locations, your restaurants, your recipe books, your customer base, your employee pool, your friendships, and your bank account. the game is really not that unforgiving once you figure out how to make money, keep it, AND PAY ATTENTION TO DEBT DUE DATES IN YOUR TASK TAB.

this is just a great game to get into a flow state and let a day's stress melt away. you feel rewarded for getting to know your youkai besties and searching for free stuff off the ground to feed to unsuspecting poors and aristocrats alike.

There is no action gameplay and no dungeons - which is an improvement as those were arguably the least fun portions of that game - the game is also somehow way less comfy than Recettear as each night handling Izakaya is a hectic rush of preparing dishes for 3 - 8 different tables of clients. This can get a bit tiring as there is no option to speed up the process when night is slow or slow it down when there is too much to handle save kicking out the customers which is never good.
It is still rather hard to fail and later on you can get trio of different helpers to make opening the restaurant almost full automatic so in the end the game has weird difficulty curve where it's hardest at the beginning and easiest at the end.
Game is also very pleasing to the senses with its cute graphics and amazing arrangements of ZUN's tracks from mainline Touhou games. It's also fun to chat up various residents of Gensokyo in between tasks thou it sometimes feels like game would benefit a lot from trying to mimic the brief conversation style from mainline games as sometimes a chat between two characters can rival Kojima in levels of length and saying much without saying nothing of substance.
Additionally while playing the game is fun it starts to get grating by the very end especially if you try to grin for perfect ending and/or all of the achievements since doing all of Sakuya's tasks is an exercise in patience. DLC unfortunately doesn't help in keeping the game fresh as it's just doing same things with slightly more ingredients and characters to handle. Personally I think it's reasonable to get the DLC's with Touhou characters you personally like and avoid the rest.
Overall I think this game would score a solid 7/10, bump it to 8 if you are a fan of Touhou Project",1680099166,1680099166,True,2,0,0.504950463771820068,0,True,False,False

I bought the game due to its warm and comfy looking atmosphere, but what I ended up with was the opposite. Ended up having to have the game's wiki open and constantly pausing the game to remember what Tanuki and Neko customers liked aside from meat, taste mechanic the game only slightly hints at.  

 Game starts off with LVL 1 stand, which is comfortable enough to execute the gimmick mini-rhythm game mechanic and deal with constant repeat orders. Once LVL 2 hit though, game because extremely stressful. Limited amount of utilities to cook with and a hoard of customers wanting the same damn thing, regardless of how diversified the menu was. Did it once as it was an event the game coaxes the player into, and never again. LVL 1 becomes slow and boring, LVL 2 is just mayhem. 

I bought the game expecting comfy, as I have several other games that are sweaty and focus intensive, I did not need another game along the same line. Thoroughly disappointed on the pacing of the game, day time exploration is just time management simulator once newer areas open up, as you have to keep tabs on what you have available while trying to fulfill quests, honestly the game does too much for it to be comfortable or fun. Stopped playing all together, would rather be doing runs in Gunfire Reborn, which is honestly less stressful than this game. 

Positive reviews seem to rave about the pixel art and atmosphere. Do not buy this game expecting it to be a fun de-stresser. Just another Touhou bait game.",1678481404,1678481404,False,5,3,0.426019817590713501,0,True,False,False

I will update this review when I am further in, but Mystia's Izakaya seems to hit a soft spot for me.

The characters are cute and engaging, the fetching of ingredients isn't annoying at all and the actual cooking for the guests of Mystia's izakaya is really fun. Also, the progression after a night of serving dishes feels very rewarding.

[b][u]Addendum I:[/u][/b]
My initial eighty minutes playtime have now turned into 6 hours, and the game is still a huge blast! The further you progress with the relationships (side quests) and the main story, the more recipes you unlock to later serve your costumers. Special guests, as well as a rising number of normal costumers you'll have to cook the right meals for, keep the game engaging and challenging.

The game features a time management system. Travelling from one location to another as well as gathering  ingredients each make thirty minutes pass, until the izakaya opens its doors at exactly 6:00pm. At no point does this mechanic make you feel stressed out, because recources are so easy to come by that you will always have enough for the upcoming cooking session. The costumers also have a timer clocking down, but at my stage of progression it is almost impossible to let it run out without actively ideling around for a large amount of time. The deadline of the first main quest makes it seem like it won't be easy to collect enough [spoiler]money[/spoiler] to [spoiler]pay of your [b]first[/b] debt[/spoiler], but shortly before the due date [spoiler]your pay is increased[/spoiler].

Gameplay is like a hybrid of Recettear and Diner Dash with more of an emphasis on building relationships with character. The pixel art is immensely charming, the music is excellent, and the translation is generally pretty good (there are a few hiccups here and there- especially in regards to somewhat stilted English- but if you're familiar with Asian games it's nothing new).

My only real complaint is that the game feels too easy. Compared to Recettear, money is far too easy to come by and repaying the loans your growing business requires was never something I had to worry about. I also found the final boss to be a bit too straightforward and simple. In general, I think rare guests would have benefited from some sort of ""novelty"" mechanic, so you can't just feed them the same dish three or four times.

That aside, if you're a Touhou fan, this is among the very best of fan games. Even if you're not, if you enjoy games built around economics and running a small business, this is the game for you.

Even if you have basically no idea about the setting of touhou, this cute game will be a great introduction. You play as a birb brained dummy called Mistya. She’s a sparrow youkai, who spends her time frying lampreys and singing… well, apparently in the main games its kinda more sinister with hypnotizing people using nonsense music and scamming them but lets put that away for a while… Ekhm, anyway, you have a chill life of gathering ingredients, learning new recipes, making frens and selling your cookery. Soon however, you are forced into debt due to some totally not contrived circumstances planned by someone who lurks behind the scenes. The debt mechanic pushes the story forward, as well as pushing you to constantly improve.
The game is split into two phases – day and night.
During the day you collect ingredients, talk with people and solve most quests. You can also pre-cook some meals for the night but it can be risky – any cooked meal you don’t sell is wasted and you lose it as well as ingredients that made it. Your friends are all from the cast of touhou games and mythos – a peach growing celestial delinquent, a not-blind girl who keeps running into trees, ZEH JAPANIZU GOBURIN!, an annoying prankster scammer bunny I want to strangle AND MORE. By hanging out, talking with and completing quests of these characters you get various items. Sometimes it’s a costume, sometimes it’s an item with some kind of special effect. Most often however, they are recipes, which are important for game progression. The more recipes you have, the more customer types you can serve and the more money you can squeeze out of them.
The recipes as well as ingredients have their own ‘tags’. For example ‘cool’, ‘vegan’ ‘sweet’ ‘weird’ etc. Each type of customer who visits you at night has different preferences. Even the generic npcs – a bunny youkai will prefer veggies, a snek youkai will like meat and sake… for some reason lol. However, special characters will have harder to understand tastes. That annoying bug girl Wriggle might come and say “Are you one of those weirdos who likes their steak well-done?”. What the hell does it mean? Well, its a small riddle, all special characters have these riddles to make the game just a tad bit harder. In this case wriggle was asking for something with a ‘raw’ tag. However, if instead you gave her a dish with ‘strange’ tag, she’d still like it, just less. That’s because Wriggle likes her dishes raw or strange. Thankfully all likes and dislikes of various guests are written down as soon as Mistya discovers them. You can access her notes at any time so if some request doesn’t make sense you can hopefully figure it out using your notes. If your special clients are satisfied or insulted enough, they give you spell cards. This time, they don’t cause an epileptic shock from looking at a fuckton of flying bullet balls. Instead they do stuff like increasing your profits, calling up new clients, giving you rare ingredients or summoning cute animals that make people give more tips lol.
The punishment spell cards can disable some of your cooking appliances, make you blind for a time, summon insects to scare people away, steal your booze, etc. Best keep your frens satisfied… OR ELSE!
There’s more interesting mechanics at night – you can only put a limited amount of food and drinks on the menu, you get a mini-rhythm game mechanic where you earn bonus buffs(and it dynamically changes depending on the CURRENTLY PLAYING BACKGROUND MUSIC!), you have a helper who can deliver foods or drinks in your place, you get combos that boost your income… but the longer I gush about the game the closer I get to the character limit and I still have a lot to say ;_;
Instead of gathering ingredients one can also buy them or have a friend help gather them. There are many regions though, all with different ingredients and different clients if you decide to open your izakaya there. Most actions in daytime cost time – travelling, cooking, gathering and some interactions with npcs. So you have to plan accordingly. Later on you’ll be able to teleport using money instead of time but by then, money is barely an issue.
Still, there are a few negatives – there’s a lot of recipes and they are pretty weirdly sorted, not all dlcs are translated though that’s understandable for a doujin studio. Some customer riddles are really convoluted and dumb – no idea if they want something ‘aura bursting’ ‘strength boosting’ or just ‘hot’. Some of those tags are also kinda weird – what the hell is ‘aura bursting’? All clients have a limit to their money, but you don’t see it. When wanting to maximize profit or just not sell them something that will bankrupt them and piss them off it’s annoying to not know how much cash they have. Maybe some item or rhythm game boost could let you do that?
Still, it is a massively positive, chill game. A great introduction to touhou for non-fans, a great fan game for fans. A chill restaurant game for casuals or a fast paced serve-em-up for those who want to play it that way. The music is heavenly and the story is cute.

But seriously, its a good restaurant management simulation game. The elements being introduced to you by the game per day is engaging. You scavenge ingredients by day, and open an izakaya at night with tons of gameplay systems to either help or challenge you. The first week is kinda slow, but its a good tutorial week to really ramp up the orders once you open a bigger space with far more special customers who keep the dynamic gameplay engaging.

The translation is quite above average, some UI elements arent perfect, but overall a very good recommendation if you want to scratch that resteraunteur itch.

Despite what one may claim, man has a tendency to fulfill the desires it is lacking, unconciously.


    After passing by an aisle the width of Mars' moon phobos full of action shotters, yet more mobile cash, and puzzle optimization puzzles there was a lone game, flanked by all of the aforementioned boring games, and its cover so colorful and pastelized that recognizing the quantity of moe contained within took minutes of eye-adaption. The choice to put it in your hand was imminent and impulsive, though you knew nothing of the journey lying ahead.

Touhou’s intellectual property is known for being a fangame free-for-all since ZUN is surprisingly comfortable with people using setting of Gensokyo and its residents for their own projects. Results of this arrangement can vary in quality, but often times you can encounter a beautiful gems laying on the ground.

While we are definitely talking about valuables right here, Touhou Mystia’s Izakaya punches even higher above that. This title not only should satiate curiosity of the Touhou fans but also deserves to be experienced by much wider audience. Game oozes with great atmosphere and engaging gameplay, despite not looking that much special on paper.

Daytime sections seem to be pointless at the very beginning, but that assumption quickly disappears after you outgrow your starting location. Suddenly, half of the game becomes a little time management puzzle of planning which ingredients to pluck out from nature or which NPC with a sidequest to visit and talk to. Most actions take a chunk of time from your schedule and you want to be sure that your restaurant is stocked with everything you need for a successful night.

Nighttime brings out cooking, customer serving and rhythm minigame in a very arcade-like package. Difficulty isn’t steep, so you can take your time and have a cozy experience. However, if you risk it for the biscuit - trying to feed the most amount of people, in the best way possible - game becomes frantic fun, as orders come, go and leave a positive review sound effects ringing in your ears. Special rare clients also throw an enjoyable wrench into your gears – where you are granted great rewards and status buffs when you interpret their cryptic tastes correctly, but also get punished in funny ways when you serve them a wrong dish by mistake or accident.

Both daytime and nighttime gameplay styles are good on their own, but Mystia’s Izakaya overarching structure hold ups as well. You could argue it can get a little repetitive over time, since each new location you unlock works more or less the same and side quests are very similar to each other. In spite of that, various story events and cute character interactions with surprisingly good writing will keep you occupied and should counteract any familiar bits. Music should keep you great company as well, since most of the arrangements provided are perfect match to the game’s specific tone. Pixel art is also amazing, although one could wish that some objects in the game world could get at least few frames of animation.

The only problems I could point out against the game are various nitpicks and spotty polish in few places.  I do wish there was an optional hard mode difficulty. Some art could be improved a little bit and few lines of dialogue could have their translations corrected. List of possible improvements should be considered long, but its nature only betrays the independent origin of this title and how enjoyable throughout this game is - despite its deficiencies.

Touhou Mystia's Izakaya had no business being this good. For the base price – it is an absolute steal. I wholeheartly recommend trying your luck with grilling some Lampreys and cooking a nice Ramen soup for yourself to enjoy.",1674858549,1674858549,True,18,0,0.670270979404449463,0,True,False,False

-----JOJO MEMES TIME-------
My name is Mystia Lorelei. Running a catering business for 33 days. My hut is in the central section of the youkai trail, where is a pivot to connect all other places in the game, and I am not married. I work as the proprietress for the Mystia's Izakaya , and I got to work every day by 6 PM at the earliest. I don’t smoke, but I occasionally drink. I’m in bed by 12 PM and make sure I get ten hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm sparrow sake and jotting my daily life about twenty minutes before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning.

I was told there was a close friend who's deeply indebted. I’m trying to explain that I’m a person who wishes to hold a concert and a bigger Izakaya. I also take care not to trouble my friend into such an awkward situation, like being pushed to pay off the debt or lose one leg, which would cause me to devote my endeavor to larger business to earn more. That is how I treat my friend and dream, and I know that is what brings me happiness.

Either way, the restaurant management genre is remarkably difficult to pull off.

Mystia's Izakaya is one of the few experiences out there that serves as the one star Michelin star of restaurant sims compared to titles like Crossroads Inn, Restaurant Empire, Recipe for Disaster or Chef. Taking place in the popular Touhou Project setting. This game serves a hearty meal that earned it's overwhelmingly positive rating. 

The premise focuses on the one of the members of the weakest Youkai, Mystia Lorelei, most infamous for being devoured by the main antagonist Yuyuko from Perfect Cherry Blossom. After a disastrous dinner service that is about to have her devoured again. Keine saves her and sends her back to several months earlier where she was tasked to saving her friend from debt, little do she know. Her debt goes beyond a mere 3000 yen as the fate of Gensokyo hangs in the balance. The game is a faithful fan game for the Touhou setting, featuring an expanding cast of well known characters such as Marisa, Reimu and Sanae as well as Mystia's fellow yokai Cirno, Wriggle and Rumia. 

Gameplay wise it is similar to Diner dash and Traveller's rest. Being an RPG Maker type game where you goal is to make as much money as possible in a two week limit with side stories and the cast of Touhou serving as both friend and foe to your success in the kitchen. In the daytime, Mystia has to procure ingredients for her dishes at a restaurant by either buying, gathering or asking friends to find stuff to give her. In the evening she runs her Izakaya proper, having to make sure the patrons have something that fits their price range as well as what they want to eat. 

What makes the game stand out is the cooking system is about fulfilling tags, some tags are mutual exclusive (For example, you can have meat or vegetarian, filling or small portion, mild or savory) and others are dishes that are incompatible with the ingredient (Like your signature grilled lampreys) where attempts at culinary creativity may result in a dark matter disaster. It is also through these tags you meet the culinary demands of your toughest food critics, the cast of touhou. As I mentioned earlier, some like Rumia want raw meat while others like Reimu hates food that strips her of what little money she makes from her shrine and demands cheap and filling food. Meeting those tags requires you to build a scaling staircase of satisfied rare dinner guests who offers new recipes. The difficult cycle is mild for a Touhou game, but extra challenges will require you to have decent kitchen equipment, a good store of ingredients and remembering what does guest want. So far I have no problem with the dinner guests save the scripted ones. But the challenge for me is trying to be as creative as possible with themed menus everyday.

The 8bit graphics don't deter the game from being enjoyable as it provides the game with vibrant food art and cg designs and adorable sprite gifs.

If there is only one con of the game it is the fact that algorithim recommended me adult games as a result. I guess when your game is cheap, it also attracts other cheap adult games without the quality that Mystia Izakaya has

Overrall, Mystia's Izakaya is a welcome addition to the Touhou fangame lineup as one of the must plays, and for the price you are paying. It is like that soy chicken joint, it's cheap but delicious and worth a buy.",1673756145,1673756228,True,14,0,0.677554428577423096,0,True,False,False

During the day it's a relaxing experience where you can wander around the town at your leisure, collecting ingredients, fulfilling quests and talking to the various waifu characters and such. This part is pretty chill, with RPGmaker vibes, cute art and so on.

In the evening, however, you open up your restaurant and the experience descends into chaos as you rush around cooking stuff, preparing food and drinks, serving customers, trying to keep everyone happy and make big money before you close at midnight. 

The flow of the game is really nice, that juxtaposition between the tranquillity of the day and the stress/chaos of the evenings. And the game has a very satisfying progression system where you make money, expand your restaurants, acquire more complicated equipments/recipes/ingredients, and build closer relationships with the other characters. The art, sound, music and quality are all superb.

However, the game is WAY too long. It took me 40 hours to do the main story. Things start to get pretty repetitive after the 20 hour mark. By the last half I had unlimited money and resources and I was just waiting for the game to end, which it does automatically after around 90 in-game day/night cycles.

You play in day cycles during the morning/day gathering or buying ingredients, talking to villagers, prepping meals for the restaurant & doing any side missions you might have. Then night time you are running the restaurant serving food to the customers.
The game is designed you progress each day which keeps it at a good pace so you do not plow through levels or progress to quickly. The games pace is cute, fun & relaxing. As you level the restaurant up it can get more challenging adding more tables etc.
The added special customer is fun as you have to cook based off there likes and dislikes. Good food results in a good card, bad results in a bad card which both effect you & your restaurant.
The NPC characters are cute & there dialog is fun. You can gain friendship levels with them. There are more areas to unlock & explore.

This game is incredibly cheap for the many hours of fun it's given me. Highly recommend!

Highlights:
- Adorable character designs
- Fun gameplay loop
- Lovely pixel art, especially the food 
- Post-round/night summary with most popular food, drinks, any wastage and a financial overview
- Sassy, fun characters that interact well
- Rush of dopamine whenever Wriggle gathers a ton of stuff for me 
- Low price
- Lots of DLC (I haven't started it yet)
- Dev team are obviously passionate (it's a doujin team/spin off work) with lots of updates

It's hit the perfect blend of time-management and zen for me.
The main story is very achievable given the timeframes, but you can still aim for perfect combos nightly.

You play as Misty, a little Izakaya owner, and help her create her dream restaurant! The story is funny, light-hearted and so very charming. Every character is unique and has their own likes and dislikes that you cater towards, the time crunch for operating hours doesn't feel stressful yet keeps you bouncing from order-to-order through the night. During the day you run around collecting ingredients and befriending your customers as well as expanding your area, and completing little tasks around the world to help out local youkai 

And for the price? i'd easily pay at [i]least[/i] $20 bucks for this game, so for it to be $8.50 [$5.95 on sale when i got it] quit readin' the reviews and buy it !! it's worth it, trust me. The only real ""issue"" with the game is that the translation gets a bit choppy here and there, but it doesn't impact your playthrough at all, and its only on a few lines- if anything; it makes it better haha!

The amount of achievements are also a massive bonus for any fellow achievement hunters!! 

Only thing i'd like is more steam point shop items !! I'd love a Wriggle avatar or emoji set for my profile

Seriously, this game is very good; it's a very engaging restaurant simulator with the cute characters created by ZUN presented in a visually pleasing semi-pixelated art style. The mechanics are easy to grasp. The main sources of difficulty are acquiring the ingredients on time (before the working hours of the Izakaya), pleasing the clients, making enough money to pay back the (((Yakumo moneylenders))) and the Yuyuko culinary boss fights later in the game. There is a bit of a puzzle element to the game, as some clients, especially the named Touhou character-clients, prefer some food types over the others; thus Mystia's little notebook is a must read before, during and after every working session. Pleasing those named clients reward extra tips and bonus spell cards, while displeasing them (ignoring their orders, serving disliked food) may result in them leaving or issuing malus spell cards against you. The player should also try to complete the extra tasks given by Gensokyo's characters and the Bunbumaru newspaper before the working hours of the restaurant because their rewards are usually very useful (money, special currency, rare ingredients, friendship points, etc.).

""Touhou Mystia's Izakaya"" was originally developed by a Chinese team of Touhou fans. As of the writing of this analysis, most of the game has been translated to English but some untranslated text can be found here and there. I estimate the ratio 90% / 10% translated vis-á-vis untranslated (including the DLCs). I'm certain the developers are working on that, because they are active in the Discussions section and listen to the feedback of the players. This great game only got better. They also included in the game extra characters from collaborations with other Touhou game developers. It's nice to see such solidarity.

Quite a unique addition as this is not a style I usually play but found it enjoyable. As a Touhou fan love the characters, setting, and style. Game manages to be frantic, yet relaxing at the same time, much like main-steam games. Building relations and experimenting with foods were my favorite aspects of the game. I'd like to add some info that I wish I knew at the start. Building relations results in new recipes, which is made very clear. However each section of the map has characters who can be asked to gather all the resources there once you built max relation with them. I wish I knew this earlier as I could have spent less time gathering lampreys, and more time building relations.

Ima put a spoiler for the ending here, as I'd like to share my experience so beware
[spoiler]The second wave of the final mission gives you a bunch of bad spellcards. This idea is amazing, and since I rarely got them it was a fantastic challenge.  However Meiling has an ability that breaks a table, and thus removes a guest. I think she actually made it easier as there were fewer punishment cards going off. Unsure what I'd do to fix it. A larger issue was the 3rd wave. Cooking for Yuyuko seemed anti-climatic compared to the prior wave. I quickly found what she enjoyed and kept throwing it at her, It and I didn't feel too creative. I think the ending should require you to cook with a huge variety of tags instead of focusing only on set qualities. Yuyuko could ask for a spicy western, or a legendary strange meal next etc. As you go through if you keep using the same tags she will get bored. Really felt like my large repertoire of recipes was useless here.[/spoiler] 

I'm still playing as there is more to the game than this ending. I'm looking forward to realizing Mystia's dream. Also have the DLC to look forward to as well. First Chinese developed game I have played and feels good that we can share the same enjoyment from this series.

While being a Touhou fan game: it's very un-touhou like. 

The only thing that carries over from Touhou is the characters. 
The game-play is like Cooking Mama and Stardew valley mixed together with a hint of animal crossing. 

The main game of cooking for your customers, and friends is simple to understand, but hard to master. There is a surprising amount of depth with how you can mix and match different recipes with ingredients to maximize customer happiness. 
As you progress further this depth is furthered by the introduction of employees and different levels of your Izakaya. 

The game is not hard by any means, but the few boss fights in the game can create a surprising amount of tension when the timer gets close to zero. 

All this backed by an amazing chip-tune soundtrack full of remixes of classic Touhou songs, and original pieces. 
It even has some fully voice acted and sung songs for the intro, and credits. 

All in all: this game has an insane amount of love and care put into it. 
It's truly one of, if not the best Touhou fangame. It stands side by side with Luna nights.

The food was absolutely delicious, with a wide variety of dishes to choose from. I started with the edamame, which was perfectly cooked and seasoned, and then moved on to the Takoyaki, which were crispy and full of flavor. For my main course, I ordered the grilled salmon, which was cooked to perfection and served with a delicious teriyaki sauce.

The service at Touhou Mystia's Izakaya was also top-notch, despite the fact that the restaurant was almost destroyed by a crazy diner who was unhappy with their meal. The owner, a young girl named Mystia, managed to calm the situation and even continued to cook and serve customers by herself with the ingredients she had gathered. It was truly impressive to see her determination and dedication to providing a great dining experience.

Overall, I had a wonderful experience at Touhou Mystia's Izakaya and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for delicious Japanese cuisine in a warm and welcoming atmosphere. The owner, Mystia, is a true gem and her hard work and dedication to her customers is truly admirable. I can't wait to go back and try some of the other dishes on the menu!

Beyond excellent restaurant management game and a great entry point to the Touhou ""universe"" or whatever you call it (it's my first Touhou-related anything but my Touhou friends highly recommended it). Art, graphics and gameplay are all super polished. 

You are Mystia, a timid-but-determined bird-girl (I heard she has a lore justification for running a restaurant involving grilled lamprey). You get into the restaurant business to stop a shyster catgirl from breaking your friend's nico-nico-kneecaps over an unpaid debt. It's one of my favorite intro chapters in gaming.

Each day you gather ingredients and drinks with a limited number of time slots to use. Getting the most and best ingredients feels like a skill you'll never fully master. Then, your preparations come to fruition as you serve fine meals to the unique denizens of Gensokyo, learning their tastes and cashing tips to avoid leg-crippling debt. Actually running the restaurant has a perfect balance between frantic and calm. The max-level izakaya attracts dozens of customers, but time stops when you interact with cooking equipment or your notebook.

The secret sauce in this game is how satisfying it is to play for dozens of hours:

- You slowly befriend a fascinating cast of characters: youkai (monster-people), shrine maidens, onis, and more. Each is fun to talk to and unique. Their spell cards are an excellent opportunity to admire the cute-AF pixel art.

- You gain access to new areas, invest into new locations, and discover new ingredients to satisfy ever more exotic tastes. Mastering the ever-increasing layers of complexity is satisfyingly profitable.

- You'll upgrade your cooking skills and equipment.

- Finally, you help Mystia and Kyouko (the friend and extortion victim mentioned above) achieve their dream of holding an epic concert, and, tbh, that's pretty rad for this pair of cinnamon buns.

A true work passion and love worth thrice the price. Buy this game if you're even remotely interested in cooking games, management games, and cute anime girls.",1669201576,1670707997,True,36,2,0.782328605651855469,0,True,False,False

Tried and true casual restaurant gameplay, like all those papa's pizzaria games but with adorable pixel art touhou girls, ""Mystia's Touhouria"" if you will. Very satisfying to play and the rare customers system keeps you on your toes and prevents each night of play from getting dull. My monkey brain loves to see the numbers go up

Story plot-wise isn't much to write home about, you're solving another incident but with time with Mystia's cooking. However, the bits of lore, history, and jokes you come across are really what I read the dialogue for. Mystia is particular is so endearing, always being strung along by the other stronger beings, while she's too much of bird-brain so see that she's obviously not the one in control of the whole scenario. 

I also HAVE to mention the artwork in this game. It is beyond precious and anytime a new CG comes up I just have to take a second to admire it, as well as screenshot. Each CG on their own would really be perfect for a desktop BG. The contrast of the soft colors and whimsical atmosphere combined with harsh pixel lines is really something else. Seriously, the game is beyond gorgeous and unlike anything else I've seen. The ONLY complaint I would have to make (and it's very small) is that there's something off to me about the chibi-style overworld sprites, they don't feel quite as polished as everything else you see. Maybe it's the proportions or shape of the faces? It just feels really boxy, but that's just me hunting for something to nitpick about with the art honestly.

I've loved restaurant sims since they were browser games where you had to manage making a milkshake for one customer and cotton candy for another before people got fed up and left. I had hopes a few years ago when Little Dragon Cafe was announced, but when it launched the reviews pointed to a lack of emphasis on the cafe management aspect and my hopes were dashed. And now by chance and the power of the Touhou Project, in comes Mystia the night sparrow and her lamprey stand.

If you don't know Touhou, that's okay. This game has no battles of bullets (unless they're hiding in one of the DLCs), so just accept that the world is full of youkai and no one is human unless the story says so and you'll be alright. The characters are all displayed beautifully, from the first appearance of Mystia rushing to Kyouko's aid to the moment the curse is broken and the subject of your waking nightmare starts to cry about how delicious all the food is. This is one of the few casual sim games to make me cry from emotion, and maybe I'm just a sap, but every time you progress in bond with a character I can feel the emotion in it.

Unlike most sim games, time only passes in this game when you do something that makes it pass. No need to worry if you forgot to pause; as long as you don't change maps or go hunting for resources you'll be fine. Oh--or you stop to invite someone to the izakaya, which was how I used up most of my time once I started forming bonds and unlocking that option.

Money in the game is also not really a problem. It's a resource, but as long as you read the tags for special customers and keep stocked up on popular drinks, you'll only need to choose between a bit more shopping and a higher-commission partner for the evening. I never worried about scrounging for money. At one point I realized I'd been overshopping and only had two days left to pay the debt. I did it anyway. It makes the game feel relaxing rather than stressful to know that money is cheap.

Your real resources in the game are ingredients. I've lamented not having the time to cover all the shops in all the DLC maps in one in-game day, much less all the gathering points. I spent more than one trip just hitting CTRL (""buy all of it"") at every vendor I could get to, because I could get money more easily than I could get those five more cuts of pork. But being able to twist in whatever flavors I wanted, and see pink dialogue and reward spell cards pop up from every special customer, made it worth it.

Objectively, even I have to admit the game isn't perfect. For some reason although Steam says that my cloud status is up to date, I've been missing my most recent save each time I change computers. I'd also like to see the system of filtering recipes improved; tags aren't alphabetical and sometimes I've had to go a circuitous route to get the keyboard controls to select a tag at all. An option to sort more or save recipes as favorites of special customers would be nice too. But that's objective. Subjectively, none of those things makes me love the game any less. Aside from having to decide where to pick up the game again, it doesn't make me want to play any less. So while I could point to some flaws and areas I'd like to see improved, I still stand by this being my perfect game. 10/10",1669415223,1669415223,True,11,0,0.614035129547119141,0,True,False,False

[i]Touhou Mystia's Izakaya[/i] is a deep cooking and light business management kind of RPG game. You will be playing as Mystia Lorelei, a night sparrow-youkai, a Japanese folklore demon, intent on running an Izakaya, a Japanese street food and alcohol stand serving humans, youkai, fairies and spirits alike in order to clear debts and to hold a concert. YES, A CONCERT IS A BIG DEAL FOR OUR SPARROW OVER HERE!!!

In the game as you roaming in the beautiful land of Gensokyo during the day, you will be expected to do some foraging ingredients [spoiler](give me a déjà vu of Stardew Valley and Harvest Moon)[/spoiler]. As the night comes, you will be planning your food and drinks menu based on the amount of ingredients you have in your inventory and open your stall. You will be cooking up meals, dashing here and there to serve the foods and drinks to your customers on time.

There is also a mini rhythm game while you cook - where it allows you to gain various of buffs that could help manage your stall better on that night itself. The cooking system also provides lots of personal touches and experimentation so that you could create the perfect meal to satisfy your customers’ taste preferences especially the rare and special guests. There are also times where the news will inform you regarding the current popular or unpopular food trends – which is very helpful when you are considering what menu to offer for the night.

In term of character development, I find each of the characters so full of personality and with their own individualistic storylines. This plays out while you are roaming and communicating with them during the day or when they drop by your stall to dine in your food during the night. This leads on to a very profound and gratifying relationship system that allow you to gain new recipes and ingredients to various buffs when you feed them the right dish at the right time.

Overall, it is an incredibly relaxing and enjoyable game. I absolutely adore how stunning the pixel visual art is as they are so lively and vibrant in their expression and personalities. The music and soundtracks are fitting accompaniment to the game. Everything from the mechanics and music to the artwork harmonizing together so well to create a captivating and absorbing gameplay experience.

-The art style is great. This was one of the selling points of the game for me. It is pretty unique and cute, it fits the game perfectly. The character designs from the original Touhou series transfer over to this art style nicely.
-The gameplay is fun. It is easy to understand and enjoy. Preparation phase, consisting of collecting resources, as well as befriending the many different NPCs the game has. If you preform certain actions, time will progress until it hits a certain time. Then serving dishes to customers, accumulating combo and earning funds to meet certain objectives. The funds earned depend on the dishes and drink value served. You earn many dishes as you progress through the game. With the introduction of many different areas and styles, it adds a bit of variety to the experience. I was always looking forward to what was in store when moving to another area. 
-The mechanics are well done. There is a bit of complexity to the game, with the addition of rare customers, these are NPCs you may befriend when exploring the areas during the preparation time. They will ask for dishes that fill out certain tags. Giving them dishes that make them happy will give spell card bonuses based on the character and also raises their friendship. Giving them dishes they hate will give debuffs on the other hand. This is interesting and there are lots of shenanigans you can pull with the bonuses to earn extra funds. It adds a nice element of strategy to the game. The story missions are creative with the restrictions the game's mechanics in mind, they are challenging, but enjoyable. 
The kizuna system is nice too. As you progress, you can befriend many different NPCs on the way. Raising friendship through means like talking to them during preparation phase or giving them great food in serving phase. As you raise the friendship, you earn many different dishes that help expand your arsenal. These dishes are great, they can be used for the many quests or make it easier to satisfy the rare NPCs. As you raise the friendship higher, you can earn certain permanent benefits, cosmetics or more quality of life or features. I love these rewards and they add a lot of incentive to befriend the NPCs.

  There are a few nitpicks,  or things that I would like to point out. This section may contain spoilers near the end so please be cautious. I will try to tag them if possible. 
-There are a few UI bugs, or scenarios where certain lines are not translated outside of the DLC, but I assume they will be fixed eventually. They don't really take away much from the experience thankfully
-The English translation is not the best, but it is understandable. I understand that learning a language is hard, but I thought it actually added some charm to the dialogue and leads to some funny lines. I'm looking forward to the translation of the DLCs too. 
-The progression can be predictable or repetitive at times, from a critical standpoint. The areas follow the same format of 3 NPCs, collect resources from the area and certain recipes from certain NPCs to upgrade your izakaya. The gameplay is still enjoyable and relaxing, but it is something I have to point out. 
-There are some weird RNG or luck elements, for example [spoiler]There is a collaboration NPC during the human village izakaya that will ask for western cuisine and high alcohol, which is unreasonable at the point of progression, she can stay for a few meals depending on luck, kicking her out will ruin the combo which seems unfavourable; during the re-challenge of the final mission, phase 2 can be completely luck dependant as you can get some really unfavourable spell debuffs that halt the run, preventing you from collecting spellcards, the final phase seems to be a little luck dependant too, it requires you to give perfect meals, but the guest will sometimes only ask for normal meals, which means the bar will not go up, it can really screw over the run sometimes.[/spoiler]
-[spoiler]I would also like to see a little bit more post game content as well, there isn't really much to do after the final mission. There isn't really much of a use for the funds either after the final payment. The funds just sit there. I would also like to see more sparrow levels or a way to upgrade the sparrow tune chance to 100% 
There are some scenarios where you can get extremely unlucky and have to sit through many seconds of the sparrow tune minigame for higher level foods, it can be a slog sometimes.[/spoiler]

Overall it is an amazing and enjoyable game, props to the developers, they did an amazing job. Sorry if the format or grammar isn't as great. I'm not very used to writing reviews, but I'd love to express my gratitude and experience of the game. I'm really interested in what other areas, the developers have in store for the next DLCs. Thank you for reading this review and have a nice day.

The story is reasonably well written and the gameplay is engaging without being either simplistic or overwhelming.  The game tests both your memory and your reflexes with an overwhelming number of tasks and details to keep in mind, but also let you pause and review an ingame notebook full of recipes, preferences character notes and so on at any time, meaning the game is exactly as challenging as you want it to be, tempered only by your patience.

1: Tewi
Currently, I think Tewi is currently unfair to the player, as the only ways to avoid having your combo broken is to either get lucky and have Reimu visit your restaurant first, or to fork over ridiculous amounts of money. While I think Tewi's concept is good, I think her prices are way too high. I believe that Tewi would feel fair if she sold common items for a much lower (but still fairly high) amount. For example, 1 egg for 200 yen. I feel that this would make the option of buying from Tewi to avoid a broken combo actually viable, and give the player another option than simply relying on RNG to have Reimu come first.

2: Pacing
In its current state, I feel that it takes far too long to make story progress. Often, I will have reached the amount necessary to pay off my debt and still be required to stay at my current point in the game for around 10 more days. While I recognize the importance of the scripted story events, I wish they would all simply happen in order once you unlock a new location, then allow you the option to pay off your debt and move to the next location once that section's story has been completed or allow you to continue until the deadline. I feel that would greatly improve the pacing of the game, allowing skilled players to avoid stagnation while still giving less skilled players time to pay off their debt.

3: Fast Travel
As it stands, the fast travel system feels useless. Far-away areas like the Palace of Earth Spirits and Youkai Mountain feel inaccessible, as by the time you reach them, it's almost time to open your Izakaya. I feel that this system should be changed so that it takes one hour to fly anywhere, making distant locations explorable and giving a reason to walk to nearby destinations.

4: Frog Shrine
Personally, I love cosmetics and unlockable content. However, I hate this game's system of unlocking them. I feel that having to spend two hours praying to the shrine for 4 coins when unlockables cost upwards of 20 is unbalanced and consumes an unreasonable amount of the player's time. I believe it should be adjusted so the first prayer gives you four or five coins, and each consecutive prayer gives you one coin and a random item from the shrine's item pool. I feel that this would allow players who want the unlockables to obtain them without sacrificing large amounts of their very limited time to unlock them, and give players who want them ASAP the option to sacrifice more time to get them slightly faster.

5: Reimu's Dialogue
Personally, I don't like Reimu's ""ghosts and spirits"" line because it makes me fear for the safety of my beloved Yuyuko. This one's completely personal preference and is probably something only I care about.

Overall, I think this game is great, but could be made even better with a few tweaks.",1668303040,1668303040,True,2,0,0.50787663459777832,2,True,False,False

And by that I mean taking the concept of the everyday life of the world and turn a casual game idea (Like Diner Dash) into a whole system of working in special orders among managing funds. This game is by far the highest rated Fan Game I can give it even surpassing previous endeavors.

This game is crazy long as well. At the time of my review I put in over 34 HOURS (Due to reading dialogue and side quests) and have yet to really see the end of the game at all. It's an addictive loop of gathering Ingridients, picking where to set up based on what side quests you have/Main Quest and then setting a menu up that appeals to the locals based on Price and the flavors the normal and potential guests can bring. The music is sweet, charming and dare I say 'Nostalgic' in some tracks that brings a sweetness to the ears. It might sound weird but I like listening to the music while I cook too. Brings a smile to my face.

The art style to some may come off as Retro but i rather call it by it's actual name 'Pixelated'. The small sprites on the overworld look cute and chibi but the full pixel illustrations carry a lot of charm and love for each character you meet in the series. Added on the fact you can change Mystia's outfit with unlocks and gifts too!
Side quests also offer unlockable modifiers if you max out your relationship ranks with certain customers and many benefits to learning new recipes that may just net you that much more money you require to pass.

The price it offers alongside the DLC (Which just adds even more to do) is both amazing and kind of concerning. I wouldn't even be mad if I paid $30 for this game. It's that high in quality compared to other Touhou Fan games and games in general of it's caliber. 

Should you buy it? Yes. Give it a try if you never played a game like this or play it if you love the games where you complete orders (Adding extra for bonuses too) for customers. It costs just about the same as a Mcdonald's Combo Meal but leaves you satisfied for days to come! So what are you waiting for!?

Otherwise, it is a chill little game where you try to please and befriend the most demanding customers (different girls) for bonuses. Other customers are easy and you can choose your menu each day.

Definitely well-worth the purchase if you're into management sims in general - what's fascinating as a player is how the game progression doesn't feel punishingly slow, but when you do any kind of progression it feels VERY rewarding. 

I adore the pixel art and colors used! Definitely up my alley. 
For someone who doesn't even Touhou, the characters are still very funny. Dialogue runs a little long, I appreciate the ""skip"" button, but they're still witty and funny in a surreal type of way. 

At this point, I do get a little tired of doing the singing mini-game since it messes with my rhythm for cooking and serving food.....but I'll still keep it on because it just feels nice to feel like I did something right lmao.

[b]Overall[/b]
An addictive restaurant management sim that's polished enough to hold interest, particularly if you enjoy the core gameplay loop of gathering ingredients, choosing what dishes to serve and making dishes to order. If you're a Touhou fan I expect you may get a bit more out of the story than I did as there is more dialogue than you might expect at first glance. I played mainly on Steam Deck which felt perfect for running a few nights of the izakaya while watching tv or on a break. Progress synced well enough that I could pick up on PC at other times without any worry. I really liked some of the art (particularly of all the different dishes!) and the music was pleasant, but may get a bit repetitive if you spend hours playing at a time. Very enjoyable if you're into casual management sims, and while it's sometimes a little rough around the edges I didn't notice any real bugs while playing. If you don't read Chinese make sure that any DLC you buy has an English release as they usually release in Chinese first - unless you want to muddle through in which case go for it! Dialogue may seem slightly wonky to English speakers but is plenty good enough to understand.

[b]Gameplay[/b]
Mainly focused around daytime gathering and talking to NPCs/buying from vendors, then running the izakaya at night. Daytime tasks are time-management focused with most actions taking 30 minutes. NPCs will give you tasks to complete which will reward you with new recipes or other useful upgrades (and story!). The izakaya management revolves around upgrading your locations/cooking tools, and serving endless streams of customers with a little cooking mini-game. You will eventually unlock things that make the day-time foraging and talking to people more efficient so you can focus on running the izakaya at night, but some of it is not very well signposted (at least in the English translation) so a guide can be helpful at times. There is also a main overarching story to complete, so the game is not endless (unless you want it to be..)

[b]Achievements[/b]
There are a fair amount of achievements you will get simply for playing the game. There was one where I needed to know in advance I would reload and make a different decision on a specific day, so if you're hunting for 100% completion you will want to look some of them up beforehand or risk having to replay if you don't have a save file from near that decision. Most are simply a case of playing long enough - I got to 100% achievement completion in about 80 hours but if you're more efficient you could definitely get there sooner. At the time of review I only own the base game and DLC1 so I can't comment on later DLCs.",1665147666,1665147666,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

For the low price of $6, you're looking at about 35 hours of content, which is how long it took me to get through the base game. All the hours beyond that have been me powering through the DLC.

If I had any complaints:
[list]
     [*]The difficulty is somewhat all over the place. I easily blazed through the paywalls at the end of each chapter with well over 2-3 times the required amount of cash for each one. On the other hand, the boss fights, what few and far between they are, are ridiculously strict for how laid back the rest of the game is. The majority of the game, you more-or-less can take your time and can at times let your employees run the place, and once the bell rings midnight you can still serve whoever is left in your restaurant. However, once you get transported to the Netherworld, the game suddenly shifts to this harrowing, stressful environment where every second matters, and if you dawdle for even a moment, you will not make it, and to top it off, you do it [i]all by yourself.[/i] 

To put it simply, the game does a poor job at preparing you for the end-game story encounters.

     [*]Once you figure out how to satisfy every tag for the VIPs, there's very little incentive to switch up what you serve them. So instead of inventing new dishes every time I get a new order from a VIP, I can just serve her something that satisfies all of her preferences at once, which makes serving them feel a repetitive after awhile. When I see Patchouli walking into my restaurant, I know dang well she wants evening pancakes with bamboo and wagyu beef with a side of whiskey with occasional Ramune. Reimu wants riceballs with wagyu beef and honey. It makes it feel less like I'm serving them a improvised dish, and more like my VIPs are simply easy to please with having the same meal every time.

     [*]Lore is sometimes inconsistent with the source material. For instance, early on Mystia claims she is illiterate. This likely stems from her interview in [url=https://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/Bohemian_Archive_in_Japanese_Red/Mystia][i]Bohemian Archive in Japanese Red[/i][/url] where she stated that she has difficulty reading small letters, to which Aya jokingly suggests that she cannot read at all. However, [i]Oriental Sacred Palace[/i] shows Mystia reading a book aloud while rubbing her eyes, so it's probably more likely that she has some kind of reading difficulty, rather than being outright illiterate. Thankfully, stuff such as this is simply minor and can be waved as artistic license.

     [*]The translation is normally great, but it could've used some refinement. Typos are abundant, and sometimes naming conventions are inconsistent, as if two different people translated this game without communicating. For example, in one instance the game referred to a location in the game as the ""Scarlet Devil Mansion,"" which is what the place has been known as in English for decades, while in another case, the game referred to it as the ""Scarlet [b]DEMON[/b] Mansion,"" which, while [i]technically[/i] an accurate translation, I have never seen it referred to as such in my years as a fan, and the inconsistency is jarring to say the least.

     [*]Another minor complaint: I do not care for the usage of current-day memes in the dialogue, because they will date this game so hard in 5-10 years. Hearing a horny goblin go on about how [i](ugh)[/i] ""thicc"" Meiling's thighs are is groan-worthy today, and it will be even more-so in the future when that vernacular dies off.
[/list]

But all of these are just minor road bumps in what has been, overall, and extremely pleasant experience. I've even been streaming the game to some Discord friends, and they can't seem get enough of it. One of them isn't even a Touhou fan, yet he finds the game absorbing, even going as far as to call it ""a cozy slice-of-life."" So don't just take my word for it that this game is 10/10 material.

Love seeing all the characters interacting mostly-peacefully, and seeing Mystia resolve the mild drama and build friendships by serving people food.

Story aside, this is also genuinely one of the most mechanically sound and well-designed shop sim games that I have seen, if arguably a bit too easy once you've leveled up a lot. Underneath the touhou fanservice are very smart shop sim design choices that add depth without sacrificing quality of life. Pinnacle of the genre, frankly.

The rhythm game elements I could take or leave, as I'm not good at rhythm games, but fortunately they're generally easy and straightforward, so it becomes a cute touch that I can still appreciate. Plus, at higher levels, you have to do them less and less. There is also a new dlc to make them harder for people who do actually like rhthym game stuff.

Cons: Controlling the UI can be a bit unintuitive sometimes, but not so bad that I can't just get used to it. And I trust the dev to keep improving on things.",1661527324,1661527324,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

I highly recommend it if you like cooking games or these sorts of management games. It does have a rhythm element, but they are basic and easy enough to pull off. But if you don't get the rhythm segments done consistently, it's not a huge deal either.

One thing I don't see mentioned in other reviews is how the game allows you to mostly play at your own pace. You unlock several locations with different preferences and famous patrons, and can adjust the amount of tables you have set up at the start of the day (you unlock more tables manually via quests and don't necessarily even have to do it). 

I myself don't have issue with the more bustling Izakaya, but this is a very safe recommendation to those who are intrigued by the cute artstyle and gameplay, who might be worried the game becomes too difficult. It doesn't if you don't want it to.

She kicks me in the ribs until I can hardly breathe. Then she starts to cry and apologizes, begging me to forgive her. She holds me all night as I gently cry into her dress. Please help is there any hope for me.

Anyways, this is a very cute and chill cooking game, and pretty easy to get into even if you're not a big Touhou fan or don't know a ton about it like I as many of the characters are cute and charming in their own ways, and while it has some minor issues like overlaying text such as giant golden letters telling you your rewards will hang over textboxes for about a minute which is annoying at most, and in some tutorial bits it'll circle the wrong prompt if you're playing in English like me so a few tool tips and hotkeys will be off-centered or way too close to one another which make it hard to read and I do wish you could click out of everything instead of having use to key unless I missed something. 

But the Devs are aware of the issues and always making amends so it doesn't detract from the overall experience which is gathering ingredients or buying them with some time-management during the day to complete side-quest or invite certain guest so you can level up their bonds to learn more recipes for your shop, and then setting up shop and listening to some good tunes whilst making sure you keep your customers happy so they don't strike you down with the power of god and experiment with your recipes to learn what your quest like or don't whilst under the pressure of different events whether be owning a mortgage to a child or a god threatening your entire livelihood, and while the game can get hectic later on depending on how good of a cook and server you are, it's still a nice game to turn your brain off and chill as you make food you'll never taste in your life.",1661360446,1661360446,True,38,17,0.77418440580368042,0,True,False,False

Mystia's Izakaya was a game I thought was going to be just casual and nothing big other than its gorgeous pixel art and sprites of the Touhou cast. I am glad to be wrong. When I found out how to appeal to customer's tastes by adding in different ingredients and being able to proc spell cards from the unique guests, I was stunned by the creativity you can put in making the dishes. 

For just being a diner-type game, I have had a lot of fun being overwhelmed by the mass amounts of customers and seeing all the different unique spell card effects. I still have plenty more to go but heck, this game is super worth it. It is one I'd recommend to new fans of the series who haven't played (or want to play) any of the mainlines. Honestly ranks up there with Luna Nights being a fantastic entry game into the series and its world.

Music is really nice and fitting to the game (there's even a surprising rhythm mini-game that **actually adapts to the game soundtrack**).

I honestly have no idea how they can allow themselves to sell a game this good for this cheap.

Relax and enjoy, or buckle down and push yourself. The game is easy to pick back up when you have the itch to play it again after setting it down for a while.

The game has a core loop of collecting/buying materials, preparing meals for quests, setting up your shop and location, then opening up for the night. Serve customers to generate income to pay back your loan shark and restock your shop. Continued success leads to a larger shop with more seats and different areas to open up at which changes the frequency of the different types of guests. Changing food trends will also affect the types of dishes your customers will ask for adding a little bit of thought to be put into what exactly you want to stick on your limited amount of menu slots.

When running your restaurant you can either go solo or pay some of the in game inhabitants to help you with certain roles. Patrons order after they're seated and you fill the orders in real time, optionally making modifications based on the tastes of the individual diners to maximize their stay and empty their pockets while increasing the reputation of your brand. Special guests will sometimes appear, and making them dishes they like will give your shop useful boosts for the night, disappoint them and those spells end up letting you know their dissatisfaction.

There is an interesting variety of different dishes requiring different ingredients and cooking methods. You are in charge of what goes into the dish, while the actual cooking is done automatically, sometimes with a rhythm game thrown in which can give you a bonus effect. It is simple enough that you can just select the item and follow the ingredient list, but with enough customization that you can deviate and make your own creation to suit the guest's palate.

It would be nice to see more accurate prompts for controller users as sometimes the buttons displayed do not line up with what is in your actual hands, although the actual support for a controller is well done.

Overall, not a bad choice for the casual or seasoned gamer. Even people new to the Touhou fandom can get into this game as background knowledge is not really required for the most part to enjoy the gameplay or the main narrative. The game itself is not too hardware demanding either, opening it up to players that may not have the dedicated gaming power required for other games.",1657297742,1657297742,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[h1] Overall [/h1]
Overall, this game is a labour of love that the devs obviously devoted a lot of passion into. Everything from the mechanics and music to the artwork blend together to create an absolutely riveting experience you just can't put down. 10/10.

[h1] Gameplay [/h1]
It's a deep cooking and light business RPG on the surface, having you play as a 'youkai', a Japanese folklore demon, intent on running an 'izakaya', a Japanese street food and alcohol stand serving humans, youkai, fairies and spirits alike. 

The core gameplay loop has you roaming the beautiful land of Gensokyo during the day, collecting ingredients in a manner not unlike Stardew Valley or Harvest Moon's foraging mechanics. At sunset you plan your food and drinks menu based on what ingredients you have and open your stall. During the night you cook up meals, popping in and out of crafting menus to serve your customers Diner Dash style. There's a very light rhythm game element here where you can sing to your food to make it taste better, unlocking various buffs. The crafting system provides lots of room for personal touches and experimentation to create the perfect meal to please your customers. Get your food and drinks out on time and tailor them to your guests' tastes and the current trends and you get bonus tips. 

You don't have to go it alone either. As proprietress, you get to hire various story characters along the way and set them various duties during the night. And each of them are just as lovingly crafted, full of personality and character with their own storylines to boot. 

On top of that, there's a lovingly crafted visual novel style character interactions with a very colourful cast of humans, youkai and spirits that inhabit the land. This plays out during the day while you're roaming or during the night when they drop by your stall to partake in your food. This leads on to a very deep and rewarding relationship system that unlocks things from new recipes and ingredients to various buffs when you feed them the right dish at the right time. 

In short, this is Recettear, Stardew Valley, VA-11 HALL-A, Diner Dash brought together into a very cohesive game presented in Touhou trappings.

[h1] Artwork [/h1]
The absolutely stunning pixel art is simply popping with life and vibrancy, from the adorable character portraits with their alternate expressions and even costumes, to the beautiful backgrounds in the free roam segments to the gorgeous cut scene art. Not to mention the adorable little retro RPG sprites. 

[h1] Music [/h1]
The score is a great, fitting accompaniment to the game's style and feel sporting high quality production value. If you're into the Touhou franchise, you'll appreciate a lot of what's on offer here. 

[h1] Touhou [/h1]
If you don't know what Touhou is, that's okay, you'll still love this game, and through it you might discover this beautiful rabbit hole that is the Touhou franchise. But if you are a fan of Touhou, welcome home. This is the Gensokyo we love brought to life in what is clearly a love letter to the fandom. The music, the characters, the world, you are sure to love every bit of it.",1657198245,1657198245,True,13,0,0.619970202445983887,0,True,False,False

The game is split between two main sections; an overworld gathering game where you can seek out quests and explore for new ingredients, and a resturant cooking sim. The act of cooking isn't difficult, but the complexity is quickly increased thanks to the addition of rhythm minigames when selecting a meal, as well as having the ability to add any ingredient to any meal to properly satisfy customers.

Some things aren't explained well, such as how earning money actually works (I'm not sure if adding an egg to a rice ball actually makes the rice ball any more expensive for instance), but it's very easy to learn in every other way.

----

This game is a restaurant simulator, first and foremost, so you're going to be spending a lot of your time playing carefully thinking of the needs of every customer. The better the dish you serve (according to individual taste), the better the rewards. There are rare customers, which double as NPCs, who may request specific dishes with weird twists or help you add things to your menu! 

The more you play, the better your restaurant gets. From the looks of things, you can also expand out to other areas later on. Upgrades to the restaurant currently include extra cooking tool space and more seating. There is also an employee system that helps you automate some of the serving process. 

Every morning, before you open, you wake up and start gathering ingredients either through harvesting or by purchasing from a vendor. While you walk about, you may see some NPCs with quests for you; these requests are typically to gather specific items or cook certain dishes for delivery. Every time you engage with an NPC successfully, you level up the relationship you have with them a bit... which eventually leads to you getting new recipes and etc! 

The spritework is all quite nice so far, but the world design itself seems to be lacking some shadow work or something. Seems weirdly flat as you walk around. Otherwise, the 'cutscenes' are gorgeously done. 

I'm not familiar with whatever franchise this game actually comes from, but the character designs are quite interesting and they seem pretty well-written. It's interesting to run a restaurant in a world full of civilized yokai, who no longer have to eat exclusively humans. I haven't seen much of this land yet, but the worldbuilding is also quite solid so far.

Just picked this up through the Steam Summer Sale, with all of the game's DLC, for $9. This game is worth the money. It's cute, fun, and relaxing. Exactly the kind of thing I was looking for. It's somewhat similar to Stardew Valley, which is quite nice.",1656976969,1656976984,True,7,0,0.609004735946655273,0,True,False,False

Outside of restaurant management, Misty gathers ingredients and builds relationships to get recipes and perks. It does require some thinking to plan each day around quests and time-specific gathering. The main story progression is a little slow but there's still plenty to do.

- You can customize your dishes to satisfy the customers' tastes.
- Not too difficult; there's some challenge without it becoming frustrating. More fun than Overcooked.
- The dialog is all skippable, which is a blessing.

CONS:
- The UI takes some getting used to. There's a bug where you can't always rebind the keys.
- I can't tell the fox and cat customers apart.
- The art isn't the greatest; it's in that awkward zone where it's a little too big to be called pixel art, but not high resolution either. The still images are very nicely drawn, though.
- The music gets tedious.",1653617307,1653617307,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I'm also glad I actually decided to try it out, since I normally ignore most of the things I get recommended. I was initially enticed by the visually pleasing aesthetics and it being set out in the Touhou universe, but I did not expect much at first.

It didn't take me long to get invested and to like everything about the game more and more. The game is meant to be seen as a casual experience and every element of the game comes together to make this the best possible casual experience, from the beautifully done pixelated sprites, to the chill arrangements and wholesome character interactions and story. Putting my Touhou bias aside, I still think everything holds up and is very enjoyable even if you're not a fan of the universe/characters/music/games. 

The core gameplay loop is deceptively simple, and from my perspective, a bit stressful (wanting to remember everything a character likes/dislikes to eat in order to not have to check their information page every time, and also making sure there's no people waiting in line for a free table when the clock hits midnight (because they'll leave)), but still enjoyable and pretty addicting - keep the GRIND going for those ingredients and money.

Great game, definitely recommend it, especially considering its price tag. The dlcs are fun too, and I'm looking forward to the English localization of the second one. I just beat it a bit ago, and have been staying in Hakugyokurou, listening to its music ever since while writing this review.

    On 2nd April 2022, the communist Youth League of China posted a blog with six images on Sina Micro blog [1] (the Chinese twitter) to inspire adolescents to struggle against further difficulties. However, it stimulated some ultra-feminists into action. They exploited the absence of women in these images to instigate their blind followers to pour dirty words under the blog. More people joined the “Free-for-all”. Minutes later then the blog’s comment area was absolutely in chaos. As for those ultra-feminists, they were just sitting on the sideline, sneering.
    Eighteen days later, on 20th April 2022. The retirement simulator was blown because of an offensive video with giant bosoms. [2] Though it was reasonable, some male users tried to resist ultra-feminism with negative feedback. These improper actions flew average feminists into a fury and taught them a wrong method to voice their complaints.
    The month’s contradictions combined to dynamite and exploded on 14th May, 2022.
    12:00 a.m. the developer posted an advertisement of DLC2 [3] for his project Touhou Mystia Izakaya with a thousand-time used image (A former version [4] posted on 4th May, if you are admitted to use Google, you may find the original version). You can fill in the blank with everything you want; even exchange both mind clouds freely). However, under the ultra-feminists’ perversion, the image became an “evidence” of gender bias. Some average feminists lost their temper, they were abetted to buy the game, leave negative feedback and apply for refunds deliberately. The viral prejudice spurred average users into indignation, nearly out of control.
    But the feminism is innocent, only the ultra-feminism must be condemned.
    Some of the ultra-feminists establish gossip groups and others post agitating blogs [5]. As for the former, I slipped into one of these groups recently and was kicked two hours later. In the group, there was a hidden chairwoman with four administrators who maintain the order. These administrators distribute “missions” to members periodically. Such as pouring foul languages, making passive comments or gathering and publishing victims’ private information. If you turned down the “missions”, sorry, you were kicked.
    Believe it or not, the members, most of them are average feminists, are victims, too. Maybe they’ve undergone school bullying or domestic violence. Maybe they are stressed in working day and night. Maybe they are just quarreled with their family members. All of these causes drive them to be in ornery mood, regarding the “missions” as safety valves. From spitting out to spewing out, they gradually became the sacrifices to ultra-feminism.
    As for the developer, he is not a bachelor; he is a family man, raising a child who is enjoying kindergarten life. Is not it ridiculous for him to advertise an offensive image to ruin his family deliberately? You have blown down his dignity, what is the next? Divorce? What an idea! You tear a whole family in two just because you feel uneasy with the rumor? Alas, you selfish brute!
    However, it doesn’t mean he is absolute innocent. The computer graphics while your assistants having spas sail close to the wind. They might attract more male users but will lose more female users. That’s the true “offence” with proofs.
    I interviewed a deputy to the Local People's Congress, who had mediated lots of conflicts in her political career. She said, “The best weapon to defend woman’s rights is statutes.” Yes, not infinite condemnation. If you are under violence, call the police. If you’re overwhelmed with pressures, ask for a half- holiday. If you’ve had an argument with your parents or children, try to invite a mediator to extinguish the flame.
    A stream of coarse invective makes no sense. Grasp the weapon of statutes; then we can boycott the sex discrimination, the male chauvinism, especially the ultra-feminism legally. We need a peaceful reformation. Please, first think; then speak. Don’t consider problems by guess and by God. It’s effective for every contradiction.
    One of the Confucius’ disciples said, “I have the rights not to be dominated, but I also have the duties not to dominate others. “That’s what I want to declare. It is free of you whether to believe yourself or the evidence.

The story follows Mystia as she expands her business from a small food cart to multiple restaurants throughout the world, learning new recipes to sell and making new friends. And while doing this, there is a storyline that gives you a goal to keep coming back.

The main gameplay consists of two segments. One during the day where Mystia can gather resources, talk to friends and potential friends and shop for ingredients. The other during the evenings where she runs her business. She sets up her food cart and serves food and drink to the customers.
Normal customers will order from the menu, but the more interesting characters will not tell you exactly what they want. They'll give you hints and have their own preferences and then it is up to you to give them something you think they will like.

This makes for a solid gameplay loop that makes it easy to go just one more day, with just enough planning ahead to always feel like you're making more progress and getting better at everything by a little bit. 
Both art and music are pleasant to look at and hear.

It has a few small flaws, but none of them are in any way a big problem. The worst I've seen was text not fitting in the dialog box and a few untranslated lines that were not relevant to the plot. Oddly the game seems to stop responding when the button to exit to desktop is pressed, but at that point it's not really a problem anyway.

In conclusion, Touhou Mystia's Izakaya is amazing value for your money and a title I will remember fondly.

The design, music and everything else is just perfect. And it’s also very cheap!
I mean… There isn’t any reason not to play this game unless you really dislike cooking food.
The game might have just hit me in the face the first time I played it because Marisa came to my Izakaya and she wanted some Japanese food. No big deal there but it was so early in the game that I haven’t unlocked any Japanese food, so I gave her the best I could do but it wasn’t enough so she ended up stealing my food. It wasn’t that much trouble, just a bit annoying. It was a long time ago when that happend so I hope that it have already been fixed without me noticing.

I had also learned from the first 10 minutes of playing the game how to exploit the early game and I was now making more money than what I should. Sadly I couldn't do the same with the drinks because even if you want it or not, green tea is always going to be an option. So I can't force people to only drink Sparrow sake. One of those has the worth of 50 green teas. So just a tip to you all, do not pick green tea because it will no matter what always find its way in.

Anyway, making money in this game is very easy. Everyone came to me and said “You should be careful with the money, not to spend it all on the store so you have enough to pay off the debt” . At that point I had around 3000 more than what you needed so I simply bought everything in the store.

The gameplay is fun and engaging, while also giving a tiny lil challenge of managing money. The music is charming and the fact the music ramps up as you do better during game play just gives each night more life as your place is packed and filled with customers. 

On the touhou side, each character feels like themselves so those who know alot about the series shouldnt worry if a character feels out of place or given a weird personality. Meanwhile, for those that barely know or infact dont know touhou shouldnt worry too much one bit. Youre not expected to know lore or backgrounds to characters as that has no effect to the gameplay. Even then, playing as a character who barely interacts with any other character in the series makes it a good introduction to various characters in the game. 

The only issue to be seen is small translation errors but its still readable and its only here and there, not all over the place.

A restaurant simulator with elements from resource management, village life simulation, and (lightly) from rhythm games. The rhythm game component is very lightweight and serves as a mechanic for getting various boosts to your restaurant, such as being able to toss your orders to a table instead of having to walk it out. Edit: I also purchased this game after the English translation came out. The translation from Chinese to English is more than serviceable, although there are a few typos and grammatical errors out there. It contains a significant amount of dialogue, so props go to the translators for their efforts.

The resource management has you making serious considerations as to where you want to spend your limited time per day, as every action (besides talking) takes 30 minutes and you have 8 hours to prepare for your night's opening. Some resources are only available at certain times of day, while other resources are unavailable at shops, and the ever-growing crowd of customers can drain your supply if you don't dedicate time to gathering those resources.

The village life simulation is fairly lightweight, where talking to the various major and minor (named) characters unlocks quests, which can provide new recipes or upgrades for your restaurant. New dialogue with these characters can also be obtained through improving your relationship, if that's your thing. Being a Touhou fan game, there are references to the official media and some fan theories throughout. The game is enjoyable without knowledge of Touhou, but being familiar with the setting absolutely enhances the experience.

The restaurant simulation is where it's at though. It's fairly simple: a customer orders a dish and drink, and you provide them what they want. If you want to make a bit more in customer tips, you can add an ingredient with qualities that the customer likes during the cooking process to tailor it to that customer's style. As your recipe list grows, you have to decide what you want to serve (or not serve) each night based on your resources and your customers, as well as which cooking implements and how many you want to bring along. Fortunately, time stops while you're looking at the menus and while choosing ingredients for a dish, so it's not impossible to handle everything even if you have 6 dishes lined up and waiting.

The real meat of the game is in the named characters that appear. Instead of asking for a dish and drink directly, they will give you a description of the dish and drink they want (ie. ""I want something that's cut in small portions"" and ""I'd like a drink that's very stong""). It's up to you to study these characters and their likes and dislikes and provide them a dish and drink that fits their preferences. If your service pleases them enough, they will use a ""spell card"", which triggers bonuses like giving you extra ingredients or increasing customer draw for a short time. To add further complexity, each character has a certain budget. While you can serve them anything that fits their tastes, if you make them spend their entire budget in one meal, they'll just up and leave after eating.

Lastly: the music. The overworld music is charming, but the restaurant is where you'll spend most of your time. The music starts off quiet and steady as customers start filtering in, and the music will dynamically change and become more upbeat and energetic as the restaurant gets more busy. The various locations' tracks are very good quality and make for great listening in-game and out.

In short, if you like casual cooking games and aren't turned off by the artwork and aesthetics, there's plenty to like about this game. At the time of writing I'm 23 hours in and am just over half-way through the game, though I make an effort to talk to everybody and complete whatever quests I can.",1650046208,1650046340,True,26,0,0.704316914081573486,0,True,False,False

The ONE improvement I would ask for the most is the ability to save the game at any time, not just at the end of the day. This would allow me to play the game in short breaks between calls at work.",1648363669,1648363669,True,4,0,0.555732786655426025,0,True,False,False

However, after watching a few reviews, I gotta say I had a long time thinking if I should purchase this. I purchased and have to say it's pretty fun! The story is, in order to save your friend's kneecaps, you take out a loan and to pay said loan you have to manage an Izakaya! There are some characters in Gensokyo you can talk to, by talking to them you increase their affection(?) towards you. You can gain more recipes through talking to them and giving them good food based on their prefrences. Talking about prefrences, each characters have preferences which reflects upon characters e.g. Reimu like cheap food cause she's dirt poor :) . I don't want to spoil more about the gameplay mechanics because you should buy it to know more. 
Conclusion, it's a quality game for it's price.
P.S. this gamed made me fall into Touhou in general.

As someone who doesn't know the characters, the back story, the years of history etc etc etc of Touhou. This game is really enjoyable and in my opinion, dare I say, even under priced for what it is. 

The core loop of the game is basically you have two phases of the day. First phase is basically, the day time where you can talk with other characters, accept/complete side quests, collect ingredients etc. The evening/night time is when you open your Izakaya (or a restaurant type place) and serve customers with varying degrees of ease or difficulty pending what you have available to you. That's basics of this game, but what an enjoyable experience I've had. Yes, there's a story and background lore/development. But really it's the game play loop of collecting ingredients and serving food will be the catalyst on whether someone enjoys the game or not.

The art style is nice, the music is wonderful and the game is just fun in my opinion. At some point in the future I plan on buying the DLCs for this game. Once it gets a translation. First DLC of is supposedly gonna be translated by May 2022, which is apparently when a second DLC is coming out.

The only flaws of the game is that a couple parts of the game haven't been translated or it's a minor bug where the English version of the text doesn't appear so you get the Chinese (I think it's Chinese, could be wrong) version of the text instead. The other flaw for me being that there is a bit too much text dialogue. To compare it to another game, Stardew Valley, if you chat to an NPC you get one or two bits of dialogue and then you move on. This game has quite a bit more than that even when you're just chatting to an NPC. Which is great for someone who enjoys those interactions between characters to deepen the lore/relationships. But that's just not for me who prefers a quick text and then being able to move on.

Overall, the game probably has about 20-40 hours worth of content in the base game, depending how much dialogue you read, how quickly you progress through the days, how often you looks at recipes when cooking, how many side quests you do etc etc. So yeah, totally worth buying at full price.",1646537347,1646537347,True,4,0,0.514574646949768066,0,True,False,False

_________________________________________________________

OLD REVIEW: 

Seeing quite a few questions related to whether the English localization is necessary to play this game (DO NOTE, ENG and JP localization are scheduled to come already, this is for the ppl that want to dive right in without waiting, me included) so I figured I'd just write this review.

About the game first:
The game's good, filled with content, and mind you I fast-forwarded all the story because I couldn't read any, so there could've been more hours invested. 
OST is great and defo among the highlight of the game. I even got the OST DLC (I think there are some tracks missing from it, but most are included). 
Gameplay is intuitive, snappy, and haptic. I really do feel like an (albeit failing) masterchef contestant dishing out hundreds of delicacies by the second. (You can pause time by the way, by opening up any UI, this game won't be troubling)
Still buggy however, on some occasions I had to restart that whole cooking day. But well it's an early access title so I'll be more lenient.


k, now can u play without knowing Chinese? my experience (I speak eng and jpn)

short answer: possible gameplay wise if u put in effort ALT TABbing. possible story-wise too if you like to waste time with OCR and deepl/google trans (and it won't be quality trans either). I don't feel it's worth it for lots of people, just wait for localization.

long answer: at a basic level and during the beginning serving nights, it's very intuitive to understand collecting ingredients, serving, cooking, etc. because there are detailed, pictoral instructions on the screens, gotta be pretty hard to not be able to learn to serve common guests (there are pictures of dishes)
however, as soon as the first ""bulli"" barges in and orders her way, it's a must you're able to read their requests, memo their favorites and dislikes (no dish pics), lest you anger them and they chase away your other customers (among many other things). Also, playing the game you must understand some quest objectives, current newspaper trend, etc. to even advance. Guides could help with the first, but I don't think there's any out there rn that details all quests (important ones at least, I think there will be one soon?). 
and ofc the story and lore. idk abt u guys but I love reading food tooltips/item descs. 
with Japanese u might be able to play normally (in this game you serve foods, and drinks. I understand all the drink cues (for english players just look for similar tags, it takes more time though) and most of the food cues (food cues are usually lengthy) but still the story was lost on me. Will replay when localization is out.

with that said yeah, you pretty much have to OCR and deepl a lot if you want to understand the story. gameplay wise it's not TOO bad with a good memory and guides, but make no mistake it will be a chore to a lot of people, having to ALT TAB back n forth. I used these guides:

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
It's a business simulation game. It's casual, easy to learn and addictive. Its core gameplay mechanic, which is cooking, offers enough diversity and challenge, but also keeps itself simple, so it never feels grindy or repetitive. 

There aren't many cooking games out there, and the ones I've played over the years are either too complicated to be enjoyable (looking at you Cooking Simulator) or offers too little so they get boring really fast, like a lot of those mobile games. Mystia's Izakaya easily stands out in this genre as a game I think fans of cooking games can enjoy.

[h1]Art[/h1]
I mean, just look at it. It's absolutely amazing. It retains the unique artstyle used in this dev's previous games. The character portraits, sprites and CGs all show a lot of passion poured into them by the artist. 

[h1]Music[/h1]
Of course a Touhou game cannot be without great soundtracks, but this game cranked it up a notch and produced some of the best video game music ever. 

Like, seriously. The music is way too good. Every new area to explore or setup shop in offers a pleasant surprise with its music, and I just can't praise it enough.

[h1]Story & Characters (no spoilers)[/h1]
This game offers an easy-to-follow, short and cute story that revolves around Mystia, whom you play as. That should already spark interest for any Touhou fan since she's such a minor character in the franchise and not much was ever revealed about her. 

It also stars many characters that rarely make an appearance even in fan games, such as Wriggle and Kyouko, offering more interesting perspectives to the world of Gensokyo.

The characters' designs and their lines are all very faithful to their source material. The characters' quirks are often accurately reflected through their dining preferences, making getting to know these characters a fun and immersive experience for Touhou fans. 

A lot of the dialogues and lines are simply hilarious (like most of Yuyuko's lines) and will certainly get a good chuckle out of you if you know the related Touhou lore. Even if you aren't a Touhou fan, I'm sure it's at least a fun read.

[h1]Replayability[/h1]
This is one of the most replayable games I have ever played.

I beat the game about 40 hours in, and spent another 40 hours playing. Now that there's a DLC, I can only imagine that number going up a few dozens more. I didn't play this game necessarily for achievements or unlockables, although they are available, but because I wanted to play it for some casual fun. I feel that's incredibly rare in this day and age for a non-multiplayer, non-roguelike game.

Maybe you won't enjoy the game as much as I did after completing everything, but completing the game alone is worth way more than this game costs.

Also apparently the devs being keen on further updating and expanding the game with QOL changes, holiday events and DLC content. They are very passionate towards this project. I'm sure there is still much more to come in this already rich and polished game.

[h1]About bugs and translation[/h1]
Other than Wriggle being in the game, the game is pretty much bug-free. It's possible that you run into one or two in your entire playthrough, but nothing serious.

Translation wise, I don't know because I haven't played it in English. Seeing some of the existing English reviews, it's probably okay.

[h1]Verdict[/h1]
This is a very special and charming game. For me, just standing behind the counter watching the izakaya in motion, observing customers come and go, enjoy their meals, is a satisfying, worthwhile experience. I believe both fans of Touhou and fans of cooking games will be able to share this feeling.

I remember first hearing about this game and not expecting much from it about 5 months ago. I never thought it would end up being one of my most played games on Steam. 

With that I can safely say this is one of the best games I have ever played. 

It is also the only Touhou game I have successfully convinced several non-Touhou-fan friends to play and enjoy. That's quite an achievement in itself.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[h1]游戏性[/h1]
游戏的类型是经营模拟，主要的游戏内容是结识不同的客人，给不同需求的客人做菜。休闲，简单易懂，容易上瘾，也没有很肝很枯燥的感觉。

如果玩过20年前软星出品的《仙剑客栈》，其相似之处显而易见，但这作只是很大程度上还原了《仙剑客栈》的那种开着自己的店、与有趣的NPC们交谈、看着客人来来往往的舒适和成就感，而游戏性侧重点不同：没有复杂的迷宫探索，而是在城镇里与NPC对话进展剧情，并且做菜作为核心玩法，需要你逐渐熟知每道菜的材料、特性以及每位常客的口味，真的有一种小吃摊老板娘的代入感。

对东方厨（真就东方[b]厨[/b]呗，笑死）和喜欢做饭类游戏的玩家来说，这作绝对是非常出众、值得一试的。

[h1]美术[/h1]
这游戏的画风真的一级棒，与作者的先前作品相似，很令人舒适。无论是立绘、行走图还是CG都可以看出画师的热爱。

[h1]音乐[/h1]
说实话，第一次听到兽道营业的BGM我真是惊了，随后每到一个新地区探索或者开店时我都会惊一次。作曲质量真的非常非常高。

[h1]剧情人物相关（无剧透）[/h1]
剧情很简单明了，也不是很长，而且主角是小夜雀！能从小夜雀的视角探索观察幻想乡，这就已经很新鲜了。而且游戏里还有很多即使是同人游戏里也不常见的角色，比如莉格露和响子（甚至还有冴月麟，我超？），可以说是棒上加棒。

人物设计和对话都非常忠于原作，可以看到很多好玩的梗，而且角色的各种设定也都被融入到菜品酒水喜好中了。作为东方厨，看到这些都会会心一笑吧。

有很多对话和台词都很欢乐，比如幽幽子的大部分台词（当你给幽幽子上黑暗物质时）。即使不了解东方，这作的诙谐幽默也足以不会让阅读剧情感到枯燥。

[h1]重复可玩性[/h1]
这是我玩过重复可玩性最强的游戏之一了。我通关时大概是40小时，通关后又玩了40多个小时。现在有了DLC，还要再玩几十个小时无疑了。不光是为了解锁成就和一些物品，更多的是真的就是觉得很好玩。作为一款不是肉鸽，也不是联机的游戏，我觉得能让人一直有兴趣玩下去真的很少见。

即使你通关之后就不玩了，这个游戏的流程也绝对远远超值于它的价格。

而且作者一直在推出更新、节日活动和DLC，即使通关也还有越来越多的内容。

[h1]评价[/h1]
非常特别的一款游戏。

我很喜欢东方，也一直想找一款好玩的做饭题材的游戏。去年刚刚知道这部游戏的时候，我感觉我会喜欢，但也只以为是个流程很短的小游戏，完全没想到竟然会成为我游戏时间最长的游戏之一。

这也是我见过唯一一款推荐给不是东方众的朋友之后他们真的会玩而且喜欢的东方同人游戏。我觉得这就足以证明它有多特别了。

不管你是不是东方众，我都极力推荐。

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

很特别的游戏。想起了20年前的《仙剑客栈》。

[h1]Backstory[/h1]

You play as Mystia Lorelei, a Night Sparrow that runs a food stand at the Youkai Trail in Gensokyo selling grilled lamprey. Your close friend, Kyouko Kasodani, a Yamabiko, is in deep trouble. She owes the Yakumo family a sum of 5000円, and the debt collector Chen has been harassing her about it. You offer to take up her debt and help her repay it before the next deadline.

[h1]Game mechanics[/h1]

[b]Gathering Ingredients[/b]
Pretty self-explanatory, you’ll need to gather ingredient for your dishes scattered throughout the map. You start every morning at 1000, and gathering each ingredient advances the time by 30 minutes. Ingredient gathering ends at 1800, which is when you open your shop. After a few days, you’ll be able to buy ingredients from a shop or receive quests from certain characters.

[b]Planning the menu[/b]
Usually depends on the amount of ingredients you have, the kitchenware you need and the profit from each dish. You don’t want to run into a situation where you run out of a certain dish and a customer orders it. That would result in them leaving. Also, after the first few days, you’ll start to receive the newspaper, which will detail the current trend in food in Gensokyo. Customers will be more likely to order food that follows the trend.
Planning the utensils is especially important, since you can make food, even if it is not on the menu. You’ll most likely need it for special customers, which I’ll touch on later.

[b]Running the food stand[/b]
Pretty straightforward at first, the customers come, they give you their order, you make the food, bring a drink and serve the meal to them. Ordinary customers will only order what’s on the menu. After the first few days, you’ll gain the ability to sing. Singing while preparing food increases the chances of getting a buff (Can serve food from anywhere, customers patience won’t decrease, etc.) You close the food stand at 0000, and proceed onto the next day.

[h1]Special Customers[/h1]

[b]Ordering[/b]
This is what makes the game way more deeper and interesting in my opinion. There are certain characters that won’t order from the menu known as special customers. Instead, they will tell you what kind of food and drink they want. For example, a character like Chen might tell you she wants fish, because she’s a cat. That means you’ll need a meal that has the seafood tag (海产). Every dish in the menu has multiple tags, so you’ll can try to match the request of the special customer to the tag in the dish. And maybe she wants a fruity drink, so you’ll need to search for a drink with the fruits tag (水果).

Knowing which customer might come is an important part of planning what kind of kitchenware to use. For example, Rumia might ask for something that is filling (饱腹). Let’s say you do not have the rice ball in your menu, which has the filling tag. However, you have a cutting board, which means you can still make a rice ball using the correct ingredients, even if it is still not on the menu. In the future, you might want to add dishes that require a cutting board to make when you’re opening shop in the Youkai Trail, which is where Rumia frequents.

[b]Adding ingredients to the dish to suit the customer’s preference[/b]
There’s a section in your journal that records the preferences of each special customer that you’ve met at least once for easy reference. Referring to the journal pauses your game, so you can take your time to plan out what dish to make.

You can add additional ingredients to add tags to your dishes. Back to the Rumia example, she might order something that is filling (饱腹). However, you notice upon reading your journal that she also likes meat (肉). Usually, you make a rice ball by using 1 unit of seaweed. However, you can add meat to the recipe to create a riceball with the meat tag. That way, you can have both tags in one dish. 

[b]Satisfaction level[/b]
By giving special customers what they like, you can raise their satisfaction level. If they are extremely satisfied with a meal, some special customers might give you additional buffs. On the flipside, if they are dissatisfied, they might debuff you instead. Raising their satisfaction level will increase their friendship with you, which might lead to them giving you new recipes the next time you meet them while you’re out gathering ingredients.

[h1]Story[/h1]

The story is pretty light-hearted so far. There are only two parts in the story, which should last you a few hours. After all, it's still in early access. The game unlocks the other 3 areas for you after you’ve completed all available story content. The game starts out slow at first, but it starts getting more complicated when you reach the second area in the story.

[h1]Art[/h1]

The artstyle is cute and charming, and the music is great. Suits a more light-hearted game like this one. What's not to love?

[h1]TLDR[/h1]

Buy it if you’re a Touhou fan. If you’re not a Touhou fan, maybe wait for an English patch if you’re interested in the game before you decide.

There's a lot of story and it's quite fun, you have to understand the things that certain characters like, pay attention to the time for different ingredients, pair up the right utensils to create a good selection just in case a new character comes up, and test and try out a whole bunch of different things to get the right method down. There is a lot of story that you *can* go through, but you can also skip it. It's visuals and soundtrack is great, it's fun to play, and there is a lot to discover. The only issue is that there are quite a few bugs, which is understandable for an early access game. Thanks for another great game, I'll be updating this if my feelings change, or if I want to add anything.",1623914367,1623914367,True,40,0,0.793048381805419922,6,True,False,True

I don't know if this is going to be a fun game, but it's gonna be a beautiful one for sure.

That being said, I don't think that this ""game"" is worth buying or playing at the moment, as it's not really a game yet. All you can do here is to interact with random objects to get ingredients that have nothing to do with your current recipes with the miniscule matching game like a 3-year-old matching food names with flashcards. The current state is more like an art book in executable and I got bored after 10 minutes. The thumbs-up here is just showing my support for its ongoing development.

For those you who are not buying because of the language, you aren't really missing anything. The game doesn't have any real stories yet, and the only part that does require you to read is when special requests come in, which currently doesn't really matter as much anyway. Put it on your wishlist and stay toned for future updates.",1623868971,1623869075,True,8,0,0.523146152496337891,3,True,False,True
