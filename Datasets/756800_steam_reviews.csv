The newest decree of the week was denying entry to any visitors from the Republic of Kagistan with food. Looks like there are concerns about tainted food. I’ve added that to the list of regulations I need to remember

First visitor had a heavy cargo truck with two flat tires, a missing mirror, and was somehow missing both bumpers. I didn’t bother asking how that all happened. Then I denied him entry because his Entry Card had his name misspelled and his passport looked forged. Not sure why he thought pink was an official document color.

Second visitor had all documents in order, except the registration number for his fancy sedan. After I denied him entry, he swore I’ll regret it and he drove off in a huff. He almost ran into the entry guard. 

Third visitor had everything in order and his van was pristine. It had an interesting paint job with flowers all over it. Before giving back his documents, I bought four bottles of pure vodka from him at a low price. He seemed happy to have finally sold them.

Fourth visitor was a smuggler. The tip with a partial registration number finally came in handy. Before I arrested him, I sold him three cigarette packs for a good profit. He was smiling about the trade, before I put the handcuffs on him. While searching his truck, I found stacks of counterfeit money stuffed into two of the tires, inside a seat cushion, and a few under the passenger seat. I had a feeling there were still more. Unfortunately, it was already 3 PM and there were still more visitors to process.

Fifth visitor wasn’t anything too interesting. He had no cargo, an expired passport, and expired entry permit. When he turned around, I noticed his back window was smashed.

I didn’t finish processing the sixth visitor. The alert sounded and I immediately slung my SMG into my arms. My mechanic, front entry guard, prison guard, and cargo officer all took positions with me. Gunfire came from the wood-line just a moment later. The proceeding firefight is still a bit of a blur for me. I think I shot down about a dozen gang members, two of my guards needed medical attention, and in total there were almost twenty dead bodies when the fight ended. 

Maybe I should pay for a better fence, some more armored vests, and rifles. Money hasn’t exactly been piling up though. Even with my side-gig of bartering commodities with visitors.",1708059365,1708059365,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Unfortunately, this game is lacking in a few ways. The game play is very repetitive which goes with the line of work, but I expected a few things that trailers and descriptions led me to believe. There is no way to illegally sell the contraband you gather, making it a little difficult to get excess money, as the police give you next to nothing for turning it in. Also, the game feels like running errands when you actually get to go out and explore. I also expected the fellow guards to do more, and not just stand there while you do everything, which was a letdown. Furthermore, I encountered a few bugs when trying to turn in prisoners, which prevented me from doing so. Most importantly the inspections start out fun, but then too many regulations make it hard to keep track of what is what, and when finding a smuggler, you just want to get it over with as fast as possible in the later game, due to how long the inspections can take at that point. The gunfights are okay at best, and do not happen often enough and when the small ones do they feel underwhelming. If this game added more control over the fellow guards that a commander should have, allowing them to conduct tasks like taking in prisoners, it would be a lot better. Overall, this game is fun in SMALL doses, and it needs fleshed out more. This is a great concept, and the developers have done a decent job, but for the price tag of $30 it absolutely leaves much to be desired!

With some patches here and there, I think this could be a pretty great game, but I just found it wanting as it currently sits. 5/10",1707286722,1707286722,False,2,1,0.411572933197021484,0,True,False,False

Unlike similar games like paper please the complexity of the inspections never increases substantially.  The game will randomly introduce certain rules for your inspection but after a few days the rules are reset and a new set of special rules is added. The complexity of the inspections never builds. In papers please by the end game you are checking for vaccinations, entry documents, passport forgeries, smuggling, and diplomatic papers just to name a few, while many of these tasks exist in Contraband Police you never really have to watch out for more than one special circumstance at time .  There is also no time limit to border inspections, while this may sound like a positive the time limit at the end of each round combined with the mountain of paperwork the inspector must check adds a level of suspense and challenge. I never felt like there was any challenge in the inspections of Contraband Police.

The errand boy aspect of the game is tedious and repetitive.  You are sent all over the border of Arcaistan to stock and resupply the border checkpoint. At first this is fun but after Dropping off the prisoners, buying supplies at vlads, and dropping of seized contraband at the police station 10 times it becomes repetitive and grindy

I will say that the border upgrade aspect of the game is incredibly fun. Being able to hire new guards and upgrade existing is a major plus and almost makes the grind worth it. 

This game has a lot of potential but i wouldn't recommended it at full price. Around $10-15 dollars seems like a fair price for the game in its current state.",1707273349,1707273349,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

after a couple hours of gameplay and learning the controls and routine, you get to choose whether you want to be a good or bad cop. i found it pretty entertaining and fun to be good and theres plenty of mischief going on to stay busy. but im sure ill have more fun on the next playthrough being a bad cop.
as you progress you can earn money and upgrade
-weapons
-vehicles
-living conditions
-hire more staff & upgrade their armor and weapons
-Jail cells
- & services
get into shootouts and defend your base as well as other police stations.
transport contraband and prisoners to work camps for sweet sweet free labor~

my only complaint (and im just being picky, & i know it contributes to the whole lore of things) but i wish the spoken audio wasnt only in russian.. english subtitles are ok but im already doing alotta reading passports ok..

The combat system is lacking but i did not go into this game with the expectations that it would be game of the year.

Overall worthwhile purchase, buyer beware... know what you are getting into and thats a moderate budget game that has bells and whistle to flesh out and that not every game out there has to come with a non stop wow factor of 10 at every moment. Instead enjoy this game for what it is instead of expecting it to be something it is not.

Different from ""Papers, Please"", Contraband Police is a 3D game with unique mechanics such as driving cars, shootouts, detailed cargo checks, etc.

There are multiple game modes that you can play, such as campaign, challenge, etc. With the new endless mode added into the game, I think this is my go-to relaxing game as of right now.

I would give Contraband Police a solid 8/10, there are still room for improvements but as of right now the game is really enjoyable and relaxing.

My suggestions for the Crazy Rocks team are to add an interrogation mechanic where users can ask questions, and allow multiple people, such as family and friends, to ride in a single car.",1679207017,1706865295,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

One dollar per hour of enjoyment. I really do enjoy this game and it's worth the investment, especially since it doesn't have the same BS prices as some triple A games that aren't worth belly button lint. However, there are a few things I hope are added or changed. The mechanics are okay, it doesn't necessarily have the movement or visuals as some other large games but it definitely isn't bad. Sometimes it's a pain in the rear to leave a vehicle. There are times where I am looking in the right direction and attempting to move and my character will just sit there until my mouse moves over the 1 single pixel that prompts my character to leave the vehicle. Additionally, I REALLY wish that when I fail an inspection, it would tell me why it failed so I could learn from those failures. Instead, it just says ""that driver should have been refused!"" and then you lose money. Like.... Thanks? How???? It seems like there are times where the game just says ""nah fam, not today"" and it fails you no matter the amount of inspection you do. For example, there's a board that details expected smugglers. In the 6 hours I've played so far, there will be a notice saying ""a suspect ran from an inspection and is expected to try and cross the border."" and then it will give you 3 digits of their license plate. I arrested one guy that had those three digits in his plate in the correct order, and I was told it was a wrongful arrest and I lost hundreds of dollars. Few hours later, same notice with a different plate number. I let him through since I didn't find any contraband (he ran from an inspection, not a suspected smuggler) I thoroughly checked his vehicle but instead of wrongfully arresting him and losing the hundreds of dollars, I let him through. No contraband and his papers were correct. I wasn't going to make the same mistake for a second time so I let him through and then lost $400 for not arresting him. Like, dude wtf? I lose money if I arrest them based on the notice board but then I'll also lose money if I let them through based on the same kind of information on the board. It shouldn't feel like some RND type of game with that stuff. I shouldn't have to struggle on whether or not to let them through when I've said ""yes"" and ""no"" based on the same information two different times and I was wrong both times! Come on. And that goes back to my initial point. Tell me WHY I failed the inspection so I know what to look for next time. Outside of those few gripes, I thoroughly enjoy the game and it's something I can see myself probably putting in a couple hundred hours into. Especially if there will ever be a multiplayer mode. I could easily just screw around with a buddy and have a great time on here.

Driving anywhere is also a chore with the unresponsive vehicles and CRAZY map layout. Also, no minimap is fine, but it makes traveling difficult.

I am a fan of the publisher, PlayWay, and have seen this game getting played more and more by certain streamers. I tested it with the demo version and realized quickly this would be a huge time sink for me.

The game design is fun and rewarding when you do it all correctly and the controls and methods to go about this are easily picked up and memorized, allowing the player to sink into a sort of ""role-playing"" feeling.

The ""morality"" gameplay is lacking and a bit confusing. You have the option to side with either the government or the rebels. On my first playthrough, siding with the rebels, the mission outcomes for the rebel side seem very off-colored and almost like it is the ""bad choice."" It's not until the end-of-story presentation panels that you feel like you made a good choice. The story itself is confusing when it comes to where you stand morally, but the core gameplay and what the game was made for (inspecting vehicles and determining entry) make up for the otherwise lackluster campaign.

I have a shelf-standard HP Victus Gaming Laptop with a 12th Gen Intel Core and an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050. The game runs fairly smoothly on high settings. The only issues I have run into are a possible memory dump about 30-45 minutes into a play session. I recommend turning V-Sync off or lowering your texture memory to clear this up and regain frames.

All in all, play the demo first, as some people seem to have issues launching and playing the game, If it runs fine and you enjoy the mellow and almost assembly line feeling to the game - which I love, American Truck Sim is a favorite of mine - then pick this game up. It's a well-fleshed-out sim that is easy to hop into.",1706124065,1706124065,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

(EDIT: Changed review to 5 stars because I JUST realized I can turn off the attacks that I hate in the options! That's genius!)

I played the demo long before the game came out, and I liked the demo SO much, I joined their discord to await news on the release date. Having now played the full game, I can definitely say it was worth the wait. 

This game is SO much like Papers Please, which I also loved, but a 3D version where you actually get to find contraband and arrest the bad guys yourself. There's no little potato man in this one, though. He was always my favorite.

I love going over the people's information, figuring out who is a smuggler and using a weapon to split over parts of the car to find contraband - it is REALLY satisfying to find it all. I could do that all day and not get sick of it. 

What I'm not a fan of; the gun fights when the rebels attack the border. I hate those so much, after this last one, I think I might be done playing. I'm also not a huge fan of having to drive around, especially with the driving being so wonky. I actually switch from keyboard and mouse to a controller to do the driving. 

But I love the finding contraband/upgrading the border part so much, I was willing to overlook the parts I hate and give this 4 stars. It's a super fun game and I'm glad it's getting love. Now if I could just customize my endless mode to not include the dang gun fights, I'd play this forever.",1706019446,1706111671,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The comparisons to Paper Please are warranted, and I loved that game also. But as someone who loved that game, I was also a bit worried about what direction Contraband Police would go. It didn't make it any better that it was yet another Unity game, which is ironic considering Papers Please was updated in the Unity engine. But I think you know what I mean. There's no shortage of janky simulations made in Unity that simply borrow the same assets from every other game. But my expectations of a jank broken game with half assed mechanics was completely unfounded, and honestly, kind of jerky on my part. Okay, not just kind of jerky.. Very jerky. 

Crazy Rock and PlayWay hit out of the park with this niche investigative simulator, and I commend them for it. This game is exhilarating! I love it. I absolutely love it. Criminals can be clever in the way they hide contraband, but it's not even just the contraband you need to watch out. Just like in Papers Please, you need to check their papers for forgeries, incorrect passport numbers, expiration dates, compare vehicle weight, keep an eye out for wanted criminals, and much more, *including* investigations and missions that take place in the game itself away from your border patrol! And many of these missions also lead into what is also my favorite part about this game.. The combat. Combat should not be as fun as it is for a game like this. You'd think it'd be an afterthought, but it's not. It won't be something along the levels of Escape From Tarkov, but it doesn't have to be. It's fun.

Now my absolute favorite inclusion is somewhat of a recent feature, and that is the endless mode! Which is something that the development team didn't even need to add, but they did! They added it, and it's addictive. In the campaign, you're allowed to upgrade your facilities like office, jail, and vehicles, but in endless mode, there's so much more to upgrade!

When I saw my favorite Youtuber Drae play this on his channel, I knew immediately that it was worth at least worth a gander. But the game just kept getting so much better, and the developers kept doubling down on improving the game.. And I absolutely love it.",1704199734,1705402709,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

But that's not all – the game's depth unfolds as you embark on shopping sprees for weapons and supplies, turning your role into a multifaceted simulation. From confiscating contraband and transporting it to a secure holding warehouse to engaging in diverse activities that keep you on the edge of your seat, this game goes above and beyond expectations, delivering an expansive and immersive gaming experience.

An example of how a good indy game should be. Addictive gameplay loop, that progressively challenges you, various side activities and on top of that a small campaign based on your actions. It recreates the atmosphere of the cold war era and while visually definitely not next-gen, it does give off that old skool games look of the early 2000's with a modern filter on top. 

Love that look of drivers humorously rolling down their windows. And many other quirks in the game. I have not experienced any bugs but beside that one time my cars drivewheels got air while my tail was dug in a small hill, due to my own fault. I had a prisoner inside and couldn't get anywhere. Luckily this game has fast travel and this reset my vehicle and I could continue my mission without restarting. I would not recommend fast travel for anything else than fixing a stuck position, the campaign only last about 16ish hours without fast travel for me. Completing all side-objectives and occasional equipment/contraband/prisoner-runs in the campaign. Do note, I got quite productive with checking cars, there are aids but I would not recommend this game if you have dyslexia or colorblindness. It will turn into a point and clickgame if you use the aids too much and the game's charm is in finding the faults in the details you personally find. The only time I use the aid was to pinpoint the tints of colors. 

The game is not difficult per-se, but you will find yourself struggling if you try to rush things, prioritize your tasks and then take your time. The game luckily won't hold your hand too much but with a bit of logical thinking, structuring and utilizing the game's many manuals and tools you always have a grip on any situation. Practice makes perfect. You can always reload your day.

Some things that are a bit too rough around the edges like combat, can suck out the otherwise fluid gameplay loop. It's still nice to have combat as a break from checking and expanding on the campaign, but it doesn't work smoothly enough to be thrilling. Driving is barebones but the chases are a nice distraction anyway. One thing that was a bit too much were the color tints during checks. Im not colorblind but I would like it if i could compare tints of colors right next to each other. Now my manual opens on the right and the document is on the left. The only time I was able to distinguish colors were when it was a totally different color, but most of the time you have to identify small changes in tint from one end of the screen to the other.    

I recommend not upgrading too much too early, your income is based on your level and while you have the freedom to do anything you want, making things expensive early on will put a lot of pressure on you for not making any faults to survive another day. Slowly upgrade the things that you need the most. You will eventually level up and make more cash.

On a sale this is a ton of fun for the money. I prefer to have a short solid indie experience that delivers a specific niche/mood than an expensive politically safe triple A time sinker with too much fetchquests any time of the day.",1705075324,1705075324,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I saw the news of yesterday's update patch. I love the game, but the frequency of ambushes that occur whenever I leave the border post in 1979 Endless Mode is getting annoying.

A lot of the smuggle/contraband hiding spots are in the same locations no matter the car/truck. Each model has its own variation but 8 is just not enough. It becomes quite repetitive after just 6 hours. Arrests, chases, smugglers - they don't really vary. It's pretty much the same each time. Also, don't expect much in the way of upgrading the border station. Options are there, and they are helpful, but the place will forever look like a pile of garbage.

Now that said - I did have a good time. I beat the game, and while the story was seemingly an afterthought, the focus truly is on the gameplay, not the writing.

You're provided with a team of police who walk patrol around the property. They serve little to no purpose. The only time they do anything is during raids and they don't seem to aim well enough to ever hit their target. Expect to do ALL of the work when this happens and make sure you have the ammo and weapons to pull it off. 

Days/nights can run really short - this means if you are still inspecting cars/drivers late into the night, you may either get little or no sleep and the next work day will start. This leaves you with no energy to be able to use the assist functions during inspections. While not a huge deal - it does slow things down and makes it easier to miss things like age limits (where math is required) or making sure the color and style of paper match what that particular originating country uses.

It's a fun game and the inspections/review work isn't particularly hard. It has enough variety to keep you entertained for a while but it really needs more content. Even outside the main campaign - it's just more of the same. I do think this game is ripe for DLC expansions/content and I think that would go a long way in helping. That said, with the lack of content - it feels like whatever may come in DLC form should have been baked into the main game.

I wouldn't spend $20 on the game, but $15 is fair. It's a good time if you're into this kind of auditing/inspection simulation genre. I found it more entertaining than ""Papers, Please"". Having drivers decide to suddenly ""f*** off"" and run while you are inspecting their cargo off to the side can be fun to have to dizzily spin around and sprint to your police car to start the chase. Just don't kill the driver/smuggler - it will likely cost you a decent amount of cash as a penalty. The game does let you choose to side with the government, party, or the ""good"" of the people, and the ending will vary a bit depending on what path you choose.

I recommend it, just realize it's base price is $20 and that is mostly for good reason. There just isn't enough content to justify much more. Maybe wait until a DLC package? Rare to find a game like this. Worth your time.",1704817593,1704818525,True,118,1,0.912588357925415039,0,True,False,False

On the other hand, you also get to roam around the area, and do other stuff, like take prisoners to the jail camp, or help the police fight certain attacks (in which case the game becomes more of a shooter).

This game has changed my life in the best way possible. I have overcome all the problems that i have been recently experiencing. I have played many perfect games (ricochet) but this one beats them all. This game has made me experience things that i have never felt before. This game is the most realistic border experience to ever exist but one of the best things is the realistic gun play and realistically simulated AI terrorist attacks. The terrorist in this game are perfectly designed for all your terrorist needs. The only thing the gun play in this game lacks is the non educational names but thats just a name right. They have use the perfect mix and blend of weapons. Another perfect example of the developers hand crafted experience is the NPC voice lines as they convey real human emotion and can make you feel all kinds of things that may be positive or negative.

[b] thats actually something i really, really enjoy about it. [/b] you unlock more things to inspect, more rules to follow, etc as the days go on, so i never felt that it stagnated at all. i was actually surprised at how complicated it eventually gets, lets start with the things i dont like first (and ill tie it all up with a lot more positive stuff at the end):

[b] - the environment, as others have mentioned, is pretty limited. [/b] and even more limited when you realise most of the buildings around are used for story only events, and have nothing intractable or explorable outside of said missions/story events. even just being able to go inside them would be something.

[b] - i wish there was more of a narrative/story, [/b] the game focuses mainly on the simulations and stuff to do with it, so some of the storylines fell a bit short to me. as well as half of the story missions usually consisting of shootouts.

[b] - building ontop of my last point, [/b] i wish the characters in the game had more... character. maybe little stories or something.


[h3] those are really my only things i feel about the game that i would call negative, ill move onto the positives: [/h3]


- [b] i mentioned that the game focuses on the simulation aspect in my negatives, [/b] but i am also going to list it as a positive because the simulation itself is realistic, in depth, and has a lot of parts, tricks, and rules that even after a while of playing i might not even have the hang of yet (which i personally find interesting and engaging). 

[b] - along with the campaign, which is what i am mainly speaking about in this review, [/b] there are two other gamemodes (as of this review) which i havent delved into quite yet myself, but i appreciate having multiple ways to play the game.

[b] - your choices and actions matter, [/b] your post directly relies on you for mostly everything, and which side you choose to side with changes a decent amount of stuff.

[b] - i find the game to be atmospheric [/b] and i enjoy the setting, music, and sound design. its gritty and somewhat solemn at times in a good way.

[b] - the gameplay is satisfying, [/b] you can progress in different ways including levelling up just from correct checks, as well as unlocking better tools, weapons, post upgrades, and new employees/upgrading your already existing ones.

[b] - you can customise a lot of what happens, [/b] you can turn off raids of your base or your car when you're driving around if you do not wish to have them happen, you can make the day(s) longer or shorter, enemy markers, smuggler tips, etc. you can make it a lot harder (or easier!) if you so wish, and i appreciate it even though ive not toyed with those settings too much.

[b] - you do get little bits of story here and there. [/b] mostly from the story missions, but also from letters from passengers, newspapers, and conversations with people as well.

overall a very good, interesting, and engaging game that i recommend heavily as long as you do not mind repetition. props to the developers for paying attention to what people were saying and fixing the bugs! i havent run into any at all yet! ive sunk a decent amount of time into this game already but it feels like the time never passes when im playing it, thats how engaging it is to me :).",1704082299,1704082539,True,9,0,0.640718519687652588,0,True,False,False

Pointless tiny open world with no real reason to explore it. Money stashes are just radom piles scattered around with no clues given how to find them. 
Every day you know you gonna get ambushed by the same 4 bandits in the same locations. 

The checkpoint work never feels overwhelming, just 4 - 6 cars every day. The contraband could be easily spotted by using uv light, no variety in this. You get instantly rewarded or fined by letting the wrong cars pass, as if someone above just tests you. The game story is under told and makes it hard to feel weight of any of your actions and decisions. You never get the taste of how bad the government actually is. Couple hours into the game and you get all it could offer. Everything after that is just repeating over and over again.

The price of ""freedom"" in the 1980s and subversive support came with great costs in the world: at times the modus operandi sought the end over the means, an ethical trap.  Having met people who were victims of foreign policy and people who were in charge during the administration of the 80s regime, the ethics in this game are on point.

Well, if you've seen my thumbs up, it's because they fixed it; now onto my actual thoughts of the game:

I originally thought this game would be janky and boring, because I thought nothing would top ""Papers, Please"". But I have been extremely humbled and proven wrong. This game, though it does have its janks, is just as fun and great as ""Papers, Please"". I love the unintentional environmental storytelling: you are a new officer, trained to check passports and accept or decline newcomers. However, you are given a s**tty outpost that is built no better than the outhouse nearby your trailer home, given little supplies, and uninspired employees that rather being doing anything else because they get paid less than you. But that's not all! You are expected to not only arrest convicts, but take them to labor camps and deliver contrabands to the nearby prison warehouse. You must get your own supplies and pay for your own outpost and upgrade said outpost with your money, while the government bathes in their own treasures. Basically, they expect you to do the job of 6 people-- by yourself! Almost reminds me of another country.

The struggle is real if you are not careful with how you spend your money and manage you daily bills that accumulate as you upgrade your outpost and hire or promote your men.

Did I also forget to mention that you are a first responder? Whenever a compound is in trouble or a convict has escaped, you are responsible. You don't have to accept them-- but you need that money and those upgrades! Their is always something happening.

So shut up and do your job. Glory to Acaristan!",1703621894,1703881436,True,0,0,0.506076216697692871,0,True,False,False

This adds a little extra to the mix with upgrading parts of your border outpost, purchasing/upgrading additional officers to help during the inevitable shootouts (your outpost gets ambushed every so often by gang members. It isn't difficult especially with upgraded personnel, but from what I understand you can disable ambushes in settings), and purchasing different police vehicles to get around the map in during campaign missions. This is one of those games where you sink 3 or 4 hours in without feeling like you've blinked. 

My one and only complaint about this game thus far is that the ambushes while driving are broken. While you're transporting contraband or prisoners, you get ambushed by 4 gang members randomly from time to time. The issue I'm having is that there are times where I hop out and kill the dudes but the game still says I'm being ambushed and have killed 0/4 men. The music never reverts back to normal so I wind up inspecting cars with this tense combat music and it makes it a little more difficult.

Restarting from checkpoint after failing or dying leads to an infinite loading screen and the only way to move on is to alt+f4 and then restart the day. 

Ambushes are bugged because enemies glitch through the map and are nowhere to be seen. This is more of a severe annoyance due to constantly being hounded by the combat music everywhere I go. Because there is an active ambush that is impossible to end, I'm unable to see any other objectives or move on to do anything else in peace.  

Also, I'm unable to melee attackers because my character gets into some kind of bugged state where my melee weapon never reaches the enemy despite the weapon being in their faces. (I've had this happen with the knife and the pitchfork already and I'm positive it'll happen with any other melee weapon.) I'm unable to switch weapons. I'm unable to interact with vehicles and the only way to deal with this is to alt+f4 and start the day over because reloading checkpoints is broken due to the infinite loading screen bug. 

I found out that the game loves to corrupt your save files and/or delete them automatically and there's nothing the player can do to prevent this from happening. Because of this, the only way to progress is by constantly restarting the day over and over and pray you don't get hit in the face by another game-breaking issue and you play absolutely flawless every day.

This is just a few of many game-breaking and severe issues this game has and it's mind-boggling how the devs never bothered fixing these problems and it's even more egregious how this game has so many positive reviews with so many game-breaking bugs. Apparently, people think games that are barely functional are masterpieces. I'm more convinced that content creators blow this game up so much and give the wrong impressions. 

Is the game good? No. I can't get through the first day because, I keep encountering countless game-breaking bugs one after another with no end in sight. Can it be good? Yes, if the devs actually get off their rear-ends and fix their game instead of riding the high of ""success"" and exposure it's been getting lately like every other studio that gets a spot of exposure and cares more about that than their own game does. 

I don't care what others say. The game is broken beyond belief and it's a miracle it even functions. These issues should have been dealt with a very long time ago.",1703284827,1703537519,False,8,0,0.593652009963989258,0,True,False,False

I'm back with another review. 

🚨 Contraband Police 🚓

I'll start with my review first with these words; buy this game without watching a video or reading anything like it. 'Cause most of the players will be like ""3D Papers Please"" or ""Papers Please FPS"". But that's not the case. I do respect the Papers Please title them as well.

Contraband Police starts like Papers Please at first we are border police, controlling returning and entering people's ID or passport cards. As the day comes forward, You will realize you are more than that. You will see yourself arresting criminals yourself and putting them behind Labor camps *cough* Ah.. Sorry, you will be putting them behind bars.

You will be in a constant firefight with the revolutionary group and criminals. Which I do find that a bit too much. Because after some time firefights start to bore you out. Like in the last 7 in-game days. I was in my Border Office till the end.







Some say DEVs are responsive to their community but I haven't got that chance even tho I did report a couple of visual and audio bugs. ( They never returned to me)

I think there are still some bugs to work out with respect to what the code says the vehicle defects are and what skins are showing up. Also not a fan of wasting a ton of my ""day"" chasing a runner and get paid peanuts for capturing them.

They are able to experiment in ways that AAA games have to play it safe to maximize profits and get a return on their investment. While it's true that CP is heavily inspired by Papers, Please, they do their own thing with the basics of running a border crossing in a fictional communist state. There are upgrades, a small variety of weapons, vehicles you get to drive, and a small town to explore. 

I played through the campaign, which didn't overstay its welcome, and I feel that I've had enough of CP but there are other modes to play if I get the itch again. Overall, the game is great and all of the positive praise in other reviews is earned, but I'm going to offer some criticisms for the sake of balance. (Too many reviewers on Steam are all or nothing. Either the game is awesome or it's terrible, but the reality is that even the best games have room for improvement.)

I really didn't enjoy the side missions that much. They felt a little tacked on and detracted from the outpost, which is where I had the most fun. The firearms did not feel accurate and I really wish the sniper rifle had a short scope but that may have made it OP. The car driving was not as tight as I would like, but with the gun and car mechanics, I couldn't really expect GTA-like tightness with a small dev team that was focused on getting the checkpoint game right, which they absolutely did. The aesthetics were bland, but I really don't expect first-person 3D indies to have mindblowing aesthetics. That stuff is expensive and time consuming to do.

I really hope CP sold well and we see a sequel with a bigger budget because this game rules and I can only see them improving on the formula in the future.",1703405193,1703405193,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[b] The Aspect Of The Game [/b]
[i] You are a new boarder officer in training put in charge of a boarder post on the ""Karikatka"" region. It is your job to rise through the ranks of your post by checking documents, escorting criminals to a work camp, or responding to emergency calls command. You may either stand with your country ruling party or the rebellion the choice is yours really. [/i]

[b] My Two Cent Review [/b]
[i] Ever since the game Papers Please came out I have been in love with document checking games and this game is no exception to that. While it may have that unity feeling of a bunch of free assets all mixed together it's actually a pretty fun game. You take on the shoes as a new boarder inspector in charge of the boarder post. As time progress of course you will be giving new directives to follow and your job will get progressively harder. On your free time you can use your money given to by the state or your trading affairs and either upgrade the boarder outpost, the boarder vehicles, boarder guards or your weapons and tools. During my play through there were plenty of story events that will let you either support the rebellion or the government party. I decided to support the government [spoiler] considering they saved my life from a rebellion criminal deal gone wrong [/spoiler] but that's just me. There were also several parts where you would tail someone or get into a gun fight with criminals which was also pretty fun as well. [/i]

[b] The Value Of The Game [/b]
[i] Twenty bucks is a fair price for the game after all I got 10 hours of enjoyment from it. While it isn't an amazing game it does do it's job well. [/i]

I can't recommend this at the moment. It's got way too many problems that stand in the way of enjoying it.

Initially there is a good amount of checks that need to be made, but quickly you get completely overwhelmed with all manner of nonsense checks and it's far too easy to overlook something. It wouldn't be so bad if I could save the game whenever I wanted, but I can't. The game has no save function, only autosaving once per day.

Spending 10 minutes carefully checking off a bunch of stuff only for the person to drive off and then you get docked ~100 money for missing that they had a broken side mirror doesn't make me want to be more careful next time it makes me want to reload, and that means restarting the whole day as you can't save.

There are side quests, but I've not done any of them because the opportunity to take them seems to be literal seconds, and they occur right in the middle of a workday, sometimes right in the middle of when you're performing a check. Why? As a result I've rejected all of them.

Driving is buggy, my van has ended up hitting *something* and coming to a dead stop on multiple occasions. Plus any car chases or anything you do can lead you to the far side of the map, and then you've got a damn timer to get back to the border before you fail the day for some reason. TIMERS SUCK.

The checks themselves are often buggy. There's a game mechanic where you can click the name/date/whatever and have the game match it. Often when I've done that and the inspection report is clean I've marked the documents and approved, the person has driven off, then it's come up saying the name and date were invalid and I'm docked money. wtf? Again, this would cause me to reload an earlier save, but I can't.

Checking for illegal goods is buggy. There's supposed to be a marker on locations that indicate contraband, but often there isn't. So you'll do all the myriad of checks, find everything's all good, and wave the person off. Whoops you've just lost more money because there was contraband here there and everywhere, in all those places you checked and found nothing. AGAIN - this would make me reload an earlier save, WHICH I CAN'T.

There are a bunch of issues like this, most of which could be worked around by being able to save the game whenever I damn well please. I have no idea why these developers continue to make games with no ability to save the game. It's a basic function that should be in your game, and if it's a design choice, it's a stupid choice.

Finally, people are saying that the game is way too short. A game like this should provide 60+ hours gameplay at least, and apparently people are completing it in 11-15 hours. I wouldn't know though as I've not been able to force myself past 5 hours.",1678973550,1703019968,False,4,1,0.428972005844116211,0,True,False,False

- Doesn't have a huge map. 
- Doesn't have lots of varieties of vehicles.
- Limited engagement withing the entirety of the map.
But I have to say, campaign missions reminded me of GTA IV as vague as that  may sound. Of course limited in fire fights and overall density of the game. But rather a pure , simple but challenging connection of the actual game ( Border Vehicle Inspection ) . 
Now here is the real issue with the game but it's not really an issue more of an identity crisis. 
As I said main part of the game is Border Vehicle Inspection . That part is very intricate and nicely designed I might add. It's perfectly set where you still scratch your head sometimes and even have that moment where you realize you messed up soon as you sent them on their merry way into the country.
The way the rest of the game works is basically as an extension , such as when they make a run or to turn prisoners in from jail. The dilemma here is , it's almost like there's two worlds , the Inspection Station and the rest of the map. You can't really do a lot without finishing your job at the station first , but then sometimes you gotta choose if you wanna arrest someone or go after a dispatch call in the map.
Having more things to do is good , extending on outside of the actual game to make it feel more realistic is also good , but the theme with games nowadays is to make it seamless between each part of the game. I think they can definitely improve on making the game feel a bit more complete as a whole .
In conclusion , 
The game is already a 9/10 in my book. Best $15 I have spent on a game in years. Feel like the value is definitely there.
Looks great , few bugs , doesn't feel like a failed game being released half way into production in best hopes. Can we also appreciate the fact that driving is halfway decent ( rare from indie companies nowadays ) . No it's not realistic but it's not the worst part of the game like so many others. Overall there's some things to improve upon like any game. I hope devs will show love in that aspect , but they also got so many things right that they could have messed up. 
I will update once i finish the game.",1702839552,1702839552,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

First of all, sorry that it took me so long to adapt my review. The developers have shown well how to listen to the community and improve their game. There's now an endless mode, you can finally travel fast and don't have to drive across the map forever.

Previous rating, which was taken apart by the developers through updates:

It is good with low replay value.
Making a decision about this game is proving to be quite challenging.
Don't get me wrong, the game itself is good and I definitely had a lot of fun playing it. However, there are certain mechanics and a lack of content that make it less than replayable. To better explain my thoughts, let me start with the playtime. It took me a total of 11 hours to complete the campaign. During that time, I made sure to transport prisoners, hand over illicit goods to the police, and buy ""tools"" from Vlad. These tools, like knives, pitchforks, and axes, come in handy when trying to find smugglers' hiding places. Vlad also sells tools that pack a bit more punch, which are especially useful when you're being attacked for the umpteenth time by the same group of people who relentlessly shoot at your car and just to get some headshots from you.

The main issue I have with this game is its lack of replay value. It's just not there, which is a real shame because the potential for it is definitely present. The planned infinity mode or one where you can expand your base further, which should have been implemented long ago would be perfect. I sorely miss these features. Additionally, I feel like the decisions you make throughout the game have little to no impact on the overall story. The base could also benefit from more improvements and the map could be designed with more attention to detail. 

Ultimately, it's the little things that bring the game down.",1689362664,1702828916,True,0,0,0.59102398157119751,0,True,False,False

The game play loop is very engaging & addicting. The campaign was far more layered and entertaining than I anticipated. Had me hooked all the way through. NG+ was a nice touch as well. I really appreciate the endless Inspector Mode - I will continue to play that off & on for a very long time. Without it the replay value would seriously suffer.

I will say for someone going for achievements, it becomes very frustrating. Certain achievements just straight up don't unlock, even if the requirements are met. Specifically the achievements tied to events. Some of them I've earned five times over by now & they're still locked. I also don't appreciate the inability to manually save, as well as the scarce save points in general. Also, occasionally the game will incorrectly tell you that you missed something during an inspection when you didn't. Sometimes it will say you missed something like a missing bumper or broken window when you for sure didn't.

Overall, it has its bugs. The achievement bug is the only reason I won't 100% this game which is super annoying. But still, it's way more polished than I thought it'd be. Role playing is a blast, whether you take it seriously or not. PlayWay makes some gems, as well as some duds. This one is a gem.

The gameplay loop is highly addicting and you'll find hours pass as you go about your duties as a border patrol officer. Very active developer, with plenty of updates and improvements. I played the game before and after the Inspector (Endless) mode update and the improvements are very noticeable. Endless mode isn't a bore with cycling entry regulations and plenty of smugglers and wanted criminals to arrest. Challenge mode is also releasing very soon with a greater focus on the inspection part of the game rather than the shootouts and management of the border.

Check the papers, clear them or reject them, anlyze each car in minute detail to try for a perfect inspection, go on missions, get ambushed, fight back, arrest criminals and collect contraband. It's all up to you.

There's still  a couple of bugs, but nothing that destroys the game (you might have to restart a day here and there if it locks up). The biggest issue is returning to the base when an road-ambush was still ongoing. This locked my game every time. So make sure you kill or escape it completely and lose the notification before heading in for the night.

The action side of the game itself is not too challenging and most of time you won't have to worry about dying or failing often, but that's OK.

In typical simulator-game fashion, the achievements are a GRIND to 100%, but they are all obtainable through natural play. They can be a bit janky in a couple of places. 
--Get all the roadblocks done on your first time through a save file 
--On the  contraband drop (endless mode) get all the crates BEFORE the bandits show up for Pacifist, if they spawn the achievement won't pop even if you don't attack them
--Patient zero is an RNG event inside an RNG event, it will show up but it might take longer than you think it would, Easily the most tedious achievement. 
--David vs. Goliath is probably the most fun to try and get. It was nice to be able to just reload the day and go back to the mission start to retry it--if you had to wait for a natural occurrence to get this one, the success rate would be even lower than it already is.",1702133903,1702133903,True,1,0,0.519230782985687256,0,True,False,False

It has an interesting premise and it changes the formula enough so it is not a 100% copy of Papers, Please. Gameplay is not perfect but it is solid enough to do its job and the game design keeps it fresh by making it harder as you progress. Besides checking papers, you'll be driving around a small-ish map doing errands, buying ammo and tools, and working your way through procedural side quests every now and then. Most of the items on my checklist when I review a game are alright here, so I wouldn't say that there's anything particularly bad with this game. But also, there isn't anything particularly amazing.

For the first few hours, I was really liking Contraband Police, but the more I played, the more I started to get annoyed by it. I'm sure I don't have much until I finish it, but I've had enough. I literally have no interest in even watching a youtube video to see how it ends. This game falls in the category of ""chill time passers"", so if that's what you're looking for, this is your game. I personally don't like games to chill but rather than to immerse myself in experiences that will add value to me. And this game did it until it didn't. That's why I'm not finishing it and the reason I'm giving it a negative review.

- I can no longer recommend this game. It's bugged to infinity - I can tolerate a few crashes and a couple of framerate issues, but bugs where you have to restart 16h of gameplay because the game only has 1 save and no checkpoint are unnaceptable. The game is a 'simulation' with a lot leeway for antics, which makes it fun, but also leads to terrible bugs and crashes as the devs couldn't think  of all the possibilities this would open. In terms of gameply, this is essentially digital crack. Really hard to put down once you pick it up. The sense of progression and ramping difficulty is perfect. 

Brilliant but tragically flawed. i will switch my review back to thumb up once (if) they fix the bugs.",1701549892,1701799435,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

While the main fun and focus is inspecting vehicles and documents (which is done very well, I would suggest not using the in-game auto-inspection mechanic as this makes game play too simple imo); You are not confined solely to the border post as you transfer contraband/prisoners, have shootouts, go out for tools and weapons etc.  

You might also have to chase a smuggler or defend your outpost from attacks, all the while upgrading the outpost with more/better guards and facilities.  There is also a story and in game you are given freedom to accept bribes or allow people to cross even if the paperwork isn't in order for whatever reason.

Overall, while some aspects such as the gunplay and upgrades feel a bit tacked on, it breaks up the loop of checking papers/inspecting vehicles rather nicely.  The game is also jank but not in an endearing way (Brigand Oaxaca, Xenus 2 etc) but in a cheap way, however for the sheer effort put into it and for the price ( I got it for 15 on sale) it is well worth it.  It is a simulator that actually tries and it easily could have been so much less in terms of content and certain aspects of detail.

[spoiler]
A few thoughts to the developers:

First, shootouts are too easy. I feel I can stand there and never die, just pop headshot by headshot. The big red markers make these interactions point-and-click without any strategy, and they also break the immersion of no HUD. First time, I was out of ammo, but manged to knife 4 guys without too much resistance, and I think that shouldn't be possible. Being attacked on the road is just a nuisance, not a challenge. Especially late-game with good rifles and health, I can just stand in the middle of the road and click below the red markers, and that's it.

Second, there's too much driving back and forth. Granted, I normally drove my contraband and prisoners whenever there were 2+, not realizing I might as well wait for more, but it still seems excessive. Being able to deliver prisoners and contraband at both locations could alleviate this.

Third, spotting smugglers is a little too easy. They always leave that UV mark, and if there is a hint like partial registration number, once you see it it's almost always going to be a smuggler. Also, it feels unlikely that the authorities know something about every single smuggler. How about adding some extra smugglers, which don't give you penalty if not found, but a significant boost if found? Like an unknown smuggler.

Finally, I would like more stuff to spend money on. The later half of the game I was hovering 10.000-15.000, but the upgrades didn't feel too meaningful. Maybe more cars, or even smaller stuff like automatic car weighing, improved bulletin boards, or cosmetic upgrades, or even just having multiple outside parking spaces.

Gun play is pretty mid and fighting enemies just feels the same every time. Getting ambushed 2 or 3 times EVERY SINGLE TIME I LEAVE THE BORDER makes it more of a hassle. There's no point to upgrade anything as it just increases your expenses for barely improved guards. 

And every time I'm asked to leave the border for something it gets ridiculous. I'm probably a third of the way in and the game is having me solve a poorly translated murder mystery. It's confusing and a lot of the words don't seem to be translated to English right. I want to play a border guard simulator, not solve your 3rd rate murder mystery.

The game consists in checking out various travelers for correct or incorrect documents and applying different laws and regulations that may change from time to time due to the government's decisions. You also have various tasks to identify different smugglers based on minimal information which isn't as easy as you may think. You get money for every perfect check and you loose money for every invalid check.  
You can upgrade different things in the boarder station like the life meter of employees, the cars you use and weapons. Yes, you will need to fire the guns from time to time when the station gets attacked by smugglers or political factions or in different missions where you come face to face with the bad guys.

It's fun for the first few hours but it gets REALLY boring around half way through.
Here are the main issues I have with the game:
1. It's too easy. This goes for both the actual gameplay itself and the enemies you can encounter. I did 112 inspections throughout my play though and only failed 3 of them. At least one of those I remember occurring because I forgot what the chapter entry regulations were. Regardless of that though, 3 fails out of 112 is way too easy. In Papers Please I'd struggle to get through the day with less than two citations which made the game a lot more intense. The issue is not just that it's easy but also the lack of consequences and risks of failing. The day is defaulted to over half an hour and you only need to inspect 5-6 cars a day so there's no sense of danger. I also never felt at risk around enemies since they have terrible damage, accuracy and they also stand still most of the time. If you're carrying prisoners to the labor camp then you'll likely get ambushed by... 4 people. The amount of ambushers never changes throughout the game so by the end I was deciding whether to get out and melee them all to death or just straight up ignore them. It's also pretty amusing how they just spawn in out of nowhere on the middle of the road when you're driving.

2. Atmosphere and 'Story'. Despite the fact this game has a Dystopian setting, it really doesn't feel foreboding. Infact I'd say it feels more like a summer vacation in the forest as the only POI that actually involves something dystopian is the labor camp. There's no named characters that travel through your checkpoint which have any impact on gameplay with the exception of some angry and pretty cringy notes left in your mailbox that look like ragemail a 12 year old might send to you. 

3. Repetition and Gameplay. Like I mentioned earlier, it's fun for the first few hours however the gameplay remains unchanged for the next 10 which turns it from an enjoyable point and click game to a slog. Papers Please worked because it was short... and because it didn't have all of the other issues this game has. Whilst you're wading through the slop of repetitive npcs that say the same couple of voicelines and react the exact same when they're denied/accepted, you'll occasionally be requested to help in a mission. These missions consist of going somewhere on the map, killing a few bad guys and finding some guy in distress or digging up a bit of contraband. Actual Far Cry tier missions. This is in addition to the boring gameplay, clunky gunplay and overall ease of the game itself. There were two missions that stood out, one for the better and one for the worse. The good one being where you're brought to a crime scene and you need to interrogate a list of suspects to figure out who is the murderer. It's a good premise but it was executed rather poorly. For example if you choose the wrong person as the suspect, the real murderer will kill you instantly out of nowhere. I don't think I need to explain why this is stupid but I may as well anyway. By killing you, the murderer instantly tells everyone in the area that one of the two people YOU chose to let free is the actual perpetrator, giving himself away immediately. It also would make no sense for him to kill you as your blunder is the sole reason he's able to escape from any form of punishment. Had this been executed properly, I think that the game shouldn't have told you that you messed up and the real murderer would return later in the game to attack the camp with a group of actually threatening terrorists, or just have him scripted to silently kill off some of your generic npc friends that you had no emotional connection to because they were as bland as the average passerby.

4. Characters. Like I've already mentioned countless times, there are no real antagonist/allies or really any characters that are actually interesting. Every NPC acts the exact same and the 'bad guys' who ambush you are potentially the most generic adaptation of villians I've ever seen in a game. 

Now that I've gone over the main issues that I had in the top of my head, here are some of the things that I think would have made the game a lot better.

1. Ambushes: Instead of 4 enemies spawning 10 meters away who are about as dangerous as the AI drivers you encounter every so often, they should have made actual ambushes. For example, placing something on the road, which isn't easy to notice, that would damage your vehicle to an extent where you cant just drive away. Upon doing this, you'd be attacked by a significant number of actual enemies that know how to shoot a weapon. You would have to make use of the cover of your vehicle to take them down before they overwhelm you.

2. Gunplay: The only thing that desperately needs improving is the sound design because it's absolutely abysmal. It would also be pretty nice if the shotgun didn't take up your entire screen.

3. Atmosphere: I think the game would be more immersive if it felt like you were trapped in a miserable landscape instead of a stock desktop background. Polluted terrain, rampant disease, lack of cleanliness and harsh npc superiors.

4. Gameplay: Make it so you HAVE to get through all the vehicles on time or you're punished severely, we can't have lazy employees at this job. The punishments could, and I think should, have significant gameplay effects. Either add more vehicles per day, or preferably make the day shorter. I think you should also perform your job through at least part of the night where raids and vehicles ready to ambush you could spawn. I never bothered nor needed to use the perception tool when viewing passports so that could be reworked into another skill.

5. Enemies: It would be nice if enemies were actually dangerous. I don't think simply increasing the damage fixes it either as they have terrible coordination. Make it so they work as a group instead of a bunch of individuals who didn't know what they were doing 5 minutes earlier. For example, some throw grenades whilst others cover and they approach you whilst fighting instead of standing around in the open shooting once every few hours.

TLDR: It's fun for a few hours but becomes incredibly boring due to many issues. Was it worth the price? Personally, no.

The developers captured the atmosphere of the 80's in the communist lands and didn't stop there.

The gameplay mechanics provide a fun gameplay loop that is presenting a feel of a constant cat and mouse game between smugglers and the player.

Even though I completed the story mode, with the new endless mode, it always is fun to pop in and check if this time the smugglers will slip something by or I'll catch them but mess up something in the process.

The perfectionists may have a real fun with this game to be a strickler for ever changing regulations and rules a border patrol officer has to abide by.

The game is like Papers Please with an added layer of fun.

One of the best games I bought that puts AAA game developers in shame with being inventive and fun.

And I must say I was pleasantly surprised by it's quality, although here and there I did run into some bugs but at the same time I. WAS mostly playing this on the heavily priced totally not Nintendo Switch ripoff known as the Steam Deck [which by the way, despite it being not officially supported on there it runs well & still does play quite well!! Maybe sometime in the future it will be supported there?] 

ANYWAYS as I was saying, it's quite a nice little game to just put on some headphones & tune out the world for a few hours! If you were ever a fan of Papers Please, it's like that but with the bonus of checking visitor's automobiles for illegal substances, chasing down the runaways, and a sweet little dash of corruption & communism! [Although it does not focus on politics & takes place in a fictional land]

So in conclusion, I would give this game a 9/10! Glory to Akaristan!

Rating: ★★★★☆ (4/5)

Contraband Police takes you on a thrilling ride through the clandestine world of border control, smuggling, and corruption. Developed by Crazy Rocks Studios, this indie game offers a unique blend of simulation and strategy that sets it apart in the vast landscape of Steam titles.

From the moment you don the uniform of a border patrol officer, the game immerses you in the gritty reality of a checkpoint officer's life. Your task is simple on the surface: inspect vehicles, verify documents, and ensure the safety of your nation. However, as you delve deeper into Contraband Police, the complexities and moral dilemmas begin to unfold.

The game's visuals may not be cutting-edge, but they effectively convey the atmosphere of a bleak, post-Soviet setting. The attention to detail in the environments, from rusty vehicles to dilapidated buildings, adds a layer of authenticity that enhances the overall experience. The haunting soundtrack further complements the mood, creating an atmosphere of tension and uncertainty.

Contraband Police shines in its gameplay mechanics. The inspection process is surprisingly intricate, requiring careful scrutiny of documents, vehicle compartments, and even the occupants. Each decision carries consequences, as turning a blind eye to illegal items may lead to personal gain but risks the safety of your nation. Balancing the ethical tightrope is a constant challenge, making every playthrough a unique experience.

The game's narrative unfolds through a series of events and choices, shaping the trajectory of your career and the fate of those around you. The branching storylines add replay value, encouraging multiple playthroughs to explore different outcomes. The writing is compelling, offering a nuanced exploration of morality, corruption, and the impact of your choices on the world around you.

While Contraband Police excels in many aspects, it is not without its flaws. Some players may find the learning curve steep, especially in the early stages, and the lack of a comprehensive tutorial might leave newcomers feeling a bit overwhelmed. Additionally, a few bugs and glitches may hinder the experience, though the developers have shown dedication to addressing these issues through regular updates.

In conclusion, Contraband Police is a captivating addition to the simulation genre, offering a thought-provoking exploration of the moral gray areas surrounding border control. Its unique blend of strategy, simulation, and narrative depth make it a standout title for those seeking an immersive and challenging gaming experience. While not without its quirks, Contraband Police is a noteworthy indie gem that deserves a spot in the library of anyone fascinated by the complexities of law enforcement and moral decision-making.

But in the end, although I have kind of fallen out of playing this game every day, it's fun to get back to it every once in a while to enjoy a fun experience for a bit.",1700696562,1700696562,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It's finally here, I'm not completely finished with the 30 days yet, probably a little over half way, but I can say they hit the spot with the inspection aspect. It's very much like Paper's Please, but way more satisfying, getting to look through people's cars, luggage, documents. It's all very well done.

HOWEVER, there is a few downsides, and the downsides are quite substantial despite the foundation of this game being great. The absolute biggest gripe I have, is a lack of an endless mode. Not only did it not come with release, but it sounds like it'll be added as a separate mode through the main menu, possibly ONLY the inspection element. Honestly, it's nice that the game breaks up the pace with needing to sell contraband, get tools, and bring prisoners to a labor camp when your prison gets full. I really just wanted the ""endless mode"" to come with the story, as most sims tend to do, use a story as a sort-of tutorial, and then leave you forever on your own. THAT is what I want above everything else. I'm expected to enjoy going back to the very beginning where I have nothing, it's on super easy mode when it comes to the inspection as you only have like 3 things to look for. What is that?? Genuinely think the endless aspect should've come with launch. This alone nearly makes this review a downvote.

The ambushes are also one people are complaining about, they do become annoying with the frequency. I don't think they're necessarily hard, just annoying. The combat is entertaining and challenging without being stupid; however, no headshots? You HAVE to shoot dead center mass, a bullet to the head just goes straight through. Makes for some annoying times when I can only see their head, but have no ways of shooting them. 

Overall, this game is well-done. It has some big flaws, but with some updates (that hopefully don't take as long as it took to make this game) it should go from good to superb. I really just hope the endless mode is implemented well; without it, this game's replay value is lacking.

EDIT: After very long silence from the developers besides just saying, ""There will be an endless mode"". There really wasn't much communication as to what it entailed, how it would work, when it was coming... However, now that it's released, it is everything that I needed to push this game into the ""absolutely worth it"" category. Paper's Please 3D, but with emphasis on contraband. The ""inspection"" mode was implemented very well.

Don't be surprised if you find instances where what you actually find does not match what the report claims to be true, for example a vehicle is missing two fenders but after you turn it in it claims it was only missing one, or it claims there was more contraband where you already picked it up from and none was left.

*General AI :
- AI coming to the checkpoint and driving on the map have a tendency to not use their lights even when it is dark enough they should.

* Checkpoint Runners :
- The subjects who jump back into their truck the moment you hop out after finding contraband and flee while you can take no action to stop them from doing so other than to kill them and get the murder flag prompt is annoying. (At this point the moment they move for the truck I run to the gate and shoot them through the windshield the moment the alarm siren starts to go off as they are free game at that point.)
- The subjects who just simply never stop and simply bash through the gate are even worse. There should be a tire spike or bollard system to stop these at one of the upgrade stages for the secondary gate.

* Contraband Hiding Places :
- Contraband has a tendency to be hidden in the same places on vehicles every time even though the vehicle has other places that it could be hidden (lack of randomization), as well as not making use of potential hiding places in several of the vehicles.
- Spare tires should be removable like cargo to make inspections easier.
- Vehicle doors could have removable interior panels allowing items to be concealed within them instead of a single solid object.
- Grazduk A&B : hide contraband between the cargo box and spare tire behind the cab?
- Grazduk : hide contraband in the gap between the frame and the mounts for the cargo box and spare tire behind the cab?
- Ilich 57 : Hide contraband between the frame and cargo carrier, this could be secured by tape?
- Zagr 53 : hide contraband in the medical kit under the passenger side dashboard?

* Paper Inspections :
- Having the NPC stand outside the car on the scale removes them from the weight calculation skewing the number (bug?)
- Add VINs to vehicles and a list that can be retrieved from the office in the morning of stolen vehicles VINs to look out for, or even just to verify the vehicle's VIN matches the registration.
- Once you realize the subjects name is wrong on one document it doesn't matter if you notice it is wrong on multiple forms as it is only a singular check point on the report. (Obviously this applies to other fields as well but I am using the name as an example.)  I feel that a multiple column checklist with Icons or abbreviations for each of the documents actually making you check each one rather than just finding the one name error and writing the rest off would be more immersive and rewarding.

* Tools :
- Tool durability is an example of just because you could doesn't mean you should, it is purely an annoyance.

* Ambushes & Checkpoint Attacks :
- Ambushes happen way to frequently when you have them turned on, like multiple times in one trip. (thank you for the off option, but they really should just be scaled back.)

* Checkpoint Personnel :
- The guy responsible for reloading cargo (Maximov)  wandering around gets old very quickly. If I have cargo unloaded he should be right there and waiting for me to tell him to reload it, he is supposed to be an 'assistant', not wandering around to take five hundred smoke breaks.
- These guys could be more useful if they reacted and did anything to help stop the idiot smashing through our checkpoint. For example the mechanic could hop in and ride with you to chase them and drive the subjects vehicle back to finish the inspection, or they could fire at the vehicle smashing through the checkpoint.",1698897922,1700638716,False,0,0,0.470446318387985229,0,True,False,False

Back in the day, I always thought what is would be like to play ""Papers Please"" in First Person. And my prayers have been heard. And it is even more amazing than I thought it would be. Despite just checking smugglers this game has so much more to offer! It is really fun and the campaign is interesting.
They even ""invented"" their own slavic languages for each nation. So, they would sound a bit unfamiliar even for slavic speakers.
Also, I love the music that is playing in the background! Many don't get why the music sounds more sad or sentimental. For this reason, I get to believe that these people behind the game knew what is was like in a Polish communist state.

Contraband Police is a new entrant in the gaming scene that puts an intriguing twist on the well-known concept of border control gaming, taking inspiration from ""Papers, Please."" While it carries some echoes of the cult classic, Contraband Police attempts to break new ground by transitioning from the 2D world of paperwork and stamps to a fully immersive 3D environment with a story-driven narrative. The game also introduces some novel features, such as daily quests in its endless mode, that add variety and challenge to the gameplay.

The transition to a 3D world is undoubtedly one of the game's highlights. Contraband Police immerses you in a detailed border crossing, where you must scrutinize vehicles, inspect cargo, and interact with people, making the experience much more interactive and immersive. The move from a flat 2D world to a 3D environment is a natural progression, allowing players to feel like they're genuinely at a border checkpoint.

However, where Contraband Police falls a bit short is in its storytelling and the emotional connection between the player and the characters. In ""Papers, Please,"" there was a constant moral dilemma as you faced desperate people trying to enter the country. The game would only penalize you if you made too many mistakes, which allowed for more empathy towards the characters. In contrast, Contraband Police's approach of deducting money right away lacks the same emotional impact. Perhaps implementing a similar system to ""Papers, Please,"" with warnings or citations before financial penalties, would enhance the emotional depth of the game.

Additionally, one aspect where ""Papers, Please"" outshines Contraband Police is in its reintroduction of memorable characters. ""Papers, Please"" featured characters like Gorgi, whose humorous and memorable interactions with the player provided levity in an otherwise tense atmosphere. Contraband Police could benefit from incorporating more character-driven moments to create a stronger bond between players and the individuals seeking entry into the country.

Another area that needs improvement in Contraband Police is the behavior of NPCs. Currently, they seem to serve little purpose as they merely stand around until a border attack occurs. Enhancing the role and interactivity of NPCs could make the game world feel more dynamic and lively.

I love this game, I really do, but I don't think it's quite there yet. You should definitely still give it a try but I feel like this game needs a touch more time to roast in the oven that is game development.

Like ""Papers, Please"" in 3D and with guns. This is the gist of it, but because it is easy and lazy to just compare a game to some other popular game and it is not only that, I will say a bit more. [i]Edit a bit later: I had more to say down there, but after writing what felt like the script to a 40 minute video I decided to keep my old TL:DR as my main review.[/i]

[b]This game forces you to check papers, manage (more like upgrade) and defend your borderpost, and follow along on a story about revolution. It is a bit like an arcady simulation game of the job as a borderpost guard in a fictional (presumably) soviet state. Combining action from the FPS genre and meticulous detail checking (more or less for each detail) from border guard simulation is pretty fun and a new spin.

As other reviews have said, this is basically Papers Please in 3D with real graphics (pretty good ones actually), cars, guns, shops and inventories, etc. You manage a border control post that can be upgraded to make your work easier and more efficient. Your main task is to check vehicles going through the border, looking at their IDs, permits, checking their cargos, vehicle conditions, making sure they adhere to all the entry policies that change as the story progresses - and of course, as the name suggests, a big part of your job is to search suspicious vehicles for contraband like illegal weapons, cigarettes, drugs, counterfeit money and so on. They can be hidden anywhere in the car or in the cargoes, and you need to use specific tools to crack them open. You get rewarded by performing accurate checks and penalized if you fail to turn back cars with problematic paperwork or arrest smugglers trying to bringing in contraband. There are also side quests that you do outside of the border post like clearing a gang point or rescuing a fellow police officer, etc. The money you earned can be used to upgrade your border control station, buy new police cars, buy guns, and more tools. So, basically that's the game loop. Overall it's designed fairly well I would say, very well paced, and keeps you wanna to continue playing. There is also a main story, which is bull$hit and really serves no purpose other than giving your some backgrounds and providing some excuses for the game to progress. To me, the biggest draw of this game is just the simple task of performing border control. It's the same game mechanic that makes Papers Please such an interesting game. There is something satisfying and soothing about methodically going through the paperwork, checking the cargoes and vehicle, and then applying the ""Approved"" or ""Denied"" stamp. Very immersive, indeed.

You also have radiant events like drivers forcing their ways, people trying to bribe you, midnight bandits attack, etc. Gun play is also not bad for a game like this. You can nitpick about how the game becomes a little repetitive towards the end, but for the price it asks for, this is an easy recommend.",1700548567,1700548686,True,1,0,0.418045669794082642,0,True,False,False

Good value for money. The game is primarily about inspection so don't expect a premier shooter experience. The graphics are not flashy but there is enough detail that I didn't really care. I had the odd crash but it did not affect my experience.

Positives:
- Lots of hiding spaces for contraband - check everywhere!
- Car chases where you have to P.I.T. cars off the road to stop them.
- Shootouts (no scopes which can be a little painful)
- Lots to upgrade in Inspector mode.
- There is a large variety of checks to conduct with enough variables on the daily intel board to keep you on your toes.

Rather than talk about any negatives, I'll mention some suggestions that I think will improve the experience:
- During car chases have an option for AI to deploy a stinger/roadblock up ahead for a cost.
- Add a basic 2x scope to the long rifle and red dot to the automatic rifle.
- Reduce handling on evading vehicles if a tyre has been shot out/is flat.
- Increase the speed (vary the handling) of the other vehicles (I found that I just bought the fastest vehicle early on as there was no use for the slow ones).
- Either have a second page of inventory (purchasable upgrade) or add a separate inventory space for weapons and tools.
- Save game option - at this time the game only saves once each morning when you wake up.
- The daily mission to sell contraband needs a bigger reward or less contraband requirements. As it stands it isn't worth the hassle to wait until you have the right amount. Its more convenient just to hand over to the guard.
- Some clarity on when accepting a bribe will be detected or not detected. Sometimes I could get away with it, sometimes not. Is this a random risk?
- The final upgrade to your sleeping quarters should max out your perception most times. I find with the final upgrade to roads, i was spending longer on the line and my perception would barely touch the final bar after sleep.

Overall, a great game for the price. I look forward to seeing what updates are implemented and where the game can go.

BUT COMETH endless OMG

they knocked it out the park you start with a joke outpost and get to build it intro a formidable one Stalin would happy with plus the highlighted missions as opposed to the mission interrupting your day and often my stride. 

wish mods were a thing that or ask nicely and get the soundtrack of workers and resources soviet republic as it add the ""commie"" 80s vibe. much sought after. 


overall the game is decent and endless mode can take longer than the campaign after you've got everything its basically just me brassing up everyone and spending cash on the micros to make a little less pathetic. worth the price yes but if you can get on a sale makes for a decent purchase. can it be long only if you make it. endless mode made this game for me and hopefully challenge mode will carry forward the awesomeness. 

things id like to see, mods or a decent soundtrack something like or actually soviet republic  a more interactive environment even just looking about the outpost maybe a BTR70 for proper border troops feels?

The game have a unique style and act almost as more investigative papers please. It does not have the philosophical and criticism that papers please often provide with its emotional impact, but it does have a small storyline which is also very interesting and very fun to play through as an introduction to the much beloved ""endless mode"".

Id love to see it have multiplayer in the future because my friends and i would have great fun messing around our own boarder post. 

The AI boarder guards could do with having a little more life in them as one other person mentioned, when people run your check point and you are full sprinting to get to the police vehicle to give chase the rest of the guards are just standing around watching with zero interest on this person who's just blown threw the checkpoint so maybe having them try to stop them by opening fire or throwing stop sticks or something would be cool, it doesn't have to actually stop the runaway because chasing them is fun but having them react in anyway would be better for the immersion of the game.

Being able to plan were new buildings go would be cool as well if thats something you guys have the ability to do, like if you want to move the sniper tower to a different spot to better defend from raids etc

Combat is really secondary, as long as you don't stand completely in the open or on top of a grenade, you are unkillable. The pistol does the job right up until you unlock the last weapon. 
Endless mode is cool, missing a proper money sink though. E.g. you could implement an information system, where you spent  money to unlock more hints for smugglers, have a reputation system with the Barkeeper, Vlad and maybe the Contraband buyers. Right now you just have a bigger set to upgrade compared to the campaign, but after around about 30 days you should be maxed out there too.

Also nice that the story and decisions you make can be considered both good and bad.
Everything has a consequence, so I felt often that I am on the wrong side of the topic while
progressing. I guess a bit like in real life.

There is enough content for a good game, but don't expect big open world and/or many options/missions.
Just enough to be satisfied, although I would have liked more to continue the game further.

There are a few bugs (game related):
- F1 button i used to unstuck car, however F1 also used for mission state (which prevents the unstuck when active)
- one time the car acceleration was kept zero, so i could not move. Restarting game fixed it.

Whilst most of the game play is centred around inspecting documents and searching cars for contraband there is also a bit of gun-play which is admittedly a bit bare bones but still serviceable. 
Having said all that there are a few minor things that I'd bring up that I think would improve the experience a little. 

1. We should be able to switch weapons whilst reloading, once the reload animation begins I need to wait for it to be completed which is a big issue when I'm fending off 40 terrorists and I have a fully loaded pistol in the other slot that I could use to narrow the herd before I reload my rifle. 

2. Getting out of vehicles when driving is a bit tedious at times, I have to turn off the engine, turn my camera, open the door and then press the strafe button to leave instead of just pressing one button to exit, when trying to leave my car during a firefight or to take care of a fugitive this is quite an issue. 

3. We should be allowed to loot dead bodies after fighting a horde of terrorists attacking our border. I've lost count of the amount of bodies I couldn't loot after a long fight which drained me of my ammo

4. More toolbar slots.

Contraband Police, while promising in concept, leaves players with a mixed experience. Set in a detailed open world, you step into the shoes of a border control officer, inspecting vehicles for contraband. The game's attention to realism is commendable, from inspecting documents to searching vehicles meticulously. However, the gameplay often feels repetitive, lacking variety and depth. The interface can be clunky, hampering the overall experience. While the game captures the tension of the job, its potential is undercut by monotonous tasks and technical shortcomings, making it a 5/10.

In seriousness, this was a delight to play - a bit jarring at first with the language, but playing the game consistently you start to pick up on certain things with the language which made the experience more charming. There are a few bugs here and there, like during the last campaign mission I couldn't enter a door until I reset the level 3 times. Driving is weird, some cars it feels like you're driving on ice which is really annoying and some parts of the map have invisible barriers on corners so you can't do sharp turns or cross without crashing into nothing to apprehend criminals.

I do love the detective solving of papers please, investigating the vehicle and background of the person is at core one of the best gameplay experiences I've had. Having the F1 option to see your score afterwards is a really nice touch too to see what you missed (if anything) and depending on how well you inspected your cash prize will be double or subtracted.

756800,148529360,76561198037306122,197,21,98,0,98,1687189279,"Contraband Police is a game that offers a distinctive and intense immersion into the world of border security and law enforcement. With its focus on realism and the challenges of inspecting vehicles and identifying contraband, this title provides a unique experience that's both thrilling and educational.

The core premise of Contraband Police revolves around your role as a border control officer, inspecting vehicles, identifying illicit items, and making decisions that can impact the safety and security of your fictional nation. The game's realism is evident from the get-go, with a vast array of vehicles to inspect and a variety of tools at your disposal to assist in your work.

The tension and excitement that come with each inspection cannot be understated. The sense of urgency when identifying potential contraband and making quick decisions keeps you engaged, even if you're facing the same task repeatedly. The feeling of discovery when you uncover hidden items or catch a suspect in a lie is immensely satisfying.

The game's graphics and audio add to the overall immersion. The environment is suitably gritty and realistic, creating a convincing portrayal of a border checkpoint. The sound design, from the engine hum of vehicles to the detailed inspection sounds, adds to the atmosphere.

However, it's important to note that Contraband Police's realism can also be a double-edged sword. The game's complexity and the need to follow correct procedures might overwhelm some players, especially those new to the genre or looking for more casual gameplay.

Additionally, the pacing can be slow, and the gameplay loop may feel repetitive to some players. If you're not captivated by the detailed inspection process and the constant scrutiny of documents and cargo, you may find the game less enjoyable.

In conclusion, Contraband Police is a game that stands out for its dedication to realism and its focus on the intricacies of border control and law enforcement. It offers a thrilling and educational experience, immersing players in the daily tasks and challenges faced by those in this profession. While it may not cater to everyone's gaming preferences due to its complexity and potentially repetitive gameplay, it's a fascinating opportunity to explore the world of border security and contraband detection. If you're interested in the subject matter and are looking for a unique and immersive simulation, Contraband Police is well worth a closer look. It's an engaging experience that may just leave you feeling like a real officer on the thin blue line.",1697791472,1697791472,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I played all the side missions and finished the game in around 10 hours.

The world building falls flat when compared to Papers Please and there is way too much time spent on shooting bad guys that just stand in one spot and shoot in your general direction. Of these 10 hours, probably less than 5 were spent doing the core gameplay of checking papers and vehicles.

There should be an endless mode where checks are procedurally generated to allow the strongest part of the game to last more than 5 hours.

Now that endless mode has come out and its fleshed out a bit, its gotten REALLY good. The only issue is that the pursuits are a bit of a chore, You just drive out and pit maneuver the enemies of the state. I wish that there was a mechanic to shoot while driving, but I can understand that its a bit to implement. Haven't stumbled upon any glitches, gun play feels fairly serviceable. Has a neat cover mechanic that will peek you out when you aim. And if you don't feel like shooting enemies, the game does let you turn off raids, although that may only be in Endless mode. The story mode isn't Casablanca, but it tells *a* story in the world that kinda sets the mood if that's your thing. If you want to jump right into it and play endless mode, you can also do that without any downside. 

TL;DR If you liked Papers Please, want a chill game to play after a long day,  or are looking for something a little different, I think this game is well worth the 20 dollars.

Please note that my information is based on knowledge available up to September 2021, so there may have been updates or changes to the game since then.

Title: ""Contraband Police: A Gritty Dive into Border Enforcement""

Rating: ★★★☆☆ (3/5)

""Contraband Police"" offers a unique and gritty simulation experience, taking players into the challenging and morally complex world of border enforcement. While it has its strong points, the game does come with some notable drawbacks that affect the overall gameplay.

Immersion in Law Enforcement: The game excels in immersing players in the role of a border police officer. The attention to detail in recreating the everyday tasks and responsibilities of a border patrol agent is commendable. The developer's dedication to realism is evident in the game's mechanics, such as inspecting vehicles, interrogating travelers, and searching for contraband.

Moral Dilemmas: ""Contraband Police"" effectively explores the moral dilemmas faced by border officers. You'll be forced to make decisions that can have significant consequences, and the game doesn't shy away from presenting complex choices. This adds a layer of depth and authenticity to the gameplay.

Challenging Gameplay: The game can be quite challenging, especially for players who enjoy a realistic and demanding experience. Keeping a close eye on details, managing your resources, and making judgment calls can be intense and rewarding.

Limited Scope: Unfortunately, ""Contraband Police"" suffers from a somewhat limited scope. The gameplay can become repetitive as you repeat similar tasks over and over. There's also a lack of variety in the types of vehicles, travelers, and contraband you encounter, which can make the experience feel monotonous after a while.

Technical Issues: As of my last update in September 2021, ""Contraband Police"" had its share of technical issues, including occasional bugs and performance problems. It's worth checking if these issues have been addressed through updates.

Niche Appeal: The game's focus on realism and its niche theme might limit its appeal to a specific audience. If you're looking for a fast-paced action game, ""Contraband Police"" may not be your cup of tea.

In conclusion, ""Contraband Police"" is a simulation game that successfully immerses players in the world of border enforcement and poses intriguing moral dilemmas. However, its limited scope and potential technical issues may deter some players. If you're a fan of simulation games and enjoy a challenging, realistic experience, ""Contraband Police"" is worth considering, but it may not be for everyone.",1697503156,1697503156,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Update 3/25/23: The devs are making steady progress with the weekly patches which look very promising, they have released 3 so far that address SOME of the concerns, I will keep an eye on further patches and will be personally waiting a little bit longer to try the game again (most likely when the ""Free Mode"" releases).

They took the Papers Please concept and ran with it, adding management systems and a semi-open world as well as it being a 3D game of course.

Let me just summarize the good. 
The game adds enough to the idea of Papers Please to still be original and refreshing like having vehicles to check as well as cargo in those vehicles, the border post upgrades are also nice and give you a sense of progression if only slight.

The core gameplay loop is very addicting as someone who loved Papers Please, at first I hated the management tasks you had to do but it grew on me when I looked at the game as less of a Papers Please clone and more of it's own thing.

Now the annoyances.
The Ambushes (Just disable them), I never found a need to participate in them, I just drove right past them and did not care, I wasn't punished for it and I never felt like I needed to just stop everything I was doing to get out of my car and deal with them, maybe make them mandatory like a tree is down in the road (already an rng mechanic) ya know... like an actual ambush.. or just get rid of them entirely cause they were just an inconvenience.

The Tools, I guess since everything else was managementified they had to make the tools break over time so you have to buy new ones whenever yours breaks you better hope you have a spare in your storage when one of them breaks or else you aren't getting that sweet contraband and you will miss out on some money.

SEMI-Open World, the main missions obviously are mandatory to beat the game but they don't let you choose when you can do them and they randomly show up.. like in the middle of an inspection (at least they give you 5 minutes to accept the mission so you can finish your current inspection). If someone drives through the checkpoint or flees from an inspection once you catch them they give you 5 minutes to get back to your post and you feel rushed to gather all the contraband out of the criminal's vehicle and that's if you decide to grab that contraband for the extra money, now I do think that the 5 minute time limit is okay to do anything around the map, you definitely feel rushed when there is that time limit on the screen.

Finally the major cons.
Trading.. I found it to be completely useless once you are in mid-game as it doesn't make you enough money to be even worth your time plus depending on how many items you buy to trade it takes up inventory/storage space that could be used to store extra tools.

The Money Balance, I never felt like I was struggling for money to be honest (like how you feel in Papers Please), the lowest I got was -$47 at the very start, also by the end of the game like the last week I was so loaded I had no idea what to do with the money, once you get all the upgrades for the border post there's nothing really major to spend your money on so you just have too much of it, I was calling transports and supplies just because I could.

The Gunplay, half the time my shots never landed cause the iron sights are so off so that was very annoying (I'd like to mention I have an ultrawide monitor and maybe the ultrawide support is bugged to make the iron sights be slightly off? I'm not entirely sure, I hope the devs look into that), also I never felt like I needed to use a different gun (I tried all the guns the iron sights were still off) because the pistol one shots pretty much every enemy if you shoot them in the head, the shotgun felt so terribly weak that I was using my one shot pistol over it (the pistol is the starting gun btw out of 4 others), overall just felt kinda rough but it isn't really focused on that much even though i'd say maybe 30% of the game is shooting.

The Raids (Just disable them), I felt no need to kill any of the bandits and use up ammunition when more of them were going to spawn anyway, I would let my comrades kill them until the timer went down to 0, they would stop spawning then I would assist so I would not waste ammo on people that are basically infinitely respawning, it didn't help that the further you got in the story the raid timers got longer and longer. It also sucks that it just completely voids your current inspection you are doing, the person just drives away once a raid has started, so you could spend a whole 10 minutes on an inspection for it to mean nothing.

The Story, I never really was following it and was really just uninterested, it was hard to keep track of certain characters in the story, the only things I looked at were the current events of the chapter and the associated newspaper and the little side story letters (basically the same story telling bits from Papers Please) the whole rebel leader's story lines and main missions were just meh.

The performance, I saved this for last as it might just be a me issue as my computer is definitely getting somewhat dated (cpu and gpu from 2017), I was playing on medium (low looks horrid and didn't really improve performance for me) during main loop of gameplay it was okay for me around 50-60, but the big gunfights (raids and main missions) TANKED down to 15-20 really close to unplayable for me, I've been doing fine on this build for a while now, to put it in perspective cyberpunk on release never dropped that low for me.. that's pretty rough.

While this review mainly highlighted the problems I still think the price point of $20 is fair, but... the problems are there and considering this game is ""Full Release"" and not Early Access it's quite odd, I don't see why they didn't go Early Access cause it still needs polish in my opinion like major rework of mechanics type of polish. I think the campaign is worth A playthrough, especially if you loved Papers Please like me but the main selling point will probably be the Freeplay Mode when that comes out (they said they are working on it).

Inspection: You just shine a UV light at the different parts of the vehicle and if you see a dragon sign on any part than there is contraband there, if not, then its clear.... /slowclap.  that could have been much better, could have had small clues and irregularities that force you to think instead of a super clear ""dragon sign"". a bit lacking there.

Driving: 
A complete chore as the mechanics are very outdated and just clunky and not fun, yet you're forced to do it very often. 
Roads are narrow and uninteresting, turning on sirens causes everyone around you to hit trees, rocks or anything around them like a 20 year old AI, there are unnecessary road ambushes very very often that takes me to the second point of Shooting.

Shooting: 
Feels like a 20 year old shooter once combat starts, pretty bad aiming and weapon handling, all the enemies just stand in the same position and keep firing at you non-stop until you take them out (they also know exactly where you sre even if youre behind cover, wallhackers !), bodies disappear very quickly before you had a chance to search them for items so after a shooting you just run like a maniac to quickly search everything before they despawn. If shooting isnt the main issue of a document inspection game, why do you make it happen so often? road ambushes and inspection point attacks are just a chore that you just want to finish it and move on.  if it happens so often, should have made shooting more dated, at least it would be a fun part of the game.

Menus are terrible and barely anything from menu options is explained.

There are 3 parts to it, the document (and vehicle) verification, first person driving, and first person shooting. The driving and shooting parts are fun but tend to get old pretty quickly. I felt like I wanted to get back to just verifying vehicles documents are vehicles and cargo and turning away smugglers. It is not all bad because the game heavily pushes you in the direction of actually being there rather than having the story told to you, and it does feel like that when you are driving prisoners to the labor camp and half way there you are ambushed by people you have to either shoot to kill, drive over to kill, or run away from.

There is some progression as well with the kind of home you have (which is supposed to refill ""perception"" but mine never ran low, even with the garbage caravan shelter I had) which lets you automatically mark mismatches on the documents to your report instead of having to manually mark them, and the prison guards and the base guards and the guns and tools you get. This mostly isn't very interesting, but adds to the realism of having to look after you and your guards in what is a very low key quiet border crossing that has its share of dangers.

I will add that I did replay papers please shortly before I bought this and that probably added to me feeling like I just wanted the simplicity of just matching papers and confirming things were as they should be.",1696914761,1696914761,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[b]Welcome to the great nation of Acaristan![/b] In a communist country, as a player you take on the role of an officer trainee at a remote border post in the mountainous region of Karikatka. Your tasks include controlling vehicles and people who intend to enter the Acarist People's Republic. Shady characters and smugglers try to cheat their way through the border control, which you should prevent, of course. There will also be car chases. You can upgrade and improve your police car, your colleagues and your accommodation. And many many more. Many hours of play are guaranteed, try it now! I love this game!

The save function can also only be operated by resting, so this requires some forethought before starting a day as they are between 25 and 45 minutes.

Edit: I now fully recommend this game as an endless option has now been added. I have no complaints about wither the story or endless modes now.

It's well worth the price, and the graphics are medium quality. There's some controls and movements that don't feel smooth, but that's expected for a freshly released game. I saw a review talking about hitboxes causing them to crash into nothing, and from driving on the road and on the side of the road, I have so far not hit a single invisible barrier. My grievance with this game isn't about world exploration or the ambushes, either, like some other reviews(Only at first are the ambushes rough, as they can destroy your vehicle easily unless you upgrade it. After that, you can easily just drive by them, and if you're lucky they don't even get the chance to shoot). My issues stem from easily avoidable bugs that could've been detected if playtesters intentionally looked for them. I can list a few, and then afterwards I'll explain what I do enjoy about this game.

The two main grievances have to do with the ambushes on the border that happen from time to time. Both are game-breaking and can force you to be pushed back to either a checkpoint, or to the start of the day. If you happen to be using the telephone for time-specific ambushes that aren't triggered by sleeping, it teleports you out into the battlefield where you cannot move, as for some reason you receive a new pair of arms that removes your legs, supposedly. You can't move, but you can shoot, which makes it not entirely guaranteed for you to die, but it is pretty guaranteed especially if an enemy throws a grenade. Another I came across was with the cars driving up during the ambush. At some point, before they exit or during the animations they make while exiting, I shot at them, which showed it did damage. However, their health bar did not deplete. Once they exited and drew their guns, they were invulnerable to everything. It forced a reset from me because there was literally nothing I could do to stop them. Again, if this was playtested thoroughly, these wouldn't be present. Sure, on release any game can excusably have bugs and game-breaking issues that weren't discovered during playtesting, but with how some of these you're guaranteed to experience at least once in your playthroughs, that's where I say it's doubtful that no one during testing came across any of these, whether looking for bugs or not. 

With those issues aside, I'll get on to the things I like about this game. First off, before you install the game, from how it looks and how well the game runs, it's surprising how small the game's storage requires compared to other games of similar quality. The quality of gameplay is comparable to Ubisoft games on here, excluding the cutscenes. There's some times where the frames drop below 60, but it's not very noticeable, and I'm on the default settings of the game. For default settings, I'd say it's debatable whether your frames should ever drop noticeably, but I think it depends on the minimum requirements more than your current specs.

This game is heavily inspired by Papers, Please: A fictional Slavic communist republic has a border crossing that the player works at, and based on criteria you are informed on for that day and for what you're taught in the previous days, you determine whether that individual is allowed to cross. Just like Papers, Please, there's people who attempt to forcefully cross the border, and there's attacks you have to fend off. The documents, the photo, the multiple regions that are constantly having issues with each other, the rebellion in your region, it all remains quite clear. I dare say this is the closest game to Papers, Please that's 3D. 

The process for finding smuggled items is quite simple, as is the display for it. The items you uncover from parts of the vehicle or from cargo isn't accurate to what's displayed inside it all the time. However, sometimes it's easy to miss these. Like the trainer says to you in the first few days, people can get inventive with their methods of trying to smuggle things. These methods feel realistic, too, as while they are forced to have a snake mark only visible in UV light wherever they hide smuggled items, they can blend in very well dependent on what it is. You'll often overlook some of these, and I applaud that. One thing I might add that I hope gets changed is the single jump sound that you hear each time. It's the same with no pitch change, so it feels like I'm playing Quake in a Slavic countryside.

For those who don't want to read all of this, I'll summarize and say things in my own words in a short few sentences: You are a demi-god who can choose to either fight crime or to fight the government. When you are ambushed by enemies, or when you attack those who oppose you, they have no idea how powerful the force that they've interrupted currently is. With your superior aim, vitality, and detection, you strike fear into your enemies in their last moments of life, making them question their life choices and wish that they didn't take this path. Also there's bugs so I can't currently recommend it.

For an Early Access game it has a decent amount of content for the player to enjoy. I'm optimistic about this game and hope the devs continue with this great start. I would certainly recommend trying the demo at the very least. 

The premise of Contraband Police is the player takes the role of a border guard in a communist / soviet-esque setting. The players success (and ability to continue playing the game) will depend on their ability and efficiency as a border guard. The better you are - the more money. The worse you are, the chances you might go broke due to upkeep. The [b]gameplay[/b] is very basic and straightforward. The player interacts regularly with items and people to check for any discrepancies. It starts simple with passport pictures, expired documents, and potentially some smuggling but as the game progresses the checks become a lot more difficult. In a way, it makes you think how much has to go through someones head when doing security. As situations in Karikatka unfold and new developments happen, the demands around the checks will change. Fortunately, the game does have some manual click-to-check functions for players to do checks quicker. It will cost the player a little focus each time it is used (which will enforce the need to rest). 

There are tools the player can buy in the world to improve their border guard ability. Sometimes this may be weapons, it may be tools, or upgrade to the player's border stop. (be it personnel or buildings). It is an open world map where players can interact with a few places, drop contraband or prisoners off. A van is given to the player to start, but if player's don't feel like contraband and prisoners all the time they may call for a transport (which will cost a pretty penny)! The premise is the player allows cars or trucks to go through and can ask the driver for documents or to step out of the car. If necessary, the player can make arrests and find contraband around and in the vehicle. Players may account for cargo and take it out of the vehicle to further inspect if anything else is hidden. While this is happening, random events will occur that will demand the player's attention. My suggestion is to do these missions as they pay a pretty penny. Don't worry about the border though, it doesn't seem like the drivers have any choice but to wait :). I don't know if this was on purpose, but it is appreciated when things go haywire and gangsters start raiding the border and the player needs to defend (hopefully with more than just a pipe). There are other missions that help  with the development of the story and it feels like the missions are decently well rounded. 

The [b]visuals and graphics[/b] are pretty good. They aren't extremely detailed, however the game does a good job immersing the player into the environment. The level design seems pretty well organised to me and well laid out. There are cut-scenes in the game in addition to small animations that NPCs will engage in. Visual upgrades to the border base are also noticeable as well as the personnel. The [b]audio and music[/b] are well done. I think more needs to be added to this domain, but again, for an Early Access game I think a decent amount was included. The player can play music while driving around in the police truck. 

Overall, I would highly recommend this game on sale. If it seems interesting to you even if its not on sale, I'd say go for it. I really enjoyed my play through and can only hope the devs continue to add to the game as much as possible. Fingers crossed down the line there is some sort of endless mode and hopefully workshop items/missions. 

TO THE DEVS:
-Endless mode would be highly recommended and I think appreciated
-Any plans for workshop items / missions down the road? I'm sure the community would love to help out
-The steering is a little weird and stiff... not sure if it was meant like that. The animation for the turning also isn't the most accurate... small detail :)
-Perhaps a sort of flash/easy mode for those new to the game. I played Papers Please so picking this up wasn't an issue, but noticed some other gamers were overwhelmed - even with a solid tutorial. Maybe an option in the gameplay menu?
-Well done with the environment, actually impressed with how much there is even in Early Access. Continue working on the world and adding events, items, things, NPCs whatever to it.
-Give player an ability to see future ambushes maybe with a radar down the road? 
-AI partners do not feel useless and actually provide cover / do something during gunfights. Enemy AI also feels well balanced. 
-What about stopping regular traffic? Why not add more to the game in terms of exploring by allowing the player to do random stops INSIDE the country? Perhaps on endless mode, may be too much for campaign.

Crazy Rocks & PlayWay S.A – Where does It say, In the Games Description that: That we need to attend Missions? Doesn’t state this anywhere does It, but what. It doesn’t state any of this at: https://store.steampowered.com/app/756800/Contraband_Police/. 

Missions Dictated to Attend: Gold Colored. 
Missions to opt out of: Silver. 

When, a suspect drives off, there vehicles are faster than you: how does that work Crazy Rocks? All Vehicles should be the same. But no, we’re Dictated to the way you have Developed this Fake Policing Game. If you are a Contraband Border Officer, you are then to deal with Contraband Policing only, not attending Dictatorship Calls/Missions, Missions should be optional, and not the way they’re Dictated by you. 
When the game Is in a state: “Loading… Please wait” It doesn’t need this at all. All It needs Is “Loading.” that’s It. Another European Game Developer, who’s a Please Dictator. There Is no grammar, no punctuation In the game at all. You are another one of those European Dictators, when It comes to Game Development, when you have no actual clew what you’re doing.  

When – I first played the Demo, It was a game I wanted, there was no problems In the Demo, since the full release there Is tons of problems, tons of Issues that needs to be fixed. Some Intel, regarding vehicles carrying Contraband, In fact, not all of them, some of them are genuine, some of them are not. Some people In the game, maybe carrying contraband on them, and there should be an option for them to be frisked. 

Game not worth the original price at: $19.97.
Game not worth the discounted price at: $17.57. 

The game Is actually worth, In the current state: $3.00 – Due to no realism, no vehicle physics, useless Weapons, where It takes about 2 mags to bring suspects down. Even spraying them doesn’t work either. This game Is another Fake Policing Video Game. Crazy Rocks – You have no clew on how policing actually works, the way It works In you’re mind Is Fake. You have wasted you’re time with this game. 

Final Thoughts: 

Value for Money: No – Worth $3.00. 
Any Physics: No. 
Real Policing: No – Fake Policing Game. 
Recommended: Absolutely Not. 
Developer Raiting: 0. 
2 people found this review funny = That makes you, to misinterpted this entire review - also makes you delsusional. 

The Video Game should be taken off, and Steam should stop allowing Game Developers, making really bad, fake games. Steam get Into action with the wrong Developers, who have no skills, like Crazy Rocks. and people should not buy. As I will be doing a Full Game Review, blog about this as well, just In case Crazy Rocks, acts like a Dictator again, and tries to have It removed, he/she won’t be removing my blog review, that’s for sure. Don’t waste you’re money on this again European Game Dictator Developer. 

FreeMode - Endless Mode It's Deceving Crazy Rocks, you're still contiuning to act like a Dictator.",1678656187,1695448908,False,2,2,0.322019577026367188,0,True,False,False

As excited as i was to play this game i was really let down when the interface kept switching from mouse and keyboard controls to gamepad controls. This intern kept returning the mouse to the center of the screen in the Main Menu, Pause Menu, and any other screens that happened to require a mouse like selecting matching information on passports ect. In game when I somehow managed to start it all seemed well up until I exited the van and noticed every three or four steps my character would just stop as if it wasn't recognizing my input on my keyboard which again led me to believe that the game is automatically switching from key board and mouse settings to game pad settings on the fly and at random. 

I just want to be clear I'm not here to give a bad review for fun as I hate giving them.

Contraband Police is a game developed by Crazy Rocks and published by PlayWay S.A.

The game offers some nice graphics, although some ugly glitches here and there, it is pleasant all the same

Contraband Police overall, however, is an okay game to play, and it does get boring if being played for a long time, but is a very good open world action simulation game and to play in short bursts

[h1] RECOMMENDED :) [/h1]

This game is very fun, however its a bit short. I completed the main storyline in about ~11 hours. So because of that i dont think its worth the price. For the rest, its a great game.

1. It is very difficult to see broken windows (sometimes its impossible, even during daytime) ...maybe make a blue outline for all the windows so they are easier to see? Or perhaps maybe just make them shattered/""spider-webbed"" so its easier to identify it.

2. Sometimes it can be confusing to determine exactly what the entry regulations are. For example, one of the regulations is when someone has more than 3 problems with their car they should be denied entry. Well... what if someone has *exactly* 3 problems with their vehicle? Can they be approved, or not? (I'm pretty sure I've declined them *and* listed it as an entry regulation- which passed me on the inspection, other times it fails me... I need to go back and play again to make 100% sure).

3. Trying to get a perfect score on the inspections during later stages of the game is very time consuming/ tedious... I wouldn't mind if we had another 5-10 minutes for each in game day.

4. Getting attacked during an inspection... God, I hate that part of the game so much. Its not because ""Ah! Oh my god, we're getting shot at! leave us alone!"" No...I hate it because of all the times I have a good inspection (I admit, they're not perfect), but the times where I spend what feels like an eternity trying to catch all the mistakes, and right as I'm about to approve or deny entry to someone, an attack happens, either that or I'll spend more than a few minutes inspecting a car only to realize just as I'm about to approve or deny them- it actually turns out they're a smuggler. Before I can approve/ deny/ find contraband and arrest someone... We get attacked. Next thing I know the driver gets scared and drives off. Yeah... So much for getting my moneys worth after inspecting someone. It is realistic, I admit... but its super annoying.

5. Having a time limit to return to the border. Again, yes, it's realistic... but annoying when I just chased down a smuggler. (For those who don't know, you can still search the car for contraband), I recommend looking for all of it first *before* arresting the driver so you don't have to worry about the time limit.

6. Contraband in animals... yes, really. I think the game was intended to have it be so that if there is contraband in an ""animal,"" its actually supposed to be fake/not move at all. this only happens if the animal is unloaded. If you unload an animal and its moving, its real. If you unload an animal, but its not moving, it's fake.

I do love the story! I wont spoil anything, but I love details like if you deny entry to someone because... legally speaking, you have to, it turns out people are actually being deadly serious when they beg you about letting them in because if you don't, they will lose their job/ house/ family/ friends/ etc. not only do the send you threatening letters in the mail next to the newspaper, they likely are the ones who cause you to be attacked. (This would make my complaint about attacks invalid to those who weren't paying attention) However, for those of you who weren't paying attention, what I'm saying is how I actually *like* being attacked at random, because its realistic for you to receive retaliation/ karma for ruining someones live(s), plus if you're fast enough, you can loot bodies, but it does suck to lose a car you were inspecting.

Overall, I give 4.5 out of 5 because of the imperfections/ bugs/ glitches I mentioned earlier, but its still very close to being perfect, maybe give yourselves a few months or a year to improve, and this game will be a perfect 5 stars!",1693146454,1693146454,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Not enough border guarding. There is no real pressure to churn through new arrivals. It's very simple to do a thorough inspection on all 4-5 men in single passenger vehicles. Pay is based on perfect reviews, not numbers of processed. So very easy to shine your UV light on everything and just tick all the boxes.

I do like the idea of the game, and it has really good potential. Taking a break from the border to drive prisoners to the labour camp and have a gun fight on the way is really cool. But..

The story is a very weak, I have no motivation to care about the rebellion or side with the smugglers. Even the people pleading to get through to visit their dying mother. It all lacks a bit of heart and narrative. 

NPC guards are just shells waiting around for a raid. Raids go on for too long, I found myself later in the game just crouching behind a box, waiting for my guards to shoot the generic bad guy raid, (from the same direction as every other raid) for another 3 mins and afkd to get a drink. Again, low quality shooty bang bang. 

I'd love it if guards could react to border events. So when I'm running to the police car, shooting my AK at a fleeing subject, heart thumping in my chest.

Game isn't that long (I think there's around 8 chapters and I'm on chapter 4) but don't let that deter you, there's three game modes currently, they are working on an endless mode making sure the game has more than just a story mode.

I was worried that it might not be well optimized and that it would be better to wait a bit longer before getting it. However, the game's visuals were impressive, and I noticed a lot of interaction from the developers. So, I decided to take the leap and purchase it right away.

To my surprise, the game turned out to be fantastic. I haven't encountered any issues so far—no bugs, no performance issues. While I do own a higher-end PC, some simulator games tend to be demanding, but this one runs and plays smoothly.

The gameplay itself might be considered repetitive by some. However, if you're like me and enjoy games like Gas Station Simulator, you'll find this game to be a real treat. It offers all of that and more, with the promise of additional updates in the pipeline.

I derive immense enjoyment from manning my station, pursuing criminals, and making judgment calls on whether to let certain individuals off the hook. The camaraderie with my team adds to the immersion; having them perform tasks without requiring constant management is a great touch.

This game lives up to its promises. If the concept excites you, don't hesitate to grab it now—before it becomes even better and more expensive. For those who might consider it just another addition to the Simulator genre, rest assured that this one stands out as a prime example and has a bright future ahead. If you're only going to have one simulator game in your library, this should be the one.",1692851635,1692851635,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It's a lot of fun and I like how it gradually gets more complex and bureaucratic while the game progresses. Searching vehicles is nice and straightforward without being obvious - you have to work to find some of the contraband - although one gripe I do have is the durability of some of the tools could be improved. When a $100 knife only gets through a couple of vehicles worth of seats and tyres it can get frustrating. The base-building aspect of upgrading your border post and hiring more guards is good, although it can take most of the game to get enough cash to be able to complete all of the upgrades!

Where the game really wins is the story that occurs alongside the day job paperwork simulator, with a mix of driving, FPS action, and puzzle solving. I found this super engaging and it really helped to keep the game from becoming repetitive. I managed to finish it in 15 hours, which is a little short, however the numerous decision points mean that you can go back and play the story again and try different branches each time to see if you get a different result. 

I would love to see the game continue after the end of the story, allowing you to continue working at the border with perhaps some random events to deal with (like escaping smugglers, criminal gangs etc.) and some of the other game modes that are hinted at. Some more black market trading too, perhaps the ability to sell contraband for extra cash. That may have been present (it's certainly mentioned) but I could not find anyone to whom I could sell it.

It has the right balance between ""work"" and action, like Story-Quests, shootouts or prison/contraband transport, so that you don´t just check papers and cargo the whole game without ignorng the main focus on said papers.
The graphics and mechanics are also very good for a simulator like this and the few things that could be better in my oppinion will most likely be added in later updates anyway, like more upgradeble buildings at your station or more NPC interactions outside Quests.

I personally only have two small problems with the game. For one, and this could just be skill-issue, there should be like a tow option on the police vehicles. I had a few occasions where I pushed a fugetive off the road and he ended in a spot where I couldn´t reach the door to arrest him, like up a hill, front first or spun on the side.
The second would be the AI of the civillians. They do make way, if you activate the siren, but if you are ambushed and jump out the car without activating the siren first, the civillians will drive up the street undaunted and just plow through the firefight. I died multiple times in a shootout because a civillian thought ""I don´t care that they are shooting each other down this road"" and drive right into me. I think this problem could easily be avoided by just making them stop near gun fire/hostiles or even make them turn their car and flee the scenen.
It would also be an intresting feature if your allignment with the goverment/the rebels would have more impact on the the gameplay, like gradually reducing the amount of ambushes/base attacks if you allign with the rebels or like better pay or benefits if you allign with the goverment, e.g. regular suppy shipments or cheaper prison transports",1692716455,1692716455,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

hopefully this gets fixed in patches to a point where its a little more clearer but not to a point where it makes it too easy

other that issues like this the game is fantastic

EDIT: just hit the first murder mystery puzzle and its beyond horribly done... there is no real clear way to find the answer yourself especially when they are constantly speaking russian

i had to google the answer trust me do the same this puzzle ruined the fun of the game but once i completed it, it was back to the fun part of the game....

the creator really needs to fix this puzzle so its actually doable without help... disappointing",1692631705,1692634594,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

However, what I found was so incredibly addicting through its routine gameplay. I love the basic framework, but there are many things that still need improvement. 

I think this game would improve immeasurably if the devs focused more on the base building aspect of upgrading your own border control post and less on the repetitive driving around. Why are we the one to drive every prisoner and piece of contraband when you play as the commander of the post? I sincerely hope they add some kind of mechanic to control what your guards do, like making deliveries for you or posting up at a specific spot to better stop rogue smugglers. Having more than one vehicle makes this seem like a no-brainer, but I guess only you get to use the cars. Speaking of which, what is the point of arming your guards if none of them can stop any old person in a hatchback that decides to drive straight through? The guards seriously need to do SOMETHING in camp other than repel invaders. Being a one-man army just nullifies the point of having any other guards with you.

That leads me to another gripe of mine: the random road ambushes. I actually ended up turning this setting off (thankfully that is an option), but the random ambushes add very little flavor to the gameplay. These events actively turn me off to engaging with them because they reward almost nothing and just take up your time. The random events need to be reworked significantly, but thankfully you can turn them all off for now.

 I am excited to see the addition of the endless mode, as I think it is just what this game needs to take a step in the right direction. I think this game needs an overall clearer vision for what it wants to be.

pros: 
- Speak Russia
- Learn to speak Russia, kind of
- Read subtitle
- you can get into the back trunk after inspection and car drives away
- you can shoot!, seriously what's a border patrol game when you can even use a gun
- your annoying trainer greets you every morning even after training, it definitely makes it feel immersive like he wasn't just script to say the same line every morning. It actually is different everyday
- raids, you can kill corrupt cop that's raiding your patrol outpost
- voice actor are great

cons:
- they don't let you choose to sell contraband to the black market for lots of money. Selling it to the police base officer he only gives you $70 regardless if you have a lot or not
- no women, to inspect at border patrol base
- you can't see your body

Price/Value
Contraband police is a fairly priced game especially considering today's economy for games and for what your getting you really can't complain, the game is priced around $30 in my region or something similar where ever your from. I got the game on when it came out, so i got a 12% discount, which was nice but i would still have happily paid full price. I usually like to wait for a sale before i purchase a game but whatever sale I've seen for this game has been really small, so in my opinion it's not worth waiting and i do believe $30 is a reasonable price for what your getting.
Game play
The core of any game especially CP is how does the game run. In simple terms great, i've never had any really issues regarding it's performance the worst that's happened to me is the AI drivers acting stupid but that's really it. The mechanics of checking papers are very nicely done and are slowly introduced to you as you progress through the game, ranging from simple name checks, vehicle weights, forgeries, and additional sub documents to name a few. The checking system overall works well although it can be tedious as you progress through the game 6 different documents all covering your screen but it does make sense. There's a simple ranking system you get papers right your promoted you unlock new stuff and increased rewards. If you get papers wrong your fined depending on your rank and point in the story, but it does not affect your rank. . Only real gripe with it is sometimes there's no direct cross-reference so you'll have to pick it up and manually check it but it happens rarely (assuming you don't get fatigued). The key mechanic to make sure you can't perfectly check everything from day 1 is the fatigue meter which can be improved as you upgrade your residence, this does feel a bit inconsistent in how it upgrades, as i feel the jump in the last upgrade is quite big, but only my personal thoughts. You can upgrade some elements of the outpost, being the prison, storage, residence, your collection of vehicles and the vehicles themselves, bit pricey but it's so you have something to work towards. The random missions you get are fun enough but are somewhat infrequent at least for me so don't expect call-outs to frequently. Attacks on out-posts have varying frequency, but add a nice element of surprise. Moving on to the contraband checking it works well, although some areas such as the engine can be a pain to check with elements being hidden extremely well. You'll get the odd runner which you have to chase, which is a nice change of pace but again at least for me infrequent. The shooting is really solid for  the game. The biggest compliant i would have is how expensive everything is especially the weapons, with the sniper (last weapon) costing you up to 5 days of work depending on how well you check although by the point you unlock it you should have some cash lying around. Finally for gameplay the bribes are the worse as they are completely RNG based so there's no way to increase your chances of getting away or getting caught and the punishment for it $800 dollars of your cash, which depending where you at in the game can cost around 1 day to 4 days of your pay. Overall the game play is great just some minor issues, and a lot of it is being addressed in the endless mode update.
Story
Look this part going to short, the story is about your average communist government trying to control every aspect of life and the rebels trying to fight back with you caught in the middle, there are a few story missions which are done well enough but are far between as they're spread over the 30 days, each gives you a choice whether to side for the government or rebels leading to different endings, so that's up to the player. The story missions are done well and are varied to provide a good experience, but as said before are far between. There are different chapters which change regulations for the outpost which again add nice variety and work well with ""beggars"" which are appear here and their basically begging you to let them in despite their faulty paperwork, regardless of entering or rejecting them there's a unique letter for each. No real consequences other than not seeing said letter, if you let them in you get the standard penalty for screwing up, but you may get a reward from said ""beggar"". The story is not the vocal point of the game it's there just to add another layer, it's not particularly complex, but it is fun and enjoyable. 
Overall thoughts
If you enjoy sim's you'll love this one with a nice unique twist rarely seen, and if you loved papers please you'll also love this more complex and open version of it, if you hate either of these than you'll hate this game as it can get repetitive like any simulator . The game is updated frequently (as of writing) and we are looking forward to our next big update the endless mode, which rids of the limit days in the story and goes on well forever with more features. If you're still hesitant to pay $30 for just story then wait until endless comes out. Overall if i had to give the game a rating it'd be a solid 8/10. I hope this review helped and i thank you for reading it my friends.

As a developer, juggling many tasks, Confluence and JIRA, checklists, etc, this game has helped me memorize things easier. It starts slowly by adding one condition to people crossing the border. 15 hours later, you're checking for name on multiple documents, passport numbers and forgery, vehicle registration and type, cargo with limitations on items, vaccinations, and a vast number of many other conditions.

And all you want is a 100% rating on the next person crossing the border.

Will play again. Different route next, then all achievements :)

Things to want:
Endless mode (I know it's being developed)
Gender diversity?
Multiple travelers in same car?
The ability to deny someone because they tried to bribe you (and decline the bribe in general)
More ways to upgrade the border, cars, and otherwise help your employees",1692273533,1692273533,True,1,0,0.504132270812988281,0,True,False,False

The audio needs improvements, as do most games in this category. The lighting can also be buggy at times, especially on the largest police unit. The campaign is great, it changes and gives unique scenarios constantly. I think there should be more communication between the AI and player though, the only words exchanged often are just asking for documents. I think there also needs to be more cars trying to cross, and different difficulties to push on time. I love idea of upgrading your outpost, but I wish there was more to expand on, like being able to upgrade your house much more, and upgrade the walls for when you get attacked. I also think that there should be addable things like sniper towers or inspection stations, where you can have multiple vehicles being checked simultaneously. Being able to cross check things with perception is great, but needs to be improved upon.

I would say it's worth the $20 at the time of writing. A few little niggles here and there. 

1. I noticed about halfway through, then couldn't not notice: there are literally no women in the game at all. I don't particularly care, I'm not the SJW type but its very weird and once I noticed it I couldn't stop noticing. My guess is they didn't have a female character model but it's not that hard to make. 
2. Late game, the economy is pretty much a moot point. I found myself arresting people for fun or because they annoyed me and not caring about the financial penalty because I had so much money. 
3. The story tells you what happens to every character...except you! Screw everyone else, what happened to me? The guy who single handedly stopped the revolution? 
4. The other border guards are totally useless. They claim to help in attacks but I swear on my life those bastards either have stormtrooper aim or were shooting blanks. They didn't hit shit. 
5. Grenades don't kill enemies if they blow up the car, yet will kill civilians in their car. Kinda annoying.

I have not yet finished the story, so will focus on the gameplay and premise instead.

You are a nameless replacement Border Patrol Officer for the glorious communist republic of Acaristan, sent to command the checkpoint at Karikatka in the Spring of 1981. You must inspect Newcomers' documents, vehicles and cargo, and remain vigilant against smugglers and enforce the laws of the land. The laws vary as the game progresses, with lax restrictions during the tutorial phase, up to cargo embargoes and an outbreak of disease, a rip on Covid19 which made me laugh, and there are ever increasing documents to inspect and restrictions on who can come in, their vehicle and its condition etc.

The comparison to Papers Please is obvious, and while I've never played it, I know of it, and the border manning phase is very similar with the moral choices to be made at your personal expense or enforce the law to the letter at the expense of the populace. You can also choose to side with the rebels, but I have not done that as of yet so cannot comment.

The gameplay is fun, interesting enough to engage and varied. Whilst manning the border, you will arrest smugglers (or accept their bribes), collect contraband and will need to transport the prisoners and contraband to locations in the map.

The phone in the office will occasionally give you a mission outside of the post, and without spoilers these are also fun and varied for the most part.

The Border Checkpoint will come under attack either from the rebels or the local criminal syndicate, and you and your men must defend the checkpoint for a period of time then finish off the enemy. There are the usual array of pistol, shotgun, smg, rifle and sniper rifle to choose from. The gunplay is not spectacular, but it is funcitonal. Hitboxes are a tad janky but for the most part they work. If you are a fan of FPS games then the shooting here will not impress, but you'll find it functional enough to not be frustrating to engage in. The same is said for the driving, searching etc. The mechanics are there, they are functional but not flashy. I have not been frustrated, merely mildly annoyed on occasion.

There are also goodies spread across the map to find, and once you have processed all incoming visitors, you are free to explore the map, find the hidden collectibles, shop for weapons, tools and ammunition, and take your prisoners to the camp and deliver contraband to the base. Some days take up more time than others, so sometimes you will not have time to do everything. You can upgrade your men, base, living quarters and vehicles with money. The more you catch and the more right calls you make, the more you will earn.

Unfortunately the ingame audio language is not English, or if it can be I couldn't figure out how to change it, and the English subtitles are not perfect translations but I've not had any trouble reading the subtitles or understanding instructions, which is good considering the devs are Polish and likely not native or overly fluent English speakers.

For the price I'd say it's good value, reasonably priced at £16.75 when I bought it yesterday, and great value if it goes on sale.

In summary, the game is functional but not flashy, varied and fun, and only mildly irritating at times, and well worth picking up for the price, even more so on sale.",1691029769,1691029929,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

As far as time pressure goes, it's there, but not as bad as Papers, Please, which was scraping by for the sake of your family in a brutal regime. Things are (at least from what I've experienced so far) lighter in tone, as you are looking after your comrades.

There are areas of improvement (aren't there always?), like the story being boilerplate ""The ills of an Authoritarian Communist state"" (the binary faction choices could be expanded into something more nuanced) and how difficult it can be to assess vehicle conditions (a broken window or missing bumper can sometimes be hard to pick up). Gunplay is serviceable but not the main draw. Overall, if this is your first entry into this style of Post-Dad game, you'll enjoy it, as it injects bureaucracy with some adrenaline, even if the combat is simple.

Think the gameplay loop of a Stardew Valley or Harvest Moon: you have a day job to manage, and then limited time based to do other tasks, based on how efficient you were during the day job.

I hear there is an Endless mode coming, so that should be interesting. The fact the game launched (or currently has after a patch) missing two of three gameplay modes does raise an eyebrow.

It is an infinitely better version of Papers, Please except this has actual engaging gameplay. 
The story is interesting and fun to watch develop, the inspection of cars is fun and didn't get boring or repetitive (to me at least.)
The only thing I wish that was a little different was less of a focus on the shooting parts of the game and a little more depth on the vehicle inspections. Possibly adding ways to have your border guards be able to pre-inspect some of the vehicles to verify issues with cosmetics or notice anything weird going on with the driver. Or possibly adding a second inspection lane, maybe even automate some of the process via your employees.
The game is fine as is, I just felt those would be nice additions.
By the end of the campaign I think I'd killed liked 400 people or something which I felt detracted a bit from the realism of the game but like I said it wasn't a big issue.

I have recorded over 37 hours in this game so far, but with the arrival of endless mode I will start playing it again fully.  The contraband police is probably not for everyone.  Not everyone will enjoy this, but if someone gets the hang of it, they will have a lot of fun.  I was personally interested in the work of a border guard, so for me this was a simulator that I couldn't help but buy.  The game only has a main career so far.  A career as such is somehow not long enough.  even if you really enjoy the game and do everything in as much detail as possible, you will finish the campaign within a few days. But as I wrote above, the authors are working on endless mode and that should solve this problem.  A little about the campaign.  You play as the main border guard who checks passing cars and trucks.  At the beginning of the control, they are quite simple and the player is introduced to what his job will be.  These first days I really recommend reading everything and trying to understand everything otherwise you will have a problem in the later parts.  As your days at the border go by, you will constantly complain about your work.  You'll have to check more and more and watch out for more things with each check.  You will have to be more careful about contraband.  Sometimes faced with a difficult decision.  You will have to fend off border attacks from time to time.  Sometimes in the middle of the working day they may call you with a voluntary mission that I recommend doing.  They are interesting and above all they will give you quite a lot of money that will come in handy.  Speaking of money, you won't have much money in this game.  It can be said that you will have more money towards the end of the game.  Until then, you will still have something to put them into (better cells, better equipment for workers, better cars...).  The whole game is in the Eastern style.  There is nothing better than riding a Zhiguli and listening to fast Eastern style music while you go to stop at a small house by the road where Comrade will sell you a Kalashnikov.  Overall, players from slav countries will definitely enjoy it more.  The campaign has its own story.  The story is written quite well, I would say, but I won't describe it more because I don't want to give any big spoilers.  I tried to write this entire review as spoiler-free as possible.  I definitely recommend giving this game a try!  A very good addition to the simulators.  I apologize for any mistakes.

Unpopular opinion but I preferred playing with a controller, with occasional use of the keyboard for inventory management. I felt like I had much better control than with the keyboard. Preference of course. I highly recommend this game, no hesitation. 

I only have one point of feedback for the Devs - when a newcomer arrives to the checkpoint and tells their story about why they want to cross the border, it would be great if their goodbyes were voiced accordingly and congruent to their story. For instance, when a guy comes to the checkpoint crying hysterically about needing to see his wife who is admitted to the hospital, and you approve his entry, and he responds with what is effectively ""Cheerio!"", it breaks the immersion lol.

After seeing it on tiktok I thought it was just a more hands on version of ""papers, please"" however this game has a lot more to it. Just when you start to think the game is getting monotonous you have more smugglers, another part of the car/paperwork you have to check for, more entry regulations; or maybe you're needed to investigate a murder, takedown a syndicate crime boss, or just digging up graves for hidden contraband. 

However, its not flawless with some minor bugs. When the border is being attacked sometimes it'll say one enemy remaining when there's none and your soldiers will just keep shooting at rocks, the police patrol car outta be impossible to drive, and other minor bugs. Nothing game-breaking as of yet thankfully.

Eitherway, this game has a lot of moving parts with gang shootouts, a storymode that lets YOU choose your side, an upgrade system, in-game bartering, and much more. Defininetly worth the purchase, and can't wait to see the new updates and the devs seem very involved in the community.

TLDR: Amazing game worth the price, minor bugs, the devs seem active and can't wait for future updates.",1689525704,1689525704,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Obviously, the main focus of the game is the border control aspect. Vehicles will come in, and you have to inspect them Some of these people will either have a wrong paperwork or is a smuggler where you either arrest them or deny them access the game can be very tricky in the later aspects of the game with more rules and regulations but it’s way more interactive and has unique opportunities such as one of the days will have a man that claims to be part of the press that wants entry into the state to investigate missing children in a cave, however, does not have the right paperwork. If you deny him, he will send you a letter saying that the children are as good as dead now and that they are gone. However, if you allow him access, he will send you a thank you letter for helping him occasionally as well sometimes, instead of having the vehicle stop and be inspected, they will simply ram the gate in a police chase ensue where you have to get into your own vehicle and stop them either by pulling them over and aiming a gun in their face or just shooting them in the face the game offers a wide selection of items such as multiple different weapons and equipment that will help with investigations and so much more to be added. There was a whole story involving corruption or freedom where you need to pick a side, not knowing truly who is the better option the only thing in my opinion that holds this game back at the moment of writing this review is, there is no endless mode as soon as you finish the story you’re back to the beginning however, they are adding an endless mode very soon, this was an incredibly surprisingly fun and interesting game solid 8 out of 10 for me",1689434145,1689434145,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

- U cant sell contraband on the black market
- There is no real value in 'tycon part' of a game. Its veeeery limited and there is no real use in all upgrades
- There is no value in stealing others cars (u cant save em, u cant sell em, u cant repair em)
- There is no value in transporting criminals. Easier just kill em on the border

So u need to buy a strong gun(u can after 1.5h) and check papers and that's all the game. 

All other mechanics have no value and become boring after 1h. For example: The game has a mechanic to arrest contrabandists and then put em in jail. But in reality putting criminals to prison have like 0 value because u get just a few bucks for this and u need to spend a lot of boring time transporting em on a very sloooow car thru a very boring map and the exactly same route again and again. And u actually ending up just killing em on the border not wasting time with em. There is no way u can take money from them for the rescue or there is no way u can sell em contraband. The mechanic is just artificial waste of your time. 
Or another example - finding contraband. At first, I thought there will be like moral choice - I can bring contraband to the police or sell it to the black market or take money from criminals to cover em... guess what - there is no choice. U have to waste time on finding contraband and transporting it, like with criminals, to the police station again and again and again and get paid like 100$ for this(u will earn more just 'checking the papers'). I ended up not wasting my time on searching for contraband - because there is no value in this. Yeah, the most efficient way is just 'check papers' and not waste time on contraband. Just find the symbol on the criminal car, shot the criminal, and ask the worker to clean the area. Thats it. Literally, nothing to do with all that mechanics.

The game becomes super boring after 3h. I played longer in the hope to see the black market or a way to mess up with other gangs or other possibilities but there is no interesting mechanics.

First off, if you know and like ""Papers, Please"" , you'll like this. You play as a border guard, also checking documents, but also you check vehicles. Rules and laws keep changing so you have to keep being focused as the gameplay changes. I love this, and as a person who has always (strangely) been really interested in playing a game where you are a border / checkpoint guard, I really enjoyed every aspect of this.

There are some things that I liked less and stuff I think should be / have been improved on, like for example:
- you get like 5 cars daily to check, and they all come simultaneously at the start, it's not like you get a car in the morning, wait a bit and two more show up. You know, a little randomness of when the cars arrive, I think this would be more dynamic and realistic.
- random events should be added. There are tons of scenarios that I can think of straight away that can really peak gameplay in a game like this; attacks from newcomers (shoot out from the vehicle as you ask for their documents), terrorist attacks (VBIED), more ethical decisions (family of your character come as newcomers) etc
- Checkpoint management, as for now, we can only upgrade our house, prison and warehouse. But what about all of the trash scattered around the checkpoint? That weird cabin you cannot enter? Gun emplacements? Watch towers? Search lights? Etc Etc.
- Assign tasks to other guards. I was kind of hoping you would do checks on vehicles together. Instead, you have 7 guards wandering around, doing nothing. It would be cool if you could assign a guy to check the vehicle cargo for example, as you go over personal documents.

Other stuff I truly hated:
- Roadside ambushes. This happened WAY too often, not just way too often, I happened literally everytime I went out. Not just once, most of the time I got ambushed two to three times, which is genuinely annoying. They always kill the prisoners in the back instead of me, they ruin the vehicle, and just give me the idea that I am in no mood to go outside the checkpoint anymore. But, I can hear you say; ""you can turn it off"", well, I have a point about that too:
- Optional random events. I find this really weird, to be able to turn off stuff like roadside ambushes. I feel like this is part of the game, and part of the experience. It feels like a really weird choice to have it on either off or on. I feel like the game should rather focus on tweaking it, and making it less toxic than having the option to turn it off completely.
- Lastly, the ending. What an ending... I was enjoying the game, doing checks at the border. I had fun plans to upgrade everything to the max soon, but then I got the final mission, did it, and the game gave me the credits and deleted my save file. What..? I know there is an endless mode coming (I think, I hope), but why deny me from at least spawning back, allowing me to spend all the money I had tried hard to save, and buying everything? Also basically denying me to unlock other achievements? I literally have to start the campaign all over again to do this. That is a genuine weird thing. And something I want to turn this review into a not recommended game.

But, while I enjoyed the rest, I wont let the ending ruin the rest of what I enjoyed.",1688737966,1688737966,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

The comparison to PP is a must because the game is heavily inspired by it, but it doesnt fully grasp what made PP an incredible hit.

First the good, upgrades although minimal are good, the inspections and other mechanics on the actual checkpoint are fun and the game flows mostly well. The base gameplay of checking documents and denying or approving travelers is nowhere near as crisp and satisfying as in PP but it works well enough to keep you chugging along and wanting more from that.

The best part for me is finding the contraband in the car, which should be the main focus of the game, I like finding the packets of contraband and the interaction with the suspect. I dont like the mechanic of the UV only serpent mark that you need to find with the UV lamp to find most contrabands, I think its a lazy addition and you could rely on visually seeing the packages or focus more on the tips you get that state that a certain car with a color or plate will come by with contraband.

Now the mostly bad which made me not recommend the game, this game wants to cover so much, right now Ive played only 4 hours and in that span, the game has tried to be:

Document Checking Simultator
Contraband Inspection Simulator
FPS
Base Builder/Upgrader and Personnel Manager
Driving/Chase Simulator
Stealth Mission
Murder Mystery Mission

And that is just in these 4 hours, and its not a problem that it tries to do so much per se, but that it does not excel at any of those 7, the first two I mentioned are decent enough, the FPS aspect is incredibly basic and janky, the base upgrades are minimal, the driving is SO BORING, if I have to chase a runaway far I'll be so bored on the way back to the base.

For the last two I have to talk about the ""story campaign"" This to me is by far the worst aspect of the game. You get introduced to it on a scripted mission and then you get calls at the office that you must answer in 5 mins and then run off to complete said mission quickly, so if you were entertained on the inspections you better forget about it, because you'll have to hop on the boring car and drive to the other side of the map to do either a horribly executed Stealth mission or a boring and minimal murder mystery mission (those are the only two I've done so far).

The game also takes inspiration from PP in that it gives you the option to work with the goverment or the rebels but it does it in the most uninspired way possible. They give you a huge prompt on the screen on certain choices that says GOVERNMENT or REBELS and its so meh, instead of like in PP where you can sometimes help one side or the other and have to make big choices that will have consequences in the several endings, here I really, really dont care about the characters they present and have absolutely no issue just going full government.

This game would be amazing if it spent more time polishing its base mechanics of document review and contraband search and leave most of the other genres alone. We dont need a stealth mission or a MM mission on this kind of game. Most of the time when im doing those or fighting waves of random NPCs with bad gunplay Im thinking man I wish I was inspecting cars or documents right now...

Hours of detail-oriented perfectionist work, combined with car chases, gunplay, detective work, and thwarting narcotics smuggling, not to mention a literal civil war/revolution in which you can make choices to tip the scales of fate. There wasn't a moment playing this game that I wasn't having a blast.

Some notes to the developer, excluding minor bugs;
-Enemies are bullet sponges, it doesn't really make sense. I understand that a human can actually take a bullet and keep going, but if I hit a man with 5 shots from a submachine gun, regardless of whether I hit a headshot he should at the very least be on the floor. Maybe a gutshot sends a person to the ground, where they have a random chance to either stay on the ground and be able to be arrested, or to pick up their gun and continue firing until dead
-Loved using the siren to force travelers to pull over out of my way, but in the third person vehicle camera it blinds me literally 1/2 of the time, ESPECIALLY at night.
-I think there should be a hidden shack where you could sell your contraband to a Red Fist member, or maybe just some random smuggler. They'd pay you more than the police station, but selling confiscated contraband too often would draw the eyes of the government. This makes a lot of sense in the game world, especially if the player is choosing to side with the Red Fist.
-Maybe a refused traveler doesn't like your decision, and decides to attack you over it. I find this idea very interesting, but I guess I'd understand if it was never included, as either your fellow officers would be uselessly standing around or shoot him dead before he could hit you at all. Even so, I think it'd be an interesting and humanizing occurrence. Especially if something happens like ""The father of children alone in Acaristan wants to enter the country to find his kids, but because of entry regulations you are forced to refuse him. He steps out of his car to attack you in his rage, but is immediately gunned down"" THAT would be potent.
-I understand that the police force of a (possibly) soviet nation would probably never even consider hiring female officers, but I think it would make the game's world feel a lot more real if the occasional female traveler was present.

All in all, the only reason I typed these suggestions at all was because I had so much fun playing this game that it dragged me deep enough to think about it this much. A big thanks to the Dev(s), and I hope to see more from you soon. <3",1688704004,1688704004,True,2,0,0.522058844566345215,0,True,False,False

I was pleasantly surprised when I started playing to find that this game isn't just sitting at a border crossing and inspecting vehicles.  While that is a fair bit of this game, the developers found ways to keep this interesting, with changing regulations to keep you on your toes.

There is a fair bit of driving around the map, and it was fairly cool at first exploring different areas, taking prisoners to the labor camp, dropping off contraband etc.  Most places aren't interesting enough to visit a couple of times outside of the necessity of going to various facilities.  There are some random events that require you to 'take out' groups of enemies which helps keeps you on your toes.

One major plus for me is character progression and visual representation of your progress in the campaign.  Your character gains rank which gives you more $ on inspections and other things, and you can unlock more powerful guns as you work your way up the ladder.  You can use the money to upgrade your officers gear, or various facilities around your checkpoint.  Each upgrade has a visual change that is immediate upon purchase.  Just one thing that helps me see that I am actually progressing.

Honestly, I would get this game if you were looking for something fairly laid back, and if the game is on sale.  While the game pleasantly surprised me with its content, I was not blown away and willing to pay more than I did for it.",1688625325,1688625325,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Also a minor gripe, but where Papers Please had numerous factions you could choose to side with and you were incentivised to move quickly, this game has pretty much two sides: government or rebel, and it doesn't really focus on speed.

The graphics are pretty on par for an indie title.  Nothing to write home about, but they're clean.
The driving mechanics aren't all that fancy, but you're driving in a 1980's post Soviet country so it feels right.
Gunplay is surprisingly solid, which is good considering you get into a LOT of shootouts.

As for the main mechanics of the game; checking for contraband?  It's pretty easy (so far) and straightforward to get into. You look for the smuggler icon and start wailing away on it.  Before long you'll be a grizzled border patrol agent doing your part to keep your country safe.   Or y'know, you could take bribes, sell contraband on the side and have your own little блат operation running.  Either way you'll have the money to upgrade your outpost and buy better gear, weapons, and vehicles.  I won't get into the story so much, but it looks like you'll also have some choices to make there too.

Firstly, I must say that I really enjoyed it, so I'll give it a positive review. I played through the whole game without getting bored or anything like that.

Although it's quite repetitive, and you mostly do the same tasks, it managed to hold my interest. The fact that the torch doesn't reveal everything, and you need to keep an eye out for hidden stuff, is a plus that prevents the game from feeling too mechanical.

There's a significant variety among all the newcomers. As far as I can recall, I didn't see the same face twice. However, I have to mention that there are no women in the entire game. Everybody is male, which made it a bit monotonous for me (I'm not getting into issues of sexism or inclusivity; I'm simply saying that seeing only guys all the time got a bit boring).

Overall, I quite enjoyed playing it.

On the downside, I would like to point out that I didn't find anything in the story that made me go against the government. In games like Papers, Please or The Beholder, the dark side of the government is more obvious. However, in this game, I couldn't see a reason to be against it.

Similarly, there are a few moments where you can choose to help people and let them pass. I did it, and apart from a thank-you letter, there wasn't much difference if I hadn't let them go. I suppose it's just the personal satisfaction of helping people.

To be honest, I had the feeling that there's no real story. Things happen, but that's it. They ask you to go here and there, fix a situation, but I didn't feel like there's a proper underlying story.

Sometimes, when I caught someone with contraband, they offered me a bribe. I accepted it once, but the money wasn't even the same as the penalty I received for letting them pass, so I didn't do it anymore. I earned more money by following the rules (the bonus for catching a criminal, sending them to prison, confiscating the contraband and promotion is greater than what they offer you).

Another thing is that the guards in the zone are a bit useless. I mean, they help when you get attacked in the control point, but they do nothing when a newcomer tries to escape. Also, you can't take one or two guards with you as cover when you go out and get ambushed, which happens constantly. I think they could be more useful.

I do have a couple of minor complaints however:
- the windows on the vehicles are too clear, making it difficult to discern a broken window from a regular window, and to this I would suggest adding a tint to all the vehicle windows
- shooting out a vehicle's tire should at least make it slow down or veer to the side

There have been a few games that have tried to replicate what Papers, Please did but I think they missed the point.  The point shouldn't be to *replicate* what Lucas Pope did, instead be inspired by it.  And here we have ""Contraband Police,"" one of the worst titles I've seen in a long time.  But don't let that particular aspect fool you, this is a very competent and thoroughly well-designed game.  It's not quite an immersive sim, and it has a story to tell.  Gameplay consists of checking paperwork, yes, but also a lot of investigation.  What condition is the car in?  Does it's tonnage match?  Is it registered to the right person?  The game makes full use of it's 3d nature having you comb inside and out, checking cargo, opening suitcases.  There's just as much to visually inspect as there is paperwork to compare.  And then you realize all of it is interactive because smugglers can and will hide contraband literally anywhere and everywhere.  That's the baseline, ph neutral.  And if the game had *just* been that I'd still be giving it a big fat thumbs up for just how well it executes on this premise.

Yet, in swoops a larger game.  Getting into gunfights, investigating crime scenes, delivering prisoners and contraband, purchasing tools and supplies, upgrading your people and station.  And all of this, while not *quite* as detailed or involved as the core loop, are still delightful.  You might get ambushed while delivering a prisoner.  Someone might try to buy illegal contraband.  You can even do some light trading with the drivers before you deny their entry.  This is where the game shows it's thoughtfulness: none of this stuff is just there to fill out time.  It all works together to build this world of chores you inhabit .  Will you side with the government for the paycheck?  Or the rebels?  It's not a terribly deep game, but it puts details into all the places that really matter and it shines for it.

There's an endless mode on the horizon and we'll see how that plays.  Personally I think the story mode is very well done, it can be planned and give the player a specific experience, but I can see how a more procedural endless mode to play with the mechanics is desired.  I bring this up simply because I think the game is worth it *now*, and frankly I'd be just as happy seeing a sequel announced.

Story 10/10 (only played the government side, haven't played the rebellion side yet.)

Replayability Sorta (this review is before they add the other 2 game modes besides the campaign. At the moment you are only able to play it twice before you run out of new content.)
Bugs- Really haven't seen any bugs during my 14 hours playthrough. If there are bugs in the game they are small and not game breaking (Hopefully)
Overall- The game is fantastic and has a amazing setting as a border patrol officer. If your looking for a Paper's Please game that is open world, then this is your game. Can't wait to see the new content they add to this game.

A positive review is merited simply for creating such a unique game, generally well-polished and bug free. There are, however, several issues that make this game merely ""good"" rather than truly ""great.""

The worst part of this game is the FPS portions: your base is periodically attacked by hordes of enemies. The very first attack already has you killing so many super-weak enemies that it feels like you're playing Space Invaders, and it only get worse from there. By the final battle, you're facing nearly 100 enemies in a single wave. yet it's so easy to kill them that it's a yawn-inducing chore.

Another major gripe I have with the game is that though a single mis-matched name or passport number can be reason to deny entry, the game gives you bonus points for finding multiple violations per car. This makes no sense. Nor does it make any sense that after each inspection, your supervisor announces whether or not you made the right call: if he's so utterly omniscient, why are you even there?

Furthermore, the overwhelming majority of people you check will have some error in their documents which requires you to deny them entry. This also makes no sense. My guess is that the game wants you to find all the various reasons to deny entry per vehicle checked, but I would have preferred a more realistic experience: one in which the vast majority of documents have no violations what-so-ever, and your job is to find the occasional criminal hiding among the crowd. As it currently stands, 9 out of 10 vehicles have to be turned away, and law-abiding citizens are the exceptions.

All that said, it's still a fairly enjoyable game simply because of its uniqueness. The story, though nothing super special, is generally enjoyable, and strangely enough, the driving mechanics are really good for a game that isn't really about driving: the FOV is spot-on for realism and comfort, and the handling (assuming you are using a controller) feels better than many a driving-only game I've played.

All in all, worth the price.

With games like this it can get a bit worrying that things will drag on, but I felt it stayed pretty fresh throughout. Every day you have about 4-5 people you check. After that, though, then you get 'free time' to go around the island and search for secrets to get you some extra money. Along with that Every once in a while you have bonus objective to complete, which could range from transporting smuggling prisoners you captured to defending your outpost during an insurgent raid.

1. I beat the game as a Revolutionary which gave me the Blood Fist ending.
2. I was a three stripe rank but I am not sure how much more I could have been promoted.

Pros
- Characterization was well done
- Game is a lot of fun if you don't like Ukrainians
- The whole Soviet Block feeling is totally there.
- Police corruption 
- Killing border jumpers (extra fun)
- Missions are fun
- Night raids on your base rock
- Decor of Mother Russia is top notch
- weapons are realistic
- The ability to beat civilians with crowbars, shovels, pipes (but not too many times because they are fargile)
- destroying vehicles and property if you are into that (most american are)
- Build up enough cash and just murder legit people for a full day of work as they pull up with passport ( $500 buck a head fine eh)

Cons
- Driving needs work
- Can only take one bribe (Not soviet enough)
- Lots of timers on things but healthy timers (I am not a timer person)
- tools break too damn easy (I like to beat my victims senselessly after killing them)
- heads don't break open if you beat them rigorously (need to show brain splatter)
- No Russian Brothel (Whats a soviet block without a brothel)
- Not much snow, hmm
- Can't drink the vodka and get drunk on duty (That's a soviet innate trait)
- Driving again
-  The trailer video shows people getting knocked out at border. Can't knock them out only kill them if they run. Only murder them if they run.
- Your Save Game file deletes itself after the credits. Little upsetting.

Some points for why the game is worth it:

The story is interesting and fun like a 3D game of Papers Please and some choices you make can lead to death.
The game mechanics are controllable but a little wonky making for some fun car driving.
The economy of the game can be really felt from start to mid but in late game money is not a problem.
The combat is not hard but you can die from getting cocky or not finding cover. (I killed around 400 Terrorists in whole play through and died about 10 times)
The border checkpoint gets more complicated overtime and is consistent with new paper requirements like Papers Please. 
The contraband scenarios are like a car mechanic mode where you use many tools to hit and bang everything.


I rate the game a 9/10, the developers of the game are active in the community and they are improving the game at a steady pace. The game is worth the money if you like games like Papers Please with police brutality and fire fights. Good game",1686169151,1686170374,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

It captures that eastern-block early 80's cold war feel and you have plenty to do.  I wish it was even longer but what is here is fun and worth the price of admission.

Trying to get perfect inspections is not as easy as you might think, especially after a few weeks when you have a laundry list of things to check into.  Take extra care when inspecting vehicles for damage!

Tips - 

- You need to pay attention to mission dialogue, because sometimes you have no idea what's going on. 

- Once you get the AK don't spend $ on anything else. It has almost no recoil and almost always 2 shots if you're a good shot. 

Leveling up stuff  is ""kinda"" worth it -

- Leveling up the prison is recommended. Lets you hold 8 prisoners which is the max capacity for the largest truck. 

- Leveling up the storage room isn't really worth it. The largest truck only holds 25 units, and I think that's the capacity for the first tier... Not afraid of being corrected. If you have it upgraded all the way, there's no point in hoarding stuff then selling all at once, because you can't..... Even if you pay $500 to have the police transport show up you're still making two trips on your own. 

- Leveling up the shed you sleep in IS recommended though. Increases health allowing you to stay alive in fights/ driving around and increases perception allowing you to blow through border stops faster. 

- Leveling up you guards and hiring more IS recommended. Helps you get through ambushes easier and they don't die as fast. 

- I did not upgrade the vehicles, because I didn't see a point in increasing their speed when they all handle like trash. 

All in all, good way to blow time and I had fun. Just don't expect good AAA stuff when the game is $20.

No seriously think about it, your a Boarder Guard, in a Communist country, upkeep to worry about, and [spoiler]you have the option to go against the government.[spoiler/]
So Whats the game like? Well, its Papers Please, but MORE. The game is a more ""realistic"" approach to being a Border Guard, in fact your the Border Guard Commander. In addition to checked peoples Documents for Discrepancies, Finding Contraband (ill get to that in a minute), taking bribes (if you so choose), you got a whole check point to worry about and world to explore. Instead of feeding your family and paying rent, your paying out of pocket for the Maintenance of your Checkpoint and paying all your Comrades at the checkpoint. So how do you pay the bills you ask? Well by doing your Job, taking Bribes, Trading with people coming though your checkpoint (its Legal), Transporting Prisoners to the Labor Camp and Dropping off contraband at the Police Base, winning Ambushes, Defending the Checkpoint, and Doing missions.

Now, it should be said its not as simple as ""Allow or Deny"" like Papers please, if you want to get paid IN FULL from each Inspection you have to be THROUGH! i'm not kidding, a Perfect inspection pays you way more then a simple ""allow or deny"". CONTRABAND, Oh boy this is time consuming, Smugglers will hide Contraband in their Cargo and even in their Vehicles, and YOU have full authority to disassemble, destroy and search all of it in order to find whatever they may be hiding. (and as above it PAYS to be through, so feel free to take the whole dame car apart if you feel its necessary) And you have several tools at your Disposal to do it (knife, axe, blunt, shovel, pitchfork), They will eventually brake (losing durability with each HIT) and you will have to buy new ones.

Once your DONE with all the Newcomers and you got some time to spare, you can transport anyone you have arrested to labor camp and bring any Contraband you find to the police base for extra cash. If you have the spare cash and can pay the daily UPKEEP, maybe invest some of that extra cash in upgrading the Checkpoint (such as upgrading personal or getting more personal, or upgrading your quarters or the storeroom or the Jail, maybe buy a new vehicle) or getting yourself more Weapons and Tools.

Did I say Weapons? Yup, we got COMBAT and MISSIONS! No worries its pretty simple, shoot bad guys (headshots do help), take cover, try not to DIE. You will get ambushed while driving around the open world (sometimes right as you leave the checkpoint area, and no your comrades will not come to help you, funny enough the people driving around will gladly run over the bad guys), or the Checkpoint itself will be assaulted (all you have to do is survive for a time, then kill any remaining enemies. Your Comrades WILL help defend the checkpoint at least). Also sometimes you will get ""intervention missions"", these are optional missions that pay well for your trouble. You do have several guns to pick from as well, and will unlock more as you Rise In Rank.

Look out for something you can do such as get in a firefight, drive around, find contraband in a vehicle and arrest its operator, take the arrested smuggler to the labor camp, turn in the contraband to a police warehouse, be a corrupt officer or be loyal and by the book. You can choose to be loyal to the government or be loyal to the underground bugaloo that aims to tear down and replace the communist regime.

Other notable things: If graphics are your main focus of what you must enjoy and appreciate from a game, this one might not be for you. That said, the gameplay experience itself makes up for this. I just so happen to value good overall content, mechanics, and even a well-thought-out story can be appreciated above graphics quality in a game. If that sounds like you as well, then you might also enjoy this title yourself.

As of the time of this comment, I just read the announcement about their start on building the Endless Mode or Free Mode and I very much look forward to that becoming available in the future!

Controller support is currently not available at this time, so I hope that isn't a deal-breaker for any of you. [EDIT: Controller support was just announced and updated for the game, so you can ignore that last bit.]

In case the devs and project directors ever read this: Ever thought of making a co-operative experience in a game like this one? Expands the possibilities. I hope this one gains enough traction and popularity to financially support that endeavor.

Sure, as of this comment, I have only 5 hours of gameplay so far. I can't rate the quality of the story/lore of Contraband Police as of yet. I can say that nothing has yet made me hate it though. I have been simply enjoying the gameplay experience overall and wanted to bring some attention to a game that has tapped into the lost arts of what provides good quality to games.",1682778004,1685761668,True,21,0,0.729612052440643311,0,True,False,False

Your daily tasks include vehicle searches and ID checks and finding contraband that may be smuggled. In the campaign, the occasional mission or incident pops up where you have to find someone or something and gunfire usually ensues. This leads to the game's low point with lackluster combat and poor movement mechanics, but the surrounding game is still a blast.

It sounds boring, and it should be, as you get a sense of the doldrums and repetition of life as a border guard. Developer Crazy Rocks did an excellent job of capturing the spirit of the less-than-dynamic true life of law enforcement that surrounds routine, paperwork, and mundane tasks. What they also nailed was vehicle searches. I found the cramped vehicle interiors where your camera is limited in movement and you have to shift about in the car to look under or between something to be spot on. There are many nooks and crannies for smugglers to hide their booty and it's aggravatingly easy to miss something. Likewise, just going over the paperwork with your subject, you can easily miss a name misspelling or a registration number being off by one character. As the game progresses you feel yourself getting sharper and catching minute details more readily. There is a perception check function you can use when you're getting tired or having trouble deciphering a long name. It has limited uses but it's great in a pinch.

Then the alarm sounds and the rebels attacking your great state come flowing from the hills and you have to defend your tiny outpost. You can upgrade your checkpoint with better guards and equip them, which helps later in the game as the rebels attack in greater numbers. The combat is disappointingly basic, however, and I mean it's a half-step above Space Invaders from 1978. Bad guys will try to run to cover, even flank you, but when they take a shot they stand perfectly still for several seconds. Their aim is atrocious and I've walked through crossfire at point blank range unscathed several times. I'm past the halfway point and haven't upgraded from my pistol because I'm nailing headshots with it from across the map due to the sights being static and the target holding perfectly still.

The investigations missions are also a bit disappointing. There's a murder at a tavern and you're supposed to question everyone and determine the killer. The alibis don't add or subtract from anyone's guilt and the ""crime scene"" is pointless. In the end you randomly pick among six people or go to YouTube to find the answer as simple logic is lacking entirely. Add to this muddy graphics and stiff character movements and it's easy to lay some hate on this game, but you shouldn't.

It's not perfect but the actual checkpoint itself is a rewarding 3D puzzle of seek and find that has a hard time getting old. Every vehicle is different, every driver responding in different ways, and the occasional pursuit breaking out turns the game into COPS: Russia very quickly. I'm enjoying the game and I will continue to repress the rebels and ensure the safety and prosperity for my beloved nation.

I personally didn't mind the side missions, because it broke up the monotony of checking passports/restrictions/vehicle damage. It can get a bit repetitive, especially playing for many hours, but breaking up play sessions helps. I did find myself getting a bit frustrated with the ever-expanding list of things to check sometimes, but once I found my groove, it wasn't as much of an annoyance.

I would like to see the world expanded some more - not necessarily a larger world, but making the current world a bit more interactive, in a way that gives players more things to do outside of checking passports all day. That being said, I do look forward to the upcoming Endless Mode and will give that a shot once it drops.

In my opinion, it can be tried on a discounts just for this sudden enjoyment.

But the game is starting to get extremely boring with little interaction and activities and repetitive days.

They tried to create a small world, and  it's a nice idea to take prisoners to camp or go somewhere to sell contraband, but it was a terrible way they implemented this. 
Vehicle mechanics are absolutely terrible, such a mechanic like this should'nt exist in 2023. The roads are always the same and curvy becomes boring to drive after 2 minutes since you watch literally the same environment.

Our main duty, the border guard, starts to repeat strangely after a point because we always do the same things and we don't have a proper target to improve. 

I really liked the details such as trying to interspersed with a story, murder solving, etc. It breaks the chain of being a border guard and feels like a change of atmosphere, but the story missions are too slow.

Random events that will fill every day can enrich the game. The only random event is getting ambushed by 4 raiders.  New interaction events that can be added will enrich the game. Increasing the typology of vehicle mechanics and roads/landscape and environment will positively affect the atmosphere.
At this point, you see that I played the game for 6 hours, and I played the last 1-2 hours by forcing myself. The final decision is up to you, I wrote down all the troubles I encountered here :)",1684065302,1684065302,True,11,0,0.655070662498474121,0,True,False,False

Rating: ★★☆☆☆

Contraband Police, developed by Crazy Rocks Studios, is a game that aims to simulate the intense and dangerous world of border patrol and law enforcement. While the concept holds great potential, the execution falls short, resulting in a disappointing and lackluster gaming experience.

The game puts you in the role of a border patrol officer tasked with detecting and apprehending smugglers, uncovering contraband, and maintaining law and order. The premise is intriguing, and the idea of immersing players in the challenging and morally complex world of border control is commendable. However, the game's execution leaves much to be desired.

One of the major shortcomings of Contraband Police is its lackluster gameplay mechanics. The core gameplay loop revolves around stopping vehicles, inspecting them, and searching for hidden contraband. Unfortunately, the mechanics are clunky and often feel unintuitive. Interacting with objects and vehicles can be frustrating, with poor hit detection and imprecise controls hindering the overall experience. The limited variety of tasks and repetitive nature of the gameplay quickly become tedious, lacking the depth and variety needed to keep players engaged.

Additionally, the game suffers from a lack of polish and optimization. The graphics are subpar, with dated visuals that fail to create a visually appealing or immersive environment. The open-world setting feels barren and lifeless, lacking the vibrancy and attention to detail that could have made it more engaging. Furthermore, technical issues such as bugs, glitches, and occasional crashes further hinder the gameplay experience, detracting from any enjoyment that could be derived from the game.

Another significant letdown is the game's lack of compelling storytelling or meaningful progression. There is a lack of a cohesive narrative that could have provided context and purpose to the player's actions. The absence of a clear progression system or meaningful rewards diminishes any sense of accomplishment or motivation to continue playing.

While Contraband Police attempts to create a realistic portrayal of law enforcement, it falls short in its implementation. The game fails to capture the complexity and moral dilemmas inherent in such a profession. The interactions with suspects and the decision-making process lack depth and fail to provide meaningful consequences for the player's choices.

On a positive note, the game does offer a multiplayer mode, allowing players to collaborate or compete with others in enforcing the law. This mode adds a slight layer of variety and can offer some enjoyment when playing with friends. However, it does little to salvage the overall shortcomings of the game.

In conclusion, Contraband Police falls short of its potential due to clunky gameplay mechanics, technical issues, lack of polish, and a failure to deliver a compelling and immersive experience. While the concept is intriguing, the execution ultimately hinders any enjoyment that could be derived from the game. If you're looking for a realistic law enforcement experience, there are better alternatives available in the gaming market.",1683918752,1683918752,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,True,False

Despite it's temporary shortcomings I find myself coming back and enjoying the hell out of myself, it's just plain fun. I've also learned which inspection bugs were getting me and they're easy enough to go along with for now until they're fixed. 

Original Review: 

DO NOT grand this game entrance into your PC. DENY DENY DENY.

Such great promise from the start, didn't even finish the demo just went ahead and bought it. A few hours in I start to realize it's not always me being sloppy in my inspections but the actual game is glitched and that is why I sometimes fail them. No big deal right? I tried to work with it because in general it is a lot of fun. However, after taking the time to go through everything just to have a big fat FAIL pop up is pretty discouraging, especially when it happens a couple times in a row and you're already tight on money. 

Uninstalled and not recommended at this time.  Will check back in a few months after hopefully they've fixed some of the inspection glitches as well as the being stuck in the vehicles glitch.",1683575503,1683854223,True,0,0,0.542422235012054443,0,True,False,False

First the bad:

The overall story is pretty meh with little to draw you in. The money mechanic is really only a threat if you overspend. 

The combat is interesting while feeling out of place - why is a checkpoint inspector mowing down wave after wave of smugglers/rebels? I mean, the occasional shoot out makes sense but ambushed almost every time you run around?

Also, if there is a giant police HQ, why are you fighting these folks?

And, of course, there is a somewhat out of place stealth mission. 

The good:

This game scratches that itch ""Paper's please"" excelled at. You'll need to check paper work across multiple documents requiring cross references and seal verification and verifying a manifest isn't off by more than an item or a vehicle weight exceeds it's certification. 

Then, when you get a smuggler, the fun of tearing apart a vehicle and looking for smuggler stamps. There is nothing like thinking you've found every bit of contraband but then checking one last time in the engine bay only to see a pouch of contraband hidden away. 

The mundanes of transporting prisoners and contraband is fun and is coupled with an out of paying for it to be done for you if you are not interested. A blackmarket would have been nice to resell things for more than the paltry amount you get from Police HQ. 

The dev would do better focusing on the already polished inspection mechanics coupled with base building(such as a switch that deploys spikes to stop a vehicle from escaping) with the rare shoot out. More character models(women, etc.) 

There is an ""endless"" mode in the works I think will solve some of the issues with the campaign and the dev has shown willingness to keep building this game. With enough work, a $5-$10 campaign expansion that greatly improves mechanics would work for both the developer and fans.",1683776153,1683776153,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

1. When you click on the developer's name it redirects to the entire PlayWay S.A. catalog. It's common practice with PlayWay to obfuscate what games a developer worked on before their current one, especially when the current one is likely to gain traction with content creators (like this one, which is going to sell itself on ""a 3D Papers, Please."")

2. Gunplay. Sim titles like this are a hodgepodge of mechanics and ideas, usually thrown together to pad for time. First-person shooter segments are never the strong point of a simulator title and this one leans into them quite frequently. Having spent a little time with it: the guns *could* be worse but they're in no way fluid or fun. Just bog-standard, and the only real UI to facilitate shooting is a weird red dot hovering over enemies, which feels like the result of a developer realizing all the earth tones in the map and character designs means you can't actually SEE the enemies that well. The solution: a cartoon dot that you just have to aim under to get headshots every time. 

3. Too many concepts. Contraband Police could be a solid game with just the border crossing and the idea of upgrading your outpost to be more effective. Gas Station Simulator showed you can have a really jankily-built game still have a sense of progression just by hiring AI and assigning them to do your least-favorite tasks. 

Frankly, I'd much rather not have to leave the outpost and partake of the lackluster driving sequences to travel to locations I don't particularly care for. Even the shootouts where the border post gets attacked could be interesting IF the whole point was I can upgrade my post to the point it's self-reliant. Sure, I can give my guys better guns and armor but at the end of the day, I still have to throw contraband and prisoners in a van and go run chores early-game. 

From reviews I'm seeing here, I know my dream of having a Gas Station Simulator-esque border crossing where I level up my NPCs to do menial tasks automatically (perhaps even add multiple inspection lanes and let an NPC do inspections for me with the understanding they have to flag me if any real inspection is needed) are not to be. The upgrades are purely to make things stronger when random attacks happen. 

It's aggressively okay, but I worry I'll be back to this review in a few hours of gameplay with the same story most popular simulator titles have: after the first few hours they KNOW a streamer will broadcast, it drops off. Maybe it won't. For now: buy with caution.",1683729740,1683729756,True,245,5,0.9192962646484375,8,True,False,False

Immediately fun, very clever premise.

Pros: -need strong attention to detail which makes you not want to play it all at once and as such makes you take your time 
-Keeps you on your toes
- clever story line
- semi-open world was surprising

Cons:
-Game save deleted upon completion, immediately took .2 of my score off when that happened. As of the date of this review the devs have said they are working on a continuous mode 
- driving controls are a little weak, one could argue it's because they are bad Soviet style vehicles though
-not enough variation in vehicle types
-not enough weapons, only pistol, SMG, AK, sniper and shotgun, as well as grenade

One more big con, which is a big spoiler

- you don't even get to kill the final boss, it's just a 10 second cut scene once you get to him and it's incredibly disappointing.

The core gameplay loop is quite addicting, something about meticulously checking through a list as you pick your way through someone's vehicle is very rewarding.

I will say that the story is kind of forgettable, its a political commentary that doesn't really bring anything new or profound to the table, just the kind of thing we've seen represented in media for about a century now. 

I also find that the game does drag you away from your work to do ""main missions"" that aren't really all that enjoyable, they ironically feel like more of a chore than the vehicle checks do.

Also, you will get attacked on the road and at the checkpoint RELENTLESSLY, expect to get into 1 or 2 shootouts a day. The novelty of bandits wore off by the 4th day imo.

I understand the devs are banking a lot on this free promised Endless mode but I feel more needs done in the long run.
The rebel story path needs completely reworked.
The tedious back and forth, micromanagement, driving for AGES from point a, b and return every, single night.
The ambushes were I just drove straight through 90%. There is no incentive?
The fact only 1 cop goes in the van to do prisoner/contraband exchange, unrealistic, give me back up.
No ability for random stops and frisk searches...
Honestly, feels like they could do a lot more and I could go on and on with tips.

But now for the good, pretty excellent 3D take on Papers-Please. I saw my first ten hours fly by but it did start to get stale and the wording needs to be better. For example. maximum weight 1400. This guys car was 1400, apparently that was wrong to let him in. Or better yet, only allowed a maximum of food sacks. the guy had 6 and I was penalised for letting him in. Speaking of guys, where are the women in this game? What was the point in upgrades? I did it for achievements, and I think I am done.

I like the idea of the game. It's basically (like everyone else says) an FPS version of Papers Please. The idea in the beginning is really nice with a border control you can upgrade, a quite nice scenery and decent game play. The problem starts coming in later in the game where the inspections are just repeated. And with the introduction of the new mechanics like that you NEED to write down when a vehicle has a damage just feels boring. The side missions is IMO sometimes more fun than the real game-idea since I find the inspection just too repetitive and in the end I was just trying to get done as quickly as possible so I could finish the game. Maybe the game just wasn't for me, so of course not everyone is going to agree on what I just said.

I also think (like some other people said) that there should had been more focus on the border control area. Where buying more guards & upgraded them actually helped. Just getting attacked all of a sudden didn't really feel so fun in the end (and I doubt the guards did anything at all) and when I had to drive after people that escaped the control I just wanted to quit playing. It really feels like I could run the whole border control by myself, which is not realistic at all.

For example: 
 - The guard in the entrance of the control should be able to do stuff, maybe already give a heads up that 'the next car is looking suspicious' or something. 
 - The guard at the exit should be able to activate like spikes or be ready with a gun to take out the person trying to flee. 
 - The 'mechanic' should be able to drive prisoners or contraband instead of having to pay for it. 
[b] There was a lot of potential here so I'm quite disappointed with the result. [/b]

In the end, I think you should definitely play the game if you feel like border inspection is something for you! But with the too repetitive game play, the unnecessary border upgrades (which really makes earning money quite not important other than buying the AK and new tools), and the pretty bad gun-play, The game wasn't really for me.

[i] Maybe I'll come back in the future when the game has recieved a few new updates and maybe changes in the game play, but for now having played one ending is more than enough for me. [/i]",1683119814,1683119900,False,1,0,0.50205761194229126,0,True,False,False

The audio is in a foreign language and subtitles are required. Some subtitles don’t stay on the screen long enough.

It lacks memorable characters like Papers Please has.

Missions are interesting when they appear.

Enemies are very easily defeated.

You get to verify the documents of course, just like in Papers Please. The story is short (Im still at 50% because I don't want to rush it) but the endless mode will drop really soon this month. Your border post will  be attacked from time to time and your crew needs to be upgraded and prepared, you will get ambushed from time to time while you take the prisoners to the labor camp or the illegal stuff to the police station.

PROS:
- The story is phenomenal, in-depth, and allows you to choose your own path
- Stellar gameplay
- Driving mechanics are surprisingly realistic
- Constable Novik is perpetually stoned
- Chucked a grenade at Vlad, 10/10 experience, would do again

CONS:
- I'm pretty sure the ever-drunk Novik has been stealing my contrabanded cigarettes
- Audit is sometimes wrong (most commonly will state their was a missed broken window when there was assuredly no broken window in the vehicle)
- I get penalized for taking a bribe sometimes even though no one is around/looking

GAME ADDITION SUGGESTIONS:
- add multiple people to each vehicle
- add ability to secretly sell confiscated contraband (eg. alcohol, weapons, etc.) to Blood Fist/Oberakov gang members or civilians 
- add ability to tell drivers where you want to go while hitchhiking
- leave dead enemy bodies after border post defense so I can steal their items

(Don't let ""PlayWay"" or the preconception of ""another half-arsed unPolish-ed game"" chase you away, this game really is good and worths the price!)
[Played it through a 2nd time hurká, to see the rebel ending too. It's nice!]

Details:
My initial thought was this game is like [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/239030/Papers_Please/][b]Papers, Please[/b][/url] but in 3D (for which [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/unqlfife/recommended/239030][i]my review is here[/i][/url]. It's brief but why a wall of text when not needed?).
From one respect it's legit, as the game mechanics is similar, as well as the era, plot, etc... But this game is different, as well as offers more on many levels - so it's not fair saying this title is a ""clone"", it's more ""inspired by"".
The player is not ""locked"" to the border booth: There's chasing, shootout, carrying prisoners and items, investigating (a bit sloppy, but still, it's something), upgrading the border crossing, guards, vehicles, etc. and it looks like a story is building out and I'm just a couple of hours into it.


There are a few negatives, but I'd say it's more constructive criticism from my side in hope devs read (even positive) reviews and might mind these points. Once again, don't let these scare you away from buying the game, these are more improvement ideas than actual problems:
[list]
[*]Lighting is a bit puzzling, there's a lot to fix there... One needs a flashlight in broad daylight at shady places
[*]Broken windows are very hard to see, would be great if window tint was changed
[*]Holding RMB to aim is last century, it should toggle (or at least offer an option for that)
[*]Cannot load ""last checkpoint"" only on fatal failure, this is a bit cheap
[*]Smuggle areas marked with a snake is cheap and makes the job far too easy: It would be better if one had to inspect instead, depending on element type (e.g. knock the bumper / wheel / tank / etc, push and hit the seating, open and search bags, etc). This way it would be much more interesting to find smuggled goods. Could be a minus if a part was taken apart with no smuggled goods in it (i.e. one was just destroying everything). As of now, it's just a visual confirmation where the contraband is, with a very little chance of missing it, not fun
[*]Cant' start the engine with the hotkey when sitting in the car... really annoying (I also don't like there's no indexing and horn and stuff but no big deal, it would just be fun)
[*]Attackers (ambushes) come too often; from what I've seen it was more frequent, but still... I'd also consider making these less annoying, e.g. mark the map ahead of time (secret services did a great job or something), so the player might decide to take a different road - but if not, I miss roadblocks. What kind of ambush doesn't try to block the road?
[*]Also, I'm not very inspired to diss them for just a handful of dollars. There should be a better/bigger reward
[*]I've no idea why there's a ""pull"" option for dead people instead of a single-key-press-quick-looting something
[*]I also don't like corpses tend not to have anything on them, but some ammo (cash, a grenade, a knife or a crowbar, whatever, really. Some variety)
[*]Adding to that, would be nice if Vlad bought stuff from the player too, not just sold things. For example, contrabands (ehehehehe - maybe it will be a thing some time in the game and I'm just not there?)
[*]Initially it was confusing what happens when I ask for a tool shipment. By the 3rd try I catched the text written out, so I understood the dude will come over as a mobile shop in the night, but it was not obvious at all
[*]Would be better if had to mark the checklist: green OK, red NOK, no mark: forgotten / skipped
[*]For saved Perception (i.e. manual verification of vehicles), there should be a bonus when going to sleep, e.g. making some extra money (folding boxes half the night as a side job or something)
[*]Color codes: Red should be trouble only, there should be different colors for other stuff, e.g. daily costs could be blue (I'm always like ""Jesus what did I do wrong again?!"" with a mini heart attack, when it was just a totally normal payment)
[*]On decisions, it's siding government or rebels... Well, no? If one was sent out by the gov. to catch someone, not doing so is at least suspicious. I think there's no way to change this but for the next game, designer(s) should mind the possible reasons behind decisions, not the choice itself - it's a decade old mistake designers make, really annoying, especially if I'm left no option but to choose ""A"" if I think for the long run... (Where it is the most ""painful"" to me was [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/unqlfife/recommended/1222140/][b]Detroit: Become Human[/b][/url], a great and wonderful game (10000% recommended to play), with some bad mistakes
[*]I checked the name [spoiler]Volk Jonas (ish?)[/spoiler] and it looked OK to me... can be a bug or a mistake on my side... But I was super-sure the name was OK
[*]Unsure if can win the fight in the tutorial, but it's annoying there's no way to try again

The checkpoint should be the focus of the game yet you are sent on too many side quests that involve very mediocre mechanics and horrible driving mechanics. The gunplay is not great at all and needs to be severely improved. While the addition of side quests such as helping local police in gun battles or responding to other crimes or contraband interceptions is fun at first, they get extremely repetitive yet you do them to be able to afford upgrades to the checkpoint. I love the fact how you can upgrade the checkpoint from better buildings to hiring and upgrading more guards and getting new cars but the concern is that the guards with the exception of gun fights are useless. I wish you can order the guards to perform more tasks such as transport prisoners (or at least accompany you for backup) and maybe even the ability to help with inspections (real world 1 guard doesnt run a border checkpoint). They need to add things to make the checkpoint gameplay more unique and be the focus of the game and cut back on the really small lackluster world quests. Add more passengers, add tow trucks to move cars instead of talking to a guard, add other events besides attacks on the outposts and maybe more customization to the outposts that matter.

And bandit raids. And revolutionaries. And smugglers. So there's some first-person shooting.

And there's an open world aspect. Sort of. It's not much of a world, but it is there. There's some hidden collectibles by the points of interest, which just give you $ and a sense of completion. And missions to go to these places for a variety of things. It's not always combat. One was a murder mystery.

None of it's done terribly *well*, of course. The enemies do take cover and pop up to shoot... but can also be seen reloading away from cover while standing upright. Your allies do lay down a lot of fire in a fight, but not all of them aim. NPCs get different looks, but it's like, 5 beards, a couple hats, and a couple glasses. All white guys. Though, at least they remembered women exist, as one voice on the phone is not a guy.

This is why Playway titles are always kind of fascinating. Not just for what goes in, but what corners get cut. Most are worthwhile, many certainly manage to be something Different.

So I do somewhat recommend this game. It runs, it's a bit janky, but rather bug-free.

The graphics are great, for what the game is. I've had no graphical bugs or errors, no prop or character bugs, nothing. I'm impressed.

There is a story to the game which I've not yet completed. I've only just begun but the game gives a very strong hint to its intentions from the start.

Money-making is pretty easy. There are a few ways to succeed here, however, they're not always easy. 

Driving controls with a k&m, considering I usually despise driving with k&m, this isn't too bad.

HOWEVER:

There is NO controller support. This is a HUGE gripe for me as I usually always play with controller due to disabilities... I can manage with K&M but it damages my joints after a while. It doesn't put me off playing but it does limit my play-time which is a shame.

The combat is... Pretty bad. Once you can get a rifle it's a little better but still not great.

One review said it was a 12 hour game, that is pretty much where I am at and hit the ending. I don't have to much of a problem with that but there is A LOT missing from the game that would make it alot better. Many of these things were mentioned already.

The game should focus more on the checkpoint and upgrading it. That is one thing I like about upgrade base games is I like seeing the progress of the upgrades and the changes. The checkpoint barely changes with each upgrade and looks the exact same. 

Base upgrades could have included checkpoint cosmetics, fixing the sign, bigger flag, additional roadblock, defense positions ect...

Another thing I did not enjoy and others mentioned was leaving the checkpoint to drop off evidence on one side of the map and prisoners on the other... BUT if you are going to do it. Again feed my upgrade beast and change the prison the more prisoners I put in the more it changes and upgrades. Same for the evidence. This would make the game feel different.  

The combat isn't fun at all. If I want combat I can play games that have way better methods, weapons, graphics ect... just focus on the checkpoint.

Screening people entering the boarder, and checking for contraband is great fun. I wish I could do it all day.

I have however a few problems with this game:
- the story is scripted and every person reaching the checkpoint is the same
- there is enough variety in cars but not in people; why are cars driven by a single man every time?
- the gameplay at the checkpoint is quite nice, but the driving and gunplay mechanics are too shallow to be enjoyable
- the stealth gameplay is abysmal (one step too distant and you lose but the guy you are trying to follow can see you inside the vegetation, what?)
- the stiff animations are really too much of an immersion breaker for me

You can tell the game has been lovingly crafted by it’s small team, and was high quality at launch, with no bugs or persistent issues. 

Contraband police puts you in the shoes of a border post manager in the fictional communist/socialist state of Acaristan. During my roughly 15 hour playthrough, I upgraded and managed the staff and facilities of the post, performed inspections of travelers through the checkpoint, defended the post from attacks, ferried contraband and arrestees to their final destinations inside Acaristan, and managed stocks of tools and weapons. There were occasional missions and side quests to keep things interesting.

Each day, a handful of cars passed through the checkpoint and it was up to me to pass them in or deny their entry based on the legitimacy and correctness of their documents, or just how I felt about the traveler. Some with illegitimate papers begged to get inside, others tried to bribe, others just ran through the checkpoint.  This made the game fun. At one point, a man was begging to get inside, he was a refugee from a war and his kids were alone inside Acaristan. I let him in even though his papers were incorrect. I later received a letter from him thanking me, with a few children’s drawling’s inside. Little things like these were really neat. 

You also be a tough cop, break someone’s window and then deny them entry because of a broken window. You could choose to follow the increasingly strict rules of the state or make your own decisions based on circumstances. 

Some tried to smuggle contraband into the country, and it was fun inspecting their cars and cargo for the illicit goods. You could take bribes or sell the contraband on the side.

The FPS gameplay was good, and the action was satisfying. 

I would recommend Contraband Police because it is genuinely fun and entertaining. Its story is alright, but its fun and varied gameplay loop kept me coming back.

Spotting the errors in documents, and finding the hidden contraband was a challenge at the start but soon enough I managed to ace all the inspections without errors. It's rewarding to see how efficient you can become at the game.

As for the content, having a bit more side activities that you can engage on your own time would add a lot to the game. The game gives you several story missions which were surprisingly fun to do.

At the end, I had a bit too much money without much to spend it on. I managed to max upgrade the border quite quickly, so more weapons or gadgets would be fun.

Also, I believe a ""New Game+"" or some endless mode would be fun once you've finished the story. After the final mission your save file gets automatically deleted, which was bit of a bummer.

The demo was fun, they gave you just enough content to make you want to get the game (which worked really well), and I ended up buying it. 

I didn't really care for the story at all, it was kind of boring to be honest, it's a ""important choices"" game where you can choose which path you want to follow, but in the end your choices effect absolutely nothing aside from which story you see. Nothing changes gameplay wise so it feels like the story isn't important in anyway. 

I didn't buy the game for the story anyhow, I bought it for the gameplay, and the gameplay is really fun. I love taking down smugglers and arresting them then finding all of their hidden 'cargo', it was a blast until the last couple of hours of the story, because then the game just got really stale. There were new things you had to look out for, but it wasn't enough to keep me wanting to come back.

I finished the story after 10 hours of gameplay, and was upset to see how the game ended, and the fact that you couldn't keep playing. The game just automatically deleted your save and you couldn't go back and keep doing your job or anything which is a HUGE bummer for me. I really liked the gameplay, but finishing the story was really upsetting because I couldn't keep playing on my save post-story.

I would recommend this game if they didn't have such a bad story, and even if they did have a bad story, at least let us be able to play the game more, not just automatically kick us to the menu and force us to restart from day one. There isn't even a newgame+ or anything, so you have to redo the training and all that. 

Not to mention how boring the combat is, when you see the trailer the game looks cool because you get to shoot stuff, but every gun in the game has 0 recoil so it's like you're shooting a squirt gun at people. If you don't want challenging combat, then this is something you can look forward to, but if you do like a challenge look further because there isn't even a difficulty option. I died probably twice in my entire playthrough, once because I got stuck on a tree while being shot at, and another to a bug.

I will recommend this game in the future if they add an endless mode with more upgrades and such, but right now it's not worth the price in my opinion.

I had so much fun, I played the demo twice and I just had to buy the full game... I've played the game for around 4 hours now and I have no major complaints. The game runs smoothly even on ultra graphics. Whoever is thinking of trying out the game please do. I couldn't recommend it more. 

1 slight complaint that I could make is that getting out of the car can be a little annoying sometimes, like the player character won't go out every time, which has cost me some chase scenes... yet that could also just be because of my Bluetooth keyboard. I can also just restart the day so that kinda solves that ""problem"". But all in all i'd give it a solid 8.5/10. Maybe even higher.. Is it perfect? No, but is it fun? 100% Yes.

PS: 
The demo is pretty much the first 45 mins to 1hour-ish of the game. So, I would try half of the demo out first and if you like it just buy full game otherwise you'll have to experience the same thing again in the full game... I had to experience that 3 times but I didn't mind since I thoroughly enjoyed every second.

I've had this game on my wishlist for over a year as I've really liked the concept of going through the process that many border control officers have to go through on daily basis. I've played the prologue before I played Papers Please and I got hooked. The political circumstances help create interesting moral questions and decision makings, similarly to how this is done in Papers Please. In my review I will be comparing some core similarities these games have in common.

[h1]Mechanics[/h1]
Overall, the mechanics have been really well done. Shooting, quests, checking documents, ambushes, etc. are great.

The driving however is overly sensitive and it is very hard to get used to for a couple of chapters, but after a while it becomes somewhat easier. However driving the fastest car in the game (Zaved) can get you in weird losses of traction while going through turns where this wouldn't necessarily happen.

Also the ambushes are quite predictable, they seem to happen in about 3 - 5 places. A little bit of randomness and better timing would make it feel more like an ambush.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
The gameplay overall has been great, the storyline is interesting and covers a lot of interesting choices of taking sides. You are faced with moral situations of letting someone pass who is in a hard situation. However, I didn't find most of these arguments to be as heart-feeling as in Papers Please, I couldn't quite connect to the characters' hardship and I felt more compelled to take a stance with the government.

I've felt the same way regarding the overall Government vs Rebels side, you are never given a strong enough reason to not necessarily take the side of the government unless you really really wanna take the Rebels' side. You are more than fairly compensated ([spoiler]Not like in Papers Please where you are paid like 5 credits per person and you barely make rent or enough money to pay for food.[/spoiler]), you do not have any moral obligations to someone([spoiler]Such as having to help out take care of your niece or to provide medication for your family.[/spoiler]), you also do not have a strong enough motivation to disobey or take bribes([spoiler]You receive about 611$ per bribe by a smuggler, and once you max out your level you get about 200$ per correct check, 160$ if you make a couple of mistakes. You also get 200$ for each prisoner and about 400$ for 25 contraband items. The bribe amount should be made higher to incentivize rebellious behavior.[/spoiler]), also being with the Rebels does not seem to give you any strong benefits like in Papers Please([spoiler]At least there EZIC seems to give you live-changing money for your family which to be fair is hard to reject, even as you are doing good things and obeying the government, you're still being screwed fueling anger against the regime. But in Contraband Police you are treated like a human being and any bad dictator-like behavior is not really shown.[/spoiler]). Ultimately if these things were slightly changed it would've made a significant and more balanced experience for the whole storyline.
[h1]Conclusion[/h1]

Contraband Police is so far the best game I have bought in 2023. Whilst it would be easy to call it open world or 3d papers please, the truth is that it's more than that, its one of the more compelling police simulators out there right now.

Game play wise, there is a central tasking mechanic of inspecting vehicles and ensuring people pass or don't based on the policy at the time. There's an interesting story line focused on the dying days of the Eastern Bloc which is interesting as well. But in addition to this, you do very much take on a wider role as a general police investigator and also the manager of the boarder crossing as well. You get to upgrade your base and team, which keeps things fresh as time goes by and gives you a sense that even if the rest of the world is declining, you're able to hold things together somewhat when its under your control.

Like a lot of other games published by payway, it's got a good game, but the quality is somewhat lacking. It's a great game for 2023, but stuck inside the graphics of the early 2010s. Going open world was a great idea and I think pays off, but at the same time the world itself is very basic, narrow roads and nowhere where the population is really living. I'd like to see a version of this game where there's more focus on the police aspect as well, and the story line focuses on a police officer struggling to do their job whilst the entire system is falling down around them.

That's where I think where they failed: where Papers please (sorry to keep comparing to that title) had a good story line and consequences for your actions, Contraband Police has a very linear approach where the consequences for refusing some people (or accepting them) is a letter in your mailbox. ==> average story.

Contraband Police is a unique and challenging game that puts you in the shoes of a young officer trainee working at a border post in the politically strict Acarist People's Republic in 1981. As you work to regulate entry into the country, you quickly realize that every move you make is closely monitored by the party, and the situation at the border becomes increasingly tense, especially after the tragic death of one of your comrades during an intervention.

One of the standout features of Contraband Police is its focus on document control. As an officer, you are responsible for checking the validity of every visitor's documents, and even the slightest discrepancy can result in refusal of entry. The game starts off relatively straightforward, but as time goes on, the number of documents to check increases, and the errors become more difficult to detect. This adds a layer of challenge to the gameplay, requiring keen attention to detail and careful decision-making.

The game's setting in the mountainous region of Karikatka is beautifully rendered, with detailed graphics that capture the atmosphere of the time period. The sense of tension and suspicion in the air is palpable, and the game does an excellent job of immersing you in the world of a border officer during a politically sensitive era.

The gameplay itself is intense and engaging. You'll need to carefully examine documents, cross-reference information, and make tough decisions on who to allow entry and who to turn away. The consequences of your choices can be far-reaching, affecting the story and the outcome of the game. The sense of responsibility and the weight of your decisions add to the game's overall immersion and replay value.

The story is intriguing, with the death of your comrade adding a layer of mystery and intrigue to the game. As you uncover more about the events at the border and the political situation in the Acarist People's Republic, the plot thickens, keeping you invested in the outcome.

One potential downside to the game is its level of difficulty. As the number of documents and errors increases, it can become quite challenging to keep up with the pace, and mistakes can have consequences. However, for players who enjoy a challenge and the thrill of high-stakes decision-making, this can be seen as a positive aspect of the game.

In conclusion, Contraband Police is a unique and immersive border control simulator that offers a challenging and intense gameplay experience. With its focus on document control, intriguing story, and immersive setting, it's a game that will keep you on your toes and test your skills as an officer. If you're up for the challenge, put on your uniform and get ready to uphold the party's regulations in this politically charged game!",1681223092,1681223092,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Entry into the Acarist People's Republic is strictly regulated by the party and your every move is monitored! The situation at the border escalates when your comrade is killed during one of the interventions...

 Document control
Every visitor must have a set of valid documents. Even the slightest discrepancy means refusal of entry. Over time, the number of documents will increase and errors will be more difficult to detect.

 Smuggling detection
Our intelligence regularly provides information about suspicious drivers. Search their vehicles using a UV flashlight and then use the appropriate tools to extract the smuggled goods. No amount of contraband should cross the border!

 Shootouts
In some situations you will be forced to use firearms. Your station is a constant target for Oberankov's gang attacks, and every away mission carries the risk of a clash with the enemy.

 Police chases
Desperate smugglers may attempt to escape from the control zone. It is your duty to stop and arrest them! Buy and upgrade police cars to improve the effectiveness of your pursuit.

 Post management
Upgrade your police station to increase its defenses and improve subsequent inspections. However, keep in mind the rising cost of maintaining your station. Successful inspections, foiled smuggling and successful interventions are a few ways to earn cash.

 Special assignments
Always be ready to intervene in an emergency. Solve crime puzzles, support your comrades and thwart the Blood Fist rebels. Make decisions that will determine the future of Acaristan.

A cargo truck pulled up at the checkpoint disrupting my musing, I hate cargo trucks they take more time to inspect properly. The driver was a foreigner, which wasn't a problem as long as he was willing to respect the rules and laws our glorious party had outline for this great country of mine. As he handed me his papers I noticed he seemed tense, I wondered if I was coming off a bit hostile which would be bad since i pride myself as being a friendly welcoming person. So after I had got him to verify that everything on the cargo manifest was indeed what was in the back I decided to crack a joke the lighten the mood. So I did, the driver chuckled, a crate laughed, I arrested the driver, his smuggler buddy hiding inside and the contraband they were trying to sneak across the boarder. It was productive day.


Okay actual review time.
My sad attempt at wit aside (thanks for indulging me if you got this far), this is nice game, thats well crafted and really knows how to let you get into the swing of things. Especially its core mechanics by gradually introducing them at steady pace so you don't get overwhelmed by them. The plot isn't anything profound or ground breaking but its serviceable for the time and setting but you really should be playing this more for the inspection process which does get broken up sporadically with a little action and gunplay. Visually the game is surprisingly good for something that didn't have a triple A budget (can't say that about a lot of triple A games these days ironically). Anyway if you like analyzing things for inconsistencies and don't need to constantly be in high octane situation this game might just end up being your jam. While the asking price for it is with in reason in my opinion, if you're still on the fence add it to your list and wait for sale then try it.",1681064807,1681064807,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Review:
Title: A Promising Concept Hindered by Technical Issues

System Specifications:

    OS: Microsoft Windows 11 Home, Version 10.0.22621 Build 22621
    CPU: AMD Ryzen 9 7950X 16-Core Processor, 4501 Mhz, 16 Core(s), 32 Logical Processor(s)
    GPU: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090, 31.0.15.3141
    RAM: 32 GB
    Resolution: 3840 x 2160 x 59 hertz

Contraband Police has an engaging premise, putting players in the shoes of a border patrol officer tasked with inspecting vehicles for illegal items. However, the technical issues I encountered during my playthrough made it difficult to appreciate the game's potential fully.

From the onset, the game suffers from performance issues. On my system, with the aforementioned specifications, I experienced multiple crashes within the first few minutes of gameplay. This made it nearly impossible to progress in the game, which was disappointing, considering the unique concept and the potential for immersive gameplay.

When I was able to play for brief moments, I found the graphics and overall design to be satisfactory. The environment was detailed, and the interface was intuitive. However, the crashes overshadowed these positive aspects and made it difficult to enjoy the game.

It is worth noting that the developers may address these issues in future updates, but as of now, I cannot recommend Contraband Police to players with similar system specifications. The game has potential, but the current technical problems make it a frustrating experience.",1681060219,1681060219,False,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

Checking papers and looking for contraband is fun, but of course it gets monotonous eventually, dont expect game loop to evolve much, you just have to check more papers, more conditions applied... You can upgrade your stuff/officers, but not really much yourself.

Other missions can be a nice break from checking papers loop, but driving and shooting is very basic, not much of a challenge or fun.

You can choose between 2 sides, sadly your choices have 0 impact on gameplay, only on game ending, so you dont feel like you picked a side. Also you do those choices outside of customs.

Comparisons between this game and Papers, Please are inevitable, so I'm just going to use that as a point of reference since I'd assume most players interested in Contraband Police are at least aware of Papers, Please and generally know how it works.

The gameplay loop is inspecting both persons and vehicles that come through your border checkpoint, and while there is a certain amount of satisfaction in the daily grind and generally getting things right (Finding contraband, upholding regulations, performing perfect audits, etc.), I find the experience to be far more monotonous than Papers, Please. On top of there being much more to keep track of and potentially screw up (EVERY part of each car must be checked EVERY time in order to get the full payment for each audit), there's also no timer to keep the gameplay challenging and interesting. It's not BAD overall, but it is indeed *worse* than I was hoping for.

On top of the regular border checks. there's also the admin stuff, which I actually liked a bit more; You can upgrade your staff by hiring more guards and buying better equipment, you can upgrade the capacity for your prison cells and storage for confiscated contraband, and you can also buy and upgrade new police vehicles.

Yes, there are police vehicles, and this is where the game falls apart for me, as the driving is simply AWFUL to control, and the cars' speed ranges between a snail's pace and WHOOPS, I accelerated right into a tree. Aside from bringing your prisoners and contraband to the proper authorities, the vehicles ferry you across the very small and uninteresting region map for missions, and for the most part, these consist of shootouts with gangs of thugs. The shooting feels very unrefined, I didn't find the gunplay to be very challenging or interesting, and I got tired of it very quickly. It was at least tolerable until the point where I finally stopped playing; a mission where you're shooting out of the back of a police van while criminals attempt to run you off the road in what is effectively a *turret section*, which I feel I could probably beat given a few more attempts but I eventually realized after dying three times that I just didn't care.

Finally I'll touch briefly on the storytelling, and again I'll invoke the Papers, Please comparison, because that game was frankly excellent with its story as every ingame day brought a slew of new story elements affecting the world as a whole, relayed to the player by newspaper or dialogue, and you could always feel things changing around you even while stuck in a tiny booth, and at crucial points you even have a hand in what happens. Contraband Police clearly tries to emulate that system, but it doesn't do so very well in my opinion. The story only updates in chapters, as does the gameplay, and a chapter will last for a few days at a time. That means very little of consequence will actually happen in between moments where you're updated about world happenings via newspaper, and the effect you have on the story seems to be minimal. There's a rebel faction you can allegedly help in certain missions by choosing certain actions. but if my choices were making any impact on the world around me, it wasn't at all obvious that was the case. Presumably it will change the game's ending, but at this point I'm simply not interested enough to see either ending of this game.

This game is set in the 1980s in a “Soviet era” fictitious country that resembles Eastern Europe. You play as the commander of one of the posts responsible for admitting and refusing possible entrants. You will progress through different events that occur that take shape other priorities that you’ll be on the lookout for during your inspections. 

Let’s start with the good aspects of the game:

* The inspections you make are varied and fun. Again, if you’re a fan of Papers Please, you will find yourself inspecting documents and searching vehicles for contraband. 
* The setting and environment are nice. It gives you an open world feel without having too large of a world that makes it feel shallow. 

* The driving is fine. The pursuits you make of smugglers and escaped prisoners sometimes feel clunky but you will have three vehicles to choose from. I’ve seen complaints on the driving but it’s really not that much different than My Summer Car or The Long Drive. 

* The story is nice but short. You’ll be able to pick one of two paths with some smaller choices along the way. It’s nice that simulators like this are actually starting to include a narrative. 

Now for some of the negatives or things that could be improved:

* There is no new game + or endless mode after you complete the campaign. You will have to start a brand new save so if you’re working on finding collectibles or trying to get some achievements, better so that before the final mission. 

* The gunplay is stiff. It’s not necessarily awful since it’s not really a shooter but there’s not a lot of recoil on the guns and you’ll find yourself wondering sometimes why certain shots don’t register. 

* There are a few minor bugs. I’ve fallen through the map a couple of times but never really lost progress as a result of the bugs. 

Overall, this is a fun little game that I would absolutely recommend. I intend on replaying the game to do the other route so I believe that the full price is worth it for the hours I’ll get out of it. Definitely get it if you find it on sale.",1680523318,1680523318,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I enjoy being rewarded for being extra vigilant and double-triple checking things.  The developers are active in fixing things and adding features, so I'm sure the game will only get better and better.  Some people may think the story doesn't happen quick enough, but if you had days where you're doing really well, all that money you are getting can get put back into bettering your home, supplies, prison, vehicles, weapons, and tools.  All crucial things you'll need for your everyday work days.  

If I had any complaints it might be this: When checking vehicles for window damage, sometimes it's incredibly difficult to figure out if a window you're looking at is broken or not. I usually get dinged for that and it just makes me roll my eyes when it happens.  Driving is a little drifty, but it's not awful.  

Recommendations for the game would be some aesthetic things you can do to your border crossing, like cleaning up all the weird junk that's piled everywhere.  I'd also think it'd be fantastic if we had some sort of twitch integration built into this so the viewers could be the ones trying to get into the country.  Maybe put that into Endless Mode or a special mode so it doesn't mess anything up.  Also maybe more variety of people who come through the border, currently it's all single men driving in.  I think it'd be nice if there was another NPC in the passenger seat, or if you had women driving in.  Just more variety so it doesn't feel so much like the same.

This game should focus solely on the checkpoint. Why do I hire all these staff and I have to drive everywhere myself and chase everyone myself?
I think: focus on the checkpoint. Add women and children to these cars. Add several men to each car. Every car has only 1 guy. If there are more you have to manage them, where they stand, handcuff them to detain while searching, etc. Here I find cocaine and the guy is standing there like no big deal. Cmon.
We should have to see the markings for contraband but before grabbing it, make believe we don't see it and detain first. Call child services for the kids. Release cars to wives. Call towtrucks instead of just telling that guy (who sounds like a minion by the way) to clear it out. Such a missed opportunity. They tried to do too many things making all of it bland and boring rather than focus on the good part, the actual checkpoint, and really going with it.
Make all of those variety's, make it unlimited, just throw new rules every few days, and I'll play it. But the way it is? I think 12 hours is my max. I was done so fast, and i think its destroying the game. I hope you guys make the storyline way longer. I basically paid 20 bucks for 12 hours.

Enjoyable and in a ""finished"" state playable for sure only one visual bug in my playthrough. Similar to games like Beholder 2 and Papers please. Not just checking papers at the border all day there are many missions and optional encounters/side missions available.

I completed the game in just under 16 hours my main complaint being that when you finish the game you can't continue to check papers after the story ends. I would like to be able to perhaps upgrade my base some more and continue to be able to check papers and do encounters but otherwise a great game.

It has so much more potential, yet it doesn't even have freeplay yet. Also at one point the amount of things you need to check on every car also get's a bit annoying. I wish there was a way to hire help for tedious tasks later in the game. Anyway, the base is there but i hope it gets developed further. Right now it does not seem like a good deal at this price point. I still recommend it though because it's a decent game, just try to get it a bit cheaper!

Some breakdown of my opinion of the game:

Story: Good
Graphics: Kinda meh but good enough
Environment: Just fine for this game. The map isn't too small or too big.
Performance: Pretty bad but settings allow one to go down enough to make it run on slow machines as well
Gameplay: Pretty good
Gunplay: Nothing to write home about but there are a lot worse games out there
Input: OK. There seems to be some sort of mouse smoothing that you cannot turn off and that annoyed me to no end. EDIT: There is an option to turn off camera smoothing now!
Stability: Not a single crash or misbehavior in the 30 hours i played this game!

EDIT at 31 hours:
Most points still stand but i find it surprising that this game has replayability! I just finished the game 3rd time and i may still start it all over again soon. My reason for starting the game 2nd time was to play on the rebels side. 3rd one was all for achevements (i still did not get the one i was hoping for) I have started to appreciate this game more the more i play it. It's simple but effective!

The game rewards attention to detail, and so far has a pretty good variation in its gameplay.  Sometimes you're checking paperwork, sometimes you're arresting criminals... and sometimes it goes full FPS and you get to neutralize dozens of bad guys with the help of a border police team that you put together and outfitted, yourself.

One small knock against this game is the fact that ingame time moves a bit too quickly, causing you to have to rush certain things in order to complete your tasks before it gets too late in the evening.  If they could slow that down 20-30%, that would be nice.  They do compensate for this a bit though, by limiting the number of things you need to do/check on each day, giving you some options to have services brought to you at a price, and stopping time during a mandatory mission (outside of the border post) so you can take that at your leisure.  I'd still recommend this game to anyone despite the slightly rushed gameplay.

I bought this shortly after all my favorite Twitch streamers started playing it.  Also, I'm surprised at how much I've written up til now.  I was initially just trying to make the Steam ""Would you recommend this to others????!!!1"" message go away.

It's like papers please, but on steroids (and god damn do I love papers please). You're not just stuck looking at paperwork and whatnot, there's interventions, checkpoint upgrades, buying guns etc. It's pretty cool. 

Two things I'd love to see: 

The more upgrades you get for your checkpoint, the condition improves, like actual roofs, rubbish cleaned up etc. 

A longer story. While the story itself isn't bad, it definitely can feel a bit empty. There needs to be more to it imo This took me maybe 13 hours to complete, and for $30AUD that's pretty alright in my mind, but even story DLC, or a different story line or whatnot would slap, I'd buy it.

The build up of information and complicated nature of the game is well done.  The environment looks good.  I never came across any bugs really during my playthrough.

You should grab this title, it's still 12% off, for €17 this is a must have.

You may think this is just a boring copy of papers please but its way more then that!
It is worth every cent! For 19.50€ you get around 13h of playtime for one playtrough. There are two diffrent endings as well.
The overall playstyle is inspired by papers please, but you do way more than just checking papers. For example: You have to check the condition of a car, or even check if the owner is transporting illegal items. Sometimes you even have to chase people because they dont stop at the station. The gameplay doesnt get boring, mostly because there are really cool story missions you have to complete. I really like how you can upgrade the outpost as well but i have to say that there is a bit too less things that you can upgrade. I also like how you have to transport prisoners or illegal items to the local police station in order to get a bit extra money. All in all this game is really worth buying, especially if you liked papers please. The story is really great and keeps you interested. The ending I got was really cool and fits the story greatly.
This game really is one of my favourites now.

The money that you make is yours to choose with how you spend it in the world, I won't go into too much detail but there are a few choices on how you spend your money.

I really loved the demo, I loved the fact that there was a demo (and not some dumb EA kind of stuff), I really waited for this game. Yet, I can't bring myself to finish it. Contraband Police tries to distance itself from getting called ""Papers, Please! 3D"", and it tries really hard. But I'd say [b]too[/b] hard. There's nothing wrong about taking inspiration from another indie gem. And there's nothing wrong about trying to spice up the gameplay to make it your own.Problem is that it's done poorly. You have free roaming on Caucasus-looking mountainous map, but there isn't a single 50m stretch of straight road, turning everything into a weird slalom simulator. Slalom simulators are [u]annoying[/u]. I don't play video games to get annoyed. So what was the grand idea behind this terrible design? There's wild nature, but it's very clearly using exact same 6 or 7 foliage assets. There's ambushes, but enemy has no AI. There's missions - but they come off as poor clones of ""missions"" you get in every other game, sort of like random picks from Skyrim or GTA. Follow that dude at a distance, talk to people to solve murder, shoot some guys in the cemetery. Which is also fine, if it was done well. Skyrim had 270 well-crafted quests. This game barely manages to make 5 of them work. Everything just feels like a checklist - it's there, but not a dime more. Bare minimum to say ""We have it"" and not lie. You go looking for contraband in the cemetery, and every time your shovel touches the ground, 3 enemies spawn around you. It's so blatant, boring, visible and annoying sort of game design that it turns you off immediately. Add a random timer. Make a car stop nearby. Make them paradrop from the sky. Just add a sound of a helicopter to the game, suggesting they landed nearby. Just do [i]something[/i] to make me feel less like a clown in a game that has design complexity of wooden toy blocks. On the other hand, core idea is really cool. Everything seems to work, more or less. Everything looks like it should, more or less. While there's quite a bit of bad busywork crammed in (like those ""quests"" and raids that never seem to end nor pose any real challenge - you can just wait them out by hiding behind the corner of a garage), there's also quite enjoyable busywork to be had, here and there. So in conclusion, time not badly spent.Priced reasonably, and at least the effort and love of an indie developer being very clearly seen, I guess it's alright. I just wish game design was a bit better thought-out and more polished. Maybe we'll see it in next game?",1679706846,1679707148,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

My opinion is that overall it is an ok game with the potential to be a really good game but there are some incredibly frustrating mechanisms getting in the way, namely combat, AI, and tools. Combat is not so bad but most of the weapons feel under powered. Next is tools and oh good God are they something, the tools are so weak it really takes away from the fun of the game. You will constantly have to go to a tool shop that is very far away in order to buy more or call to have them delivered, however if you have the police truck at your checkpoint then the tool delivery can not come. Also some tools allow for alternatives but others do not which makes no sense. For example you can cut with either an axe or a knife but you can dig ONLY with the shovel: not the knife, not the pitchfork, not the axe, not even your own hands. Have a mission where you have to dig three holes? better bring like 2 or 3 shovels, and ONLY shovels. Also your fellow AI customs officers are pretty useless, you can upgrade them all you want but they don't contribute anything to the actual searches of vehicles, delivery of prisoners or contraband, or to stop fleeing suspects. Its really frustrating to watch a suspect announce ""I'm gonna run away!"" then slowly get in his car and start driving away just to watch all 8 of your fellow customs officers do nothing to stop him at all, just stand there like cows while you have to do all the work. the only good thing the AI is good for is during raids on the base but the thing with the raids is that they can just be disabled from the menu, thus making the AI officers EVEN MORE useless.",1679582519,1679582519,False,3,0,0.49824562668800354,1,True,False,False

I would say its one of the more polished simulator games ive played. I have not encountered any noticeable bugs as of yet which is a good thing. I hope the devs keeps updating and adding more stuff to the game soon.

Some things i would like to be changed/tweaked/added
- Driving feels slightly clunky
- Top shelf tools breaks to fast imo
- It does not feel like there is much of difference between the weapons in terms of damage.
- Also aiming down-sights feels abit off.
- Adding female drivers would make the daily job feel less repetitive.
- The game is pretty serious, so i would not mind slightly more humour :p
- Also i would like to see more stuff to upgrade and customise, like tools and buildings and so on.

This game had a rough start at first, but after the 1.0 release, this was an incredible surprise of a game. The car mechanics felt a hint off but honestly I just put that off as ""80's cars driving like boats"" so that is a minimal issue. The only time I had any sort of instability was only once during a single mission where the game froze and crashed. Otherwise the only main complaint that I have is that I felt like the smuggling/contraband system held your hand a little too much. I don't mind the fact that nearly every contraband was given that snake mark, but I did mind that every smuggler in the game you got forewarning with on the notice board, so I actually took it upon myself just to not read the notice board's smuggler warnings as they made it too easy. Also I found it strange how the lowest number of contraband I had found in a single vehicle was at least 3, and I never had a moment where someone was trying to be cheeky and just smuggle one little item in, it was always a huge haul. Also why couldn't you sell your excess ammo or weapons somewhere? even for dirt cheap? I had purchased weapons only to be given that weapon a mission later or a couple missions later so I would have two of the same weapon which was not only useless but a little detrimental at the early game because inventory was a little tighter. I would just end up throwing ammo or repeat guns on the ground since I couldn't do anything with them. BTW this list is basically every complaint or nitpick that I ever had with the game, so considering that's literally all I can complain about? That's Pretty Good.

In terms of good things: the gun mechanics and sounds were incredible and I loved every shootout I got into as it always felt suitably epic. The variation of gameplay felt nearly perfect as it would give you anywhere from a day to 3 days in game of just checkpoint duty but then sprinkle in an intervention or a story mission seemingly right as I was about to feel repetitive. I liked the upgrades system and staff system decently, even if I wished that the staff had just a hint more life to them (maybe a convo between nearby staff every once in a while or something they comment on to you in passing? Idk) and almost always felt like I was at the correct difficulty in regards to money and getting equipment. Also the fact that if you accidentally went in debt it would give you to the next day's maintenence to fix it felt very nice. I felt like story missions/decisions didn't really need to be any more complex than they were and always clearly telegraphed what side you were picking with each decision, but I never felt like I knew enough about either the govt or the blood fist to really be compelled to pick a side beyond ""Communism is bad m'kay?"" or ""Those are criminals and you should be loyal"" but there was also a good amount of world building through the news/regulations system that I did at least feel like things were happening in the world (even if they were just a little quick to come and go)

Great game that I got some 20 hours out of on my first try with a decent enough amount of replayability that I'd be willing to try siding with the other side to see how the story differs. Solid 8/10. Not a masterpiece but a good game.",1679444404,1679444404,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

You have no idea what you're doing. Things aren't intuitive.

I would like to recommend an endless mode as well as for the game to add female drivers that can have their own quirks into smuggling items over, like having handbag, fake being pregnant. Kinda have the same as papers please where the husband enters with a valid passport whilst hers is fake and so on. Plus it would cool to also customise your border. Not only just upgrade a house, but also fix and paint the entering signs. Its really a good and fun game just needs these add-ons and it will be the cherry on the cake. Maybe  low odds for people to do weird stuff too ect. Pull out a gun when getting caught with drugs. Maybe randomly in the morning thugs robbing the border patrol for its contraband or a prisoner just to add more spice to the game instead of the same old stale night thugs ambushing you. Or even when someone gets caught that they would also even try to escape by foot ect some weird stuff to make each encounter feel unique and fun instead seeing the same old reaction and it becoming stale and boring.

i didnt bother to stick around for the cutscene, you cant have a freeform simulator game like this and have hard scripted events. espeically if the player has the foresight to buy ammo with all the surplus money. then again if the devs really wanted to implent shit like driving and shooting you should actually invest in these areas and make them an enjoyable part of the game instead of means to an end

I like the car models and that you can access them to search for stuff easily, I like the border checks most in the game, the other part is a bonus but it should be just checking people at the border. A nice feature would be using a Russian old analog 35mm camera to document stuff for the KGB or something, just for fun those cameras where pretty common in USSR and should be in any ""soviet era"" game. 

A knife that wont break would also be very nice, maybe with a grind stone or something the player could service it. I also dont understand why a shovel or crowbar would break that easily doing what the tool was meant to do in the first place. Yeah maybe it makes sense in the mission part of the game but should be not in a sandbox mode if added later.

The game engine is nice now Devs should add an endless mode, sandbox mode or any DLCs to build on that. 
Maybe also different border locations (Bulgaria, China, Siberia with lots of cold related issues) with DLCs and or different themes like the 80s west or the covid years etc.

This game is wicked good fun, the searching mechanic is fun and by the end of your playthrough there's a huge number of details you'll need to be considering if you want to get perfect scores.

There are two main storylines you can choose to follow, the open world has collectibles and secrets to find and the game has a fairly robust upgrade system where you can use your hard earned Acaristani dollars to upgrade your own statistics of those of your subordinates.

A recent patch did address the rate at which you get ambushed while outside of the checkpoint which was a pleasant change - in 1.0 it felt impossible to drive anywhere without getting shot at constantly, and most of the guns and all of the vehicles do feel satisfying to use

The open world does feel a little wasted at times in that there are a few points of interest however you don't generally have a reason to visit these outside of a few quests, and most of your time spent driving will be between your checkpoint and one of two other locations.

The game as a whole has an excellent sense of pacing, and will always seem to know when to offer a new combat encounter or event to keep things fresh as soon as the car checking and ferrying of prisoners and contraband starts to get stale.

There is music on the car radio, however this is limited to two songs. Would have been nice to have had some more variety on the radio given how much of your playthrough will be spent driving around outside of the checkpoint.

All in all a real hit in my opinion, absolutely a sleeper title in 2023 and well worth your time if you're prepared to pay for a game that's flawed but fun and interesting.",1679401286,1679401286,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I just wish the game was longer, if there's potential for DLC and enough interest please make some! Heck, if it needed a kickstarter I'd even donate. I like how the game gives the option to be a law abider or a filthy rebel, especially the financial implications of the choices too. 

One negative thing I will say though is the ending is a bit weird. It's not bad or anything, it's just anticlimactic, you can't sense the game will end and boom it's over.

The shooting sections that are sprinkled in are as generic as can be.

If you liked Papers Please I think you might like Contraband Police. I think this game had some love put into it by the developers and I really did enjoy playing it. That being said I have a few points of feedback.

The lack of explanation on ""Cargo"" types was tricky when regulations were increased.
Its hard to tell if side missions are important or not.
Putting the ""Youre free to go"" and ""Transfer to X"" buttons next to each other made a misclick easy with no verification for release of prisioners.
The repetition from the ""Manger? Leader? Boss?"" of the check point when finding contraband or waking up.
Why am I the only one doing all the work at this checkpoint? Mikel helps load cargo but never unload, everyone else just stands around until we are attacked.
The story was okay, felt lost at times, especially the ending I dont remember alot of these names at this point.
Driving in and out of the labor camp was annoying, need those laborers to widen the entrance.
No women or passengers pass through the checkpoint? I get that its a strict county but even in the soviet era women were had equal rights to men so not sure why I never saw one only heard them, bit of a sausage fest.
The game ended and my save is just over? gone? my money? my work? I cant keep playing on it I have to start a new game?

The tasks you're required to do is not busy work nor fetch quests but rather you play the role of a detective, a defender and an auditor all at the same time. The detail involved for you to inspect areas of vehicles was really good, however, could be improved but considering this was released 12 days from this review, i can't complain. No complaints on the gun play honestly I enjoyed it. The driving can be a bit tedious at times since most times the places you need to go to are far from each other but the starter vehicle isn't half bad. However, I found that trading with the newcomers of the border to be pretty useless and quite unrealistic? (idk if IRL border officers trade items whilst on active duty with new comers only to arrest them for smuggling 5 seconds later xD). I managed to unlock and max out all weapons, vehicles, commodities and personnel without ever having to trade with any newcomer nor personally deliver the prisoners to the labor camp or contraband to the station. I always called vlad and prison transport to the border. Another thing that bothered me was the incoming Main quest calls and give you a timer to answer the phone calls forcing you to interrupt inspection, I think they should wait till all the cars are done clearance and then a phone call can happen cuz even then, I doubt a border control stops operating out of no where because an officer got a phone call about a murder that happened at a restaurant LOL. Also, the money you get to stop driving and eliminate the gang members shooting you isn't worth it AT All as you only get  $70 across all stages of the game. you can only buy 1 AK Mag with that. But I do very much believe the pros outweigh the cons by a mile. I think the price is somewhat justified if it continues to get updates and bug fixes and hopefully maybe a DLC expansion?

The game gives you a lackluster story that has zero weight because there is no real dialogue besides that, 
the decisions you make at the checkpoint are meaningless ultimately, 
everyone uses the same voice lines with very little variation, 
the dialogue has none of the quality like Papers Please which further makes every interaction boring,
you can't talk to anyone at the police camp, 
the open world is large but completely empty as there is no one to talk to (besides in the side quests, but that's not an excuse), 
the game is so easy it hurts as there is no time limit: so no consequences (even if there was one it would still be shit),

Completed the rebel playthrough, took about 12,5 hours.

One bad thing I've started getting annoyed by, you can't skip cutscenes and you can't skip the tutorial. And, despite the tutorial not saying so, doing things in the wrong order will make you stuck and not be able to progress forward.

And for the love of all things holy, stop disabling functions, let me get out of the car! Let me start it, let me live with the consequences of my choices. And let me skip cutscenes!

I also think contraband should be in random cars and not only in those that have been flagged in advance. This would really force you to check every car to make sure nothing is hidden there. It's similar to real life when anyone can really be smuggling something and not only those that you've gotten advance notice of. I also think if you found contraband outside the vehicle and the driver was still inside, maybe at random times he would try to run away upon seeing you found illegal stuff? So you'd have to ask him to step out to prevent this from happening but even then at random times the person would get back inside his vehicle and run away. I know there are random people running away atm but it should be expanded further.  Maybe you also should be able to search the person for possible contraband? Upon searching you could find other lethal items like guns or knifes? Maybe sometimes they'd attack you with a knife or gun too to make it more interesting?


I think we should also be able to sell weapons and ammo at Vlad's store. I was able to collect so much shotgun ammo from all these ambushes that I really wish I could've sold it somewhere but it would only allow me to drop them. Overall it's pretty good game but it really needs more content and more importantly the endless mode. Once endless mode is in place, add more stuff to different places that you can visit off duty.",1679229298,1679229298,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It's a tough job, but somebody's got to do it!

But let's face it, with all the criminal activity these days, it's starting to feel like Acaristan is the only country left on Earth with any law and order. It's a good thing we have brave heroes like us customs comissioners to protect our borders and keep us safe from harm.

And speaking of harm, it's just tragic-comic that the government of Acaristan has started to see even the game ""Contraband Police"" as a threat to national security. I mean, come on - it's just a game, right? But I guess they're worried that we'll all become so addicted to it that we'll start smuggling contraband in real life!

But never fear, because us customs comissioners are here to save the day. We already confiscated 100.000 illegal copies of the game, just like a true customs commissioner should. And when those lonely nights at the border post start to get too much to bear, we can always sneak in a little game time on the old computer in the customs barrack. It's like you're living out your own little episode of Contraband Police in real life!

And let's not forget about those hardware donations - because hey, if someone's going to sneak into Acaristan, they might as well bring a little something to make our gaming experience a bit smoother, right?

Pro -
- Whilst simple, it is easy to become complacent which in turn forces you to focus to get it right; and for me that's a great thing. So many games become to easier and than boring, whilst this will penalise you when you forget or overlook something in the inspections.
- I enjoy the ability to customise the base and than balance that against your income. You need to think, will this improvement be worth the cost of purchase and on-going costs to run. 
- I find comedy in the general interactions between my character and all the entrants or smugglers. 
- Their are good elements for morals/ethics decisions at play; do you accept a bribe to allow a man entry to save his family or enforce the law(s). The letters you receive later in the game give indications to how that worked out for those individuals.
- I like managing/deciding on whether I take the arrested to the camp, go buy supplies or hand in my contraband after full-filling my duties at the post.

Neg -
- There is much interaction between you and your hired help, additional dialogue or purpose to them would be good; other than that they help you repel attacks.
- Driving can be a bit clunky and whilst using your sirens whilst driving can occasionally cause accidents that hinder you, where you might fail in your task. Although it has made me laugh each time it has happened.  

Possible growth - 
- It would be interesting to see if in the future that their is a barracks for the guards, not just separate upgrades for them; but something that required both. Eg, Barracks level 1 allows for the additional recruitment, whilst level 2 would allow promotion of the guards themselves. The barracks might improve their health and give a fortified position to repel attacks, whilst the individual promotions gives the better gear.  
- Same as above, but improved cosmetics, better upgrades to the yard, no on-going costs, just up-front costs for fencing look, inspection areas etc.
- The upgrades are dependent on your promotion/rank.

Overall, its just fun and I look forward to how far I make it in the game.",1679188297,1679188297,True,1,0,0.501915693283081055,0,True,False,False

Original Review:

I love this game, but yet also hate it at the same time. I had a hard time deciding whether to give this a thumbs up or not, so I'm sure I will change my review in the future if there are any changes made to the game.

Pros:
I love the way the game plays as border patrol and the ongoing storyline with the country and tough decisions you have to make. Inspecting the vehicles while keeping certain regulations and wanted subjects in mind kept me wanting to play the game more and more. Some combat in this game does make sense. The game also seems very polished, and I rarely run into any bugs at all.

Cons (for me):
The ambushes & difficulty of the combat system is what made me give up playing this game. I am at a point in the story where I have to take a call that requires taking on a lot of enemies by yourself, or else you can't move on with the gameplay. I'm personally not very good at FPS games, and wasn't expecting so much of it out of this game. I understand some people enjoy games like that, but I would personally love to have a setting we can adjust for game difficulty. Maybe even the ability to turn off combat all together or at least minimize it significantly for those that want a bit more of a relaxed experience.

I know there will be updates in the future, and if the ability to change difficulty mode is included with that, I will definitely be changing my review.",1679067162,1679171710,True,0,0,0.482014387845993042,0,True,False,False

A bit more depth would go a long way however, for example adding more upgrades (A better gate that stops smugglers from demolishing yours every time for example), more points of entry for attacks from the rebels (Having them attack you from the same choke point makes it a bit redundant after a while).

Also adding more checkpoints that the player can automate and manage remotely, with different commanders reporting to you would be great. This will allow you to assist a checkpoint that comes under attack from the rebels (Or perhaps even a foreign army).

So why I don't recommend it;

[h2]Time Management:[/h2]
While this isn't\wouldn't be an issue in and off itself, plenty of games have time management as an important gameplay mechanic, this game however does not. Time Management feels like it was put into the game, because Papers please had it. Currently, it serves to limit you from doing ""too much"" in a single day, while simultaniously expecting you to do ""everything"" in a single day.

Every few days you get further restrictions and complexity to the inspections (this is good, not a bad thing), that serves to take away your time more and more (inherently not necessarily a bad thing). Then, once you've finished the (increasingly complex) inspections, you have to transfer prisoners (with little\no time left), give contraband away, purchase new tools to find contrabands with, and\or get ammo.


[h2]Ambushes\Combat:[/h2]
It is far too frequent. It devalues the experience, ontop of serving as an infinite ammo-glitch (as you get more pistol ammo than you know what to do with). 

[h2]Missions:[/h2]
There's essentially 3 types. Story missions (unskippable), Side-phone missions (5 minutes to answer, then 5 minutes to do it), Side-mission events (F2 to answer, have about 1-2 minutes to press F2 or you lose it, so better not be doing anything else after an inspection! Like a prisoner transfer, or you'll lose out on cash!).

Time-limits, and\or the missions\events themselves are fine. The issue comes in how everything relies on ""do it within this time-limit, within this time-limit!"", while constantly drowning you in increasing amount of stuff.


[h2]Example of why these points are an issue[/h2]

A standard (later\mid-game) day:  You do a couple of inspections, double and tripple checking the paperwork (3+ different ones that has to be cross-checked, + the cargo lists). Maybe you even arrest a smuggler. Then you get a phone-call (5 min to answer, 5 min to do the mission, have to drop everything else), so you run up and do this. On the way you get an ambush that destroys all 4 wheels of your car (which bugs out the physics a bit and you now barely can drive forward). You do the mission, then try to get back. By the time you're back, it's late afternoon with another couple cars or so to go through. By the time you've gone through, your prison is full, your inventory is full of contraband, so you then starts to unload.

On the way to the prison camp, you get an ambush, totalling the car all over again (as you repaired it when you got back), wether you drive through or kill them make no difference to car totalling (except you'll recoup the repair cost if you kill them).

You get to the camp, unload prisoners, then drive towards the base. It's now the next day, and you also get another ambush. Then after this ambush, you unload the contraband, decide you need more tools (as you're out of tools for searches), drive over to vlad, get the tools, and on your way back, another ambush.



It's not difficult, it's not hard. It's just unenjoyable and serves no real purpose other than to drag out your time keeping you from the core loop of the game (inspections).  Doubly so as Ambushes give you the money to repair the car (once you get back), and recoup more than the ammo you spend (I use about 2-3 pistol magazines an ambush, and get about 6 back).

[h2]Conclusion:[/h2]
Overall, I really enjoy the game. The core gameplay loop is great, and I definitely suggest getting the game, when\if these things gets addressed. As currently, these things just soils the experience (increasingly so).


The changes introduced by Week 2 patch is welcomed and can be used as a band-aid, but I don't feel it addresses the real issues pointed out in my review, and so I still can't recommend it in it's current state. Hopefully the 3rd or 4th week patch (assuming we get that) addresses this, and I can change this from a not recommended, to a recommended review, as I think it's a great game overall.",1679061583,1679090896,False,60,4,0.679089903831481934,3,True,False,False

This game should focus solely on the checkpoint. Why do I hire all these staff and I have to drive everywhere myself and chase everyone myself?
I think: focus on the checkpoint. Add women and children to these cars. Add several men to each car. Every car has only 1 guy. If there are more you have to manage them, where they stand, handcuff them to detain while searching, etc. Here I find cocaine and the guy is standing there like no big deal. Cmon. 
We should have to see the markings for contraband but before grabbing it, make believe we don't see it and detain first. Call child services for the kids. Release cars to wives. Call towtrucks instead of just telling that guy (who sounds like a minion by the way) to clear it out. Such a missed opportunity. They tried to do too many things making all of it bland and boring rather than focus on the good part, the actual checkpoint, and really going with it.
Make all of those variety's, make it unlimited, just throw new rules every few days, I'll play it for 1000 hours. But the way it is? I think 9 hours is my max. 
I'll check back in a year to see if any of this is implemented, but as it stands now, I can't recommend. Unfortunate.",1679084068,1679084068,False,9,0,0.583996355533599854,0,True,False,False

-------------------------------------------
The advertising for this game belies it's lack of content and polish. It's more gimmick than game.
Don't pay any more than £5 for this.
This is more of a basic wave shooter than it is a papers please-like.
I appreciate the effort of the story but it's presented so badly; I tried more than once to wait out the telephone calls. 
I'm introduced to the idea that I'm a checkpoint police, let me just play that without the ridiculously tedious wave-attacks, constant ambushes and awful on-rails story missions. 

Sure you'll check some papers, but that becomes the background task that you have to give up in order to do other rubbish, and you'll do it alone. Even with a full stack of checkpoint police, and all upgrades you'll never actually be assisted with a vehicle check. Even in a shootout it becomes clear they don't actually target the enemy but shoot at a specific spot that the enemy are programmed to run through or stop in.
This needed to be a company-development game where you earn enough to be able to delegate some tasks to employees. Instead you're surrounded by husks that you cannot interact with.

It's like you'll be standing there verifying wannabe citizens' documents all day with your dick in your hand, but you HAVE to be careful because you can't trust a single one of these jackasses. They are unpredictable and they will get you killed doing some dumb shit if you give em half a chance. And it's the clean looking guys you never expect that will fuck you the hardest. Because 90% of the time, the clean shaven guy in a family SUV isn't smuggling AKs in his trunk and cocaine in the tires. Or is he? You just never know. 

I spend extra time inside every one of their vehicles, even if I have no reason to suspect them, because they are all lying pieces of shit. I was doing a routine inspection and this guy comes through the first gate and he's acting like he's my best friend. I ask him respectfully to step outside the vehicle, of course he's like ""no problem commander."" I open the tailgate to his truck to make sure he's got the 2 washing machines and 4 goats the ledger says he has. This dickhead motherfucker hops in the truck and drives off through the gate. Usually they just blow past it without stopping, whatever. I sense your urgency. 

But this guy, this guy thinks ""oh, the border guy is a dumbass, he'll never look behind the obviously fake washing machine"" (do people from Al'barakh even wash clothes), he talks to me like we're besties, then he runs like a pussy when my obviously excellent visual acuity catches him red handed. After the chase was over and he was in my cruiser, he started saying shit like ""oooh my girlfriend is gonna be pissed when she finds out I got nabbed."" lmao guy you are never leaving the labor camp. I have literally never seen someone come out of there, and I drop off a LOT of people. On the way there he ended up catching a bullet (not sure who fired it) from an ambush in the woods. I took cover behind the cruiser and under heavy fire I was able to pop all the attackers with headshots from my trusty Makarov. 

But it's people like that that made me into the skeptic I am today. ""I'm not hiding anything."" That's what they all say. No one gets a free lunch but I will personally see to it that every illegal immigrant gets a fair shake. The fair shake of my fist. Sometimes when people are impolite to me I pull my gun out and shoot near their feet, shouting ""dance, monkey, dance!""

This game looks pretty good too. I'll update the review when I have time to try it out.",1679024500,1679026913,True,1,1,0.525862038135528564,0,True,False,False

It has a lot of things similar to Papers Please in the aspect of checking their passports (making sure name, face, and id matches) but when you get further into the game it gets better and better. In Papers Please you'd have people run through the station and bomb it and you had nothing you could do, now if someone speeds through the stop you can run to your car and pit maneuver them off the road, check their car for contraband, arrest them, etc. There's fun little side tasks like murder mysteries, raiding a hotel, or secretly following someone to their house. I think this game has so much potential from what the base game is, you can see all of the passion and care that went into the game down to specific things like how you can flick switches in the car instead of just pressing buttons on your keyboard. There's so much empty space on the map between locations which is perfect if the developers want to make a DLC, maybe add more character interactions, possibly chat options to change how they respond. All in all, I love this game and the people who spent the time into making a game out of passion instead of money. I am so excited to see what happens in the future with this game. My only criticism would be that there's no English dub, I can read subtitles fine but I'll get so focused on reading the info for typos that I cant focus on the dialogue.",1679025678,1679025678,True,1,0,0.506329119205474854,0,True,False,False

Pros:
- The inspection part of the game is really fleshed out and a lot of fun. It seems like it would get repetitive but hasn’t for me at all.
- There’s surprisingly a lot of story in the game, with missions outside of just inspection that change up the gameplay.
- I have been playing this solely on Steam Deck and other than a little bit of lag when driving, it runs great! (You’ll probably have to change up the controls, though)

Cons:
- I’m not a huge fan of the driving or shooting. Both feel unsatisfying and floaty to me, but I think they could be great with work.
- This seems to be common of a lot of simulator games, but why are there no women at all? I can understand maybe not in the actual police force, but it’s hard to believe women would never need to cross the border.

Other than the small cons, I am really enjoying the game so far and already know I will be doing more than one play through to see the other options.",1679022671,1679022671,True,2,0,0.527533054351806641,1,True,False,False
756800,134787153,76561197995990465,3356,38,1161,0,1161,1679015241,"[b]Have you ever felt like destroying someone’s car but never acted on it because, you know, laws and stuff? If so, hoo boy do I have good news for YOU![/b] Contraband police not only allows you to slash tires, rip seats and destroy cargo, but it actually demands you do so to obey the law! I mean yes I’m oversimplifying the game and its appeal but I feel I deserve a pass for being excited about legally wrecking stuff. Why are you saying I should find a therapist?

I might be joking but the game really does allow you to do all that I mentioned, and a lot more. [b]I’ve seen Contraband Police being described as a 3d Papers, Please[/b], and honestly, the titles do have similarities. In this one, you play as the leading officer in a border post. Your role is to allow, or not allow, vehicles into your country of Acaristan. Sounds simple enough, right? Well… it isn’t. Throughout [b]the game’s 11 or so hours[/b], the task gets progressively harder as you get more and more things to pay attention to.

[b]You’ll basically have, in your job, a list of things that you need to check to ensure that you can let them into the country.[/b] You need to check if their names are spelt correctly in all their documents, if their picture matches their face, if their documents are expired, amongst many other requirements you gradually unlock as you play. Furthermore, with each chapter you get some external government orders to take into account. One, for example, has you checking each person’s nationality and denying anyone under 30 years old from a certain country, regardless of whether or not all their other documents are correct. 

[b]You can also find smugglers trying to cross the border when you’re inspecting cars - this is where legally destroying a vehicle comes into play. It’s a super cool system![/b] You basically get tips on the right side of your board of instructions that tell you characteristics to watch for in cars that are coming in. If any meet the criteria laid upon one of the papers, you pull out your UV light and start inspecting the car. If it’s a smuggler’s car, you can find little snake icons in certain parts of the vehicle, which indicate to you that there’s something hidden there. All you have to do is then tear that bit up with tools like axes, knives and crowbars and bam, contraband is found. You can then arrest the driver and keep him in jail until you’re ready to transport him. The contraband should be dealt with by giving it to your superiors. Because you’re all honest cops. Right? Guys?

[b]It may sound a lot to keep track of, but honestly, you get used to it pretty fast.[/b] To help you check some of the trickier things, such as a person’s age (which you have to do by calculating via their date of birth and current date), you have a perception meter that allows you to automatically compare two fields and give you the answer of whether or not there is a irregularity at play. It even marks it in your file for you if there is! [b]Your job then is to check all these things and mark on a checklist every irregularity you can find on a person or their vehicle, and then ultimately deny or allow them access to the country.[/b]

Honestly, if being super thorough bores you, [b]all that really matters is choosing the right option and putting at least one correct reason down in case of a refusal.[/b] You get money from each vehicle you correctly handle, but all that the extra time inspecting the vehicle and documents to find all flaws does is give you more money. And while money does help, as you can get upgrades to help you defend your post, gain more perception, increase the size of your jail, amongst others, I had everything I could possibly buy by chapter 5 out of 7, so the money is really not a major issue. You can game over from running out of money, but it’s hard for that to happen. In fact, it’s hard for anything bad to happen, as [b]this game felt very easy to play through.[/b] The battles were easy, I had upgrades maxed out by chapter 5, etc.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2947904618

So how do you get money aside from inspecting cars, you ask? Well, remember those prisoners and contraband you intercept? They’re a major source of income! See, inspecting vehicles is maybe 60% of the game. [b]Your time is not entirely spent on your post, no. You can take a car and go explore the map, with plenty of locations to see and secrets to find.[/b] One of these locations is a labor camp in which you drop off prisoners for cash. Another is the police base in which you hand in contraband, again for cash. Then we have a shop in which we can buy tools and guns, and the rest are just random locations with no functionality aside from serving as mission spots.

And yes, I did say missions. This is the third major source of income. [b]Every once in a while, you’ll get intervention missions, which are simple assignments you can deny if you want, or story missions. These are the big ones.[/b] There’s one of them per chapter, and you basically get a time limit to accept a mission and get to your objective - usually one of those random locations I just mentioned. These often involve several steps, ending with a choice between two options which influence the end of your game, and the future of Acaristan itself. I’ll be honest: I was really pleased with the mission variety. [b]These were very different from each other, often involving some light investigation moments that I really appreciated.[/b] My favorite was literally a murder mystery, in which you had to find the culprit amongst six suspects.

But while the mission variety is strong, [b]I have to say that the story itself felt very lackluster to me, unfortunately.[/b] The story missions didn’t really relate to the world events that changed how you dealt with cars in each chapter, so it almost made no sense for the game to be divided by chapters. Furthermore, the ending came completely out of the blue for me. Aside from the morality choices at the end, the missions all felt disconnected from each other, and the ending was no different. I genuinely was wondering if it was the end or not until the credits rolled because while I was attacking a pretty massive location, there was no build up for it being the end.

By now, you might have noticed that I used the term “attack”. [b]Yes, the game is a first person shooter, and it does involve shooting a bunch of people at times.[/b] Your post may be attacked, your car may be ambushed, or you may encounter dozens of enemies in your missions. Whatever the case, you must always be prepared for a gunfight, so remember to carry a weapon and plenty of ammo with you at all times! [b]The shooting itself, along with the driving, is… acceptable. But if you’re just looking to inspect cars for mistakes, these will make you feel annoyed at the game.[/b] Also, glitches. I ran into one crash at some point, but luckily, the game autosaves after every time you sleep.

Overall, Contraband Police is a lot of fun, and there’s a demo called Contraband Police: Prologue if you want to check if it’ll be a lot of fun for you too. I had a good time with the game, but be warned that Papers, Please, this is not. It adds quite a bit of things, including a whole dimension, but it also lacks the emotional gut punch that Lucas Pope’s game gave us. I can see people who never managed to get into Papers please enjoying this more hands on experience of inspecting documents and vehicles, alongside the extra elements like shooting, but I can also see fans of Papers, Please not enjoying this as much. Regardless, if you do pick this up, I hope you enjoy it!

You know, people were really wondering what a 3D version of Papers Please would look like, and this is a very great example of it. At first, I thought that the checkpoint was the entire map until I had to get in my police car and drive around to buy necessities.
Papers-checking is absolutely awesome. I can't imagine a better version of it.
Contraband checking is also very interesting and complex.
Other mechanics like upgrading, cargo checking & packing, and imprisoning are still quite good, but I am only negative about 3 aspects:
Vehicle driving - the controls are so odd like if i turn a little too left or right, I feel like I'm gonna crash.
Weapon mechanics - aiming is kind of weird, the fact that you have to shoot multiple times in the body (except the head) sounds ridiculous to me.
Ambushes - the idea is interesting but I don't like the fact that it happens way too often, based on the ingame country population.

Overall this game is worth all my 10 bucks and I give it a solid 8/10.

Comparison with ""Papers Please"":
 
 It does need to be said, this game and PP does share a very similar setting and job. Inspecting paperwork, looking for contraband, and allowing in those that pass the requirements. I will try not to state how I feel about each difference as opinionated answers may not reflect each individuals wants.

Time: In PP, each day lasted a specific amount of time which forced the player to accurately and quickly determine the validity of each entry. In CBP, I do not believe that there is a time limit, with more focus upon smaller details. As the world is 3D, and having to document errors with each vehicle a time limit may or may not frustrate players. 

Game Play Loop: In PP, the game play loop was go to work, perform duties, start the next day with small cut scenes that would occur at set times. In CBP there are additional activities that will spring up such as story missions, immediate alternate missions, base invasions, and free roam to explore the area under the government's control. Money also feels different in both games. In PP, money was generally a hard consumable to obtain on first play through and that is the lifeline between your families life or not. In CBP, as long as you are adequate at your job money will not be an object, with additional ways to earn money. Due to having money not being a true driving force, I just bought everything relatively quickly.   

Story: Although the story is certainly serviceable, and allows the player a branching system to stay true to the government or work with a rebel force to overthrow it, PP does it in a much more streamlined fashion. The rebels in CBP seem just rather inept, potentially because every couple of nights as you defend the base your team will kill dozens of them without a casualty. 

Music: Music was nice. Some of the music cues while working were rather relaxing. 

Graphics: I had no issues running above 60 fps. 

The bad: The main complaint I have is near the end of the game. The idea of this style of game is to start rather simple, and expand the demands of the player. At the beginning, you are asked to verify names, passport numbers, and expiration dates are valid. The end is demands much more, but without a time limit this really did not bother me. What did bother me was when forgeries become a possibility, and I could not get a good example of comparing the paper that was forged vs an authentic one. The only solution is to use the games compare system, where you click the item in question and compare it to what is in the book. No other time was this a requirement for any other system.

Side complaint is interaction with the other characters. You will not find a Jorji here, you will not get a compelling story of reuniting lovers and trying to save the guards life so his wife does not immediately become a widow. You get put in some situations where people will plead about there circumstances, but the writing does not make me care about pointing out their documentation flaws and sending them back into the wild. 

Side complaint two. At times your base will be attacked by a waves and waves of rebels. After the first one, this becomes a chore to content with as no matter how quickly and efficiently you kill enemies, it is timed for up to four minutes. There are multiple ways to exploit this mechanic, and as much as I think the developers wanted to capture the players attention it really just got boring. It is weird to say the game where you make sure Bob is in fact Bob and he can enter your country offers a massive shooting section, but it is just boring to me. 

Final: A play through with one path was around 11 hours. Is it good? Yeah, I think it is. 7/10.

Fun game if youre looking for another Papers Please. I play PP Endless mode for fun and this game definitely scratched that itch. The game on its own is very interesting in the 3D world, there's some combat and driving which is a nice touch. There's a lot of different things you have to check and I find that the fun part. Sometimes I wish I could just sit and check cars all day, but it'll eventually force you into the story.

This game is more like a First-Person Story driven game more than anything. [spoiler] The story itself is very basic & the cast of characters are kinda forgettable. [/spoiler]

It would be awesome if at the highest level, the border checkpoint was a reinforced concrete monolith with multiple guards, towers, spot lights, k-9's, etc. This could allow for enemy upgrades as well, such as having to deal with multiple passengers, who might wait before you begin searching for and/or finding contraband to try running or attacking you. Another enemy enhancement could be booby traps, or bombs (ala the k-9's as a way to stay one step ahead). Granted, I know that it took multiple years worth of effort to produce what they have so far.

The biggest difference being Contraband Police has a small open world that has you drive around to deliver all the criminals and contraband you’ve captured, plus they encourage exploration by having hidden collectibles which gives you a fair amount of money

Just like Papers Please, Contraband Police has a story where you choose the fate of entrants, but the ending seems mostly affected by accepting calls for missions and regular police work, and the choices you make at the end of those missions.

The main gameplay adds something to what Papers Please offers: vehicle inspections. Besides document checks (which I personally think Papers Please did a bit better), you also check cargo and vehicle condition and if a smuggler is suspected, you can tear their vehicle apart with your melee weapons to find contraband and make an arrest. Your inspections are evaluated by every single detail of the entrant and vehicle, even if they are supposed to be denied of entry

Another big part of the game is shooting and driving mechanics. Papers Please had limited shooting, but Contraband Police introduces ambushes and shootouts, which you can fend off with a variety of weapons. Sometimes an entrant may smash through the gates which then enters a chase sequence. You can even drive their vehicle once you arrest them!

As for money management, Papers Please has a limited amount of things you spend money on, but in Contraband Police, you can spend your earnings to upgrade the border post, vehicles, hire guards, and buying weapons from the tool shop. Melee durability is kind of pathetic though, even if you have the most expensive tool. But if you make perfect inspection and participate in outside missions, money won’t be an issue

Fantastic game. It's everything it claims to be, it's a simulator game where you work as a captain at a border post in a 1981 Communist country. It has choices to side between factions (the people vs government) but ultimately is just a very fun, day by day Border patrol simulator. The game also has way better gunplay than it needs. It surprises me how fun the shooting is in a game that would be fun with no combat at all. The meat and potatoes of the game comes down to the vehicle inspections. Building up your post, upgrading your team and their equipment, and finding drugs or weapons by cutting open a car seat is consistently fun and engaging. Additionally there is a storyline going on, random events like gangs ambushing your base or a car driving right through with no inspection, and random in the village policing scenarios. I made an initial review very frustrated by a mechanic... the developer responded immediately and has worked on it. Even with this issue it was still fantastic, the developer response, and immediate fix to an already great game... Buy this.

Now that I helped the party defeat its enemies I can write a few words.

This game is amazing! Papers Please already set the tone for this kind of sim games but Contraband takes it a step further and brings some action in it. Yes the driving isn't the best around. Yes the shooting and the enemy AI are pretty standard but it is freakin fun to try to catch a runner and be attacked on the way back after catching him. Aren't there things to better like the economy or the difficulty level? Yes there are.

I replayed papers please right before buying this, to see if it would hold a candle to it, and I have to say, it's a near perfect spiritual sequel. It does have some annoying problems, but the pros outweigh the cons ten times over.

You run a checkpoint, much like in papers please, but you get a ton more interactivity. Finding contraband in PP is a pretty quick and easy process, but figuring out someone is smuggling alcohol inside their seats and then getting to tear them out with your knife is SO satisfying. I absolutely love the core gameplay.

I'll talk about the few cons I have, because the developers seem pretty receptive to feedback, and because I think they're worth mentioning, but keep in mind that although I might sound harsh, my list of pros is ""pretty much everything else""

The cons:
There are collectibles, which give a decent amount of money, so they're great to find, especially early on. There are some that are common sense to find, funny ones, like the one hidden in the bathroom right next to your house, and then ones that are absolutely impossible to find without a guide. Driving can be really slow, especially in the beginning (when you'd be looking for the collectibles), and these files and buried chest can be in absolutely random spots that the game will never take you near without you exploring there for yourself. If you'd like to randomly scour across an almost completely empty open world, be my guest, but otherwise I'd ignore them or use a guide. Some off these hiding spots are actually f*cked and I NEVER would have found them in a million years.

The clunky driving from Thief Simulator is back, and it is in rare form. This can be annoying in its own way while you get used to it, (or re-get used to it if you love Thief Simulator like I do), but there are two major problems

1. There are car chases. The way the trees and roads are designed, it is absolutely impossible to offroad and try to cut someone off, so you're stuck driving behind them and slowly gaining on them unless you invest thousands of dollars into buying and upgrading the fast car.

2. You can put a siren on, which is great and convenient because most people will get out of your way, except for the walking people in the police station who have absolutely no issue with walking right in front of your car. You really never drive without the siren on, it's just so useful. Except some drivers bug out and seem magnetically attracted to your car. I swear, some of these drivers are paid off by the rebels, they seem legitimately out for your blood. If you get caught in a random encounter, bullets do a ton of damage to your car, so any car crash can be fatal. I remember one time, I was very far from the checkpoint, and some guy tboned me, kept going, and pushed me directly into a tree. My car exploded, killing him and stranding me all the way across the map. I'm now out $250 for the car, $500 for a ""fatal accident"" and have to either spend the next 5-10 minutes holding shift and w, or reload a save and start the WHOLE day over. It really sucked.

However, if you can deal with that and minor bugs, like things phasing into each other, and the car radio audio doubling and turning into a very unpleasant listening experience, this is a wonderful game with a lot to love in it. I can definitely see myself putting 100 hours into it. It's genuinely so much fun.

Surprisingly, the gun fights, although pretty simplistic, is pretty satisfying! (Hot tip, upgrade your house early on, it upgrades your max health, which is a must have). In Papers Please, there was a beauty in its simplicity, but in Contraband Police, there is so much more depth that I found really rewarding and enjoyable.

In my opinion, a must buy for anyone who enjoyed Papers Please. 8/10",1678830574,1678830574,True,2,0,0.541284441947937012,0,True,False,False

I have not find anything I would describe as cons, so here are just few mehs:
- it is produced by PlayWay so expect it to look like a PlayWay game
- the driving and shooting is kind of a wierd but it works just fine
- the border station management is basic but satisfying

Now the pros:
- the border control part of the game is just GREAT. There is everything you know from Papers, please! and more. It is not just about checking the paperwork. You have to keep on mind event restrictions. For example, there are Olympic games and cars with more than 3 defects cannot enter the country. Every 5 or so days there is a new event. You are also given few clues about smugglers. Some of the contrabanf is hidden really well.
- there is a decent story with two possible endings. I have not finished the game yet but I will definetly play it again for second ending.

Pros:
-Game is fun, the inspection sequences are not that challenging if you pay attention but don't get too cocky 'cause you might miss some details.
-The idea of the story overall is thought out nicely.  
-The city is nice and beautiful
-The information board is a good idea!

Cons:
-Enemies bodies and death animations look like they come from a Android game.
-Guns are the same
-Driving is slow and unsafe between the country roads
-When you wanna get out of a car during third person view you have to change it to first person just to do it. 
-The guy helping you with the cleaning and getting back the merchandise that you got to inspect turns around everytime you talk to him and requires a fade to black to make it work. Wish it could be fluid and you would see him clean up the place.
-The map always get in the middle of the screen when you're driving. Just make a minimap please.

Game is great, Story isn't hard to follow and has a few events that happen to spice up the gameplay.
the choice system is basic but doesn't make you just choose one side every single time.

Upgrading is also basic but enough to fulfil this size of a game.
combat is actually fun as the NPC's go for cover but also charge when in greater numbers

driving is pretty horrific and considering you will do quite alot of it.

the game can get repetitive and I don't think there was enough changes for the border checks to make the gameplay consistently fresh

I would happily buy this game at the price it is at, If it goes on sale I would 100% buy it.

Its easy to start overlooking small things in the late game, and worth being meticulous about your checklist.

There's only 2 downsides to this game. The first, is there is no variation to the day. An example: The first car that approaches is good, has everything is a perfect entrant. Second car, whoops, turns out his papers were garbage and you messed up and sent him through. You restart the day, The two cars you did are exactly the same. It makes it easier the second time you mess up.

The second isnt really a downside, more of a hopes and dreams thing. But this game would be super mega freakin' awesomer if it had a Infinite mode.

I was expecting to patrol the boarder, stop contraband from entering, turning away people that don't meet the requirements and maybe get into a firefight if a traveller didn't like the outcome of their attempt at crossing the boarder. But I was heavily mistaken; There is so much more to this game than meets the eye. Open world, Resource manager, being a detective of sorts, a story with choice & good conflict, and the list continues. 
  
  My only gripes is that sometimes there will be contraband in the engine bay, however there isn't actually an there. Just a bug i'm sure. Another is the abundance of ambushes; Its very obnoxious repairing your vehicle only for it to be shot up about 30 seconds after leaving the boarder camp. If they were tuned down a little to be more rare, but made a little more difficult with more risk/reward. Would make them feel exhilarating & refreshing.  
  Overall I REALLY enjoy this game, I 100% recommend giving it a try.
 
 [UPDATE] I have now finished the game, and would like to update this review;
  My previous feelings and thoughts still stands however, upon finishing the game I was sadden to see the lack of any continuation or endless mode for the game. After you finish the final mission your whole save gets nuked. No way to continue playing on the save, no new mode unlocked, etc. I hope this is a feature coming in the future just because how great this game plays even without the story missions. You could still work the boarder, encounter ambushes of fellow gang members trying to break their comrades out of prison, do intervention missions, etc. 
 Still a great game, and I look forward to doing more playthroughs to chose the other choices.",1678620075,1678781522,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

(Ingame premium currency / loot boxes / NFT's and you name it)
that and they release them rigged with bugs and be like: ""oh we will fix that later"" with some of that later being literal years or never have been fixed. (looking at Dice here with Battlefield 2042!!!)
not to mention that some big companies don't care for their community at all and reacting very toxic to their players....looking at you take2!!!.
And none of that is here what brings me joy to just play the game and not having to deal with large corp BS in game.
The game is going for a good price and you get what you pay for: a game to enjoy and that actually works.

I already got several games from these guys and i enjoy all of them (ofc i have my favorites between them)
however one thing i would like to see in a future update for this game in particular would maybe be to have that:

- The Big truck being in 3 variants... the first being the one we already have obviously.
but the other 2 being dedicated to either transport of prisoners (more than 8) but not able to transport confiscated contraband.
and the other being only to transport confiscated contraband (more than 25) but not able to transport prisoners.

Reason for this being is that i like to drive the prisoners and contraband up and down my self but think having the truck expended to as mentioned would make it possible to be more efficient at it.

- With the 2 added truck variants being added it would make sense to see if can further upgrade the prison and warehouse beyond level 3 but by how much ill leave to the developers to decide.

- Rush Hour?
with rush hour being basically a option in menu maybe to add more vehicles line up each day at the border that can be defined how many more a player might want.
(want only basic numbers? sure. / Want to have 20 vehicles lined up at the border? why not? / want to deprive your self from sleep with 50 vehicles lined up at the border? go for it!)

- Infinity Mode?

I feel like the game has a lot of potential in terms of future development. Adding more ranks which can be grinded would promote longer playtime (ex staff/chief inspector), endless/inspector mode which ik is in the works, being able to have one of your border guards accompany you when you leave the outpost as an escort. Lots of potential. 

Some issues I had with the game: When I try to slash tires, it always hits the top part of the car unless I'm positioned a certain way, hard to find ALL contraband esp if its in obscure places, and story felt disconnected from the main gameplay. My choices in story missions don't seem to affect the gameplay. Like if I join the rebellion, maybe they would send me messages to let a certain person through or kill someone etc.

Additional info in response to the developer request.

1. Dialogues
First thing that starts to irritate a player right from the start is a decision to use fictional language voice audio for dialogues. While it could be (and possibly was planned as) an atmospheric feature it is implemented very poorly and without regard to gameplay. Here's why.
It requires a player to listen for the familiar words and at the same time he has to read a subtitle. While playing a game in a real time. Dialogues do not pause the game. It distracts a player and requires him to make himself concentrate on audio AND text at the same time. There are no controls for dialogue (i.e. click to continue, logs). So basically paying attention to dialogues wastes your precious time you could spend on some other game activity. It is obviously a bad design because you even had to stop the time (disable this game mechanic) for the detective mission.
There are no textbox background which makes text hard to read over a motley game background.

2. Graphics
It looks cheap. It's the second thing that irritates a player. I think it's because it is very very motley. There is a lot of high contrast in very small and insignificant (gamewise) details. Textures are way too motley, so you can barely recognize an object outline. It is a strain for an eye. Color coding and highlighting is just useless in such a mess of art spray. And it looks cheap and outdated. Overall visual design is subpar.

3. Art
Third thing which is very irritating. The place looks like a dump. There is absolutely no art style designed to characterize the game. It looks like an asset flip. There are no flags, no streamers and no posters which are designed in a single decoration style. There is no visual flavor in any object. Everything is a simple generic asset with no style.

4. Document checking gameplay
I have to admit that document checking UI is well designed. I liked it. Yet document checking gameplay has flaws. First is an awareness meter. It's just useless. It doesn't help at all. It reuires you to click datafields which you have to compare. So basically it still requires a player to look for a field in the UI. While a player looking for a proper field to click he's perfectly able to compare data himself. So basically auto-check does nothing. The only exception is an age calculation.
In addition awareness meter is not used at all in cargo checking, vehicle condition checking.
There is no progress or development in this mechanic while the difficulty and variety of checks increases with progress. It is a design flaw. The mini-game becomes harder and more time consuming without any mechanics introduced to spare the player of repeating any of lots of monotonous actions.
For me the game became unbearable on vehicle condition checks introduced. 

5. Time
It is a bad design decision to implement a real time mechanics in the game. The game is about monotonous and tedious every day work of a border customs officer. Limiting a time by introducing a real time breaks the idea (IMO) and imposes a needless strain on a player to rush him to do the constantly increasing number of checks. If you will add here the need to deliver prisoners and contraband and buying/selling tools and goods, and managing a base, and defending a base - it's just too much for a tranquil chores of a customs officer.

6. Too many variations in the gameplay
It is really a bit too much. You had to concentrate your development on base gameplay cycle and perfect it rather than implement lots of badly designed gameplay variations which ruin the main gameplay.
For example attacks on a base should be only at night. It shouldn't interfere with main gameplay. Minigames of driving aroung shouldn't waste time.
Ambushes are really very badly designed minigame. Me as a player I just do not understand what do you expect me to do? Stop in the middle of the narrow road (all roads are narrow) and do what? Hide behing my own truck? And all I got is $70 and free ammo (if i'm fast enough too loot disappearing corpses)? What is the point of introducing such mechanics? Why wast resources on this?
Stalking mechanic is just stupid. The difference between target suspecting a pursuit and losing a target is just a couple of meters.
Detective mechanics look artificial and alien (why customs officer conducts a detective work?) and implemented badly and very cheap.
All these mini-games just dillute a fun of a main gameplay with unwanted and unpleasant actions.

7. Level design
The map (level) is awful. Long narrow roads. No minimap. Opening a map doesn't pause the game. There is no fun or challenge in travercing the map in your vehicle. It's just a tedious time consuming activity.

8. Controls.
Why I can stop engine by pressing G but can't start it by pressing G?

I bet I could continue but I already uninstalled a game and I think I made my point.",1678651050,1678718065,False,4,0,0.407407402992248535,4,True,False,False

A full playthrough with some side exploration took me ~9 hours. 

Let's start with the positives:
- the inspection parts are done well, mechanically they work and rules occasionally get mixed up
- the upgrading aspect of your border outpost is done well, you can upgrade several parts of the outpost which I enjoyed.
- the shooting itself works reasonably well
- performance was good, barely encountered bugs or fps drops.

Now for the negatives:
- even at current patch, ambushes are far too frequent and far too pointless. It just spawns 4-5 enemies that have some ammo as loot and that's it. I encountered 1-3 ambushes on every trip and loathed each one. Completely pointless.
- money was too easy to acquire, I never had issues with money and upgraded everything fairly quickly
- the characters are literally copy-pasted, I can't remember a single one. Unlike Papers 
Please which had very memorable characters in here they are bland copies of each other. I got several letters where someone complained that their wife/daughter/mother/job died and I had zero clue who they even were. Bad boring characters don't make lasting impressions.
- the story also falls kinda flat, in big parts because of the above mentioned lack of characters. You can choose to do your job correctly (siding with the government) or joining the Rebels, which is essentially just a group of violent criminals. Didn't care for that aspect whatsoever.

Overall, I had fun but also loathed other parts. It's a 6/10 that's worth a look if you enjoyed the document controlling gameplay of Papers, Please.",1678709789,1678709789,True,2,0,0.49681013822555542,0,True,False,False

First of all, the production quality is really good for such a small indie game. The looks, the graphics, the sound/music - while obviously not triple-A quality - are all quite good. The gameplay is interesting and engaging, both the ""Papers, Please"" style document and vehicle inspection part, the gunplay and even the story and side missions. While it's not Witcher 3, but everything is well written and the voice acting is great.

However, what totally sold me about the game was the style. The 80's Eastern Bloc feel brought back vivid memories of my own childhood, growing up in barely-post-soviet Hungary, I've seen these cars and trucks (even driven/owned some of them), the architecture, the government propaganda, I drove through such border checkpoints, handing over your passport with mandatory bribe money folded inside (even if you didn't have anything illegal) so they don't take your car apart just for fun. Heard all the stories back in the day about the weird ways people were trying to smuggle stuff back home from ""The West"", cigarettes, booze, cassettes, VHS tapes, kitchen appliances, jeans and clothes, etc. The border guards, the police, everyone knew people were doing it, yet also everyone coveted the shiny new western stuff, so blind eyes were turned in return for a few ""gifts"" left at the crossing, the cost of doing business. It was a ""live and let live"" type of deal.

Contraband Police captures this era of Eastern Bloc weirdness very well, just like ""Papers, Please"" did, albeit not as depressing. While ""Papers, Please"" showed the bleak, hopeless, harsh realities of trying to survive under such oppressive regime, Contraband Police is a lot less heavy-handed and brings some much needed levity and fun into the mix, not to mention a complete story with actual characters and multiple endings based on your choices.

While the game is obviously not without faults, some bugs, glitches, imbalance and missing features, the devs seem to be actively working on fixes and additions (like the Endless Mode a lot of people have been requesting) so there seems to be some mileage in this game yet.

In closing, Contraband Police is a very nice surprise. Instead of the run of the mill ""eurojank"" we got a very well made, fun and engaging sim that brings a huge load of nostalgia for those who lived these times and quaint enough to entertain those who didn't. Well done!

I'll start with the worst problem, which I hope will be solved with a bugfix:
Falseflag..
It happened 3 times in my almost 4 hours of playing that I scanned everything thoroughly, but still the scan was not perfect. For example a broken lamp that wasn't broken.

Poor humor:
There were so many things I wanted to do in this game that I shouldn't do in ""Real Life"", like accepting a bribe from a smuggler, but then I'd just as soon arrest him, which the game doesn't give me the chance to do.
Or just wrecking the other guy's car for disrespecting me and not being able to let him in. Or just killing people in different ways, which not only can't be done, but also gets a $500 deduction. You also can't take weapons away from attackers,very little money making opportunities in the game. Why shouldn't I be able to sneak the drugs to someone else, rather than deliver them to the police for a small amount of money?! And similar questions came to me while I was playing. After the 3rd hour, it got pretty monotonous.

Is this game worth it?
For this price it's definitely NOT, maybe if there is a -50% for it, it will be worth buying.
I would also point out the poor sound quality,which is repetitive silly NPC voices,(from everyone in particular)... Now this can strongly discourage you from playing the game.
Why no more conversation options? Why can't you ask back?! Anyway, I'll play the game for a few more hours, because I didn't buy it for decoration, but I don't think my opinion will change.",1678690473,1678690473,False,6,1,0.458954274654388428,0,True,False,False

   I first played the prologue to this game quite a while ago. I enjoyed it quite a bit, so when the full game was released I couldn't help but buy it within the first 2-3 days. And, I saw you were streaming it quite a lot. I never actually watched any of the streams, but I saw you ([i]or one of you[/i]) with your hat and I thought it was so wholesome! I played it whenever I could for about 3-4 days before I was able to complete the game, playing for 19 hrs. I have suggestions and criticisms!

[h1] Bug Fixes [/h1]

1. The Micros 260 has what I'd guess to either be a decal or texture issue. On the rear of the vehicle, the driver's side light is correctly shown as red, whereas the passenger-side light is white. I wasn't sure if this qualified as a ""broken light"" the first time I noticed it.

2. When raiders attacked the checkpoint, the last raider must've glitched underneath the map because my team would continuously shoot at a spot, and I was never able to locate the last raider. I had to quit and load back in, which didn't hurt much because it was right before the raid began. I had no issues with the re-do of the raid.

[h1] Suggestions & Criticisms [/h1]
[b][i]Spoiler Alert[/i][/b]
[i]Also, apologies as I may be going too in-depth, but I hope it helps![/i]

[b] World-Building [/b]
[b][i]Spoiler Alert[/i][/b]
[i]Also, apologies as I may be going too in-depth, but I hope it helps![/i]

   When you find the police traitor's hideout, he tries to convince you to join the rebellion. He says that the political opposition leader was poisoned by the Gov't, and that the state tries to put down anyone fighting for, I believe, ""[i]democracy[/i]"" and ""[i]freedom[/i]"". We're just kind of forced to take this at face value, because there is nothing leading up to the event that would make me believe that this state is necessarily any more tyrannical than any other. We're just kinda forced to accept the incorrect or disingenuous notion that Communism is always, inherently dictatorial ([i]Marxist-Leninist vs Stalinist, etc.[/i]). Noting that those buzzwords have been historically used to slander nations as authoritarian, citing ""[i]free speech[/i]"" when what they mean is corporate-sponsored speech, and lack of ""[i]economic freedom[/i]"" when a planned economy is required to ensure everyone is fed.

   When considering joining the [i]Blood Fist Revolt[/i], the world building didn't really fill much in for me. So, I resorted to my knowledge of historical rebellions in Communist or Socialist countries. They were usually a minority, funded or lead by ousted bourgeois, and principally funded by foreign Capitalist powers out of their own economic interests, disregarding whatever was best for the people. Presuming this was true, and considering the aforementioned buzzwords, the rebellion would've probably been fighting for a [i]Liberal Democracy[/i]. Which is concerning for me because the end-result of a Liberal Democracy can very easily be Fascism, which would most certainly be a far worse evil than whatever is alleged of Communist Acaristan. But, I would've still chosen the rebellion if the majority of people wanted this to be so. So, I listened to the civilians that passed my gate. All of the Acaristani people passing the gate had nothing intentionally ill to say of the Gov't, except on occasion such as when the government got rid of artists, teachers, and journalists ([i]which I would say is tyrannical[/i]). Rather, I would often hear Acaristani newcomers speak positively of the state, once even hearing about how the new restrictions kept him employed. This doesn't feel like a conscious world-building choice, and I feel a small handful of lore leading up to finding the traitor could've better informed the decision!

[b] Free Play After Completion[/b]

   It feels kinda sad to have invested that time with updating my officers, facilities, vehicles, and just not being able to play anymore afterwards without starting a new game. Each newcomer felt intentional, so I presume you must've crafted every encounter. But, if you could only make a randomizer script of some sort, you could very easily allow for continuous play post-credits! I would definitely want to play the game more post-credits, and was sad to find out that I would have to start all over.

Let me say it a bit louder...

I enjoyed hunting down contraband and the little story missions you get along the way are serviceable.

Overall, i would give this game a sold 7.9 out of 10. It's a great game, if you see it on sale you'd be dumb not to pick it up and give it a chance. The game play does get a little repetitive but it's a fun experience and i recommend it fully.",1678667954,1678667954,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It's really fun in the sense that you aren't just stating at an outpost all day, you're given full access to the full map and allowed to wander around once the day is complete. The game is amazingly well detailed and has an interesting story in the game that makes you wanna continue. My favorite part I found while playing was the base upgrades, it gave you an incentive to keep wanting to get more money for making sure that you and your border guards have the equipment necessary to fight in raids. 

However there is a main downside I found with the game, it was with the Blood Fist. They're an interesting faction and seem cool, but I found no real reason to join their side not unless you don't want the government to succeed. I feel in Papers, Please they gave you a reason to support the rebels in that you had a family to support and you really felt the cruelty of the government. In this game?

I like searching the nooks and crannies of a vehicle for contraband, and I seemingly missed 10 - 20% most of the time. I like the base management system input, where you can upgrade buildings personnel and hire new guards. The driving sections are less fun, and it has the worst tailing mission i have seen in a game (The difference between too close and losing your target is like 8 steps)

Unlike papers please, it does not really require any thought or attention to detail, nor is time management any concern. Look for typos, remember to check the license plates that the KGB knows are smugglers, and then use your UV lamp to check for the super secret contraband mark all criminals keep on their hidden compartments. But ok, a more easy laid-back approach is not necessarily a bad thing -- some folks like that, and papers please could be overbearingly stressful. 

The real killer to me is that the story elements are unearned, and the easy difficulty is the main driver of that. In papers please, the difficulty reinforced the evil nature of the totalitarian government. If you don't work hard enough, your family might die. This causes you to participate in the evil -- doing the right thing and letting someone across the border despite a minor typo in their documents to avoid being murdered at home is a *lot* harder decision to make when that good deed could mean your family goes hungry. 

In this game, I was rolling in dough and buying upgrades because, well, why not? A few of the civilians meekly asked to be let across the border -- you know, because it would be a nice thing to do, not because of any real reason. I always finished the arrival queue with plenty of daylight to spare, which mean I was making the big bucks and could buy anything i really needed. I never got the opportunity, but i assume you could possibly sell contraband to the black market for a higher risk/reward, but the economy of the game is so permissive i don't know why you would want to (other than RP i suppose). 

Then out of nowhere, some guy asks me to join the rebellion against the evil government. Why? I've been on the job for less than a week and I've already upgraded my house twice.

Graphics - Good, not super-fancy, but more than enough to allow you to get immersed in the game.

Audio - Good

Music - Good, but a little repetitive, not too many tracks.  Competent music, but nothing that will win an award.

Gameplay- WINNER WINNER CHICKEN DINNER.  The gameplay will suck you in.

Value and Replayability - My goal when buying a game is to get a minimum of an hour for every dollar spent.  This game delivers at the price I purchased it at.  In my first run-through of the game it took me about 25-30 hours of play time.  When I finished my first run-through I immediately started my second run-through.  I anticipate that I'll stop playing when the second run-through is complete.  This will be the type of game that you'll dust off every 12-18 months and do a run-through.  It's not a game like Factorio or Minecraft where you'll put thousands of hours in.

(Light spoilers below)

The GOOD:  Checking people's documents is fun and the process slowly gets more complicated and morphs as the game progresses.  The core game mechanic doesn't get easy, doesn't get old, allows you to mess up a little bit without being too severely punished, and rewards attention to detail and immersion.

Other than document\contraband checking, there are two other major mechanics; driving and shooting.  This game isn't as competent at driving and shooting as the game ""Mafia"" is, but it's still good enough.  Driving and shooting missions help break up the core document/contraband mechanic.  I never found myself bored during my first play through.

You can also upgrade/purchase/hire as the game progresses.  This helps make the game rewarding and allows you to more efficiently do grind-tasks or to avoid them all together.

Also, the story is fun too.  I had a hard time following it completely, as a lot of the Russian names just started to blur together in my head, but perhaps I'll catch more on my second time through.

The BAD - The driving mechanic is good enough, but it is the weakest point of the game.  The good news is my car never really got stuck.  The bad news is that driving just seems a little bit off.  The other frustrating part of the game was the ""ambush"" events.  The developers are addressing this.  Basically the ambushes happen WAY TOO FREQUENTLY and don't offer enough reward.

Ambushes:

For those of you that are worried about the ""ambush"" issue, don't.  I had about a 90% success rate just driving right through them.  That's right, just ignore them and keep driving.  You'll take insignificant damage in most cases and continue on.  Don't attempt to take on the ambushes until you have better weapons and more experience using them.

Developers, if you're listening, this is how I would fix ambushes:
1)  Limit Ambushes to 1 per day
2)  Let players know (perhaps in the tutorial) that they can flee if they're not prepared
3)  The $70 reward for winning the ambush is too small.  Increase the reward to something like $500
4)  Make it possible to reduce the chance of an ambush by turning off sirens or taking certain routes, train the player how to avoid them/lessen their chances.

Also to the Devs:  Bravo, well done.  This game is fun, surprising, addictive, suspenseful, and does a good job at a variety of gameplay mechanics.  You've created joy in this world.",1678596372,1678596372,True,3,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False

So as most have already stated, a few bullets can make your car explode.. so you have to restart the day, and more than likely you will be driving at the end of the day to transport prisoners and contraband.
That isn't the worst part though, the worst part is the ""Stop the intruder"" stuff. So... you have a vehicle that is almost exactly the same speed at the guy who ran your gate right?
So you have to cut every corner without messing up to FINALLY catch up to the runner. Well you also need to remember that the runner goes through your gate at full speed and you still have to get into your vehicle, turn it on, and then chase him, so he has a pretty good head start. 
If you hit any trees, or anything really, you will easily lose 1 minute of your time catching up. I have slammed the runners car into trees/mountains/etc, and I didn't get out quick enough - he would just keep going and I would have to get back into my vehicle to continue the chase of two cars with the same speed. :( Sometimes I can get lucky and end it soon, like the first runner. I just got 2 of them today and I shit you not, 15-20 minutes to complete the damn runner and arrest him.
Oh, and you can't go through his vehicle for contraband because you have a timer now to get back to your post because people are waiting to come in. So then you get penalized for not finding all the contraband in the car... It's just, such a bad mechanic and really needs to get overhauled - easily the biggest disdain I have with the game.

Sometimes you will get missions randomly, I just did the graveyard mission. Few issues, not a huge fan of the enemy appearing out of thin air every time I start to dig in spots, just never been a huge fan of the magical enemies appearing from thin air.
Secondly, and more importantly, the game tells you to bring a shovel. You should probably bring a couple... maybe the dev can put a shovel in the van for this mission as well, OR have a few shovels laying around in the graveyard during this mission. If you are unlocky with your dig spots, you will break your shovel before you can beat it, if you leave hte area than you lose it. :(

Also, there are some annoying bugs, on the micros 260, you can't pop the tires, so all contraband in the tires you can't get to for your money and you are also penalized for it as well. :(",1678539209,1678595256,False,5,0,0.475418150424957275,0,True,False,False

In both games, you work at a border crossing of a fictional eastern European country in the 1980s, and are tasked with deciding whether people enter or not based on the rules. In some ways this game is simpler than Papers, Please, but in most other ways, it is much more complex. In Papers, Please, the challenge came from trying to process people as quickly as possible without making mistakes in order to earn more money, with the challenge coming from more advanced paperwork as the game progressed, along with some moral dilemmas.

In Contraband Police, time isn't so much an issue, and instead the challenge comes from making sure your report for each entrant is as accurate as possible, making sure each individual document is accurate and if not, why it's not. You get paid more the more accurate your report is, and that money goes towards making your outpost better. And there are more systems than just checking the paperwork. There's searching for contraband, capturing fugitives, transporting prisoners and contraband, a black market system. There are also some first person shooting segments that handle decently, and can happen suddenly, which can keep you on your toes.

I do have some issues. For one, the labor camp where you deliver prisoners and the police headquarters where you deliver contraband are on opposite ends of the map, so driving to both can get a bit tedious at times. The shootouts are a bit easy too. I found that early on I was able to pull off headshots pretty easily with my pistol just popping out from behind a tree and lining up my sights. The enemies only become especially challenging if you encounter a lot of them and they all get real close to you. That or you're in a car and can't get out quickly enough before they shoot your car into a fireball. They can still kill you if you aren't paying attention in a scripted firefight so it's not totally mindless, but it could be better. When it comes to each inspection, the order of the vehicles and each one's specific problems aren't randomized like in Papers, Please, so there's no reason not to refresh the day if you feel like you've messed up, since you'll know what to expect. While the overall themes of the story are clear, no one character is given enough screen time or development to stand out or be memorable.

Still though, Contraband Police is a good time for those who like going over details and making sure everything is in order. The FPS segments could be improved but they're still fun to me. Running the outpost and watching it get better over time felt good. And I think aping Papers, Please really helped it in a way. I recommend giving it a chance if you feel like this kind of title would interest you. At least, play the demo first and decide if it's for you.

The developers seems to be pretty active and has plans for the future of the game. And so far when they mention things are going to get fixed, they get fixed. Main issue I had (and many others feedback) was way too many ambushes on the road, so that got patched within a couple days of release. 

The game is exactly how it states on the store page. This feels like a much needed expansion to ""Papers, Please"", turning it into a 3D first person game with police chases, shoot outs, ambushes, and of course: Checking travelers papers before they can cross the border. You will also have to check cargo, taking out a paper to check how much of each cargo the driver has and then comparing it to the drivers manifest. You also need to do upkeep on your police station including hiring new officers to help out, expanding the jail (you will be arresting and transporting the bad guys), the warehouse (where all the contraband is stored until you take it to the police base), your residence and more. Lots of progression within the game.

Price is more than adequate, gameplay is great. There are few bugs here and there, but the experience is great.

The gun system is okay, not very realistic, damage can be a bit more buffed, and the AI should play a bigger part in gunfights, right now they barely get a single kill, while you're fending off the checkpoint against 10-15 gang members.
Overall I'd say this game is a 6.5/10, it has a lot of potential and I enjoy it.

You can earn money by doing work, taking bribes etc.  Earned money are spent for upgrades.

you don't necessarily go into playway sa titles expecting the highest quality, but this one holds up. sure, it looks like a mod for far cry 2, but the gameplay is excellent. there's nothing like the feeling of getting a perfect inspection.

on the other hand, both this and papers please have the very video-gamey mechanic where your inspections are checked and graded. is there a second border patrol person who is Perfect and double-checks your inspections? how do they know how much to pay you? i know it's ostensibly necessary for the game to have any type of challenge to it, but it's a bit of cognitive dissonance that's bothered me in both these games.

my other gripe is that the UI, while mostly great, falls apart for marking down vehicle conditions. vehicle condition should really be another list like the Cargo List instead of a manual ticking of tiny boxes. it doesn't make sense that the cargo list lets you count/unpack items with ease while the same quality of life doesnt apply to vehicle condition. if you have to, make it cost perception to check tires and body condition! it's often hard to discern what's a body condition problem and what's just mud.",1678530942,1678542347,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Spoilers ahead!

The game delivers really really well, and even exceeded my expectations in some parts. I enjoyed playing it to the point where I wasn't willing to stop playing. You guys at Crazy Rocks really did a very good job with this game! As with any game, there are pros and cons, so I'll list them here:

Pros:
- Actual stuff to do outside the border station, missions, transport prisoners and contrabands and missions. The map is also larger than I expected. 
- Upgradable border station.
- Get to actually interact with searching vehicles and actually putting in the effort to find inconsistencies in documents, smuggled items etc.
- The overall environment looks beautiful!
- Main storyline missions have variety. Sidequests are also fun to do.
- AI during Border Station attacks actually knows to take cover and use grenades, and just doesn't run up to us like headless chickens.
- Interaction with the vehicles! You get to even turn on and off the siren, load up stuff into the vehicle and such.
- I love when newcomers have a chance of just trying to escape from the station as well. We get to actually chase people.
- The game runs REALLY well as well.

As for the cons:
- The amount of ambushes feels a bit too much from time to time. I would get up to like 6 ambushes in one trip, delivering prisoners and contraband. Maybe have the amount tuned down, but make the ambushes more intense.
- I feel that the AI during ambushes and sidequests aren't bad, but I feel like it could be better. Sometimes, although not annoyingly large amount of times, they would rush you like headless chickens. Maybe have them take more cover and use more tactics and such.
- Cars sometimes feel like they are weak in terms of durability, and would start breaking apart and combust into flames quite quickly, specially after a small ambush. I would add some durability to them.
- Interacting with your police comrades and NPCs outside the border station is out of the question in this game, unfortunately. Unless it's during a mission which has dialogue.
- While the sidequests are interesting, there could have been a bit more variety and amount to them.
- There is no endless -mode. This would have been a good addition to the game as well.

Along with pros and cons I have some suggestions:

- I think there should be a chance for a smuggler to appear at the border, which doesn't have any of the smuggler marks, or appear on the board under the ""smugglers"" -note. Basically, they would be carrying some amount of the contraband inside the vehicle in hiding spots which don't have the mark (like under the seats, dashboard etc etc.), but is visible if paying attention. It would keep us on our toes and pay attention if we see anything inside, for example while unloading the cargo.
- During the war episode, I was expecting vehicles rigged with explosives to come to the border, which there were none. I would have added the chance for rigged vehicles to come to the border, and we would have to be careful with opening doors and such, otherwise the explosives would go off. And then have us go through a procedure of how to handle such situations, like having us make them safe to handle and such.
- Never during the game would I have been required to check under the vehicle themselves, which can be used as a hiding spot for contraband and such. Usually during vehicle inspections on checkpoints and such they would have mirrors on a stick which they could use to peek under the vehicle and see if there is anything there.

But overall, I love playing this game. It's super fun! Keep it up devs,

There are also side quests and story quests which involve choices that impact the game, also action & stealth quests which are quite cool. you can also do side hustles trading or be corrupt and sell contraband if you like.

Have not had any bugs yet in 24 hrs of playing & the game does have a decent story going with cool quests.
pros - good solid game with no bugs
          lots to do and keep you entertained
          FPS combat inst bad reminds of stalker.
Cons - not really bad cons tbh
           Graphics are fair not horrible at all, on par with garage sim perhaps a bit better.
           No save function the game auto saves only at the end of the day when you go to sleep or you can 
           restart the day

Games worth the money, if i had to make a suggestion it would be allowing to save so if you need to quit the game you don't lose progress if you haven't finished the day yet. 
Perhaps slow the day duration a bit or let us have an option to slow it a touch, its not bad just would be nice to have an option to do that on the days you want to do more. hope this helps everyone :)",1678533817,1678533817,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

First the game should allow more control on how to do things. If there are notices about somebody probably fleeing, you should be able to stop them preemptively by breaking their car. I smashed the car battery and destroyed all the wheels of a such car and still they were able to run the checkpoint because apparently you cannot avoid the chases.
Also if you try outsmart and run ahead of the smuggler on foot, the game will reset your character near your car because you are not allowed to do such a thing.  You can't do prisoner / smuggled items transports when you're on gate duty either, you have to do them after the gate shift which is sort of understandable but I think there should be an option to spend a day doing transport like there is in the tutorial phase.. 
When driving around the map, you get ambushed way too often. The frequency of the ambushes should be reduced it just gets tedious when  every time you drive on the paved road there's an ambush. Ain't nobody got time for it and it's hardly an element of surprise either by your 5th ambush.
Driving is a little bit laggy still. especially with several cars oncoming traffic the game has performance issues. Not as bad as in the demo but still not exactly smooth either. 
In general the basic game part of checking the vehicles and papers does get a bit repetitive after a while. It's nice that they have created the side missions and other distractions. 
But as it stands this is definitely a release quality game unlike some of these indie games I've played recently. I think the price is fair and execution is pretty good.

Now don't get me wrong this is a pretty good game, and if you liked the bureaucratic gameplay of that game then this will scratch that itch... To an extent. However its completely bogged down by superflous and completely mediocre gameplay elements that just have no real reason to be in the game. I'm a border control officer so why would I be driving around doing bloody tailing missions? I mean it doesn't make sense from a gameplay or logical standpoint. The constant phonecalls to go do some other random thing that has nothing to do with the border control is honestly annoying although mostly ignorable. I haven't completed the game so I've no idea if ignoring them has an effect though.

It's just not necessary. In fact none of the ""open world"" elements are necessary or even fun at all. It just detracts from the main gameplay and lets face facts this isn't a triple AAA game, the shooting and driving mechanics are severely lacklustre at best. So why they decided to force you to drive around (being ambushed constantly) and do these really out of place missions and busy work is beyond me.

It also detracts from the relatively rare moments that made papers please special. Like a dude begging to be let in to help his family but with a minor problem in his paperwork. This game does have that but so far I've had a lot more ""chase this guy"" ""go follow that guy"" ""go here and do this"" missions which, as I said, just feel out of place here.

I'm also REALLY not a fan of the vehicle inspection elements. For some reason I just can't seem to ever get them right. Finding broken parts of vehicles sounds easy but almost all the vehicles are rusted piles of crap anyway and its super annoying to have a perfect score ruined by a missing bumper that you had no idea was supposed to be there in the first place.

Now you're probably wondering why I'm recommending this game when I have quite a lot of problems with it? Well the fact is it is a pretty good game and doesnt deserve a negative review. It was released in better state than most AAA games and the devs seem active in the forums and are addressing at least the most egregious issues people have with the game. Namely the bad ambush system. So while I'm giving it a postive review I'm not gonna sugarcoat it. Basically i recommend it but don't expect it to become your most favourite game of all time.

It's like the opposite feeling I had from papers please. Where I expected to hate that game and ended up absolutely adoring it. I expected to love this game and found myself thinking it was ""just okay""",1678510972,1678510972,True,1,0,0.537815093994140625,1,True,False,False

Like others say, it feels kinda like ""papers please"" (which should be taken as a compliment), but it actually has a bunch of other stuff to do too, and feels surprisingly deep in many of its gameplay mechanics. Therefore, it shouldn't be seen as simply being a ""papers please"" copy, as it differs from that game in many interesting ways. 

I haven't played it that much yet, so i don't know how many hours of gameplay the game has, but for its price of about 20 euros i do think i would recommend this game, as it actually seems to provide lots of gameplay elements that justify the price, and isn't just a cash grab.

The game still have some bugs in it of course, it just came out. Even with the bugs though, even the annoying one where you deny someone, which is right, and still get counted wrong for it, I say its playable. I did not run into any issues with driving the car or interacting with any of NPCs. Missions can be a little confusing because it does not directly tell you where to look for some items, had to search on YT to find an item in one mission that I thought was apart of the background. Nevertheless I do want to warn people though, this is a story based game, not a endless mode game with a story. 

I wish it was like Papers, Please; it is well polished for it's official release. Again, this is a story based game, so if you restart the day, the same cars with different information/character will come up but most of the time, it will be the same deny/entry, and this happens out the tutorial. The gun fights are a bit here and there, a shotgun can shoot across the field and some NPC can take three point blank shots to the chest before dying. I used the sniper at the very end of my game play but somehow, it seemed to have worst range than the shotgun and worst fire power. 

Leveling up in this game is not that important. I got through the game fine with only level II items for my warehouse, jail, and housing. Max for my border guards and did not buy the last unlockable car, because truly you did not need it. You seem to lose a lot of money for simple mistakes which can cost you to not to be able to afford upgrades the next day, because it only spawns a few amount of cars each day. 

I say I recommend this game because while it was short, it was fun. I would play it again, this time for the opposite story line. It's a bit sad knowing I know what comes next and not much will change next time, but not too disheartening.",1678506046,1678506046,True,1,0,0.516129076480865479,0,True,False,False

With its immersive gameplay, and challenging levels, Contraband Police offers a thrilling and addictive experience that will keep you hooked for hours on end.

One of the things that sets Contraband Police apart from other games is its attention to detail. The game accurately simulates the procedures and protocols that border guards follow when inspecting vehicles and passengers, adding a level of realism that makes the experience all the more immersive.

But what really makes Contraband Police shine is its gameplay. Each level presents you with a new challenge, from inspecting suspicious vehicles to questioning nervous passengers, and you'll need to use all of your skills and intuition to succeed. As you progress through the game, you'll unlock new tools and equipment that will help you in your quest to catch smugglers and contraband items, adding an element of progression and reward that keeps you motivated and engaged.

Pros
- Shoot rebels and steal their contraband.
- Make money from arrested and dead rebels.
- Fun game for the price, I got more than I expected.
- Defiantly worth a second play through, more than one ending.
- Can become pretty challenging with the border checks, especially at the end with everything tied together and if you're trying to get perfect inspections. 
- Pretty interesting story and how fate is determined/events.
- AI has ammo... not just 3-7 rounds when looted.
- A studio that finally releases a finished product instead of a beta type release. 
- Profit

Cons(Minuscule)
-  AK has like zero recoil. Like a little tiny bit more would be welcoming... At least it's not ridiculously unusable in a sense where I can't hit a barn door 10m away. But I don't feel like I should be full auto hitting a watermelon sized target from 100m away.
- AI bodies disappearing during or after gunfights really quickly, I want that ammo >:)
- How tf does the commissar know who the smugglers are? If you already know just point them out homie, who's side are you on? Are you omnipresent? If I missed him I don't think it should fine you... just keep the chapter going until he tries to pass again.
- Siren on loop. A very obvious start and stop. Idk if that's how it's suppose to be but it's annoying after about 2 minutes. 
- 5 minute time goals to be at an objective no matter where at on the map or what condition your in. 

Cons
- Ambush mechanic. I feel like I'm constantly being attacked by rebels while on the roads.... And I mean like 2-4 times when I'm just driving a half loop around the small map. Also pretty much occurs after every incident. Main reason I didn't enjoy going out or exploring. I did notice it dropped a little towards the late game although I was making less frequent trips out. 
- THE FREAKING WHEELS ON THE SD2 whatever Geo Metro looking thing. If there's smuggled contraband in the tires goodluck trying to get to it. The wheel is so small you're practically never going to hit... you'll either hit the fender, the rim, or the ground. I've gone through so many types of tools trying to crack them open and nothing works. Also I've let so many go by with flat tires it's insane. Geo Metro OP. 
- Game is finished when storyline is finished. It would be nice to at least to get a warning that your gameplay is going to entirely be done for. 
- Shotguns have zero range. Pretty much useless unless right on top of someone. Save your money for a SMG or AK. 


I'd highly recommend this game. My biggest complaint is the ambush mechanic and how many there are. Like isn't this a totalitarian regime... where are all these rebels getting these weapons? Am I not doing my job at the border by catching all these vigilantes smuggling in weapons? Is Vlad behind this? Where is the Commissar and his all seeing eye watching me search these vehicles?

I enjoyed the storyline and being able to pick a side to support although I wish the gameplay didn't end so abruptly. I had one more baddie on my list to catch but I suddenly got a call and took it and finished the game without even realizing it. Idk if I can sleep knowing there is still one smuggler out there that I didn't catch... Another annoying con was the siren on a loop... like it was obviously a loop and had a blatant start and stop. Also AK is extremely OP due to the recoil... like don't make it Tarkov level recoil where it's ridiculous but I feel like it's peashooter recoil level. Like just a smidge higher wouldn't hurt. Shotgun has no range also so, it's a no from me. Also I found the dead disappearing really quickly during a gun fight, kinda annoying when I'm low on ammo and I need those sweet sweet rounds (really nice on how the AI carries a decent amount of ammo though!).  Overall I'd highly recommend this game to anyone looking for a nice change of pace... One minute you're checking paperwork and letting cars through the toll, the next you're in a high speed chase or shootout with multiple baddies.

Contraband Police caught me completely off guard; there is way more game here than I was expecting for my ~$20. 

Is it perfect? No. Is there jank? Of course.  However, the quality of this game and the passion and hard work that the Dev put into it shines through, and really makes this something unique and fun. 


The story and side-missions so far are quite good and they are paced well. Just when you start to feel the monotony start to set in from the daily grind of checking paperwork, catching smugglers, turning in prisoners and contraband, you get a call telling you that there has been a murder at a local establishment and you --as the closest thing to proper law enforcement-- are being called in to investigate.

Another thing that really stands out is how much this game actually makes me care about my actions. I was expecting to just fall into the role of the compassionless guard ""just doing his job"". But, somehow, even with the fairly sparse dialogue and only having short summary of my subordinates backgrounds I found myself actually caring about how I went about my job. 

The system I serve my be rotten and the rules I enforce sometimes arbitrary and pointless, but the job I am doing is important and has an affect on the people I interact with every day. 
I quickly found myself happy to accept the fine for not turning someone away in order to help them. I even ended up foregoing an upgrade to my living conditions to ensure I had the cash reserve to let asylum seekers through who would have otherwise  been turned away because they had a spelling mistake on their paperwork. 


The only real complaint I have about Contraband Police is the roadside ambushes when you are out driving around, they are far to frequent and only really serve as an annoyance when you are trying to get some of your busy-work done. I think they would be much better if they were tweaked to be much less common but far more dangerous, make them something that can actually surprise you rather than something you expect.

If anything about Contraband Police seems like something you might be interested in, don't hesitate, it will at the very least meet your expectations. But, it is far more likely it will surpass those expectations just like it did with me.",1678477621,1678478991,True,92,1,0.885508716106414795,2,True,False,False

This is essentially a combination between thief simulator and paper please. 
Gameplay 10/10
Graphics 8/10
Bugfree 5/10
Music 9/10
Story 5/10

Spoilers from here:
The story is fairly short and consists of single intermissions between your normal day job essentially finding things or killing people.
The gameplay is increadible. Each new chapter introduces new mechanics, new things to remember and check and just makes you exited for the next chapter.
Although it can be frustrating, often times having not a perfect score means you messed up somehow, not the game. The discussion threads are filled with ""this is a bug, I checked everything"" and later on it turns out, they missed something.
The difficulty is great, you are not heavily punished for messing up a bit, but getting perfect scores is still hard.

Small details I want to be changed:
Car windows are really hard to see. Checking them is more of a ""how do I angle my camera"" rather than ""did I remember to do this"". Sometimes quite frustrating.

Document backgrounds are not intuitive explained. It is not clear, what a correct or wrong document background is. I had to rely on the auto compare every time here.

The Special Rule for Chapter ""War"" is not explained clearly. Do you allow al'barakh if they have not asyl? Do you ignore missmatches if they have asyl? That rule should be rewritten to be clearer.

Give me more ranks. I reached top rank after 4 chapters. The rank mechanic was pretty useless for the rest.

Cargo Cheatsheets should not be tied to the document section, when I have the cargo cheatsheet equipped. Unequipping the cheat sheet brings up the cheatsheet in the document section again. This was annoying.

Nation and Car selection should be the first page in the information book. Clicking the ""next"" button every time was annoying.

Car maximum weights on the driver license should be tied to the car that is actually on the driver license. This increases the difficulty. Otherwise I don't need to look at the car at all, I just compare the written maximum weight with the information book.

I would love to have a more intuitive, or more detailed view of black markets. It is not clear if the price given by a person is way to high compared to the average or not. If players want to get into this, why not add a whole new section with graphs (maybe everytime the player buys an item, the buy graph gets extended - as in the ingame officer draws them by hand).

Positives:
-Each character (Newcomer) changes slightly if you restart your day. So its not exactly the same.
-Game gives you time to do your search and I never felt rushed like in Papers Please.
-Upgrades give you a sense of accomplishment and assists your needs at the border station.
-No game breaking Bugs!

Negatives:
-Faces and names don't change much from each Newcomer.
-Smaller bugs can cause you to fail a search (I.E. Car behind pushes subject's vehicle through the gate.)

A bit short in my opinion (finished the story once in about 12 hours).
Lots of great bits of gameplay like vehicule chases and ambushes. (Ambushes are a bit too frequent but the devs said this would get changed)

Decent replayability, the game can be played twice (once for each side of the story).

I hope the game will eventually get more content such as : more faces (women?), new vehicles, new rules, new weapons, new outpost upgrades (especially this one since it gives you a feeling of progression and there's not much to do once you're rich and bought everything, one of those upgrades could be a NPC to assist you in your car when going outside), etc. The loop is working well, so more content to expand on it would be awesome! 

When I first played the prologue, I thought the open world wasn't working well with the ""papers, please"" aspect of the game.. but upon actually playing the full game it's actually very good! It's a nice break to give you other things to do. 

My favorite main story quest in the game has to be the murder investigation one! I love thrillers so it's no surprise that I enjoyed it, but I was really surprised that those quests weren't redundant which I was expecting at first. Not at all, they're varied and don't ever feel the same. Music is also really good.

Here's a small section on what I didn't like:
- Gang attacks in the open world: apparently it's going to get fixed soon, which is good, because there's too many of them for very little reward so it was a bit annoying to me.
- Sniper rifle was such a let down, doesn't seem strong at all and no scope either to facilitate head shots

There are a few improvements that could be made for sure (contains spoilers):
* Days feel a bit short, even after 8 hours into the game. Sometimes I am done with the drivers and there is plenty of light left 
* The world feels a bit empty. Just hotspot areas have things in it. There is no much life in it other than the drivers driving around and the ambushes.
** Adding some houses, wildlife would make this better
* Some more hotkey options would be nice as well, changing the way you approve or deny an entry (instead of having to talk with the person to do the final decision would be cool to have a hotkey for it and changing the flow where you deliver the documents after, while allowing you to still edit the inspection report after making the decision - similar to what Papers Please does), hotkey to pull up the inspection report for car damage
* A bit more interaction with the guards with fleeing cars: feels odd that they just do nothing to a fleeing car when you have heavy armed guards at your post and paying big bucks for them
* The ambush mechanic should be revamped. It's nice on the first and second encounter, and then just become an annoying thing that can kill your precious cargo (prisoners) when taking them to the quarry (use the downed tree as an ambush instead of randomly popping up dudes shooting at you; add ways to slow you down, maybe lower the firepower but make it more challenging to flee)
* Sometimes it's really hard to spot broken windows in the cars: not sure if I am just blind or if bugged.
* Some drugs are said to be hidden behind the car seat, but in some car layouts it's super hard to spot those

Overall, I'm happy with this game and I hope they keep improving on it and make it even more challenging, just like late game papers please gets.

I was skeptical, but bought it anyway. 

Gosh what a great game. Really refreshing and new approach. It's ""Papers, please"" taken to next level.

I really like the ""puzzle"" this games offers. When you have to control many details before you can Approve or Deny entrance. Even then for maximal reward, you have to make sure to note all faulty details in inspection. More details you note, the bigger reward is.  Every time I make a decision, there is uncertainty if i missed something. After chapter II, the amount of things you have to watch out increases a lot. It becomes a mystery game, with a burning question ""Did i get all the clues or not?"".

Extra part is, you have to arrest correct people, take them to labor camp. Take contrabands to police warehouse, fight gangs who always ambush you when you're driving these two things. Aaaand this is the part where games fails. Gosh this is annoying as heck. The game has gunfights, either on the road or when border crossing is attacked. This part, although a welcomed mix, is really annoying due to how, too simple it is and anti-climatic. 

There is also some detective work, which was done pretty well. But not too hard. 

The map design is also one of it's biggest minuses. It's a bland corridor. You gonna spend a lot of time driving to camp and police station plus to other parts. This drive through canyon looks like a long, identical corridor. Nothing to see except tress and canyon rocks, plus those annoying ambushes.  While I presume this was done to make game less system demanding. The two most used routes to camp and police should still be somewhat more interesting visually. More nature, wide roads, something to make that drive feeling lees like identical corridor. 

However this games shines at you looking at papers and inspecting vehicles. A truly well made game.",1678447253,1678447405,True,1,0,0.509345769882202148,0,True,False,False

Spotting discrepancies in the actual border part isn't much of a challenge, with the only exclusion being the fake passports, but by that point you've upgraded your post enough to be able to scan every passport with the scanner. Despite that, the game does provide a nice challenge closer to the end, with you having to remember all the smuggler hints and remembering to check all 13 possible reasons to reject someone. 
Everything outside of the border post part is mindless and pointless. You have to drive across the entire map to first drop off criminals at the labor camp, and then drop off the contraband at the police station. It's good worldbuilding, but the only gameplay during those parts is the ambushes, which are somehow both really annoying and extremely easy. Closer to the end of the game, you even get the ability to get a house call from the cops, so you don't even have to drive anywhere.
The gunplay is... well.. 4/10 at best. The AK sounds like a 9mm.
Story is nice, but it's not developed to the point that I actually care about characters.
After beating the game, you don't unlock any NG+ features or an Endless mode, which would always be nice, as playing through the same thing again except for 6 diffirent choices in story missions gets really repetitive.
Overall, this game is great and an easy pickup if you loved Papers Please, but it's got some issues that prevent it from being my favorite game.",1678446446,1678446446,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

the only thing I'd change is the frequency of ambushes.
