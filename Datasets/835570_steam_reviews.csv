Been stay loyal to the game.
The game was unique the only reason i keep playing.
but there a huge problem in the game such as

1) Optimization 
2) The whole territory war system.*The most change needed as soon as possible
3) A good system for newbie/newcomer

My hope
1) Alot of esport organization invest into conqueror blade

What should you expect with the game ?
1) The only game with this kind of gameplay
2) Soo many variety of season
3) Competitive
4) Casual
5) Community
6) Friendship
7) Place to hang out i guess.
8) Drama to spice up the game
9) Good responsive technical support from the game *Any report will quickly got response by their technical support service.
10) Responsive game developer
11) The variety of maps, and also each map layout that looks incredible.

Otherwise the game was soo unique that keep me playing.
And as long as the developer improve the game day by day , its sound good for me.
I starting playing with my real life friend. enjoy play it since 2020.
Not just build a coummunity in the game.

BUT.........................................
The amount of UI i need to click to collect rewards is insane.. you will be jumping from one panel to the next and there are hidden little buttons around the place like the seasons you can change to.

The quests that need you to relog to finish, like unlocking the Unit side quests.

The very first time i got to fight another player in a siege battle.. they annihilated me.. I was not able to damage them no matter how many times i hit them, and with 1 combo they can kill me.
There is no balance only Pay2Win, you will not be matched in battles with people of equal strength and there is no mechanic that will reduce all players to the same gear level so that skill makes a difference, if you have better gear then you will win.

The Tutorial tries its best to power level you up to 100, but you get to around level 50 and you have forgotten half of the stuff because there is so much stuff and the way it tries to teach is horrid, then bombards you with loot each time and exp, its makes it feel almost meaningless and the game is a big waste of time.

The territory wars and events are on a locked time at certain days of the week, and there are only a limited handful of servers so you will get unlucky with a bad ping and needing to be online at 3a.m. to even attend an event.

PVE is limited.. you only get a few matches a day, then you will receive no rewards.

Your inventory will be full of junk that you apparently need because of how the UI dumps loot into you for everything, its alot of micromanagement to make the cash shop relevant.

New players get given a skin at the start that has some feathers like wings on them, you can spot a new player a mile a way and its easy kill.

Bots.. the game is full of bots up to level 99, you will see them Derp out on walls and follow set paths that makes them stand out as non-players.

Weapon balance is pretty much whoever has the highest upgraded gear.. but then Nodachi is a common weapon because of the lifesteal, there is very little balance or hybrid stuff, alot of the weapons only have 1 set of working skills that are worth taking and the devs dont care.

The learning curve is steep, but they have made many changes in recent months to make the game beginner-friendly.
They have a concept of ""Season"", wherein they release new units & content every season based on the medieval period in a certain region in the world. (e.g. season 8 is based on Tang Dynasty in China, Season 7 was Vikings, etc.)
It's a mixed genre as in -- you are a hero/captain leading your squad of troops (~20 to 30 troops), so you need to strategically think where and when to engage with enemy troops or heroes (""Strategy oriented""). And when you engage, you as a hero have strong skills to make you impactful on the battlefield, which is more ""Action"" oriented.
This is one of the most intense games you will play, as in you will have to think about a lot of things before taking any action, and this can be stressful at times in PVP. In such a case, there is a good amount of PvE content to get you relaxed.

Now the game seem to be going to a decent direction after months of slow updates and now finally out of early access. It can certainly use a new review.

TLDR : Its free, its worth a try at the current stats, not the best but it does offer something new compare to similar game on market (or used to be on market). I am actually split on if I should recommend it, but being free certainly worth giving it a try for now.

+ Positive

1. Unit balance got a lot better than before. While some unit is still very questionable...especially the older small shield unit (old balance issue that was never fixed), where they are currently way behind the newest unit this season in term of effectiveness. Certainly on the right track however.

2. New units! lots of them, this certainly help change things up and is currently pushing out new unit every season (granted, not all of them is useful, but certainly change the feel of this game)

3. They found ways to deal with scripts, while they are certainly still around, it is not as crazy as before.

4. Season pass make more sense now, could be better however. Still lots of grinding involved to make the best out the season pass

5. Early in the release but at least the server population is way better now. Used to be pretty much dead game before.

- Negative.

1. Low hacking penalty, I mean seriously, you said you found someone hacking (and some was reported for a long time) and all they get is 4 day suspension....you serious?

2. Still buggy for non chinese language, some text will be missing etc

3. New weapon design, feedback before it came out about how the design is just not practical and they certainly never fail to not listen, Only after they release then say ""yea, it doesn't work like we hoped"". Please fix it, ask the community for help if you really did not bother playing the weapon before releasing it behind another grind of mission to unlock SKILL BY SKILL. Give some of us with massive amount of free skill point to use them instead of forcing the grind if we do not want to pay cash for them.

4. Low amount of communication after the 2 CM left (granted, even when they are around, the communication don't really feel like they exist anyway) 

5. The unlocking mission of season (units, and now skill) can be insanely annoying with some mission not having the required event for the week and cannot be done even if you willing to grind.

.6 Unit balance can certainly use a review, some units, especially when T5 start being unlocked, is still a little much. The cav and especially rattan ranger is the worse offender, for anyone new and has never see them yet, well better go train your nerve before season unlock into T5 period, you will need it.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Additional update 7 Oct 2019 : Almost nothing get changed, in fact most issue got worse and there is a lot other new BS that came out.

- There are massive amount of script or hack user AND official refuse to act on them, infact there has been no action ever since China server started
- No new unit as promised before
- Unit AND weapon balance is a massive mess right now, community opinion does not matter to them.
- Lack of communication, especially after China server came out, this server totally feel abandoned
- Battlepass require massive grind (and more than likely you will not get the reward due to insane grind) before patch there is totally 0 way to get it, now...well you can get it if you grind for at least half a day every single day (or more)+pay for battlepass+spend additional money in cash shop everyday for additional xp.

AVOID THIS GAME

Below is the old review (yet still true)

As there are mostly Chinese review...let me try to make a more detailed English version. I dont really do reviews but the latest patch just totally hit all the wrong area instead of the root of the problem, showing total incapability of the development team.

Pro

1. The combat is actually pretty decent and entertaining, some balance is still needed but overall its pretty decent compare to many other similar game.
2. This game has multiple way of playing it, you dont need to be extremely skilled to enjoy this game, only need to make sure you are constantly engaged in moving troops to the right position and support it.
3. The grind tbh is not that bad, way better than game like World of Tank etc.
4. Netcode surprisingly good, granted it seem to mostly based on the client side which open up hacking.

Con

1. Bad decision making from developer regarding balance, found a problem? nah lets not fix the root of the problem but trying to use another minor issue to try and cover that crack.
2. EXTREMELY bad risk vs reward - obvious beneficial action is not rewarded and is only based on the amount of kill you make.
3. EXTREMELY bad risk vs reward - what is the point of using high level troops with high reequiping cost only to found out you certainly is going to be losing money if that troops going to take a few death in engagement? Especially apparent in the usage of defensive units like higher level tower shield, where you are there soaking damage and doing little dmg in comparison, which result in bad score and bad rewards, AND losing money, oh winning you say? nope, you probably earn more from just spamming with 3star+ archer from behind the line (even when you lose) which also happen to have one of the lowest reequiping cost yet doing one of the highest skill and damage in a game.
4. Soul system - like seriously, its nice to have another route of progression, but having it behind a huge RNG is certainly not going to make this game balance, especially with the fact that you have 10 chance per week to open a box that you get from mission to get an item (with low drop rate as well) to do ANOTHER freaking roll for Soul (which happen to be a huge pool and often filled with useless Soul). I get it, it is to provide the foundation for future cash shop sale/item but at the very least you could had reduce the RNG factor for such an important progression route for the troops. Say no to huge P2W factor.
5. Lack of direct communication - especially after the first week of steam launch (where we can actually see some reply on steam discussion), there are people asking for help, doing hacker report, reporting problem, giving suggestion. The very least you can do is read through it and give a slight acknowledgement.
6. Lack of communication method - whats the point of providing an email if you are not going to responds to it?
7. HACKERS - I get it hacker can be hard to eliminate from game, but the fact that there is inaction to fix the situation is not very promising for the future of this game, some hack is so obvious that there should be anti cheat that can pick it up instantly. Even your so called ban wave doesn't even address the root of the problem and often manage to get the wrong guy as well. Why would we risk investing in cash shop if we might someday get a random ban out of no where as a normal player?

There are actually few other con, but I would like to see what is the action on those area before putting them down as con, what I wrote is what already proven to fail.

EDIT: The problem listed wasn't fixed by the time of this edit and more came up...now all the promised features and new units never came and updates just pretty much stopped coming. All balance changes has been rather biased against certain type of weapon, making the current gameplay experience getting worse by the day. It feel that the company just kind of abandoned the support for this server after their China server started up. Just totally not worth buying.",1565653033,1587245015,True,2,0,0.54356849193572998,0,True,False,False

您好，製作組
在遊玩200小時候，我對這遊戲開始失去耐心了。
我很喜歡攻城模式，無論輸贏，我都盡心盡力去盡我所能
我無懼我士兵全滅或是我裝備破損，只要能增加0.1% 得勝的機會我就傾心投入所有資源。
然而，我發現就算攻城模式戰勝，仍然無法補足我損失的兵裝與我的裝備磨損。
於是我花更多時間去遊玩人機模式以賺取足夠的錢讓我收支打平

我發現這遊戲的遊戲體驗一天比一天的差，開始覺得這遊戲的變化越來越了無新意，
加上中國國慶期間只剩下私訊頻道可以用，遊戲內宛如鬼城。
這週大概是我覺得這遊戲最糟糕的一週，因為組攻城，組土匪無法在遊戲內問，使得人與人的溝通變的超級超級難。
這週二還為了你們中國的同胞放假，領地戰也休戰一次。
中秋節就沒休戰，你們國慶就休戰喔?
那我們國慶10/10 那週三天連假，下周六你敢不敢也休戰一次?
要不要國父誕辰11/12也休戰算了?

教團兵種一直不出，遊戲幣收益也一直不改好一點。
我真的受夠每天農錢幣的日子了，PVP都是負收益，根本沒人受的住啦
晚上八點同時在線人數只有2000， 我看了都難過....

個人建議野戰奪旗和攻城演習消耗慮降低個90%
最好是部隊被全滅個10次才會掉一個兵裝。
不然遲早攻城演習會變成農民大會。

目前這遊戲我真的推薦不下去，含淚改負評。

====I used to recommend this game, but now I change my mind======
遊戲蠻好玩的，這個價格值得入手
尤其是攻城戰非常的迷人。

個人玩了兩個月之後，覺得累了。
因為這遊戲的競技設計很不錯，但是經濟系統很差，所以花很多時間在農遊戲幣。  
希望開發組可以改善經濟的部分。

I really like this game.
It has verify unit to use.
Seige Battle really amazing, no sh*t

Pros: Easy control with aim assist available for beginners to use. Equipment progression makes your character stronger, those who like RPG elements will like this.

Why i don't recommend this. Mainly due to the lack of any way to overcome enemy higher gear or level than you.

Cons: You get matched with people well geared and stronger units than you in matches when you are around 30+ level. Your full killer combo may only deal 1/5 of his full hp, but he can melt you down before his full combo is completed. Its more gear based, and skills are unable to help u overcome that.

The gameplay consists of your customized character and chosen weapon, and a team of 10 on either side each with 1 unit of soilders at a time, each with their own roles. (eg. Archers Spears pikes swords) Combat is fluent and skill based as well as the minor tactics and teamwork used when coordinating with your teammates as to how your units should be used. (I especially enjoy the seige battles and multi tier segments. (eg. Scaling the walls with siege equipment, taking the inner city) 
Progression is slow and a little grindy, i myself spent many hours just obtaing enough resourses to upgrade my lvl 30 equipment and make my first cavalry unit. I havent myself encountered any bugs or glitches or connectivity issues at all out of Australia

Ok now I've been playing this game constantly for a few weeks now and I'm loving it.  It's a MMO with character development with fps (mainly) sword fighting combat and many different units to specialise in and grow.  Your units usually do more damage than you will, and keeping them alive and using at the best times is key to winning.

I forgot to mention territory wars - wars to seize lands from others and to defend your own which is reminiscent of Eve online

On the downside, the Aus server is located somewhere in South East Asia and there are MANY chinese non english speakers you have to try to work with.. unless you join an English house like I have where we can work tactics together.

Firstly, this game is great, You are looking at hours of endless fun (especially if you get your 2 am gaming crew together, squad up and go on a multiplayer castle siege that makes Warband look like childs play.

This game pulls aspects from a variety of games including M&B (leaving a fief basically turns the game into Mount and Blade) Dynasty Warriors (the in game combat is a few heroes versus each other and their units) Dragon Age (Real time combat orders for your troops, very fluid and user friendly with a few basic orders for troops) There is also squad formations which can be incredibly powerful when used effectively.

When you enter the game you're shown the basics of the game (which is literally all you need to know to pick this up and start trying to rule one of the 5 kingdoms you get to pick as a starting location, pretty sure you can go to other cities later but I'm not that far in yet)

This game is doing very well and I truly hope it takes off, as long as the developers pay attention to the wants of the consumer this game could go far. Maybe adding a single player aspect eventually, basically the same as online play but its you against AI controlled characters.

The only issue I've got with this game so far is that I'm sitting at a constant 200 ping. I'm playing in mainland China, i assumed because this game has Chinese as a supported language that there would also be a Chinese server. I was wrong, im not sure about others but for me there is only one server to connect to at the moment. I am sure it will change eventually but for the moment there's going to be lag for most of us here.

If you have bought the EA edition, don't blow your in-game currency on cosmetics. Buy useful items like squad extensions so you can hold more units and experience boosts so you level faster. The higher your level, the better your units and more fun you'll have rolling over people.
