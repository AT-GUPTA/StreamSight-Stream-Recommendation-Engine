[b]Note:[/b] I have played with a lot of strangers and have never had any issues with finding a team, but I have also not found a single person purposefully ruining for others. Hopefully you would have the same experience. 

[h1] Story [/h1]
Super Earth, our home, is governed by managed democracy, a system so streamlined and perfect that you don't need to vote a computer does it for you. 
But our way of life is under attack the aliens want nothing but our total eradication, Super Earth will not buckle, we will not give in, we will spread managed democracy until peace and prosperity reigns again! 

Would you believe that this game is a satirical? [i]Starship Troopers[/i] is one clear influence as evidence by several achievements being quotes from the movie. If you delve deeper and read the in-game news that preface and outro a frontline you will find other interesting things such as implying the entire war was based on a lie, and that they did not have the destructive weaponry Super Earth claimed, or that anyone who doubts Super Earth’s official stories on their Casus Belli are labelled “sympathisers”. I would say the game has a sort of sardonic wit and style, so I found myself enjoying reading the various entries backstories and the tactical information on your enemies. 
With that said the writing is completely optional, there is no storyline or anything like that only the Galactic Campaign where you defend Super Earth's right to suppress protestors with SMGs.

[h1] Presentation [/h1] 
[i]Helldivers[/i] has a remarkably diverse set of enemies, the three factions all have their own unique style from a cybernetic body horror to crustacean insects, and within each faction you can easily tell everything apart. It is very easy to know what you are fighting, so it is easy to know what tactics will be effective. You might have been able to confuse certain enemies, however, these are typically exclusive to different difficulties, and so they pose no issue when actually playing the game.  
There are also themes for each faction, and yeah, they are also great, adding further personality to each faction and solidifying them as different experiences. There are variations with different intensities for each faction to accompany the added difficulties of higher drops which works really well, remarkably I have never gotten bored with the soundtrack, but my personal favourites are the high difficulty Illuminate or perhaps the boss themes.    
There is also some variety with planets snow, volcanic, swamp, deserts of cities, but in all honestly all planets of a type look the same, which is not lovely, but it is not something I hold against the game either, luckily there are certain changes depending on the faction that controls it. 

Since [i]Helldivers[/i] can get very hectic it is a good thing that the developers tried to remedy that with aural and visual cues. Helldivers will call out when they are reloading, when they drop down, and the countdowns for stratagems are very explicit so you rarely get a tank dropped on your face if you are paying attention, but in war all kinds of things happen. 
The voiced callouts are the best and most fun, I really like how they shout out their hatred of the enemies of democracy as they are firing, and being able to quickly and easily communicate within the game and its four basic audio emotes is cool, but sometimes people do not ”stop” when you ask, them and so they get a face full of lava. 

You are also given customisation options to differentiate your own helldiver from the masses. I always love this in games so of course I love it here, but it's not all sunshine and roses, it takes a while to unlock all options and a lot of the cooler armour pieces are DLC. 

[h1] Gameplay [/h1]
The key to defeating the alien scum that threatens Super Earth is acquiring contribution to the Galactic Campaign. As players collect more and more we push our enemies further away from our home world and closer to theirs, eventually we can launch an invasion and hopefully deal with them for good, but if we do not collect enough contribution they will push us back, and if Super Earth falls then all will be lost 
So completing planets, especially on higher difficulties, is important to winning but so is defending regional capitals so as to stop their advance. It helps that the city centres are the most fun missions in the game, at least in my opinion. 

Regardless once you have a planet you can choose to do drops, each one has a selection to choose from but on your standard planet you will need to compete them all to gain contribution. Once done you can choose your loadout from a large selection of weapons with different benefits and drawbacks as well as powerful perks and game-changing stratagems. You get missile strikes, heavy weaponry, vehicles, and various defensive measures. If you are in a team you may want to coordinate your equipment, but unless you are playing at the highest difficulties or if you are bad, it will not make a major difference as long as you use something that is somewhat useful. 
Once planetside you will need to make a lot of decisions, which objective to tackle first, what route do we take, do we circle around the patrol, do we kill them? And many more. 
It is often the case that you will try and kill patrols before they sound an alarm otherwise you will quickly be swarmed with enemies, both options are fun but ideally you will actually complete the planet and to do that it is best to have good synergy and a common goal with your team. Certain players are definitely sample-addicted and will beeline towards any research they see, and since you share a screen that can be annoying, but it only rarely jeopardises the mission. 

There is also a lot of variety in the actual drops, you always get a selection of different missions and they require you to do various things, from assassinating a target, disarming mines, escorting someone, defending missile launchers etc. 
Failing a mission does not mean that everything is lost, as long as you evacuate you will receive all research you collected (used for upgrades), however a low number of deaths, no failed objectives and full evacuation is required for full contribution. Since each criteria corresponds to a third of the contribution it might be useful to destroy the objectives yourselves if you have already failed one, so as to make the run faster and not waste valuable resources, or lives.
Added to this is the differences between factions against the Cyborgs it is hard to fully stealth so it turns into a tactical strike in a warzone, against the Illuminate it feels more like a special operation in hostile territory while the last one is a bug hunt. I enjoy all of them and I enjoy fighting all the factions, I love the variety and it has kept me interested in the game. 

Worth noting the differences between KBM and a controller, I have used both, but all my PC playtime is with a keyboard. A lot of people agree that aiming is more precise with a mouse, but it is called ""twin-stick-shooter"" so it is not like a controller is useless. 
The more important difference is grenades and stratagems, with a mouse they land exactly at your cursor, provided your throwing arm is strong enough, but a controller is more flexible, you can throw grenades or stratagems off-screen, which can be the difference between calling in an artillery strike next to you or on a group of enemies. Ultimately it is down to preference, but they are also best suited for different things.",1703327874,1708858230,True,25,0,0.743230640888214111,0,True,False,False

Improve, if criticism is grounded on arguments. In the end, you will find decent helldivers to fight on all kinds of planets, winter ones included. Changing the review to positive. The earlier version of review will stay here for history purposes.

______________________________________________________________

This game forces you to buy DLC with All-Terrain Boots. Otherwise, say goodbye to winter missions on higher difficulties. Annoying.

Don't get me wrong. The game is cool overall, it is this DLC policy that is really outrageous. Yes, you can say that this DLC is cheap but why should I buy something that must be in the base game to start with or absent from it altogether?

I am ok with this difficulty mod on winter planets, which require you to play more carefully and avoid patrols to not get killed easily. I am not ok with people spamming these All-Terrain Boots and forcing others to move faster and kite hordes of enemies when it is simply not possible in snow (even with Jet Packs, yes. Because you tend to lose them upon death).

To not have this DLC means that if u join someone to assist with their winter mission, you just end up like a burden and receive a negative feedback from full stacks or even 1-2 people with DLC content.

Helldivers is a top down, 4 player coop, twin stick shooter. It's an odd mix that works surprisingly well.

It combines the likes of starship troopers, aliens and a sprinkle of 40k to bring us a game that wants to serve up some nice hot liber-tea.

I bought it again here to play on Steamdeck, which it runs perfectly on and is 100% functional. I have never tried playing it with a mouse & keyboard so I don't know how functional, if at all, that is.

It is a fantastic game and is absolutely worth the full price with all the DLCs(which give you access to new weapons, stratagems, perks and cosmetics), even better if it is on sale.
However it can be very difficult if you aren't ready or haven't had enough practice and can require a good team effort or a lot of dedication.


It's a hardcore, mission-based, 1 to 4 player, top down, twin stick shooter. You select a mission from the ship, choose your loadout then drop into the level and must complete the listed objective and then extract. 
All players stay on the same screen at all times and have to work together.
Each mission will typically last from 5 to 25 minutes depending on the difficulty of the mission and skill of the team. 


As you and other players around the world complete missions against a faction it gets closer to completely defeating that faction, at the end everyone can do special missions against that faction's home planet and once those are completed the faction will be removed from the map until the next War (kind of like a season). Once all three factions are completely defeated the War will end and a new one will start, completely resetting the missions and faction progress.

Everyone in a team can see the entire loadout of their teammates on the confirmation screen so it's easy to cooperate even without voice or text chat. 
In the actual missions you can also see each players' primary and support weapon, how much ammo they have of their currently equipped weapon, how many grenades they have and the cooldown timer of their stratagems.

You have limited ammo for your weapons which can only be restocked by calling for an ammo resupply with a stratagem or finding crates on some missions. 
When you reload your gun, all remaining ammo in it is discarded - This isn't an FPS where you reload after every single shot

If you die, your teammates must call for a reinforcement with a stratagem, then you will be dropped back into the mission in a new pod. Your ammo will be reset to half capacity and any items you had on you (support weapon, backpack etc) will be on the ground where you died.
If all players die but someone was able to call for a reinforce in time, they will drop the beacon and all players will come back at the same time.
In single player you will be automatically revived once, and get an additional auto revive each mission objective completed.



The only potential issue I have, which is very minor, is that the PC version seems to have a couple bugs that I never encountered on the PS version, such as sometimes being killed immediately after starting a mission because your teammate's drop pod lands too close to or directly on top of yours, or rarely scout enemies not sounding the alarm after detecting you.",1671646354,1706726861,True,22,1,0.728098154067993164,0,True,False,False

If you are looking for a twin stick shooter for single player sessions - this might not be the best fit (even though you could do worse). HELLDIVERS is made for [B]co-operative[/B] play and this is definitely were the game shines. It has the Arrowhead twisted version of co-operation where you [I]really[/I] must work together, but at the same time your squad is often what (accidentally) kills you.
The twin stick/top-down shooter action is top notch. It is one of my favourite in the genre as the more tactical feel (rather than frantic shooting) is just up my alley. The accidentally-kill-your-squad chaotic action might be overwhelming at first, but if you play with the same squad you'll start to finetune your tactics and strategy, and that actually makes the game even more co-operative than most games in the same genre.

Wont detect my xbox controller, despite it working fine in the Steam test app, and every other game Ive tried. No manual option in the settings. their ""Detect"" option doesnt detect anything either.

why?
does this game have any pvp aspects? no 
an online in-game store with mtx? nope
were cheaters prevalent? in my thousands of hours wasted in pve coops I have yet to encounter a single cheater. doesn't mean they don't exist but they are exceedingly rare. 

I guess the devs looked at some random stan with no social life, who probably complained on reddit and decided to go ahead and implement an anti-cheat in a pve coop. 

this is why modern games suck ass through a straw. I can play ancient games in coop with my gf and give her some cheats in order to compensate for the fact that she isn't a diehard gamer but in modern games I have for some reason less options at my disposal.

No one is joining the lobby despite using a tool in game that is meant to help matchmaking show it is urgent. No clue how dying multiple times to enemies with extremely unfair advantages such as knockdowns, projectiles, rushing you in a horde, etc. is meant to be fun.
Enemies are ""searching"" for you, but somehow have an auto-lock on your position despite you doing nothing to alert them. I walk on one side of an area, they head that way, i turned around to walk up behind them, they turned around immediately. ""Dogs"" in the game will charge and pounce on you, knocking you down and leaving you defenseless as you're shot at, get grenades thrown at you, and they charge at you again right before you get up.
It has unique aspects that alone would have been fun, such as everything killing you including your own weaponry and evacuation ship. I can see how this could potentially be fun should it be played by someone who knows what they're doing, but as someone who is thrown into serious missions solo after a brief tutorial that explains the basics, it is not fun at all. 
No AI helpers, no real consideration for someone who cannot get a single person to join their lobby throughout multiple attempts.
As stated, i passed the first mission, only after an hour of playing, but the 2nd ""easy"" mission was just too much. It's the same thing. Dogs charge you, knock you down. If you kill them, your bullets alert guards, who then call for reinforcements. You get surrounded and die. You can try to run away, but snow slows you down, of which 85% of the map is covered in.
All in all, worst experience i've ever played. Dark Souls, Hotline Miami, and every Vampire Survivors clone i have ever played is more fun and welcoming than this.

It's similar to L4D2 in a way you can just boot it up with friends and have a blast together or listening to music and relaxing while playing with randoms or solo.

You might be worried you won't find a group to play with, but I assure you as of now the community is very much alive. I have zero issues finding players in matches especially for harder difficulty missions where they're most needed and so far haven't faced any serious toxicity from anyone, the worst offense is someone rushing ahead pulling the shared screen toward them and away from the rest of the squad, but if you are the host you can kick them or anyone who refuses to comply with your rules. That said this is a co-op PvE so be also considerate - don't hijack your whole squad to journey across the map for 1 sample. Everyone wants to have fun and compromises have to be made.

The game has 15 levels of difficulty, each getting progressively harder. The gameplay starts with you choosing location where to deploy on the map and then you can start calling in your gear while hopefully undetected. Enemy patrols the map in small sized groups which upon spotting the helldivers at certain distance call in reinforcement which are basically entire armies in comparison to the patrol sizes, so you can and ideally should stealth through missions as much as possible, but that's much easier said than done and the combat is so much fun it doesn't even feel like a punishment. Decent variety of weapons and large variety of skills to bring into each match.

I haven't mastered anything in the game yet, but I certainly want to play more and I can only recommend buying it, especially when it's on sale with all the DLCs.",1703976727,1703976727,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Helldivers features numerous weaponry all with it's own unique ways of playstyle and strategy, perks, as well as vehicles. Play it alone or with up to three other fellow Helldivers, deploying from ODST-style drop-pods from high-orbit.

Graphics are good enough, I tweaked some settings in nvidia instead of in game to try get better graphics. Most computers will have no issues whatsoever with this game.

Sound effects are good, and the game is easy to get into but a hard to master. Every weapon and gadget has its uses, allthough on higher difficulties some become obsolete - as some gadgets are better suited for tougher enemies.

Interestingly, the three types of enemies differs very much from one another, which encourages you to try out other weapons, gadgets and combos. And your loadout can be even more customized when playing with others because you can then play different classes, like ""support"" or ""assault"" and etc. When playing alone you have to be more versatile, and be prepared for anything. I enjoy playing by myself and online, but it's the most enjoyable playing with someone you know!

I would define this game with the phrase ""controlled chaos"". It's a perfect middleground between seriousness and fun. It's also on sale very often with 75% off so for 5 Euros it's a must have. 

Dont expect updates for this game, or more content. But at least it runs perfect and there are no bugs...

First off, it's Starship Troopers and that's one of my favorite movies. You fight the bugs, you have the propaganda, you yell hilarious lines like (have a cup of Liber-Tea). Second, there's a ton of weapon options, strategems for support, enemy variety. Extracting at the end of a mission when you're under enemy fire and you've rezzed your friends multiple times is so exciting and fulfilling. Third, I like the upgrade system, but I do have to say you level up way too slowly in this game. I've been level 18 for over a year.

The downsides to this game, are that you really need friends with mics to play this game. There are no bots to help you, and playing by yourself is doable up to about difficulty 6 planets. Even with 2 or 3 players I haven't been able to play past difficulty 8. You can say we just suck, but we've all put quite a few hours into it.

Overall, I have always had a ton of fun with this game. I wish I could muster a team long enough to beat some of the more difficult missions but medium-difficulty missions have their own charm as well.

Even though the structure of the game is... Fundementally flawed, Its alot of fun, and its community is very friendly. What you see is what you get- but if you DO get this, you should keep a few things in mind.

Cons
1. More than just a few guns and stratagems are either quite useless, too situational, or inferior. You can use some of 'em, sure, but your probably not gonna find any unexpected synergies outside the meta. 
Also its basically mandatory to bring an ammo drop stratagem if you're packing solid-munitions, so for most general purpose loadouts, you're probably gonna be using an energy weapon.

2. Finding weapons/stratagems that can take down Bigger foes is annoying as hell-  Alot of them aren't powerful enough to do the job, or very unergonomic and put yourself at risk- Anything that you can actually count on will have very little ammo or a very high cooldown.

3. Snow planets are ass. like, serious ass. The snow slows you down, which makes traveling around the map obnoxiously slow and survival ALOT harder if you don't bring your Snow shoes. Fuck snow.

4. The game Isn't made to accommodate Solo play and it shows. Lower difficulties will be boring as ever, but medium-difficulty missions will be very time consuming. Don't even think about going above 10 unless you're a badass whose ready to put themselves through the wringer.

5. Depending on how the War is going, You can't always chose to fight against your preferred enemies, and thats kind of a drag because I've literally met noone who actually *likes* to fight the Illuminates, but eventually you'll probably have to do it.

6. ALOT of useful gear is locked behind DLC. It alone is a sin that the Snow Shoes are locked behind a DLC because of just how shitty ice planets are.",1699095452,1699095724,True,20,0,0.709518074989318848,0,True,False,False

- Randoms messing up objectives? Just laugh and focus on surviving the mission
- Matched with 3 well organized guys? Try your best to adapt to them

The 4 in game orders/responses are more than enough for effective communication. ""Yes, No, Wait, Move"" 
I cannot stress enough how well organized I've been able to play with randoms (most of the time) just by using those 4 commands.

Only complains are ""balancing"" wise:

- Rumbler (a weapon) is amazing but too OP. Depends on difficulty level. Some weapons are plain irrelevant after Lv12 missions. This weapon is an all in one package, you can wreck everything with it easily.

On the other side, it is a needed advantage when you get a swarm of 6 or more tanks on +13 missions and up... So we kinda need less enemy tanky units spawning OR more Anti Tank wep options for such big swarms (just my take, I might be missing something).

All in all, this is a great game, I HOPE Helldivers 2 comes as fun as this one is. My first 100% achievement in steam, +400 hrs played and slowly adding more, many level resets just cuz why not...

[h1][b]Helldivers[/b][/h1]
[b]A satrical vision of earth were it taken over by America at some point during or before space exploration.[/b] Helldivers puts you in control of an unlimited amount of SUPER EARTH soldiers and all the lack of saftey and proper training that comes with. Mostly an enjoyable experience kneecapped by it's own encouragement of multiplayer aspects. This is not a good singleplayer game at all and you should avoid it if you do not intend to play with three other friends looking for a game that doesn't respect it's own hazardous and humorous volatile munitions.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1470888011

[h1][b] Gameplay [/b][/h1]
[b]The second biggest selling point.[/b] Right up there next to it's over the top humor and stylistic art that I assume is intended to parody starship troopers and ape halo's ODST delivery system(or some other game I dunno who did it first). The gameplay at it's core is solid, but favors controllers a little too hard. Twin stick shooters are often made for controllers, but actually work best with a mouse and keyboard when the developer has a strong enough grasp of coding to make it work.

Among the framework for the game you'll find joyous punchy gunplay and giggle worthy lines of dialogue spewed from your character. Aiming and firing in this game is about as good as it can get and I only think Alien swarm does a better job. But that's a game that DOES respect mouse and keyboard play so it's not really a fair comparison. You also have diving, running, grenade throwing and strategems.

Strategems are a hugely important aspect of the game that seperate it from most top down shooters. Enabling you to summon reloads, airstrikes, reinforcements, turrets, vehicles and all sorts of other shit. And with how over the top this game is you can expect many mistakes and boons from the giant pods that deliver these. Allies killed by a tank you dropped. An enemy killed by an ammo reload you dropped. Calling in a railgun to kill a huge enemy and killing them with the delivery crate. Killing an ally when summoning another ally back. It all happens at some point to varying degrees of hilarity and frustration.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1470890925

And with this the first element of why this is a 'multiplayer only' game to me comes to surface. While you will go down when you're low on health and can get back up on your own, there are few situations at middle to late game where you will ever get back up if you go down. 

Not only is the game MASSIVELY HARDER playing solo, once you're outta lives you lose. This is even more frustrating when you have completed all the objectives and get killed waiting for evac. Respawn and send a guy down (why?) and then die again and lose. This is bad game design and also makes no sense. Seriously this is the second worst part of the game.

So what's the worst part? Well it's the fucking view. In singleplayer it's pretty tolerable. You can aim a direction and the camera will shift that way to help you see further. It's rare for the view in singleplayer to suck ass. In multiplayer though the view struggles to keep the camera around everyone.

Holy.
Fucking.
Shit.

What atrocious game design. I don't give a fuck if this is intended to be 'funny' or 'goofy' this is horrible. More often than not we'll have one guy who gets seperated from everyone else and now suddenly we can't fucking see and then can't fucking move farther to get away from enemies. This causes at least one person's death. Why is the game like this? This is stupid as hell and is almost bad enough to not recommend the game from solely. If it wasn't for the rest of the game being so good then I'd tell everyone to steer clear of this abomination. Split screen cameras were made FOR SPLIT SCREENS. Don't enforce it on players playing online.

And I wanna point out that the difficulty in this game is regularly too dependant on you rushing. I fucking hate games that rush you. If you don't rush you won't have enough supplies to make it through. And some later missions really require you to have heavy weapons or you can't even kill some of the enemies. This sucks. And with the way the views work you will often find yourself being run down and instantly killed by an enemy you couldn't even react to. What piss poor design choices there.

Ok so I got that off my chest. If you can believe it, the rest of this game is pretty great. I disapprove of the forced 'galaxy' war system that they have and the forced 'end of war cutscene' you have to watch every time you login after a week, but it's a pretty good game. I think the gunplay for this is some of the best in the top down genre and that there aren't that many that match it. The Halo twin stick shooters have some nice gameplay too, but they're fucked cause they don't have multiplayer.

[h1][b] Graphics [/b][/h1]
[b]The area between mobile game quality and something good.[/b] Because the camera is often zoomed out a decent amount the graphics are often pretty tolerable. But only just so for the majority of the time. Some of the environment look really nice as well. I like the chosen colors for the players and I think the models are well made. I like seeing the enemies start to fall apart as you damage them and I do definitely feel some heart in how the graphics were made.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1470888939

But augh, the homeworld have this really UGLY tint to the screen. The bugs have yellow tint. The cyborgs have red and I forget what the others have. AUGH. GROSS. It's very distracting and ruins the invasions of the enemy homeworlds. Not to mention the environments don't even LOOK different. They just have this ugly tint.

Speaking of the enemies, they have some nice variety. Cyborgs aren't something done in many games so I enjoyed to have them around. The bugs are just bugs. Most games have that sorta alien. They're satisfying to kill though so I won't complain. The sorta energy based aliens are my favorite though. I really like energy based aliens and I also find them to feel the most unique. Unfortunately they're also the most frustrating to understand how to even fight.

[h1][b] Sound [/b][/h1]
[b]The clink of a near empty magazine is what seperate good sound design from average.[/b] Although I feel they failed in making the views and graphics really noteworthy, their sound cues are top notch. You'd be surprised how uncommon it is to have the 'click click click' of a near empty clip and how often you miss having sound cues rather than visual to let you know something. This game seems to understand that sound cues are important has a ton of them. Enemy being signalled or letting you know they're about to signal. You get a visual and audio cue.

[h1][b] Story [/b][/h1]
[b]Let's not be silly here, there is no real story.[/b] But I will point out that you're just SUPER EARTH and you're being assholes and taking over the universe while fake propaganda calls you the good guys. That's it. Don't pay this game for the story.

[h1][b] The Developer [/b][/h1]
[b]This is the Magicka devs.[/b] I currently don't feel strongly about these devs. And the reason behind that is I'm not sure who's at fault for shutting down 'Magicak: Wizard wars' since it's reportedly on paradox interactive's shoulders (they're a publisher). So I'm reserving judgement. That means I have no strong feelings either way about them. Strictly meh.

[h1] In Conclusion [/h1] 
A good game for a party of 4 players who can tolerate volatile game mechanics and piss poor camera or for a single player who enjoys utter chaos when joining multiplayer games.

The game has a ton of variety! You got standard weapons you can take with you, call in weapons, call in strikes call in defensive emplacements and personal buffs each with a dozen options!

You can costumzie your loadout to your hearts content: wanna be reckless? Bring all the airstrikes you can fit and go ham! Prefer the hands on approach? Call down heavy weapons and backpack utilities! You get the idea.

When you get a team it can become a wonder everyone can bring different gear which with a good synergy can turn even the hardest difficulties easy. Someone can bring mechs for everyone. The other can bring 4 nukes to total everything, then the next can bring turrets for defense but no need to specialize anyone can bring the pieces with themselves and be a force to be reckoned with.

Finding games is quite easy! The community is very active and helpful!

While dying is quite easy in a team anyone can revive you making lives infinite so long as the one calling in doesnt have cooldown in effect.

TLDR version: a great, tough tactical shooter which can feel quite arcedy with a good team. So pop in and give the enemies of Super Earth hell! Also don't forget october 26th.",1694634876,1694634876,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

1. Play through 5-10 very easy solo missions before you start messing with Multiplayer missions.

2. The run button (Shift) is by default a toggle.

3. There's a ton of hectic stratagems to call in and it takes a while to learn them.

4. Don't drop right on the objective unless you really know what you're doing.

5. Grinding missions for samples gets old. I guess find a group to level up and get unlocks and samples for research points that way. 

6. Watch out for the lava spewing all over you while enemies laser you from off-screen.

Game is hectic and good and awesome and fun but eh, just not for me right now. It's kinda hard to learn the combos for stratagems while being murdered, and the icons aren't super helpful with no tooltips to tell you what you have equipped until you memorize them.

Are you?

HELLDIVERS is a very enjoyable experience if you like chaos, friendly fire, and bombastic sounds and effects. Friendly fire is a major selling point, do not feel bad if you kill your teammates as you will very much one shot and be one shotted by many weapons including from your allies. The game also rewards skill and thinking under pressure, if you have played magicka you will know how Arrowhead Studios handles their coop combat games. Abilities called stratagems, are activated by inputting a series of inputs be it a D-pad on a controller or WASD, once the correct code is inputted, your character holds a beacon that you must throw to call it down wherever you wish. The fun part begins here, as you unlock deadlier stratagems, the danger for you and your allies increases as well. You can call down support weapons like anti-tank weapons and heavy machine guns, and end up being able to call down artillery barrages, missile strikes, napalm walls, heavy cannon strafing runs, and then a tactical nuke. Enemies are relentless and will not stop spawning throughout the entire mission, that is if you are spotted. The stealth in HELLDIVERS is all about blasting the patrols before they detect you instead of sneaking. Once you are detected, the enemies will spawn near the edges of your screen or sometimes on top of you and then things get intense. Those stratagems from earlier are very useful here and inputting the codes under fire and in the ensuing chaos is something that will save you, your team, and the mission, that is if you don't throw it at your feet.

HELLDIVERS does have a fair amount of references and easter eggs to many pop-culture and science-fiction works, like novels, films, or other video games. Admittedly, the game is lacking in lore and background, and there is no story, but it is meant as a couch coop twin-stick shooter and lack of story here is not a drawback.

The skill ceiling is high, and players who can input codes quickly, clutch a revive stratagem, or know what to do in different situations will help their team and finish missions. You will get killed A LOT, and you will kill your teammates, A LOT, but as long as one player is alive, they can call down a revive stratagem so all hope is not lost. The game rewards cooperation and performing under pressure, as the enemies and your weapons are very deadly. You are still just a human in the end, and the enemies will stop at nothing to use what is available to them to kill you, as you will use what you have to do the same to them.

The game is intended for co-op and up to 4 players at once but being a chronic introvert I actively try to avoid the scenario this game was optimised for.

The gameplay is a tactical arcade-y affair with a focus on resource scarcity as your gun runs out of ammo and grenades are in limited supply. This brings in the real time strategy aspect as you are constantly calling down supplies, turrets, and vehicles using long strings of d-pad inputs like you're performing a fatality. Combined with the large open levels with key objectives it feels like an action oriented Warcraft 3 by way of Starship Troopers.

The gameplay is great, it's so much fun to mow down bugs/cyborgs with tons of different weapons. I love that the ammo mechanic is magazine based. Which means, if you reload with some ammo left in the magazine you discard, that ammo is lost. Just like in the good Battlefield games. It helps with the immersion of being a soldier on this hostile planet surrounded by enemies. There are loads of vehicles, airstrikes, drones, turrets and more, that you can call in, adding to the fun.

I think there are only 2 flaws to the game. On higher difficulties, tank units spawn very often, so you're kinda forced to bring lots of anti-tank equipment. This essentially limits the loadout variations drastically. If you play on high difficulties all the time, the only thing you can really change are your main weapons, because most of your equipment will stay the same to deal with the constant tanks.

The second flaw is the online-only campaign. The campaign being online and all players adding to the progress, makes you not very invested in it. The contribution you deliver is basically nothing in the grand scheme of things and often campaigns are won and lost with little to no of your involvement. The game may as well not even have a campaign because it never feels like you contributed anything to it.

[h1] 💎         SAME GENRE COMPARISON:[/h1]
* Up to 4 players offline & online coop
* Sentry gun would kill ourselves too
* Easily dies
* Unlockable Vehicle
* Unlockable Mech

[h1]  🔊         TESTER MUST KNOW:[/h1]
* Have to press row of arrow keys to perform each action = deploy / equip each time
* Cannot Pause while playing solo
* Cannot turn off friendly fire
* Stay away from landing supply drop, that kill us
* Die in mission earn nothing = No exp / no $
* Easy mode is not easy
* Cross platform is Galactic Campaign = Share Wars, not lobby
* Offline mode available
* Very limited player customization

[h1]  ⚠️        RUMOR CHECKING:[/h1]
* Best team killing game ever with 1200+ hours ➜ True
* Grindy ➜ Require 30+hours to unlock all the base items
* DLC is both expensive and necessary ➜ Yes, for hardcore difficulties
* We cannot fight that faction again when the war is over, which you enjoyed ➜ Wait for a week or longer.
* Community easily kick player from game ➜ Because player didn't own DLC
* Some factions are preferred over others ➜ Resulting in the same faction often being left over
* Unlucky enough to log in at the end of the war ➜ For for people that cannot log in often enough to see all the variety
* Not fun for veteran play together with newbie ➜ Because newbie skipped tutorial
* The biggest threat to you in Helldivers is actually your own team ➜ Because coop game need cooperative
* Having great fun with my 7 & 9 year old kids on this game ➜ So sweet

HELLDIVERS is a top down, 4-player cooperative shooter. It is set in a hyper parody sci-fi universe in which the democratic Super Earth is fighting in a 3 front war for the sake of freedom. Very cool, very fun. Takes itself very seriously.*

Lets get into the gripes and grandeur of this title right away, starting with the issues of the game.

[1.] Lack of Story
The second you get into the game, the entire story is laid out for you. If you don't understand it, it is unlikely any amount of playtime will get you there. There is simply not a focus on story in this title. This is made up for in other aspects of the game's mechanics and playstyle that make the lacking story a rather unimportant side detail. Still, if story is an important aspect of a game for you, this is certainly something to consider.

[2.] Required Cooperation, ""Required"" Friends
This game is no joke. You are diving into a hellscape of whatever you want to call the aliens you're fighting, and I mean that literally. If you're playing on any difficulty higher than game journalist, the fact is that there are enemies and there is a lot of them. This means that the higher difficultly (and by extension, higher amounts of fun) missions quickly become impossible for a solo player to overcome and can certainly lead to frustration. 
The good news? This game has a fairly dedicated and (mostly) non-toxic fanbase, who are often playing public lobbies open for you to easily hop into and join the Zurg slaying fun. Still, having your own friends who are willing to play with you or just having cracked gamer skills is certainly going to make the game easier and (again, by extension) more fun.

[3.] Galactic ""Campaign""
Here comes my first real gripe in the game's systems, and I don't really have any jokes about this one. 
The Galactic Campaign is a fairly unique campaign system which dictates the missions you will go on, the environments they will be in, and the enemies you will face. The galactic map is fairly large and 3 factions are available at the beginning of a war to fight. The 3 factions are very different to fight against. Some are big, sloppy bugs. Others, cyborgs with miniguns and cannons. And herein lies the issue.
The largest draw of this game is its fun, alien destroying combat. It's fluid, its well put together, and feels natural. Players are usually incentivized to move between the 3 factions to unlock new gear and get a better understanding of the challenges each faction provides. There is an issue with this only because the way the galactic campaign is set up means that oftentimes, the easier or more fun to fight factions can be quickly defeated. When this happens, the faction CANNOT be fought again until the start of the next war, which can be days/weeks/months away from happening. This means that players might not get to experiment and try out all of the content in the game, despite having paid a nice $20 to do so.
((IN SHORT: THE CAMPAIGN SETUP MAKES IT SOMETIMES IMPOSSIBLE TO ACCESS THE GAME CONTENT. THERE IS NO WAY TO ACCESS THE OLD REGIONS AND THERE IS NO PERSONAL, OFFLINE CAMPAIGN.))

Now that is out of the way, we can move on to what makes HELLDIVERS fun. I'll keep it short.

[1.] Expertly crafted mechanics.
All of the actual gameplay mechanics in this game are seasoned to perfection. The combat, movement, and more all are fluid and natural feeling. Players can quickly pick up how to move around, shoot, aim, and even call down stratagems and other equipment. This means a fairly small portion of the game is you having to spend time learning HOW to play it and spent actually playing.

[2.] Cooperative leaning gameplay.
While the needed cooperation on harder difficulties can be frustrating when you want to play alone, the reality is that HELLDIVERS is much more enjoyable with other players anyway. There is nothing quite like finding a team that can expertly work together and communicate to bring a mission to a close. There will be the times of struggle, of people accidentally teamkilling, but this is just the beauty of HELLDIVERS. If you play, you'll understand why it cannot be any other way.

[3.] Highly configurable playstyles.
How do you want to play HELLDIVERS? Do you want to run around with a sniper rifle picking off the far enemies for your team? Want to call down heavy turrets and stationary defense to protect the objectives or close off enemy pathways? Or maybe you want to summon giant, armored mechs with autocannons for hands to rip apart the gunners attacking your squad with heavy gunfire. 
The beauty of the game is that you can do any of these things, and there are a million other possibilities. A large selection of optimized, powerful weapons for the base arsenal and a massive amount of options for high powered stratagems means you can absolutely find a loadout that works for you and allows you to be an asset of destruction and team player all in one. And believe me this makes the game fun.

There you have it. Lets end on a final note in which I tell you with complete honesty that this game is very, very good. It's well put together, fun to play, and allows for endless, arcade style fun to be had. With a sequel not far away, (coming later this year) and a complete asking price of $20, you will certainly get bang for your buck with this title. I could not recommend this game more, despite it's very minor shortcomings, due to the very real fun and laughter that is to be had in this game.

The pros are that there is surprising variety in how you can accomplish missions due to the loadouts you can bring into the levels as well as the generally different enemy types. 

The big negative is that at higher difficulties, the game just stops being fun because they will spawn enemies infinitely and it the game comes to a standstill as you need to crawl your way across the map while be swarmed by a dozen tanks and squads at the same time. The way to prevent this, in the game, is to kill a patrol squad before they can send out the signal. But I don't think this is good game design since it's rather difficult to do and can have a chain reaction since failing one squad execution leads to a skirmish and thus makes it almost impossible to kill the other squads before they call in backup. 

Overall really good, but I don't know how they expect you to beat or enjoy difficulties above 10. And for difficulties below 7, it's going to play very similarly each time. I mean, the weapon and loadout variety is good and playing with teammates adds replayabiliity, but you will have the same missions and the same enemies (depending on difficulty) so it's more that there is relatively limited content.",1685264672,1685264672,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I have played Helldivers since its release in 2015, with intermittent pauses here and there. What I think is most telling about this game is that even without the enormous budget and huge backing of a mega studio, without any constant content releasing stream of news and ""reminders"" to the world that it exists, it still has a loyal and firm fanbase that keeps coming back to it week in and week out. And the reason - it is that good. 

It does not have graphics that push your brand new RT GPU to its limits. It does not have artwork that will blow your mind with its depth and complexity. It does not have a story, or characters that can spawn a TV series. But what it does have is a unique combination of great gameplay, endless replayability and most of all - edge-of-your-seat fun and suspense, and the following sense of relief and achievement when you pull a split-second save or evac off.

I have reached lvl 50 on Playstation in 2016 and then started from scratch on PC last year. I am planning to reach lvl 50 here, too and enjoy this game for a long time.

For those of you who are wondering whether to go for it - trust me, you will not regret it. Don't mind the reviews that you need friends/couch buddies to play it - far from truth. I have almost always started a session solo and teamed with random people online. And I have made one or two digital friends that way along the way.",1680863239,1680863239,True,4,0,0.559464216232299805,0,True,False,False

At its core, Helldivers is a top-down, twin-stick shooter that gives you a variety of weapons and abilities to take on alien threats across a range of dangerous environments. But what sets this game apart is the emphasis on teamwork, where you and your fellow Helldivers must work together to complete objectives and fend off enemy attacks.

But don't let the emphasis on teamwork fool you - this game can be downright hilarious in its chaos. Accidentally shooting a fellow Helldiver, calling in an airstrike on your own position, or getting killed by a stray bullet are all too common occurrences in the heat of battle.

Despite the potential for friendly fire mishaps, the Helldivers community is surprisingly supportive and friendly, with players often offering tips and strategies to help their teammates succeed. It's up there with other cooperative games like Deep Rock Galactic in terms of fostering a positive player base.

All in all, Helldivers is a challenging and chaotic game that rewards skill, communication, and teamwork. It's not for the faint of heart, but if you're willing to dive in and get your hands dirty, you'll find a game that's as entertaining as it is challenging.

There are quite a few things that bug me about this game which don't make it worth a price tag of more then $5 imo. 

Such as:
1) No quickslots for Stratagem. You have to hold down one key while inputting a code that consists of arrows up, down, left and right. When things get hairy while playing solo it is almost certain death to try to input those while under attack. A simple quickslot, one key press, would've done wonders for this ability but instead it is tedious at best.

2) Gun magazines are extremely low capacity. You get like 4-5 shots with pistol and maybe 6-8 with rifle. You are constantly reloading and takes away from the combat. And when down and being attacked by packs of 3 cyborg dogs in groups of more then one means you'll run out of ammo and not be able to fend them off long enough to rez.

3) Enemies just spawn on top of you and can kill you before you can escape. Makes no sense that they just ""POOF"" out of nowhere and they are right on top of you. Would've been far better to have them drop beacons and spawn from that.

4) Enemy patrols just appear out of nowhere and they don't have a base or whatnot that they spawn out of so seems rather dumb. And they are infinite which is something else I do not like. Would've preferred an option or even on lower difficulties to have limited number of enemies and be able to clear a mpa and not have them respawn in.

5) The pointer is not 100% accurate. I'll have the enemy square in the middle of target and I am somehow missing it and they are in range of my shots. It is frustrating especially when magazines are so low which means shots NEED to count even more.

6) Can't fire while prone. All prone seems to do is avoid weapon fire. Not sure if you can just stay down there forever and not be hit or if you can only be damaged by melee. Needs further testing but not being able to fire while prone is terrible.

7) The pointer turns into a shadow. It is cool but I would've preferred to have an option to leave the pointer on all the time. I can lose it during action unless I constantly have my aim on which is not efficient.",1671465343,1680723732,True,0,0,0.476606905460357666,0,True,False,False

Helldivers is already a bit on the older side but at the time of writing this review the game is on sale for 5 bucks with all expansions. It is one of my favorite multiplayer games ever and for that price it is an absolute recommend from me. 

[hr][/hr] 

[b] What is it?[/b]
Helldivers is a cooperative mission-based top-down-shooter set in a world that is largely inspired by the Starship Troopers movie. You are a proud citizen of Super Earth and joined the Helldivers to spread FREEDOM and DEMOCRACY™ to the galaxy...with guns. 

[b] What is the main gameplay like?[/b]
You and up to 3 friends (this really is a coop game, you can play it solo but it isn't as much fun, trust me) team up to complete objectives on planets belonging to one of 3 distinct alien races: 
- The Bugs, an insectoid species making use of swarm mechanics and monstrous super-units. 
- The Cyborgs, twisted former humans that are now more machine than man. 
- The Illuminates, an advanced Alien civilization that uses advanced technology and specialist fighters against you.

Before each mission you choose the faction you want to fight as well as the difficulty (there are 12!! different difficulties available). You then select your loadout. You will then have to complete multiple missions on the planet before you can extract. These missions range from capturing enemy territory to diffusing minefields or assassinating enemy boss units. You can even achieve this stealthily by avoiding or eliminating the many enemy scouts roaming the map. 

After completion your progress will be counted toward the war effort (more on that later)

There is no skill tree, however you will be able to unlock vehicles and abilities by completing certain missions and you can research weapons and upgrades by finding science packs during the mission.

[hr][/hr]
 
[b] What makes the game so great?[/b]

[b] [u] The Graphics: [/u] [/b]
Although the game is from 2015 thanks to the stylized art style it still holds up surprisingly well graphically. The visual effects and sound are done so incredibly well that they even surpass a lot of modern games in my opinion. All in all very impressive.

[b] [u] The Enemies:[/u] [/b]
Every faction's units have their own character and unique strength and weaknesses. Some are bloodthirsty maniacs that just come after you relentlessly, some create barriers to separate you from your team mates or invert your controls with mind tricks. Once you are detected they can also become quite dangerous; even just a few hits will lead you to bleed out and be quickly finished off if your teammates don't come to your aid.

The unique thing about enemies in this game is the armor system. Most standard units are not armored at all, some have light armor that might force you to shoot a certain part of an enemy unless you are using a weapon with a bit more punch and some are heavily armored. Those you will not be able to damage 
[b] at all [/b] unless you are using a dedicated anti-tank weapon which makes good coordination with your team while choosing your loadout essential. 

[b] [u] The Weapons: [/u] [/b]
Except for a few stinkers (cough Arc-Shotgun cough) most weapons feel incredibly fun to use and are quite varied: Each gun has it's own unique feel as well as up- and downsides. Attributes like shot spread, ammo availability, reload speed as well as upgrades like poison bullets or a bayonet can have an immense impact in the hectic fray of battle. 

[b] [u] The Stratagems: [/u] [/b]
This is a system completely unique to Helldivers and I am quite surprised that i have never seen anything like it in newer games because it is really fun. With a system not unlike a rhythm or fighting game, where you have to input the correct combination of 'up' 'down' etc you can call down drop pods containing equipment (and yes, you can drop those hyper-velocity pods on enemies and it's very fun) as well as support in the form of artillery strikes, turrets or vehicles. You can equip up to 4 different stratagems before each mission which gives you more tactical opportunities than in pretty much every other shooter that I have ever played. This includes the ability to equip an additional weapon like a rocket launcher, a mortar or a god-damn shoulder-mounted auto-cannon!! as well as a multitude of support items like ammo packs, shields, drones etc.

[b] [u] The Co-Op: [/u] [/b]
No other game that I have ever played has nailed co-op quite like Helldivers. For one, you are actually forced to play and stay together: Your entire team shares one camera that is centered on the group so one guy can't just run to another part of the map. You will have to figure out together where to go and how to distribute tasks. 

You can also make use of cooperative weapons. For example your buddy can equip an anti-tank rocket launcher but give you the backpack with spare ammunition which will give you the ability to reload his launcher a lot faster than he could on his own, something that I have never seen in another game. 

All the vehicles also require multiple people to make full use of. The APC for example needs a dedicated driver and gunner. I am quite confident in saying you will be hard-pressed to find another game with as much thought put into the co-op as Helldivers.

The game also has all the friendly fire you can hope for which often results in hilarity.

[b] Now to the bad [/b] 

Helldivers is an amazing game, one of my all time favorites but it has one major flaw that multiple reviewers have already pointed out:

[b] [u] The War-effort: [/u] [/b]
Helldivers uses a community-driven global progress system. After each mission your progress will be transmitted to ""Central Command"" and be counted towards the war effort. If enough people complete missions in a system that system will then be counted as conquered and no longer be available  until you reach the enemy home world or, if you fail and the enemies retrieve it. 

There are two main points of critique I have of that system:

- Your own contribution matters very little: To finish a system a certain amount of points have to be contributed by the entire community. That can make your own contribution, no matter how hard you fought for it, seem completely insignificant. After having barely survived a mission against all odds seeing all your hard work being represented by a small number that doesn't move the progress bar at all can be really disappointing. This is a relatively minor issue but still something that had a negative impact on my experience.

- The only major point of critique I have of Helldivers is the fact that once you conquer an enemy homeworld you will no longer be able to play against that faction until the war is won and the map is reset. This is a completely baffling decision by the developers. With each faction that is eliminated fewer and fewer players will contribute, drawing the war out more and more.
 
Sometimes only one faction will be available to play against FOR WEEKS and then, once the map is reset all players of course want to play against the factions that weren't available FOR WEEKS which inevitably results in those factions being wiped out and the same faction as before being the only one left until the cycle begins anew. 

[hr][/hr] 

All in all one of the most unique and fun multiplayer games ever created and I wished there were more like it.

On the other hand I understand some people get very annoyed by this setup quickly and give up on it because they feel they are being punished unfairly. For example it is hard to find your own character sometimes, since you dont have special colors or well visible markers. It is also hard to see where u aim unless you equip the red laser dot and even then u might end up hitting ur friends accidentally. Exiting a vehicle in a way it is still rolling a bit and hits you upon exiting leads to your instantenous death, this can also be frustrating. Some missions are tough challenges that you can only master by optimizing and adapting your loadout.

So overall how do you play: you run around in top-down view and separately control movement and aiming, you have to keep reloading in mind and track your ammo. If your ally dies you revive them with a combo of arrow keys that you need to enter while holding a button. This process is the same for all extras you request, including extra ammo, vehicle drops, special weapon drops, or to fulfil mission objectives, they are all done with key combos that you can fail and have to then repeat which is an interesting challenge and adds to the whole time pressure aspect well as you will stand undefended and immobile while doing so. As you traverse the map you will see enemies and some of them contain scouts. IF a scout sees you they will call in reinforcements which is a huge impact to your chances of survival so you always want to pick out these scouts.
And here goes the first grievance we had with the game: sometimes scouts saw us although we couldnt see them (they were offscreen). It was impossible for us, despite standing close to each other, to see the scout and therefore kill them, before they saw us. This does not happen often but when it happens it feels extremely frustrating since you dont know what to do about it. Another problem we had is that the world has a progression influence by all players. You might come back to play the game after some days and you get 10 cutscenes you dont care about since you had nothing to do with them and then you realize now you can only pick one type of enemy planets (one enemy race) as target for the time being. NOT FUN. We like to pick enemies at our will and we effectively are constantly locked in and locked out of options. I dont see any purpose in this game design decision.

Overall it is a fun coop game with a lot of challenges and interesting design decisions, although it is surely not perfectly balanced and not suited for anyone with a low frustration threshold.

Fun and challenging gameplay: Helldivers is a top-down shooter that offers fun and challenging gameplay. The game's difficulty is well-balanced, and the gameplay mechanics are tight and responsive.

Co-op support: The game supports up to four-player co-op, which allows players to work together to complete missions and objectives. This creates a fun and engaging social experience.

Customization options: Helldivers offers a lot of customization options for weapons, gear, and appearance. This allows players to tailor their loadouts to their playstyle, which can be satisfying and rewarding.

Active community: The game has an active and dedicated community, which means that finding matches is never difficult. This also allows for a lot of player-created content, including mods and custom missions.

Cons:

Steep learning curve: Helldivers can be a challenging game to master, especially when it comes to the game's mechanics and strategy. This might be off-putting for some players who are looking for a more casual experience.

Limited enemy variety: While the game's enemies are well-designed and challenging, there are only a limited number of enemy types available. This can make the gameplay feel repetitive over time, especially for players who have been playing for a while.

Limited mission variety: While the game's missions are well-designed and fun to play, there are only a limited number of mission types available. This can make the gameplay feel repetitive over time, especially for players who have been playing for a while.

No single-player content: While the game's co-op mode is fun and engaging, there is no single-player campaign or story mode available. This might be disappointing for players who prefer to play games on their own or who are looking for a more narrative-driven experience.",1677334528,1677334528,True,0,0,0.488668560981750488,0,True,False,False

The controls are tight, the servers are still strong, there are a number of challenge levels for everyone, and the power balance between you and your enemy feels just right. But there's a particular thing that makes Helldivers really stand out. 

Obliged teamwork in games, particularly games with action elements, has often been a really hard thing for game devs to get right. We've all played a game where you just need someone to ""get on the point"" or ""push the button"" or whatever it is, and nobody's doing it. And then you lose because your allies are off doing whatever the heck they do when they choose to play team games alone in a crowd. It'd be easy to blame the individual players for that behavior (and oh, I do!) 

But when it comes down to it, the developers who make those games should know what players do in games. And-- since they DO know that, those devs should have designed their games with those behaviors in mind, urging and/or compelling players toward teamwork or, failing that, choosing to make a different game with different goals.

There a number of elements in Helldivers that address that very issue. Without getting the weeds, just know that they succeeded. Players (mostly) work together and accomplish objectives like they should-- a tough nut to crack for many creators, but Arrowhead pulled it off.

A fair warning: if you approach this game like a straight action game you won't make it very far and you'll probably end up frustrated. In Helldivers you play as commandos. As such, your goal is to move quickly from one objective to the next without getting bogged down in long engagements. Leave the front line fighting for the off-screen infantry; the waves never end and later difficulty levels you shouldn't expect to be able to kill all the on-screen things before resuming objective work. You'll need to be doing both at once.

Thinking of the enemy as an obstacle, rather than an objective, is key to success. 

Your choice of gear is important from one mission to the next. Keep an eye on what your team takes, fill in the holes in group's loadout, avoid things that kill your friends more effectively than they kill your enemies, and you'll find that the game's a lot more manageable than it often seems to new players at first.

And it's very worth your engagement: this a smart action game for smart action people that rewards understanding the underlying systems, prioritizing objectives tactically, relying on your team and, naturally, shooting straight. But it doesn't require a bunch of stat analysis and grognard stuff.",1452274850,1676004075,True,1,0,0.40089571475982666,0,True,False,False

It has major flaws in my eyes that will never be fixed though.

War system is bad.
Forcing us to engage a particular enemy type sucks and being a live service essentially is damn near an automatic veto for bad review.
I wanted to fight bugs but upon my first try I can't because of the war system unless I fiddle with files.

Spacing, perspective and zoom.
The game feels just a bit too claustrophobic, I get that's the idea to foster the chaos but it makes the game annoying with screen sharing forced and enemies who can fire from outside your view.
I could easily use a fucking N64 game as a good example of screen sharing without being burdensome. Gauntlet, easy, just zoom out a bit.

Oh and FUCK cyborgs, whoever made that part of the game is sincerely a retard, over half the enemies are anti-tank requirements and IFVs are probably the stupidest enemy type to make a patrol.

It will tide me over till starship troopers because even a semi competent game will be better made than this fucking waste of time I only play for friends.",1674095117,1674617104,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This is your commanding officer speaking and let me tell you, this game is more than just a mission accomplished, it's a total and complete obliteration of the enemy. A total and utter victory for our forces. A triumph for humanity that will go down in history as the greatest achievement of mankind!

You'll be fighting against the enemies of mankind in the most diverse and dangerous environments, and let me tell you, they don't stand a chance against our superior forces. The graphics in this game are sharper than a razor-sharp bayonet, the gameplay is tighter than a drum and the action is more explosive than a nuclear bomb. 

The co-op multiplayer is as solid as a titanium tank and just as indestructible. You'll team up with your squadmates and take on the alien threat like a well-oiled machine. And let me tell you, nothing is more satisfying than taking down a bug swarm with your friends by your side (be warned, though, friendly fire is always on, so watch your crosshairs and don't hesitate to take out any traitorous allies.)

The weapons and equipment in this game are as advanced as our technology allows, and the upgrades will make you feel like a one-man army capable of taking on a whole planet of enemies. You'll be able to customize your loadout to suit your playstyle and adapt to any situation.

You don't have to play with people but the game is a lot more fun and feels a lot cooler if you do, and it's super easy to join up with someone or drop into an ongoing game.

The combat is simple; twin-stick shooter but incredibly addicting and fun to watch and take part in. It can go from calm to absolute chaos in a few moments, and the more people on the screen the more difficult it is to be coordinated but also you have more firepower.

It comes with a perk system, weapon unlock, and 'power-up'/call-in system called stratagems (my one complaint here is that these all use the same currency: research points). Additionally there are planet and level up unlocks that you get as you play. 

At this time it's still pretty easy to find people to play with, and I've had no issues. The only thing is I wish it was easier to add people to my friends list from playing with them, as there is no easy way to do this without searching the persons name on steam or getting/giving a friend code but the former doesn't seem to work all that great and the latter is not as streamlined as it could be.

Enemy variety is pretty good with 3 factions and each have distinct units, abilities, strengths and weaknesses. There are 12 difficulty levels (or 'planets') but I personally haven't played much past difficulty level 5-7. These higher level missions are easier with more people; but they are soloable with the right build and a lot of practice I think(i read that somewhere).

The music is awesome and the sound effects for all the guns are weighty and destructive. The weapons seem relatively balanced and even the standard rifle is pretty damn good for a while, at least it has been for me.

I kinda wish people would go after research points more when playing in a team, that's not really a gripe with the game just an observation.

I bought this game on sale for I think $5? Well worth it, personally I think it's a little steep at $20 though. I would pay that price I think knowing how good it is, but I'd be more comfortable if it was $15, because it's a seven year old game.

I also think their system for inputting objective codes and calling in air drops by actually punching in a directional code is brilliant and adds a lot of intensity in high-charged situations.

Stratagems can offer offensive/defensive abilities or supply certain items. Large variety of weapons keeps the game interesting, along with mostly useful & interesting upgrades. Stratagems are also upgradable.

Some weapons are rarely equipped by people and just plain weak - though still fun to mess around with.

AIMING:
Mouse & keyboard has a huge accuracy advantage because it has aiming crosshairs showing you where bullets/lasers/attacks will go. Controller players don't have the aim icon, and will typically have <50% accuracy - this can get annoying on sweaty hard missions when they can't aim at & quickly kill enemy patrols that are far away from their character. These small-sized scouts need to be killed quickly or they'll raise the alarm, calling in more tough enemies.


Controller players have 1 slight advantage where they can throw Stratagem beacons off screen much farther - throw distance is based on how long you hold the throw button. Mouse & keyboard is based on distance from player to their crosshairs - which stays on screen and can't go past the edge. M&KB has the advantage where you can more accurately place Stratagem beacons for precisely calling in bombs, strafing runs, railcannon strikes, etc.

Something else I should mention is that you can bind custom macros to mouse and keyboard buttons with a variety of software (Logitech Gaming Software, Corsair's iCue, AutoHotKey, etc). This can be vital for rapidly  throwing out Stratagems in a few milliseconds, like those that respawn your teammates.

It has the potential to be really great, and there are times where it is fun, but there's some specific design decisions that very much ruin the fun of what could be quite a good game. I'm just going to outline them in this review, then it's up to you whether you can overlook this and enjoy the game. I can at times.

1) 'Squad' based camera - Probably the worst design element of the game, and the one the developers are the most stubborn about, even despite the significant backlash. In HellDivers, the camera operates not around your position, but places itself in the middle of where the general squad is. There are a huge litany of issues with this approach, like:

- Due to the colour palette and lack of good U.I., it can be very difficult to actually distinguish your own character from other players
- You can't play tactically. Say you want to split up, so one person can get aggro, and the other person can shoot a bug's exposed rear. The camera will punish you significantly for doing this, and you're likely to get killed.
- Say you get downed. The camera will consider you dead, and will wander off to where your team is. This often means you will find yourself off screen (indicated by an arrow) with basically 0 chance of actually getting back up. 
- The camera will result in you getting one shot by enemies you had very little, if any, way of anticipating. They will be aggro'd outside your visual range, especially if you're just playing multiplayer, and their attack goes across screen. 
- An intended design choice, it makes the game very claustrophobic. 

All in all, I consider it (and quite a few others) the most negative feature about the game. It doesn't encourage teamwork in the slightest, it encourages you to group up, and people mistake this for teamwork.

2) Enemy design

This is also a pretty weak point of the game. At the beginning, the enemies are fairly interesting and the gameplay is creative. At the higher end, the game developers felt enough work was done, so what they did was reuse the same enemy designs but just make them tankier and make them spawn way more.

- Due to the claustrophobic nature of the game, you are both forced to group together and punished for doing so in the form of hostile game design. Plenty of enemies, especially bugs, have either AOE attacks or, like illuminates, ways in which players are forced to split apart, which as mentioned you are punished for doing so. It results in awkward gameplay that stops being fun. 
- BUGS - At the higher end, bug games became a case of stratagem spam, because they are very tanky units without any weaknesses except hitting them with something hard. All their attacks are basically insta kills.
- Illuminates - At the higher end. they are just annoying to play against. Again, some fun things could be here, like controls being reversed, your playable area being cut in half, but the camera makes it frustrating rather than fun to play against. You can get one shot from an enemy off screen, and poor unit design means you (too many players really) will be confused as to which side of the screen they're shooting from until they actually take the shot.
Cyborgs - Probably the most fun, up until they start spamming IFVs, and it becomes a tanky bug problem game, but its to me the most fun I had on this game.

Having defeated the bosses for each faction, each have the problem of being way too tanky, it gets very boring playing them. They could cut the HP in half and it'd be better. Also typical insta kill shenanigans, small arena issues etc. 

Why do I keep mentioning higher levels? Problem is that the lower levels are far too easy, and the enemy design poses no real challenge. Again, the issue is they didn't develop any proper middle level challenge, so it's either too easy or frustrating. 

3) Gameplay

This game is pay to win. There are some top stratagems and small arms that will make your experience significantly more fun if you get them (entrenched and support DLC is pretty mandatory, and if you don't believe me do a high level snow map with no all terrain boots to experience 'fun'). 
- At the higher end, the game is just stratagem spam. I literally took out the illuminates boss with a rando lobby who just spammed incendiaries (which enemies don't cross) and spammed rockets and ammo resupply until he was done for. This is the cheesiest gameplay you can imagine, it's not fun, it's just standing in one corner, spamming explosives, and dodging attacks, because anything else is just far more of a pain. 
- There are some really annoying quirks. Going prone is basically suicide. You can't use weapons (because that's real life ;) ), your movement is uber slow, and you are vulnerable as you stand up. 
- Some levels are just plain unfun. The ones where you're stuck in a very small arena, and enemies spawn anywhere (and often right next to you). These are the least fun by far.

I'll probably still play this game because it does scratch a fun itch, and there's a lot of good things going for it. But it's a game I would not recommend. It's not about ""get good"", I've done the hardest levels, and they're not engaging, they're just very unfun and once I did em I didn't want to do them again (and neither did the lobby). If you can overlook all that, you'll have some fun. But I doubt you will.",1672272338,1672334472,False,3,2,0.460954457521438599,8,True,False,False

There are some items that require two or more people to operate, e.g there is an anti tank missile launcher that needs one person to fire and another person to load, and it's great fun when you make it work. This is also a downside, because you might not get to use some items very much if you usually play alone.

You upgrade equipment by finding research samples around missions (you usually have to walk around the entire mission and search away from objective areas to find samples, but it is no guarantee). Every 10 samples gives 1 research point, and each upgrade costs anywhere from 1 to 5 research points. Samples carry across between missions, so if you need 4 samples to get your next point and you find 6 samples, the extra 2 samples will count towards your next point.

I can't really think of anything bad to say about this game, except maybe that the environments are a bit basic. There are deserts, swamps, tundras, mountains, volcanoes, ruined cities, giant factories.. But they are all very flat, and there is no vertical movement - when you consider that this game is designed to work on PS VITA (a handheld console), it kind of makes sense that the design is simple.

At the time of writing this game was 75% off, with the game and all DLC coming in just under $12",1672199699,1672199699,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Though, holy shit, so annoying.. Missions very early on take like 3 minutes, medium missions take like 6 minutes, i'm guessing ""hard"" will be hopefully twice that.. because...

The menus TAKE FREAKING FOREVER to go through, ""mission success!!"" 2 hours of useless info afterwards and then you can queue up the next mission.

Standing up from prone takes way too long aswell, not super important but.. no reason it's that slow.

I mean honestly, my ""rating"" of the game - RIGHT NOW, is like a 5/10, i'm sure it'll get better when the missions get longer so the menu-ing won't feel like fkn AGES, but it isn't right now.

Also, dying instantly in coop because of spawn pod landing on you 50% of the time is just fkn stupid. (AT THE START OF A MISSION...) - idk what the devs were thinking.

the game does legitimately screw you sometimes for the sake of the laughs, which are many however that is the first area where the game has a problem it seems to go too far in this vein... although as the trailer show you, the greatest threat is your team, or lack there of. Friendly fire & trigger discipline and LEARNING GROUP DYNAMICS are the most important things, also watching for where airdrops are going to land, but frankly you'll learn that last one within the first few hours, if not... this way be monsters the likes of which your soft lil ClownBoy-body has no hope of living through.

its loads of fun to be sure but it is legitimately challenging more so than ever because of the team playing TUG-O-WAR with the screen trying to get their way cause Larry wanna go left, Moe wana run right, curly mighta wanted to go up or down but its unclear as hes currently having his entrails used as jump rope by a bug swarm... who ever survives might end up compacted into the ground by and incoming hell-diver reinforcement pod.

whatever you learn in the first few hours know that your death however prevent-ably will reach a point of inevitability and the real strategy begins, utilizing the reinforcement system, get your team back in the ring before you become new lubricant for incoming tank treads.

i'll have more to say later but the main takeaway if anything is the game is aiming for Comedic fun and mob shooter action first and the main problem it suffers is the ""Quit first and try again with a new team mentality"" sometimes things just aint working and thats fine by all means move on to another group but sooner very much rather than later you'll have to learn a groups dynamics and who's going to do what as the before mentioned tug-o-war screen manipulation is a major case of failure, people stubbornly wanting to get their way but ultimately causing problems, and then the hilarity ensues thereafter, whether you learn to behave well with each-other determines whether or not that joke becomes so overplayed to ware out its welcome. 
the game is very fun, the smarter you all are, there are three certainties in life, Death, Taxes and things can only get so retarded before the whole system falls apart and this game has a low threshold for stupid, it will bring out the paddle board for a good and unrelentingly punishing battery right quick if you aren't on point.
        That said... its good to have one Chunder head in the group, maybe too, it becomes its own impromptu Three stooges routine that way :)

UPDT:
This is a pretty cool 1-4 player co-op drop-in-at-anytime twin stick pew-pew with randomized levels/maps and 15 levels of difficulty that allow you to get used to the game's mechanics before jumping into the real $#1+. Also, lots of friendly fire and deaths from your own team (I haven't tried Magicka yet, but I heard that's how it is there too). Satiric voice lines, commercials, societal ultra-militaristic order/values, N@zi uniforms, upbeat music — all of this emulates the feelings from Paul Verhoeven's movie Starship Troopers. If you've got a friend who's wondering what to play, stop wasting time and get this game for him/her (it's cheap during sales) — you won't regret it.

I bought this game on its last sale after being recommended it from a friend whose taste in games I trust.  From the get-go the artistic direction of this game is fantastic, which one should expect from the same devs that made Magicka.  Plenty of satirical propaganda to make one chuckle (or worried) tied in with a killer musical score and just enough lore to make the game interesting without making it overwhelming or tiring.  For a game that's nearly seven years old as of this review it looks great.

Mechanically it's a twin-stick shooter, but with a Magicka twist: while your main weapons are twin-stick staples your specialty call-down items and attacks (called Stratagems) are summoned by inputting various WASD combinations (or + combos for controller users).  You can get bigger guns, vehicles, or various air/artillery supports, though placement and timing are key lest you get killed (again just like in Magicka).

Likewise, completing in-game objectives often requires interactions that also use these WASD/+ combinations, though only one objective type has the potential to backfire on you and kill you outright.

Here's where the game's shine starts to really darken: just like the titular Helldiver you are given a brief tutorial and then thrown into the grinder to learn everything.  What stratagems are best to use?  Gotta learn that yourself!  How do you put yourself out if you're on fire?  Figure it out!  When do I unlock this gun I like?  Look up up!  The game would have absolutely benefitted from having some more things spelled out.

And then the great big caveat of the whole game: it is an online co-op game.  Yes, you can technically unplug your internet and play offline, but the game was designed and constructed to play with other people and later difficulties (especially 13-15) effectively require a full team of four.  Even if you have a group of four playing on your couch none of your effort will count towards the campaign progress unless you are online.  While this might not normally be a problem there is also a much smaller community now than there likely was seven years ago.  These hardened veterans are very nice and helpful most of the time, but you are still likely to stumble across players who are bored playing at levels you are struggling with.

All in all, even with the online requirement and being forced to learn all the nuances under live fire this has been an enjoyable experience, albeit confusing and stressful at times and best played in doses.

Edit: Since I've now put a bunch of hours into the game over a week, it's about time I update my review.

SHORT VERSION: Helldivers is an up to 4 person coop game where you all share the same screen. You go on missions to collect samples for upgrades and get influence for completing planets. That influence goes into the region goal, where if enough Helldivers manage to fill it you advance one region. Once you run out of regions to take, you attack the faction's homeworld, hopefully get enough influence to conquer it, and then go on with your day against the surviving factions.

LONG VERSION: When loading into Helldivers, you first need to select a region (or more accurately, enemy faction) you want to fight against. The three factions are 
1) In the top left are the cyborgs, a bunch of medium -> heavy armor enemies with guns that shoot you and dogs that knock you down and, as one person put it, ""are Germany's leader in WW2's spawn"". It's fun to bayonet them and watch the chunks of their corpses fly past you at full speed though.
2) In the top right are the bugs. Think the bugs from Starship Troopers, the Zerg from Starcraft, or the Tyranids from 40k. They're a lot heavier armored but are entirely melee oriented.
3) On the bottom are the Illuminate, basically an Eldar from 40k looking faction that functions like the protoss from Starcraft. They're very lightly armored, however they have shields which absorb ALL damage from a shot until the shield goes down. Doesn't matter if it's an infinity damage nuke, it'll absorb all the damage even if the shield goes down midway. You've likely seen people say that everyone hates fighting the Illuminate. I thought that was dumb and I'd fight them. I. DESPISE. FIGHTING. THEM. One enemy can flip your controls so up is down and right is left. Another can spawn a wall that blocks movement unless you brought the jetpack as your backpack equipment. And let's not even get started on the railguns. It's H E L L.

Once you select a region you want to fight, you can pick a difficulty. Each planet has 2-3 missions you need to complete, and a different difficulty up to 15 in numerical order. The difficulties to highlight are
1- Dive in the park, where you fight only enemy scouts
5- Challenging, where heavy enemies begin appearing. You need AT to kill them.
10- Suicide mission, which is as difficult as it sounds
12- Helldive, which used to be the hardest difficulty until the last major update (afaik)
15- The Inner Circle of Hell, S U F F E R.
""16""- Enemy boss planet where you fight against the boss and endlessly spawning hordes. No rewards except lots of influence. Do at your own risk.
There are also capital city fights, where you fight on difficulty multiples of 3 (3, 6, 9, etc) to earn influence and double xp as you attempt to hold onto a region. If you don't get enough influence fighting on the capital, the region is lost and the next region is attacked where you can then defend the next region. (RIP Winter Hold, we fought like hell to hold you o7)

Once you select your difficulty, you can select your loadout. Loadouts consist of a perk, weapon, and four stratagems. Stratagems come in three general types
1) Blue, which are support stratagems. These include vehicles, mechs, ammo, and anti-tank stuff.
2) Green, which are utility. These include things like turrets, barbed wire, mines, and the UAV drone to find samples (if it's level 3)
3) Red, which are your offensive stratagems. These are entirely focused on dealing damage in an area and range from a wall of fire to a tactical nuke.

Once you set your loadout, you can finally go on the mission. Jump in, call down any stratagems you plan to use, and get to work running to objectives, completing them, and then extracting. Planets are procedurally generated, so while you'll still run into areas that look the same as you've seen before, you won't get exact duplicate planets normally. In the 50 hours I've played, I've only noticed a duplication once with the SAM site objective being rotated. Overall I haven't noticed this though.

Do I recommend this game? Well let's look: I bought this game for $10 with all DLC with the intention of playing with a friend of mine who said we'd play all weekend who didn't wind up showing up since he was simping after an internet gril. So, I bought the game AGAIN for a different friend of mine and we played together. Then he wasn't around so I bought it for ANOTHER friend, who then questioned if a third friend might like it. That friend decided that if I'm paying, he'll play it. I have now bought the game 4 times for $40 in total. Then another friend of mine said they might like the game so I bought the base game and the terrain pack DLC to help with snow planets for them since the sale ended and I'm running out of money buying Helldivers, so that's a total of $65.

Tbh the limiting factor to my enjoyment of Helldivers is that I don't have friends to play it with (you can play with randoms though, as they can be really cool. I've even friended two of them), as playing with friends always increases the fun factor through the roof. I can comfortably run difficulty 6 solo if I run cardio perk + Justice rifle w/ the ammo, EAT, UAV, and Exo-44 mech stratagems while not going down at all, but with 3 friends we'll have a combined total of 20 downs on the same difficulty and 3 almost wipes. It's hilarious and a ton more fun with them but still fun to play alone!

So yeah, 11/10 would buy this 5 times again (though I don't have friends to buy it for except for the people who would play it amongst themselves and ignore me)",1663520998,1664123094,True,10,0,0.64206308126449585,0,True,False,False

A couple tips for a new player to reduce some of the bad experiences others have had:
1) Try to stick to missions with a difficulty rating only 1-2 lvls higher than your current lvl.  If you're lvl 5 trying to join a mission 8+, you'll probably get kicked because you'll be more of a hindrance than a help
2) Play some of the super easy missions alone or with a friend, this will allow you to get a feel for a lot of objective types and unlock useful equipment to bring to higher difficulties (recoil-less rifle or some other AT type is a must get to play 7+ difficulties)
3 Be mindful where you're shooting or throwing stratagems; 1 accidental TK is forgivable, 2 is annoying, 3 is frustrating, 4+ will probably get you booted (especially if the host is the one getting TK'd)",1663871470,1663871470,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

A unique concept of a game. Similar to Alien Swarm, this game has a scifi futuristic look. The loadout inventory consists of primary weapon like the assault rifle and machineguns , a subweapon such as a pistol, and a tertiary add on with the choice of a rattling gun or supply crate. You can play co-op couch or online multi-player. The tutorial does a great job of showing you the ropes with the controls, and weapons. So why did i give this review a 'no'? Unfortunately, this game is way too repetitive. The objective of the game is to capture the point, defend the point and then find the extraction point to escape. As you progress, you encounter more enemies and the capture point takes a longer time to finish.

Buuuut I only have one gripe that I still hold onto. Mainly involving the initial player spawn in. Like at the start when everyones dropping in it is possible for the host to die with no chance of survival as you are always the middle pod and have to exit out into somewhere which said somewhere could have a pod about to crush the spot with the host underneath it still in the exit animation. 
Another problem is that if you are an empty lobby and waiting for someone to join then keep moving. Cause before a boss raid I had my EXO-44 deployed next to me and waiting to be used. While I was on the radio entering a command for my life pack I was smooshed by a player who just joined in. Which I find odd mainly cause I was standing perfectly still so I wonder what made that a good decision in the games spawn in system. As both me and my exo which hadn't moved an inch for a solid 5 or 10s got flattened
I hope they at least put something in for at the start so the pods have a larger gap between each other during spawn so that way if someone does get killed at the start of the game cause of a spawn in its because they ran directly out to it. and for when people join in maybe the pod could look for a clear spot to avoid killing someone who is standing still waiting for people to join",1663208601,1663372460,True,0,0,0,2,True,False,False

I own both the Playstation and Steam versions and prefer the Playstation version due to better controls and fewer bugs (mostly hit-box related). The PC version has better graphics but it is annoying when you have to struggle seeing the mouse cursor or can't hit enemies due to the hit-box calculations failing to register the hit.

Yes, there are some players who love to kick people for no good reason, usually right as you are joining and before you have even done anything. It would be good if the game showed a score next to the hosts' names that show how often they have kicked people recently so that we can avoid joining their games. Obviously, with how frequently they kick, these toxic hosts don't want [most] people to join anyway--they would likely appreciate not having sub-par players join them. (To be symmetrical, players who have been kicked very often recently should be blockable by the hosts, to prevent trolls from going from game to game.)
Another way to solve this kick-happy hosts problem would be to have a filter for the games where only players above a certain level would be allowed to join their games, and players below that level cannot even see them.

This is an ultimate top-down co-operative experience that you've been craving.  It literally forces teamwork.  If someone isn't playing accordingly, just boot, and eventually another will port in and take their place.  No loss in mission progress or penalty.  Next thing you know, you're with the same 4 person crew for the next hour and having a blast working out the challenges together.  The community is quite awesome really.

Each player has a unique game style (a plethora of gun, gear, and support combinations) and it is so much fun meshing strategies.  Throwing down razor wire then watching a teammate set it on fire with a flame thrower to further its effectiveness for example.  Or bypassing a 6 second artillery weapon reload by instantly changing mags from your teammates support backpack.  Believe me, 6 seconds can be a loooong time in certain situations.

Super light on storage and hardware usage, like 9 or 10 gigs(ish) with all the DLC content included I believe. This Alienware laptop (i7 with a 3070 integrated) runs at a mostly constant 62 degrees C. with graphics cranked up full nuts.  About 42 degrees C. just chilling on the desktop.  No crazy spikes or anything like that.  Laptop fans run like a tower and not like a jet engine (as per normal when gaming) so that is refreshing.

The in-game voice chat is excellent.  No need for Discord but there is a solid Discord community if that's your style.  No ""join my Discord"" spam exists that I have seen.  And if you're bashful, chat box available for us keyboard clickers.

You don't need the DLC, nothing is really locked behind it, you can get vehicles and mechs from completing planets.
So yea, I spend 5 bucks for the base game and then another 7.5 for a game I already had and all the DLC.

With that out of the way, this is a 8/10 game for me and I plan to play more. I had better communication and teamwork with randoms than friends playing this game, for a console import, keyboard and mouse controls are tight, tighter than games more recent and more fleshed out games. The loadouts might seem annoying to you until you realised that you 
having teamates kind of breaks the game cause you get up to 16 different stratagems which are 75% of your loadout. 
For guns, there's variety and good fun, tho you will figure out that some guns are better than others, but more so through mechanics rather than numbers. Your starting gun? It's good, it will be relevant, there's better guns but nothing stops you from doing all missions with it. No mechanic or numbers that just cockblock you.

>Story
Story is fun and if you don't like the tips shown during the hellpods dropping, you have something wrong inside. 
The Campaign is a 3-way war between The Zerg, The Protoss and The Emperium of Man, oh sorry, wrong ones, it's The Bugs, The Illuminate and The Cyborgs. Tho all these factions have scouts, infantry, heavy guys and other categories of units, they play out very very differently. It seems people like to kill the bugs. 
For example, scouts. Scouts send off alarms that summon more units as to kill you, scouts for the different factions are:
Bug - 3 bugs that each can spread spours to alert the other bugs
Illuminate - Invisible drone that screams when you commit a micro-aggression
Cyborgs - 3 light infranty units + a normal guy that sends out a flare

you have to grind for all the guns, and xp is gated on harder planets, so you have to be more and more meta, defeating the purpose of grinding.

that said, the real problem is the war mechanic is something you have very low control over and was clearly designed with a larger more active playerbase in mind, as it seems too easy to lose the wars, which are also very boring.

basically if you like the look of the gameplay in the videos, it has a lot of comedy and is a very star ship troopers over the top parody of scifi trooper genre, so if you don't get bored of repetition, this is good fun. if you quickly grow tired of the same swamp/desert/snowstorm with limited realistic loadout choices, maybe go to a more populated game.",1656462156,1656462156,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

-Tethered camera: When playing co-op you can not move away from your friends. You're all stuck in the same tiny area. When a friend lags behind, you can't see ahead of you so you get shot from off screen. Unacceptable for a PC game.

-Tedious Repetitive missions: The missions are short, the game play areas are small, the objectives are boring, and they're almost all the same, You're just supposed to play them over and over to grind out new weapon unlocks and small upgrades. The gunplay doesn't save it.

-The gun play isn't fun: Very limited ammo and a tedious resupply system, so you can't go in guns blazing and just have fun. Missions often force you to use stealth, but the stealth system sucks. You're spotted almost immediately and swarmed with constant spawning enemies. On top of that there is full friendly fire in the tiny shared-screen area you're forced to stay in with your friends. If they get in a mech and walk into you they will stomp on you. It's NOT fun. 

-Awful graphics: The game isn't that old but there's hardly any options in the graphical settings, and even on max settings it looks like it's running on a potato.

The game is basically a Hardcore Coop which involves true coop and basically requires it on harder difficulties.

Many DLCs, but you can get them on sale for cheap, so no worries.
All the DLCs are not must have, but some of them are fun and cool, and others you might never actually use.

Obviously better with friends, The screams, laughs and strategic plans are just amazing.

The game for solo players might be fun for a while, but as far as I noticed there's no scaling, all you get if you're solo if auto-respawn for each completed objective, good luck!

However equipment is everything in this game, and the best equipment is locked up in DLC packs. The Ranger pack is almost essential (just to get the UAV, it reveals Sample locations on the map which you need to upgrade all other equipment) if you plan to really grind out some hours on this game. If it's on sale and you're already interested, buy the Deluxe Edition to get all the DLCs at a discount, because you'll definitely want them all later.

Pros:
- Very strong Starship Troopers vibes. Kill endless swarms of bugs. Spread Democracy throughout the universe using violent and explosive negotiation tactics.
- Feels very arcade-y, in a good way. The gameplay loop is extremely action packed, and feels very good even during the game's most stressful moments. Skill & accuracy matter just as much as how well your equipment is upgraded.
- Instant in-and-out local 4-player multiplayer, perfect for controllers & couches. Even if you're in the middle of a mission, someone can pick up another controller and drop right in from orbit. Local and online multiplayer at the same time. (You'll need it too, see Neutral section below.)
- Always-on full friendly fire turns what would otherwise be a blind, dumb, shoot-em-up fest into a game that requires some tactical positioning considerations at all times.
- Very cool ""Stratagems"" system that plays into the ""drop everything from orbit"" theme & mechanics of the game really well. These are special beacons that you throw like grenades that mark the location to drop ammo, secondary weapons, character upgrades, vehicles, and mark the location for artillery/air strikes. Besides weapons and perks, these are your core considerations when designing a loadout, you only get 4 slots. To choose which one to activate during gameplay, each has a different ""code"" sequence of up/down/left/right directional arrows you need to enter in order. There are different difficulty levels of these sequences that make certain Stratagems take longer to use: e.g. a basic air strike only requires hitting 3 right-arrows in a row, but dropping an auto-turret requires hitting 5 arrows of all different directions, and a mech walker suit has a code 6 arrows long. It's like a fun little mini-game that adds to the arcade-y vibe, and is something you'll get faster at over time at as you memorize the ""codes"" to your favorite Stratagems.
- Great variety to all the objectives. They're like minigames that don't ever pull you too far out of the action, yet still require a decent amount of focus & concentration to get right quickly. Some like Activate SAM sites is a variation on the ""arrow-codes"" with a timed wait element, then there's bombing the shit out of bug nests, using a mine sweeper to find and disarm bombs, and pretty soon you're escorting survivors from dropship crash site. Some objective types are only available on the higher difficulty levels, and all of them are designed to be easier with friends (or turrets) watching your back.
- Even tho getting squished by incoming friendly orbital drops sucks, the game somehow still makes it seem pretty funny.

Neutral:
- Multiplayer, specifically a full party of 4, is basically required to experience the majority of the game. The difficulty ramps up really really quickly, there's 15 different difficulty levels, ending at ""Inner Circle of Hell"". You start at 1- Dive in the Park, then 2- Very Easy, but by the time you're ready for 3- Easy (maybe about 10 hours in, max), the game itself says that these levels are meant to be challenging for a single person. Endgame most certainly requires 4 players no matter what. (There's still usually a few hundred other players online at any given time as of this writing in summer 2022)
- Even though this game was obviously designed to be enjoyed with a controller, yet again, as always, using a keyboard + mouse will give you far better accuracy. This might really start to matter a lot more at endgame, but for now I'm getting by just using an Xbox 360 controller.
- No real story, you get thrown into the action pretty much immediately. The intro movie and tutorial fill in the majority of the background story you get. As soon as you finish the tutorial, you can choose any enemy race at any difficulty. (Bugs are the most popular, of course)
- Very grindy. While the gameplay loop is fun, progression is very slow. It would probably take close to 100 hours to unlock & upgrade everything. (*without the Ranger pack DLC, see below)

Cons:
- Some really damn-near essential equipment is locked behind a paywall in the form of DLC packs. For example, you probably want at the very least: Terrain Specialist Pack, which contains the All Terrain Boots perk. Without it, on snow levels your movement speed will slow to an absolute crawl, and the rest of your team who all already have it will start to get pissed off at having to wait up for you the whole match. (The Cardio Accelerator perk can be used as a substitute in a pinch.) And the Ranger Pack, which contains the UAV Stratagem. Once fully upgraded, it shows you the location of every research Sample on the current map, which give you more research points needed to upgrade all weapons & Stratagems. These upgrades are the main & only progression loop in the game, so anything that directly helps you gather more of them & faster, is going to directly impact the speed and grindy-ness of the whole game. And the rest of the DLC packs are mostly just much-more-powerful versions of the stock gear items.
- Stratagem ""arrow-code"" sequences aren't shown in the text description of them when you're safe back on your ship. This is silly because these activation codes don't change, and memorizing them offers significant value to gameplay. Even just seeing how many arrows a Stratagem requires to be activated would be of great help when choosing your loadout.
- Levels appear to be procedurally generated. While it sounds cool in theory, ""never play the same map twice!"" just like other games that have it, in practice what it means is every map ends up looking the same. Every map is very flat, features repeat themselves, and the only discerning characteristics between them become the different biome types themselves: is it a forest/desert/swamp/volcanic/snowy level? Because other than that 1 factor, each level looks and feels the same as the last.

Overall, besides the deceptive DLC packs, this is still a fantastic game I plan to sink many more hours into. And if you're looking for a 4-player party game with RPG/progression elements, there's very few other options out there that are this good. (Champions of Norrath on the PS2 comes to mind, but that's more of a Diablo-type game I've already dumped hundreds of hours into, and is starting to show it's age.)",1655473964,1655473964,True,22,0,0.731151103973388672,0,True,False,False

Got your attention? Well, let me explain some bits here:
Magicka is definitely to be found in the raw backbone of the game (4-player with single player possible, dark humor and a harsh take on the ""subject"") and where Magicka was a tongue-in-cheek take on norse mythology with world eating snakes (easy kill for a meteorite, who would've thought?) and lots of friendly fire in the hectic of battle or out of boredom, HELLDIVERS has you and up to three friends drop into a combat zone to spread democracy and liberty among hostile alien aggressors.
And of these there are numerous! No storyline you can easily wander along enjoying the sights, it's almost always a run through territory crawling with enemies (sometimes literally) and they're always ready to drop some heavy, unfriendly blokes into your group.

Alien Swarm saw you and up to three friends follow the story of an infested colony, trying to rid it from crawling space bugs. The levels were gorgeous and the story pieced together through audio logs scattered in the levels.
You had your pistol and some main weapon, be it a flamer, grenade launcher, shotgun or whatever.
It's a good example of dedication to crafting nice levels and lots of little details that pop into focus when you play the second/third run. Since it's still free on steam: Go and give it a try. You most likely won't regret it and if you do: HELLDIVERS might not be the right game for you.
But that crafted story was also one of the downers: You played the same time and again. Sure, updates/mods allowed for other stuff but even these were the same after a while.
The first run was always tense and some trigger happy moments led to accidental team kills, the second was easier because you had a rough idea where the enemies would pop up and the third became a definite been-there-done-that run.

HELLDIVERS is different in that each player is contributing to the overall campaign, the War SUPER EARTH is fighting against the Bugs (which by PURE incident turn into bio fuel on death, totally not the reason to fight them and keep the industry going!), Cyborgs (which want liberty of the single being and think man & machine could work in the same body. Everybody knows that the managed democracy is the best way for humans to live in prosperity and liberty!) and Illuminates (which are a total threat to SUPER EARTH because they don't want us to have their advanced tech and also they're producing WMDs to eradicate humanity!).

Now, these missions are generated on randomized maps, with the outline of the combat zone hardly ever the same (apart from arena fights where you have to kill a certain amount of enemies to teach them a lesson!) and on these maps you get an area that might be using the same models of rock outcroppings, bunkers, cyborg AA emplacements, battlements, wrecks and the like but these assets are always rotated differently, so that you won't see two in the same orientation soon. I played 47h now and I haven't.

Controls are responsive enough with either Mouse & Keyboard or controller though in some cases you can clearly notice it was made for controller with twin stick and d-pad controls.
Your trooper moves fluidly, diving for cover in the direction he's facing (that often saves your behind, if you remember it) and generally shooting where he's looking.
Shooting? You'll do a lot of that and with a load of weapons. Aim to get a crosshair (otherwise your cursor is invisible) and unleash a salvo of slugs, blasts of shotguns or laser beams.
Because... if you don't shoot the enemy patrols will notice something's wrong with you, you not being a six-legged bug/heavily implanted mind-linked cyborg/descendant of jellyfish and signal for backup to ... cleanse that problem.
This backup -depending on the mission difficulty- might consist of some simple worker drones (boots up and stomp 'em out!) up to tanks (argh, another one? We're running low on AT ammo here!).

And that is the moment where the real fun starts.
See, every HELLDIVER starts his/her mission with a pistol (which can become quite a capable tool to dish out democracy), a rifle of one sort or another, one perk (an always-active item of equipment like incendiary grenades or a cooldown reduction for your stratagems) and four stratagems. These are marvelous.
They can be anything from an ammo drop to recoilless rifles vs armored targets, grenade launchers, artillery barrages, auto turrets, napalm, cluster bombs, mechanized assault suits (bad if you think they look like Warhammers Dreadnoughts) and many more.
These equipment drops can themselves be used as a weapon. Because, you see, they're dropped from a Hellcarrier in orbit. And they drop fast. And are heavy. And don't really brake before hitting the ground...
Anything standing under or next to them takes damage. A lot! No matter if it's your comrade, your teams APC or a bug Tanker: They're squished. Add to that the ability to upgrade them between missions and you go from ""cluster bomb to take out infantry"" to ""laser guided bunker buster with side munitions to clear the area"". Or for rifles from ""the second shot goes in the same direction"" to "" four shot salvo dead center"".

Overall, HELLDIVERS is a lot of fun thanks to the friendly fire incidents that are often times hilarious; the backstory that's brilliantly deliverd by NPCs (nice voice acting there, too!) and the Encyclopedia on the Hellcarriers; and the satisfaction from completing a stressful mission against the odds, evacuating all HELLDIVERS just before the shuttle is overrun.
Matchmaking is as fluid as you can wish for, just step on the teleport pad on your carries bridge and select a mission on some world and difficulty you like, short moment later: BLAMM, you're dropped into combat.

It might not be the right thing if you can't handle satire and are from the best damn nation in the world but even then:
Ignore the story, come for the shooting.
And the explosions.
And the laughter when another well meant and poorly placed artillery barrage takes out not only the enemy but your team...

Sure there's stuff they could've done better, like a planet rotating under the Hellcarrier to bring the later missions required to ""liberate"" it in sight, but the way it's now (left side with the Hellcarrier in geosync orbit and part of the planet with mission markers in the corner below; right side for mission details) you can select where to start.

so the things that make me not recommended this game are because:
- all players share 1 screen. so, the slow player is always on edge of the screen and can not see the enemies. surprisingly the risk for team kills is bigger than in Alien Swarm stray bullets.
- what you aiming for is not always where your shoot landing. so no quick tap in a different direction, now you need to aim then wait, then shoot, repeat.
- small map, lots of empty open space. the enemy just spawns anywhere, kinda simple.
- portable turret can rotate 360, with no arc, and coupled with dumb ai and can friendly fire, it just blasts any player in front of it, so the player needs to duck but when at it the player can not shoot.

other note:
- reload always take longer because there is no special bar for quick reloads.
- in Alien Swarm, alien bugs spawn from 'scene' blasted dor, floor, window glass, or jump in from above and you start screaming ambush and trying to lock down the blast dor, looks so cool, but in helldivers they just 'puff' spawn in.
- maybe animation and behavior are lacking? idk, in Alien Swarm the alien bugs sometimes act like taunting the player, flinching when get shot, etc.
 

the good thing from the game are:
- can join on progress mission.
- can revive fallen players. cus in Alien Swarm if you are dead then you are dead until the mission is over.
- changeable outfit.

Imma put this in perspective:

Do you want a casual game that allows you to pick up and put down in 15-30 minutes? 

Do you want a game that can be a piece of Super-Earth pie, but you can take the difficulty to extreme levels of chaos? (When you know ""Democracy"" MUST be spread no matter the cost of your time and or personal life?)

Then you need to visit your local recruiting office on Super-Earth today!

Do yourself a favor and support the creators of this masterpiece. Also, if you really want to experience everything this game has to offer and more, the DLC is an absolute Must-Have. From the ""all-terrain boots"" DLC that let you run through winter-covered planets, to the ""Pilot DLC"" that gives you an anti-tank cannon mech, the cost is but a ticket to ride.

(Look, you don't have to buy the DLC, in fact, I don't usually buy anything with DLC because I often find the regular free items better than the paid.)

But after giving hordes of indigenous hostiles a ""taste of freedom"" with both paid and free loadouts, I can say with confidence that if you like the look of this game, you will 100% enjoy pretty much everything you buy for this game.

Its a fun game with satire and lots of splat.
Reasonably short maps.
Reminds me of Magicka but with guns.

Longer Version:
It hits with the same kind of humor as Starship Troopers. The flavor of the scenarios aren't exactly deep to get into, and it is steeped in a tongue and cheek look at reality. It is amusing to me to put out in caps lock ""FOR SUPER EARTH!"" This is of course, followed by firing whatever weapon  I have until the clip goes empty and loosing every grenade in my arsenal. The game is designed for a character to likely die, and die frequently. On the higher difficulty planets, I saw like nine deaths still get the bonus exp for clearing. 

The ""strategems"" are a pain in the neck to start. Luckily, when you're learning them, you're probably not using them for the first time. Eventually, you will have say two seconds to fire up the command, rapid fire the entry, and revive your squad before you have to dive out of the way of some other angry thing trying to make you pay. You got some decent loadout things you can change according to your playstyle, but overall, if you don't have a plan, you're going to be in for a rough ride. 

There are different missions for each map. There are different objectives, and progression isn't entirely locked to level advancement. You get a good group together, you can crank out the research needed to advance your gear along the way. If this game is on sale, I totally recommend it, especially with the nifty DLC. If its not on sale, probably use your best judgement on that expendable income. I've had a good time so far, even when someone accidentally spawns and splats another squad member.

For those of us familiar with the PS2 golden era with Metal Slug and Neo-Contra, this will give a familiar shoot-em up vibe. The main difference here is how brutal the game is if you don't play by the rules, especially above medium difficulties where enemies are a lot tougher. The means in which enemies spawn in the map are mainly by patrols/scouts detecting the players. You're given a variety of powerful tools and weapons to deal with your enemies but are mainly limited by your ammunition and the amount of times you can respawn. The game mechanics HIGHLY favor Co-op so get some friends to play with you or make new friends to play with along the way.

Things I like:
1. The game is polished; in graphics, sound design and mechanics. It looks good, it sounds good and it plays well.
2. The variety of strategems you have at your disposal to unlock, upgrade and use gives everyone a chance to experiment with different playstyles.
3. There is no consequences for defeat or loss. It just means that a mission is failed and you have to start over. Sure you lose the samples you collected in a mission for upgrades but that's about it.
4. There are no in-game micro transactions! Everything else is sold in DLC packages which are really cheap when discounted.

Minor gripes:
1. The music is very over the top and generic Starship Trooper propaganda music. I wish there was variety.
2. The camera can be very janky as this was built to be played Coop on the PlayStation. If 4 players decide to head in 4 different directions, the camera is going to stay still and everyone is going nowhere.
3. The upgrade system is rather grindy. You have to collect 10 research samples in each mission to get 1 upgrade point. The amount of samples increases based on the difficulty of your missions. However, if the other player (s) in your team decides to play the objectives than collect samples, your efforts become a lot slower.
4. At some point of time, the game becomes repetitive once you master a difficulty level, but that gives the incentive to tryhard and attempt even crazier difficulty levels which is hard to succeed on your own.",1649490770,1649490770,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I find it just really annoying, all the enemies just run towards you at quick pace and high numbers, constantly spawning.
Your slow character, quickly runs out of bullets and struggles to reload (great soldier training there), and can't even shoot while prone, or do anything at all (not even look at the map! WTF!). All the equipment you have take ages to deploy, having to hold a button and a sequence of other buttons just to be waiting to get it deployed or for a simple bomb... all this while the endless waves continue to spawn and rush to you. It's just too easy to get overwhelmed (even having played about 5 missions!) and I really don't find this fun.
This game is probably best in multiplayer, as I bought it to play single player, I won't recommend it, and I'll ask for a refund.

If you love PvE shooters that have you going point to point doing objectives and are good at rhythm games, this game is worth a try. The three different factions have a wide variety of enemies, some only spawning in harder missions. I love how unforgiving this game is too. It's so funny whenever you join your friend, and then you crush his head in with your drop pod. Basically everything that you can spawn will intsa-kill you if you stand underneath them, including the escape ship. The strategy you have to put of what you are going to take and how you are going to use it is so exhilarating for me that this is probably the best shooter I have played. There is so much to do in the game that you're only bored if you choose so. if you don't try out a few missions (and if you don't like it you can refund) you are missing out on the best top down shooter.

Everything comes together nicely to set the stage for the overall game-play, sound and isometric visuals are great. The whole premise is you are trying to drive back alien forces from the galaxy to protect humanity. Not much else to it. The game-play itself is twin stick shooting at it's best. Very much designed for co-op, it's a lot of fun with any number of players. Weapons feel meaty, there are great skills and equipment upgrades. And a wide variety of challenges as you progress through the game.

""A Cyber Hound is chewing on my cape! I can't escape!""
""Again!? that's the third time on this mission!""
""Damn these cyborgs. How are you doing back there, Rick?""
""I'm in a tight situation here. Almost out of ammo as well! Oh, someone joined the squad!""
""What's his name?""
""I can't read it while trying to dodge these bullets but he won't make it! And yep, he is dead!""
""It's about time to call the reinforcement.""
""Got it, hehe!""
""You had to throw reinforcement in the middle of that horde of Butchers, didn't you!? We won't make it to the shuttle, you idiot!""
""No problem, kill as much as you can! I'll never forget your bravery! You will become a legend!""
""I'll get to the shuttle and tell your story to the next Helldivers generation!""
""Before talking about legends, you better watch yourself about not getting squashed under the rescue shuttle!""[/i]

This friendly conversation will wrap the Helldivers Co-op experience in a nutshell. Like every Co-op focused game playing this game solo while it has its challenges, it will get repetitive much faster. The best way to get the most endless fun out of the game is by playing with your friends! Character's monologues during the missions like ""Say hello to democracy"" or ""Freedom never sleeps"" are one of the best parts of the game as the game uses this political humor very proudly. 

The core game will offer many handy gears to make the best loadout for each mission. If you wanted more variety of weapons and pieces of equipment, there are lots of great DLCs available to add to your inventory.

Teamwork and good loadout will make a difference in success and loss in these randomly generated missions. Character customizations are not so appealing because of the top-down camera and mistaking your character with others can be a regular accident! 

Thanks to the amazing sound design everything feels deadly. This friendly fire system is one of the best points of the game and it will force you to make better shots or call the pods in better places. It is full of joy and cry at the same time! Lack of the story and more sandbox and non-linear missions is a downside to the game but no one can deny the fantastic Co-op experience that this game has to offer!

My experience with this game amounts to an initially hopeful feeling after seeing its visual style, followed by a deep discomfort and feeling of dread as I failed to understand the user interface, and then ending with a sense of rage. This game seems to have 3 factions of about 6-9 maybe units, and it already became repetitive after an hour of playing.

Merits:
- Great setting (Starship Troopers vs 3 kinds of ""evil"" aliens);
- Fun and good gameplay;
- Good sound;
- Variety of weaponry and tactics (and no winning algorthm).


Flaws:
- There is nothing to do after 15-20 hours of gameplay (and acquire essential strategems, and 3 capes), no achivements, no unique clothing (you will get some while leveling), nothing. You just play for gameplay... But this is co-op game, there is NO COMPETITION WITH OTHER PLAYERS, so after you helldive with all factions you will feel contentment, and you will uninstal game, because there is no reason (exept fun gmaeplay) to play more;

- Single Player is just playing coop missions alone, there is no campain, no specially created for one player missions, no story line, nothing. 
You have NPCs on your ship, they could just give you some generic extra subquests (e.g. ""kill 4 bug behemoths in next mission"") for some ""medals"", just to have a purpose to go on mission. Even after you WIN A WAR, you admiral will tell you, that there will be SOON NEXT WAR. So community achivement is meaningless;

- Servers are just pile of garbage, DC from games are often for exaple- my friend have 120 mb/s, I have 240 mb/s, we got DC, and today I WAS DISCONNECTED FROM MY OWN GAME! How?

- Basic weapons are weak and miserable, you need to buy DLCs or you will struggle, and this is classic ""PAY TO WIN"".

PROS
Good amount of build customization.
Good level designs and objectives although no elevation sadly.

CONS
Awful shared Camera lock.(worst thing about this game by far)
Terrible balancing of gear, skills, and perks.
World Event tied heavily into the game with not enough players to progress it.

I have, as Steam so kindly displays above this review to see, 25 hours played in this game at the time of this review. What you don't see is that I have roughly 150 hours on PSN of actual in-mission playtime in this game at the time of this review, so I feel I am capable of thoroughly reviewing this game, as on PSN, I have every weapon, every strategem (the equipment you get to call in on each mission), and every perk (accept for a couple strategems in 2 of the DLCs that I have not purchased.

The controls are easy to learn, hard to master, at least at a speed that keeps you alive in high-level missions. As a side note, controllers also work well with this game, and don't have the huge disadvantage that they do in FPS games, for example, which is nice as I am a native console user. There are some advantages to both, at least from what I've experienced.

There are plenty of weapons to use that all handle completely differently and match all sorts of playstyles. There are shotguns, sniper rifles, assault rifles, smgs, and every weapon has not only it's own stats, but many have their own unique perks, such as a mini-stun effect from some smgs and unstoppable rounds from a certain assault rifle, making gun stats not the only thing you look for in a weapon. The weapons feel as if they are their effects, like the SMGs don't pack as much firepower as other weapons, but the stun effect makes them easier to deal with for your teammates.

In terms of player base, it is still easy to find games to play in as of writing this review in May 2020, roughly 5 years after the game came out. Most of the players you find are friendly, but as with any game, you will come off the occasional annoying or just plain rude player. This is one of the few games that 4 people can play on the same PC at the same time. You also don't have to wait until the mission is over to join. Players can join at any point in a mission.

The DLC in this game does add a lot to it. On PSN, I have, as I said before, all the DLCs accept 2, and on PC, I have none yet. Seeing the game with and without the DLCs, I can say that they are certainly worth getting if you have the money. If you do get the DLC, getting all of it together would be the way to go, as you do save some money when you buy it all together. Speaking of saving money, the game goes on sale for half off frequently so getting it then is also advised.

There are 3 alien races or factions that you fight in Helldivers. Each with their own unique units and fighting styles. Each one has weapons that counter better than others, such as weapons with armor piercing rounds that do better against the bugs (the more armored faction, as you might have guessed). As a side note, there are also different planet types that have different hazards and disadvantages too. Both of these factors can influence your loadout in different ways, giving more variety to the game.

Also, as a bit of a miscellaneous paragraph: The game is updated every year on ""Liberty Day"" (in game holiday on October 26th), giving stuff like new free strategems or gamemodes. There is an official Discord for this game in which you can find people to play with. Even if you are a new player, there are people willing to help you out and help you learn the basics of the game.

TLDR: 10/10 game, nice controls, great weapon variety, good playerbase, multiple factions to increase game variety, and it goes on sale for 50% off often.",1590342411,1637778380,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This game will surely become a favourite when you experience the sheer sense of relief as you realise it's only a matter of seconds until your drop ship will arrive to signal the successful completion of a challenging mission. Or, the anticipation created as you realise this was a rare event mission that will likely lead to a promotion, more tech, or at the very least it will contribute significantly toward the War effort that impacts every single Helldiver player...

THE EVEN BETTER:
Holding out in an unfavourable position, you've found yourself in, as you are forced off mission to help your team, while you curse through reloads to find some breathing space.

THE FUN

A top-down twinstick shooter where you fight against giant alien bugs, hideous cyborg monstrosities and advanced alien psychics, with an arsenal of assault rifles, shotguns, lasers, grenades, mech suits, tanks, and nuclear airstrikes, you are part of the HELLDIVERS, an elite team of highly trained human soldiers doing their duty to protect Super Earth by ""liberating"" the other factions. It's very highly tongue-in-cheek universe where ""DEMOCRACY"" and ""LIBERTY"" are yelled at every given opportunity while you're kicking in the teeth of everyone who isn't human.

It's a difficult game, to be honest. Many enemies are extremely tough, and have tiny weak spots where you have to have spot on aim to kill them, and then there are some enemy types that are impervious to all your weapons except rocket launchers or airstrikes. However, the most dangerous obstacle in this game are arguably your own teammates, as friendly fire in this game is a very common occurrence, and when calling in more equipment, you can be crushed under the droppods.

Negatives? The Pistol Perks Pack DLC is trash. Why? Because it's poorly implemented. Same goes for the Grenade Perks (not DLC, but same deal).

Helldivers is a challenging couch Co Op shooter which really nails atmosphere, importance of tactics and communication. It is brutal and unforgiving, but phenomenally satisfying and rewarding when you pull off a mission, overcoming seemingly impossible odds. 

The base mechanic of inputting a series of directional commands to complete objectives or call in powerful stratagems is a very refreshing mechanic, as some people may struggle with this, others may be terrible at shooting but absolutely fly through the command sequences, which opens up the roles team mates can play nicely. 
 
The persistent meta war is a nice feature, and I found myself logging in and being on the edge of my seat by the end of the war report, seeing how close we are to delivering managed Democracy to our enemies, or how close they were to our sacred Super Earth.

The humor in this game is also excellent, and the overwhelming majority of the community is patient and welcoming too.

The Cyborgs are hard to kill and the Fishborgs are easy to kill, but they don't like it when you try to kill them, so they ask you politely to not and go away. For some reason this works. Unless of course, you're wearing an energy shield of some kind. In which case the sound of their voice just makes the barrel of your weapon jam itself down their throat. Very odd indeed.

If you are seriously considering getting this game, you need the DLC that gives the Humblebee UAV. Upgrade that to lvl 3 and you'll get upgrade points like a motherfucker. It spots the tokens you need for upgrades at lvl3.

Another thing I should add, the Illuminate(fishborgs) aren't scary. Energy shield, Punisher(pump action) shotgun and the Grenade Launcher(don't remember the name) and you're good to go. Punisher one shots all infantry and scouts, even shielded ones. The GL can be used to waste the walker tanks and council members(floating chair dudes) with ease. And because the punisher is loaded shell-by-shell, you can have a constant stream of lead headed their way.

Oh, never let your gun run dry. The reloads are WAAAY longer if you do. Even for the punisher. You'll hear a 'Garand Ping' when your weapon starts running dry. For the punisher, you get one before the last shell. That's when you reload. Energy weapons need not apply. You get overheating noise and beeping instead. Let it cool off a second and you'll be good.

This game accurately depicts shotgun, by the way. The punisher is the most accurate, able to fucking snipe across screen. The... other shotgun... is very good at crowd control, decent spread but still able to hit distance shots. The laser shotgun is... odd. But functional. Haven't used the double barrel yet, but it can become a sawn off.

Last thing, before I end this, I'm not sure if the 3 round bust on the standard pistol is good or not. In some instances I'm like 'Yes! I needed those extra bullets!' and in others I'm like 'FUCKING DAMMIT! I NEEDED THOSE EXTRA BULLETS!'. So idk. Wish it was selectable.",1629168765,1629168765,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

1. A perpetual event means you don't get to choose which of the 3 enemy factions you fight. After 4 days I have still not even seen one of the factions because the event has decided that faction is already defeated. Unlocks are also tied to defeating the 3 factions which means 2\3 of the game is inaccessible to me and will remain as such for the forseeable future. 

2. The game is extremely pay-to-win. In the great future where this game has ended development you can grab the game + all the DLC for a reasonable sum. But if you don't you will be miserable. Almost all the fun toys are behind a paywall and almost every weapon found in a DLC is better than one outside it with few exceptions. Buying the DLC lets you use a mech that comes with an anti-tank gun and a flamethrower; these are two separate unlocks in the basegame.

Any of the positive qualities this game has immediately falls away when things outside my control restrict me from enjoying it. If the global war event didn't exist, or let itself be bypassed, then at least you could play to have fun and progress. But can't even do that. Always at the mercy of the global permanent event.

All three races are mostly self-explanatory in their theme (the Illuminates are similar to the Protoss from Starcraft if you are curious) and all have a set of light, medium, and heavy units armed with unique weapons and abilities to keep you on your toes. There isn't very much in lore or story as I mentioned, but snippets of game dialogue paint a very satirical backstory for the galaxy, which is ruled by a hyper-centralized 'managed democracy' with some very imperialist and fascistic tendencies hidden behind a facade of freedom and patriotism.

Players can set up a load out consisting a primary weapon, a backup weapon, a perk, and four stratagems. Primary weapons run the gamut of assault rifles, snipers, shotguns, and laser cannons. Your backup weapon is always a basic pistol, unless you select a perk that swaps it out for something like a mini-flamethrower or a revolver. Other perks give you more passive buffs like a laser sight for increased accuracy or quick call-in times for your stratagems. Stratagems are essentially supply drops that can be used by the player to acquire things like extra ammo, heavy weapons such as rocket launchers, or even vehicles such as mechs and tanks.

Weapons and Stratagems can be upgraded by spending Research Points, tokens that are earned from both leveling up and finding 'Research Samples' on missions. All of this combines to make a pretty fun shooting experience with a decent amount of customization.

The only real complaints I have are: the UI is clunky and counterintuitive in some places, especially when it comes to setting up your loadouts. Why can you only set up a loadout when you're waiting in a lobby to start a mission? Why do all weapons of a similar type (i.e. assault rifles) occupy one spot on the weapons list in the loadout, and you have to cycle through them by clicking a tiny arrow? As a returning player I was confused and could not equip one of the assault rifles I unlocked until I realized this.

And: some of the graphics, such as your Helldiver character model, are on par with a PS3 or 360 game. I know it's from 2015 and the camera is zoomed out most of the time, but come on guys...

I think this game is worth a buy if you're a fan of the genre, I just wish it was ten dollars cheaper so you could get more randoms playing and enjoy yourself outside of game night with your buddies.

The biggest problem is that it can be obnoxiously difficult.  I would guess that's to get people to team up, but then they force team damage and losses do not progress your character in any way.  The few times I played with anyone online they ended up wiping the group with poorly placed explosives (I was doing couch co-op).  And then if you're playing online and their servers go down, you're kicked out of your couch co-op mission.

Difficulty doesn't scale with player count, and is pretty uneven.  Paired with a crippled player count (<400 people online) and further fragmented by difficulty levels, even finding someone to play with isn't easy.

Progression is tied to increasing the difficulty.  So after getting everything from difficulty 5 and below, and being unable to do 6, no new unlocks would ever happen.

Taking the previous three points together I'd either have to find more people to play, grind way too much, or quit.

They wall off content based on some odd mmo space war.  There are 3 factions in the game and I only ever saw one of them.

I dislike entering d-pad codes.  This is essentially a quick time event to throw a grenade; other games have this stuff figured out.

One of the best combinations of good mechanics, fun and sometimes challenging gameplay, and player teamwork I've ever seen together. The player community is generally pretty awesome. Despite the occasional disgruntled player, I can't say I've ever heard anything horrible over voice chat. The game encourages cooperation, and what I've seen of the community reflects that.

The setting is fun and honestly kinda hilarious, and in-game hints will often offhandedly mention horrifying existential or Orwellian concepts like they're everyday business. It has a lot of Warhammer 40k inspiration, along with some Halo thrown in there for good measure, and the resulting mix is refreshing. The three enemy factions are all completely different both aesthetically and strategically, and force the player to experiment with different play-styles to combat them.

I want to briefly talk about the multiplayer here; although one can technically play any mission solo, it's very clear that many if not most of the higher difficulty missions are designed to be done with a squad of up to four. This has some drawbacks, but the game is undoubtedly well-balanced. Remote Play Together or  multiple inputs are also possible, allowing players to share the full game with friends who don't have it (assuming you can get them to play).
The DLC also doesn't segment the player-base, and players without it are not at a major disadvantage. 

Lastly, the graphics and sound effects are impressively smooth. I particularly love the sound and effect of the Scythe when it fires. It's a really juicy sound for a laser. Not sure how else to describe it.

TL;DR This game has a lot of character and is definitely worth picking up if you want something fun to sit back and play with friends or randoms. Just don't go jumping into the higher difficulties as new player without backup. I've seen many a decent new player accidentally splatter themselves on arena maps because they don't know what they're doing yet.",1627421781,1627421971,True,2,1,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

I almost found this game accidentally. Before beginning to buy games on steam, I was playing pirated games (don't worry, I'm now a better person and I'm only playing the games that I buy from steam). This game was one of them, I've played it with my brother and we enjoyed it so much. At that time I didn't really understand how the planets and regions work, we just played it locally and had fun. But when I bought it on steam, man, the fun has at least doubled!
As you can see, it's a top-down shooter. I kinda like this genre, one of the reasons are this game. it plays very well, I can just walk with an EXO suit and watch the animation and feel the weight in it and never stop.
Almost everything hurts you. Friendly fire is lethal and even your supportive drops can kill you instantly if you stand beneath them, and you will, trust me. But this makes the game even more fun, to care not just about your enemies, but also about your friends. If you play it alone, it's fun. But if you play it on multiplayer, it's so much more fun. But the beauty of this game is when you have a party of you and 3 other friends, on a hard level that pushes all of you to your limits. This will change how you look at this game...

For those of you who didn't played it anywhere neither see someone playing it, this game can be hard, so much hard, and it also can be easy. It's a little tactical but not that much, but you have to take care of almost everything. It is old but it still has an active community to enjoy multiplayer. But even without randoms, you can enjoy this almost infinitely with your friends.

1) You will be forced to do whatever mission is available. This means doing the same mission in the same biome against the same enemy until the community either wins or loses the war. The only thing you have control over is the difficulty level. This gets VERY boring and tedious, and you cannot progress through the game and unlock new stuff until this thing is resolved, which I'm told could take weeks/possibly forever.

2) The enemy spawns are incredibly bad. I have seen a tank drop from the air right next to me and set off an alarm one too many times. You can kill a tank only to have a new one drop a literal second later. You have very little control over how a battle goes, it's all just RNG bullshit. Either kill everything before it sets off an alarm, or deal with endless streams of enemies that spawn right next to you.

3) The community is kinda meh. I have met a few good people that are willing to work together, but mostly it's just randoms that all want to go their own ways and flex their epeen. The community is extremely small so you will see the good and bad players time and time again. 

4) Every time you finish a mission you have to sit through the completion screen. This will take maybe a minute or so, but there is no way to skip it. Enjoy wasting you time watching the same thing every time you finish a mission. Who designed this shit? It's designed to waste your time, that's all.

5) I haven't even been able to experience most of the game since it's all locked behind some community goal BS, but I'm sure there are many many more issues with this game.

The Good:
+Massive variety in guns, perks, artillery, vehicles, and cosmetics.

+Gunplay is satisfying with enemies exploding into chunks of gore.
+The sheer chaos of a full lobby in a high level mission is something to experience.
+The entire presentation is a wonderful parody of a bunch of classic movies.

The Bad:
-Pretty much everything has to be unlocked. Levels and research is some of the worst to grind.
-Online play is an option, but it'll vary wildly on who you meet.
-The galactic war system gradually locks off enemies, which sucks if you just want to hunt some bugs.
-The locked camera is there to encourage team play, but there's no reason you shouldn't have your own.
-The late game effectively has you only invest in AP weapons.

I bet being one of 'those' is enough for some.... people. But what if I told you about a group of soldiers - no, angels - the Super Earth Federation has created that exceeds even the demands of Jean Rasczak himself?! Or the tenacity and precision of Supreme-Commander Irelia Xan?

As a mere trooper, do you find yourself still...wanting after the last shot is fired? Wanting for the blood of the horrid, xeno-alien bug to be on your hands just a bit longer? To spit in the face of every single one of them as they die, with the image of the true rulers of the galaxy embedded in their hollow, lifeless eyes?

Do you have an unquenchable thirst to safeguard humanity - and your loved ones - more than anything, but seem to be lacking the proper ""tools"" to do so? Tired of seeing your mates, friends and drinking buddies - even partners - die at the hands of these disgusting, insect, xeno scum simply cause they weren't better geared for the battle at hand? You, Your friends, Family, and Humanity itself, deserve better!

The Super Earth Xeno-Obliteration comity (SEXO) has been monitoring the ""archaic"" methods or the ""Starship Troopers"" project for some time now, and has had enough of the precious blood of Humanity spilled on filthy alien worlds time and time again. And so, with complete authorization from SEXO, this letter - which shall self-terminate in two standard minutes upon reaching this point in the message - has been sent to YOU, and a select few of your fellow brothers-in-arms, for showing bravery above and beyond what could ever be expected of a ""simple"" trooper....

YOU have been selected to join the newly formed 'Helldivers' Division! An elite group of individuals from the furthest stars of our galaxy. From privates, to Space-X forces, and even commanders - all are equal in a squad. All are equal in Hell!

Your missions will be the most suicidal, reckless, insane and borderline illegal according to the Super Earth Defense Force doctrines (SEDF). However, your squad's impact on the enemy we truly face will be monumental, and truly ensure that your loved ones, friends, family - and above all else - Humanity are truly made safe for generations to come; with your footprints laying the foundation on each planet.

Your odds of survival will be low. Your enemies are legion UPON legion. But unlike the foolish Star Troopers project, WE are sending you with the best weapons, armor, and orbital support SEXO has to offer. You may be in Hell, but you are never alone!

In the words of the late Jean Rasczak: ""I Expect the best and I give the best!"", an so too will you, Helldiver, should you choose.

The only real question that remains is: Are you ready to go to Hell? Are you ready to do MORE than just your part?

Should any word of what has transpired here reach unfriendly ears, remember....we...will be watching. We WILL speak aga-[/b] [spoiler]END TRANSMISSION. !!!!REDACTED!!!! !!!!!!!!SELF TERMINATION IMMINENT!!! !!!!!!!!!WIPING FILES!!!!!!!!![/spoiler]

The game is so much fun in multiplayer (far less fun if playing solo). You all share the same top-down view (limiting everyone from moving far away), which keeps you in close quarters & relying on each other, which can be both a benefit ... and with always-on Friendly Fire it can also be a liability.

I recommend playing with random loadouts at first until you learn what things do. The loadouts allow you to sort of design your own class (I tend to play medic/engineer classes, so my typical loadout focuses on the Angel medic drone, turrets, and barbed wire). Weapons, strategems, and perks all feel pretty unique, which allows for some great customizations.

Randomly generated maps are great, and the unlocks are pretty consistent + achievable such that I haven't felt it necessary to buy any DLC. The difficulty scales brilliantly, allowing you to find that balance of challenge that is also winnable.

There isn't too much lore, and I think the game might be better losing what lore it has. The overarching campaign is confusing and not well implemented (I still have no idea what use Influence has), but it's also something you can ignore without consequence. The only real harm it has is in making mission selection more confusing & tedious than it has to be, but it's more a pet peeve than an actual problem.",1622439754,1622580461,True,0,0,0.491803258657455444,0,True,False,False

Sadly there is no proper campaign or story.

You can't split up, you can't look or shoot in different directions, when certain gameplay mechanics require you to be able to engage enemies at distance. If your teammates are selfish, they'll just force you to go in a certain direction or leave you off screen when down. The always online system that relies on the community to lock or unlock content is also very poor. You might be locked out of fighting one or two of the three factions to fight because of this campaign system, and there's no way to play against a certain faction if you felt like it.

It's basically impossible to play solo, except maybe on the absolute easiest difficulties, and so like it or not, you have to play co-op. 

The method by which it forces players to cooperate is by giving everyone the same view of the battlefield .. if the team doesn't move together you get deadlocked. You also can't see much around you at that point, although enemies [i]will[/i] see you. 

This is where it gets tricky, because incompetent teammates will be the death of you. Helldivers truly is a game in which only the strong survive. 

Friendly fire is active at all times. Players take a lot of damage from being run over by friendly vehicles, from mis-thrown grenades, and even defensive turrets. Players have to be responsible for individual sectors of fire, have to deploy defensive assets such that they won't do more harm than good, have to cover each other as they reload, and have to coordinate flawlessly against heavy enemies while the anti-tank player reloads. 

Patrols will sound the alarm when they find you, and ammo is limited, so the only way to survive is to stay as close to the centre of the screen as possible (so you can see as far as possible around you), be on alert, and take them out so quickly that they don't have time to raise the alarm. 

The wide variety of weapons, gear, and strategems is awesome, but the limited number any one individual can deploy once again forces teams to carefully work together in order to ensure that you have enough ammo, healing, vehicles, defences, or heavy weapons, depending on the enemy race, and mission difficulty.

This will not be everyone's cup of tea, but for those of us who like this sort of thing it's one of the few games which gets so many things [i]right[/i].

If you want a game that gives you a challenge, want something to play with your friends, and gives you tons of ways to gib enemies this is the game for you.

The game is difficult make no doubt about that.
With a locked 4 player screen ( where all players essentially share the same view ) it makes for some hairy moments.
Knowing how to fight in a very limited space without killing your team mates is part of the skill it takes to master this game. 

You will have a massive assortment of weapons and and skills on hand to take with you to each battlefield. Use them wisely as a few of them can only be summoned a limited number of times per fight. 

If you are wondering about DLC
Most of the DLC isn't necessary - though survival boots helps a ton.

But if you love the game buy the DLC to encourage Arrowhead and sony to make a much needed Sequel.",1617715200,1617715200,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

There is a gun, the LAS-Sickle. Quite simply, it's one of the best guns for the following reasons:
1. When fully upgraded, it has pin-point accuracy. Compared to most weapons it's blatantly superior in almost every single respect due to the accuracy, and the next point.
2. Effectively infinite ammo. The simple fact that if the heat is managed effectively enough, you literally have unlimited ammo and never need to reload. This is a fact shared amongst all the LAS-series weapons.

The Sickle, it's not so much that it's too good imo, it's that some other weapons are too garbage to warrant mention in the same breath.

This game also has a design of enemies finding you, quite frankly, it seems okay at first, but then when you're soloing, it's the most aggravating thing in the world. Throughout the levels, there are patrols, these patrols are tiny and solely exist to detect you. Now this would be fine if stealth was an option but you can't even attack while prone, the perk for it simply doesn't exist, and honestly, it would make no sense that you'd need one. Shooting a gun while prone is, in fact, realistically easier and simpler than doing so while standing. There is no perk that causes your character to crouch down, becoming harder to spot unless sprinting, or hell. No perk that equips Camo of some kind, even a damn guille suit would be nice.

And patrols are basically everywhere, quite frankly only depending on your proximity to objectives, and there is no break in it unlike what the game supposes.

Not to also mention that the cursor on Mouse/Keyboard controls is mostly invisible unless aiming with right mouse button, making span-decisions really fucking hard if you can't fucking see your cursor because go fuck yourself on desert levels specifically, the game has a very bad readability problem with it.

Do I even need to start with how the enemies can ""detect"" you offscreen? Couple that with the fact that you are practically punished for playing in multiplayer by all players sharing the same goddamn screen, and congrats, you have a """"""fun"""""" horde-based twin-stick shooter to smash your dick with.

Drop pods? They land 70% of the time anywhere the beacon isn't, sometimes just directly on you and you may not even have any say in the matter.

I initially got this game because of a meme's comparisons between this game and Deep Rock Galactic.

Deep Rock Galactic is objectively far better in every single metric. Enemies just come at you, you don't have any patrols that summon literally 10x more enemies, drop pods drop on locations that is entirely predictable, All enemies can be defeated with only primary weapons if you really want and there is only one gun that sucks, while this game's weapons, half of them are bad. This game has a railgun that can't damage tanks, fuck off with that honestly. honestly the progression is also better than Helldivers.

I recommend Deep Rock, I've had more intense encounters, and more fun playing that than I have in my entire time of playing Helldivers, because everything doesn't knock you down so you take free damage, and all explosives don't kill you instantly.

Honestly the cursor point, drop pods being unreliable and the weapon balance being fixed would make this a helluva lot better, currently this is a game with vast potential, but it's designed like a Console game ported to PC as a half-assed effort, and honestly? I'd sooner recommend playing Dark Souls: Prepare to Die Edition for the PC without DSfix, you'll have more fun playing Blighttown at 5 FPS than this game overall.

I may only play this game, but only because it's better with friends in the way that you get to share in your collective misery, and that's not a good thing, even if it's a goal, because that should be a worrying sign that shit ain't alright from a developer's perspective.

Shared Masochism is a red flag, not a feature. While many confuse them all the time, there's a vast difference between a genuinely badly designed game and a really fucking difficult game.

Get Deep Rock Galactic instead. Or get Alien Swarm: Reactive Drop for literally free and have infinitely more fun.

Give me a team, and I can make something better.",1617701263,1617701263,False,5,1,0.438768178224563599,3,True,False,False

Enemies send scouts with each group of enemies and scouts can raise alarm in 2 seconds from next screen edge. You can't kill it due to various objects, enemies and magazine size. This results in far too many spawned enemies which are just frustrating and annoying to deal with. Graphics and menu interface is atrocious.

[b]Helldiver is a twin stick shooter that combines gunning and cooperatively perfectly.[/b]

Helldiver gameplay as a twin stick shooter feels responsive. The smoke and bullet trace to the enemy animation made your gun have an impact when shooting them. What helldiver is famously known is for their difficulty. Friendly fire will always on, mech can kill your friend with two step, and even the escape shuttle can crush your whole teammate.

The game also have a stealth mechanic, in which you need to be careful of enemy patrol. If the patrol spotted you, they will call reinforcement. Their reinforcement is endless, which mean if more patrol spotted you, more alien will show up. 

You will play as a helldiver, your job is to protect your earth from three kind of alien that want to destroy the earth. The earth will be strike from three alien at the same time, so you need to think which one you should eliminate first from the war. If one of those alien get to earth and we failed to defend it, the war will be lost. The war is a community effort, which mean everybody help the invasion from the star they earned from mission. Higher difficulty give you more star which can make the war faster. What happen if the war ended? there will always a new one ;P

The game have a unique air support called strategems. Strategems can be the difference of life and death of your team, escpecially in higher difficulty. Strategems can call mech drop, drone, ammo, equipment, and even a nuke. When equipment strategems is called, it will drop a pod that will crush anything (your teammate also) on your marked area. While the airstrike strategems will fire anything on your marked area. I remember killing my teammate while he is riding a mech with an ammunition drop.

The critic I have is boring map and repetitive mission. The map seems to consist of dessert, snow, and jungle. Because each mission is about 10 minutes, you will get to see the same map and mission over and over again. So I hope they will add more map soon.

It also got local coop which is awesome. You can play with keyboard and your friend on controller.

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
[b]+ Real teamwork is needed
+Packed with lots of action
+Strategic thinking
- Boring map
- Mission feels repetitive
- Weapon needs a lot of balancing [/b]

[h1] One of the best coop game on right now 9/10[/h1]

EDIT 28/11/2019: 
With the added new difficulty and weapon balance, I think the game is getting better. They still can make it really greater by balancing most weapon to be more powerful than one of the weapon in the game. Still, it's one of my favorite game of all time.

Best if played with friends, but not to be worried if you are a lonely wolf, you will make friends in game... or you will receive hate!!!
The comunity is alive at the moment I'm writing (3rd Mar 2021) - Always a game to join or people that will join your game.
It's an Evergreen. Sometimes I still meet with people I met 6 years ago in the game.
A very good amount of Steam friends I made, I made in Helldivers.

Sadly no Democracy expansion this year but the content is way more of any other game out there.
And don't be scared if your leveling apperas to be slow. Around level 20-25 you will be very adaptable to all situations! ;)

The game:
 - Pros -
Graphic is 100% - Polished, clean, fine. Perfectly tasty also for 2021 greeders.
Replayability is 110% - The game is awesom and the best is made by the players, the enemies sometimes becomes optional!!
Customization is 120% - The itemizations package offers an incredible amount of working permutations
Feeling is 130% - The leit motif of the game simply drives you insane!
DEMOCRACY is 200% :D

- Cons - 
Better if you buy all DLCs

My suggestion:
Buy the game, play the game, bring liberty

[hr][/hr]

[b]First Impressions Matter[/b]
If you want to start out in this game I highly recommend inviting a friend over for the proper co-op experience. There isn't a single game where I/we have had so much fun sucking at for the first few hours and I'm super glad I could share it!
Starting out, I don't think anyone will be good at this game and dying, failing and accidentally killing each other is both more fun and more forgiving when playing with someone else. While online multiplayer is great, it's a lot more satisfying to yell with and at the person next to you or return some IRL friendly fire. ;)

[b]Difficulty & Gameplay[/b]
As I've said, you WILL suck at this game for a bit, but don't let this discourage you. You do not NEED to be good to enjoy this title. In fact, I probably had the most fun when I was starting out and constantly screwing myself and teammates over.
In terms of challenge you won't be disappointed as mission difficulties range from ""Your mom would survive that"" to ""OMG that's impossible!"". [i](There's only a handful of people worldwide who can solo the hardest levels.)[/i]

Gameplay is easy enough to get into and feels great once you get the hang of it. For me a controller feels most natural, I mean... twin stick shooter, but kb&m is just as viable. Most people (90%) will just be playing the basic running and gunning, but for those interested, there are more advanced mechanics to master. 
Apart from the challenge of becoming a mechanical god at controlling your character, there is a great variety in enemy behavior you can study to become a master at manipulating the battlefield.

I cannot describe the gunplay without writing you an entire essay, so I won't [i](Yeah, I realize this review is going to be quite meaty already)[/i]
Let's just say this is no bullet hell shooter with some generic pew-pew. The main weapons already have plenty of variety and the fact that there's still discussions between veterans on what they like or think is weak or strong is testament to that. The combinations in primaries, special weapons and other strategems (kinda like airdropped abilities and/or gear) offer endless combinations in playstyles and anyone should be able to find some favorites. 

[b]Singleplayer & Coop[/b]
Like any game, the experience between single and multiplayer varies. 
Single player is more tense and less forgiving, but a great way to improve yourself. Remain in control of the game or die a terrible death, nothing beats the pressure and elation once you finally manage to overcome yourself on a hard-ass mission.

Multiplayer can either be super chaotic or efficient depending on your teammates and figuring out how to work together as a team (or survive despite your ""team"") adds another layer of depth and joy to the game. [i]Tip: add people you enjoy playing with to your friendslist; it's great to get used to eachothers playstyle and think up strategies together.[/i]
Coop works very well and while the playerbase isn't as large as it used to be, there are enough players around at all levels to either join their game or request their help in clearing your planet (low difficulty can be spotty as people move on from those rather quick and super new players might not know how to join you or just want to discover the game for themselves).

Overall I'd say we have a healthy community, both in random matchmaking and even more so in the Helldivers Discord[url=https://discord.com/invite/HELLDIVERS] [/url] with plenty of people willing to share their knowledge or even help out with missions or achievements. Apparently toxic players do exist, but they are no more than folklore to me.

[b]Progression[/b]
I quite like the progression in the game, although some aspects don't function as well at certain moments.
Helldivers is a SKILL based game and whether you can complete a mission has no relation to your level and is only partially determined by your gear; I'd say it's 30% gear, 70% skills and knowledge. [i](Sorry, had to be said as I feel like people are often focusing on the wrong things to blame)[/i]
[u]Level:[/u] Unlocks certain perks (like faster healing, lower strategem cooldown, etc.), weapons and armors (visual only).
[u]Research Points:[/u] Can be used to upgrade weapons and strategems, can be earned by leveling up and collecting samples on missions (1 sample = 1 extra research point after the mission).
[u]Strategems:[/u] You get a couple to start out with + whatever is included in the DLC you may or may not have bought. The rest needs to be unlocked as a reward for completing a planet (2-3 missions). Now this is where some complaints might rise. If you play in offline mode or you don't like doing multiplayer, it can be very difficult to clear high level planets to unlock certain strategems. 

Additionally, the game operates around a ""Galactic Campaign""; think of an endless war with different stages. Before one war ends and another starts, either all alien races need to be defeated or Super Earth needs to fall. In the event where we lose the war, there isn't much of a problem since the event lasts for a maximum of 48 hours. However, to win a war, we need to defeat all 3 races, and that doesn't happen in one night. This means that one race may be defeated and you can't play missions against them to unlock new gear until the war comes to an end (which can take up to 2 weeks). Now there are workarounds to mitigate this issue, involving deleting the part of your savefiles where the campaign status is stored, but I know many people want a game to ""just work"".
For the most part this Campaign mechanic isn't a problem, but if you just bought the game when one race is being defeated you may be locked out of some content for a little while, which sucks. Unfortunately there isn't much to be done here other than playing offline, messing with savefiles, to take a break and return later for a proper fresh experience, or just deal with it for a bit and learn to play the other races first. :)

[b]DLC[/b]
I absolutely hate DLC and microtransactions and I think it's a shame Arrowhead opted for this model of releasing content.
That being said, I actually don't have a problem with this game's dlc. The way I see it, you should just consider whether the Digital Deluxe edition is worth your money and be done with it. (Pro tip: [b]IT IS![/b])

- Insta-downed if any enemy barely scratches you ? Check.
- Weapons that need 5 bullets to kill a basic trash mob (largely because the spread is so bad only 2 of them will actually hit) but only hold 30 or so ? Check.
- Equipment to summon on the fly by entering commands which force you to stay stationnary the whole time, so enemies WILL hit you ? Check.

I had an absolute blast with Magicka, from the same folks, and thought that the ""you need to enter stuff on the fly"" would not only be as well done, but also be as fun. Alas, in this game, it just gets you killed. You need to use the movement keys to input the commands, meaning you can't move at all while doing it. In a game where any scratch on your armor paint means you're downed.

DLC somewhat mitigates that, so the ""pay to win"" mech suit saved my rear end a few times. But it is indeed pay to win. About DLC, too, there are quite a few of them for ""visual customization"", and still you can barely notice any difference. Can't even change colours.

I do love twin stick shooters of all kind, and own a dozen of them, at least. Never thought I'd ask a refund on that one, but here we are. Even on sale, this piece of dung isn't worth your money.

Tanks, APCs, mechs, motorbikes, airstrikes, napalm, artillery. You can throw together so many different combinations in your loadout that you can always change things around if you get bored of one play style. This is a busy game. It is loud, action packed, with lots of yelling, explosions and constant gunfire. At higher difficulties, you will be challenged and you will die. 
 Which brings me on to my second point. Friendly fire is permanently a feature. However, the community is small and tightly knit. You won't find many trolls or griefers in this game, but accidents do happen. Take it with a hint of humour and laugh when you get caught in the blast radius of a friendly nuclear warhead or when your ammo drop lands on an ally's head. If you can't cope with that, then this may not be the game for you.
 My third point is regarding DLC. The DLC for Helldivers expands it greatly. It contains a vast amount of weapons and equipment that adds so much diversity to the game. Certain DLCs are more useful than others, and I would very much encourage any new buyers to look on some forums to see which are your must-buys. On the plus side, the DLC packages are very cheap and well worth the content. But certain items such as snow shoes and the UAV are extremely useful and are not available in the core game. I'll say it again; check on some forums if you don't want to buy all the DLC. If you're going to just play the base game, I'd strongly recommend you avoid snow levels though, for your lack of snow shoes. 
 If you're looking for a fast paced, chaotic game with lots of action and humour, then definitely give this a try.",1613477004,1613477004,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

You are dropped from orbit into a variety of dangerous environments in order to purge xeno scum in a Starship Troopers esque setting using small arms, heavy ordinance and several items somewhere inbetween. Stellar sound design makes every weapon feel powerful and satisfying to use. This is 100% best played with other players as teamwork and specialised roles are essential for survival with specialised equipment with unique team uses not seen in other games are available. While friendly fire is extremely present and a major cause of death, teammates can easily revive you, making incidents very casual and easily brushed off. The matchmaking system works well and multiplayer games seem to be very stable.

While you drop with a primary weapon and backup sidearm, additional weaponry and support can be called in using the unique Stratagem system which is limited by either cooldowns or a single use per mission depending on what it is. Stratagems are called in by entering a combination of directional inputs, which is novel way of restricting the speed of calling in support as opposed to just having a time delay. More powerful Stratagems (heavy missile strikes, or tanks) have considerably more complicated inputs compared to weaker ones (light air support, or light bombardment). 

More weapons and cosmetics are unlocked via increasing your level using experience which is fairly quick if you take on higher difficulty missions and events. Different stratagems, slightly controversially are not always available to unlock as they are obtained from conquering planets which will be unavailable once the community as a whole has ammassed enough points to conquer it, removing it from rotation. This in theory may leave you lacking in particular aspects of your weaponry, such as a lack of  effective anti-tank or armor piercing weapons. I recommend buying the dlc (or deluxe edition) which will give many more options from the get go, although equally effective equipment can also be easily unlocked from low level planets.

One point I would put against the game is that the music selection seems limited and gets old quick. While triumphant military styled themes are thematically appropriate, I have found it to get boring quickly, although it's not to the point of being annoying. 

The level to level gameplay of Helldivers is extremely chaotic and enjoyable with situations capable of devolving from controlled and calculated to absolute carnage. The game seems to still have an active playerbase as I have encountered a mix of other new players to max rank veterans in matchmaking. I would definitely say it's good enough to justify paying full price for, but it does also seem to go on sale often.

It's made by the same guys who did magicka and the influence shows, so if you like magicka's gameplay you might like this game.

I used to really dread starting up this game, because of the community nature of it. See, I'd play it casually on and off, which means that the campaign - which is community wide - would often get finished while I wasn't there. Which in turn means I'd have to sit through a 'war completed cutscene' for ten minutes before I could actually play the game. And, a patch or two ago, that cutscene and the accompanying credits sequence was unskippable. It was especially annoying because I originally picked up the game for the local coop features. So I'd grab a couple lads, we'd sit down to play helldivers, the cutscene would start, and then I'd have to explain to them why we'd need to wait 5 minutes to play. 

Now, it is skippable, and it makes a huge difference for me. Now I can just casually kill an hour by liberating a planet. It's perhaps a bit counterintuitive, but now that I don't get slammed in the face with credit scenes with updates when starting the game up, I'm much more invested in the actual community war effort.",1612231083,1612231083,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It does an excellent job of keeping the tension up, and providing a good variety of top-down shooter combat. It’s easy to pick up, and there are worthwhile, game-changing unlocks.

It’s also highly repetitive, with limited enemy and location variety. How much you’ll enjoy Helldivers really depends on your playgroup, and their appetite for doing the same 15-minute mission over and over again.

It can be played on both console and PC, i have played the most on console (Three hundred-ish hours), but got the game on PC to play it even more and to support the developers of this amazing game.

Co-op:
The Co-op is amazing, although you can play on your own, i highly recommend playing with other people, whether it be your friends or the very friendly community that surrounds this game.
The Co-op feels very meaningful, some weapons, vehicles and equipment requires you to work together perfectly, an example of this is the widely used anti-tank weapon, The Recoiless rifle, which can be reloaded with a support backpack. If you attempt to reload it on your own you are left vulnerable, hunched over on the ground trying to slide the rocket from your back into the weapon. Or, one of your friends could come up from behind and quickly slip the rocket in over your shoulder, reloading it instantly.

Unlocking equipment, perks and stratagems:
Every single thing that the game lets you use is very meaningful, NOTHING is bad, the only time a weapon is bad is when its used incorrectly.
I will say it does get a little tedious later on to level up and the game is not very beginner friendly, but once you get the hang of the game you will have hundreds of hours of endless fun.

Enemies, difficulty and community effort:
As the Helldivers, you are Super earths special ops military force, carrying out dangerous mission behind enemy lines.
The enemies you face are the Bugs, Illuminate and Cyborg.
All of these enemies have a patrol of some kind which will sound the alarm when they spot you, the only way to prevent this is by killing before they call for backup. Sometimes the enemies can be a bit buggy ,sometimes patrols spawn inside objects and their path-finding glitches out every so often, but it really isn't that big of an issue and isn't anything game breaking.
To defeat an enemy race, all helldivers must capture regions and push them back to their home world in a massive community effort, each planet you ""liberate"" accumulates influence, which helps fill up a bar which determines when an area is captured.
Your goal is to complete missions on planets until they are conquered, there are in total 15 difficulty levels, you will have a lot of trouble when you first play and you will have to stick to easier planets for a long time so that you build up enough skill to take on harder levels.
I personally would recommend practising for a while on difficulty 4 or 5 , because thats when the difficulty starts to spike drastically.

Conclusion:
This is an absolute gem and more people need to play it, this is the only game that I have ever played for this long and i would love to see more people playing it. This game doesn't waste your time with meaningless side quests or hours of waiting, this is simply get in and have fun.

	Now, Helldivers is fun on both single and multiplayer mode for me.  For multiplayer, characters must work together since they are tied to the same screen.  Multiplayer can be incredibly fun, or incredibly annoying, depending on the teammates.
	The number of weapons, vehicles, and abilities (Strategems) that are include provide virtually all types of strategies and play-styles.  You want to move fast and avoid damage while using a jet-pack to further avoid damage?  Well, you can.  You love assault rifles and grenade launchers?  Grab 'em and party hardy, Marty.  The load-outs have a generous amount of variation, and trying new things out has been one of the best experiences in any game I've played.  The mechs, tanks, armored apcs (that all four players can ride in) are stellar examples of the vehicle play-style.
	Another very solid design choice was is setting up your gear so that you are always thinking of what to sacrifice in order to meet that sweet spot of player balance so that everything ""feels"" in sync. Again, the tactical strategy really pulls me in to this game.
	Older reviews appear to have gripes with a possibility of one or two of the three factions being locked while there is a campaign mode going on in the background.  This was leading to players being unable to fight against the faction they wanted until the campaign was resolved by the three factions being conquered.  I believe that would be very aggravating if still going on, but I haven't seen that issue as the devs appear have addressed this.
	One of the big questions for newer players is whether to get the dlc for the expanded items or not.  It is not required to own, but it makes for a much bigger variety of gear, so it has been a must for me personally.  Several dlc items are in my setup repertoire.  
	Another factor to the game which is really rewarding is mastering the different offensive weapons.  Reading several reviews, I've seen a lot of people that like a lot of different gear, and that really boosts the replayability.  So if you are not so locked into one style, you will really appreciate the work put in to change things up.
	With competent teammates, this game has been nothing less than stellar.  The thrill of victory has been very memorable in my gaming experience, and I am still getting into mid-tier rank and difficulty.
EDIT: So the lockout of certain races is still a thing with the campaign, but for me it forces me to get better at all the factions.  However, I see why this would aggravate a lot of people.",1610241418,1610761692,True,7,0,0.601075470447540283,1,True,False,False

 but ironically it's 'weak point' is the awkwardness of the controls, especially the 'strategems'.

 You have to constantly use your 'directional pad' to do 'strategems', 

 problem is that's very awkward, I wish they would've used the right hand buttons to do the strategems, that would've made things a lot more fluid.

 The game is very frantic, fast paced and 'fun', if you play with a full team and run around trying to do the missions etc, doing planet after planet.

 It, however, doesn't have that fluid smooth action feel that you'd expect from a typical twin-stick (i.e. Smash TV etc),

 so it's not as great as what you would expect if you play solo, which is very very unfortunate.

 It's a very good game, and extremely well put together, there's just 'something' missing though and a new 'redux' would probably be very well received, especially if they would have mainly 'shooting' missions,

 instead of constant non-shooting missions  (actually killing enemies missions are very rare in this game).

If that last point is hard to understand  (this confusion is why I first down-voted this game),

 it's because in this game shooting enemies is not actually what you 'think' you'd supposed to be doing, 

 it's more of a 'side-thing' you do just to get your missions done, which almost never include actually killing enemies.

 This is what ruins the massive potential this game had - this game isn't about shooting enemies, it's about doing missions (which almost never require shooting enemies) and the enemies you shoot just to keep yourself alive while doing missions.

Whenever I introduce this game to a new friend it is extremely frustrating to get wedged into whatever the current meta campaign situation is, and often the missions are too difficult or we have too few mission options.

IMHO this game *NEEDS* a campaign that you can enjoy with your friends, like the awesome ones in Magica or like the one in Castle Crashers. If Helldivers had this, it would move from ""instant classic"" to ""multiplayer legend"".

My only other major gripe is restricting the players to the same screen real-estate. It is a bizarre design choice, and counterproductive in the long run.

The fact that Helldivers is still such a great game is a testament to the many strengths and the polish put into the final product.

To do this, you and up to three other players must take on enemies from the Cyborg (arctic robo-bros), Illuminate (blue alien people), and Bugs (bugs) as you spread the reach of humanity across the galaxy. Players must take caution as to avoid firing on each other in the process, which occurs a lot more often than other games due to the mandatory shared screen (even in online co-op).

A big draw to the game is the use of ""stratagems,"" which provide you with a variety of offensive, defensive, and support items or attacks that can help you turn the tide or better equip yourselves for the upcoming fight. These are activated by radeoing in an arrow-key combination. The game also makes it very explicit that you should be careful with these call-ins since they may inadvertently hit (or land on, if it's a resupply call-in) other players.

The most frustrating parts are arguably the slow progression and quickly repetitive gameplay elements. Players who are adept with games in this genre while find it laughably easy at the start but must play through easier levels before they can access more difficult content. Additionally, equipment unlocks require the player to conquer planets from different factions, which can be a time consuming process. Since the state of the galaxy is shared across all players, once a faction is knocked-out, it's also unavailable for all players until the start of the next war.

I find a lot of joy in experimenting with different loadouts or tactics to tackle the challenges presented by the different objectives that are further augmented by how each faction provides a unique combination of difficulties for the player to overcome. Others that require more direction from the player in terms of how to challenge themselves will quickly find it boring.

Regardless, Arrowhead Game Studios has returned with just a lil' more content every time we celebrate Liberty Day, a holiday that occurs on October 26th. The last update provided a new gamemode with a new weapon, which adds a few hours (or more, if you're feeling adventurous) for returning players. Their dedication to this indie game dating back to 2015 is absolutely well-appreciated by me.

My one con is that a few of the equipment essential to success are dispersed among multiple dlc. (such as the sickle laser rifle, and the humblebee drone that revels samples)

After a few hours it becomes somewhat repetitive as there are only a handful of planet types and you only ever fight 1 of 3 factions over and over. On top of these you might not even be able to fight the faction of your choosing as the community based progression can result in that faction being eliminated by the time you log in.

All of that may sound bad on paper but its mitigated by the fact the gameplay itself is incredibly fun, especially with friends.

You may not be able to fight the factions of your choice but at least each of them are very distinct from one another and will keep you on your toes as long as you start a harder difficulty.

The game offers replayability in the form of unlocking new equipment and trying different weapon/strategem loadouts.
Although obviously there are objectively good loadouts and bad ones I can safely say most if not all the different options are enjoyable to use so there's definitely fun to be had finding what you like.

[h1]Story[/h1]

We are heroes that fight to sprerd managed democracy across the galaxy, Super Earth is our home where all desicions are made, and the target of the three main enemy factions that threaten our way of life. To fight back we count with a great arsenal of weapons, bombs, and technology that will help us during our liberation missions, the enemy will either accept our terms or they can die trying to fight democracy.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]

Helldivers is a simple game, we have two weapons, main one being hard hitting experimental weapons, rifles, shotguns, smg's, etc, a whole arsenal. secondary weapons are pretty much that, a weapon that will help you to get rid of smaller threats when carrying an objective or when you are down. Every time we start a mission we can choose four stratagems that will be practical and a key element according to the situtation, enemy and environment, most of these stratagems can be unlocked whenever we attack a high level threat planet, either that or we get XP, that will vary as well, the harder the mission, the better the reward, in the end we will have a huge arsenal of new gadgets, bombs, nukes, air strikes of different kinds, shields, armors, vehicles, etc. making the game more intense and extreme when trying to call for a stratagem, making them a danger as they can drop on you or your friends, being careful is important, one member down and a simple mission can go wrong.

On our way to spread managed democracy, three enemies will show up eventually as we advanced on every planet and sector, the map will reveal new areas to invade and/or defend if the enemy is cunning or if our numbers dwindle on an especific zone and fail to liberate a planet, this will give you the chance to choose what faction to attack, Cyborgs, Bugs or Illuminate.

Cyborgs: They are known to be socialists, change their body parts to mechanical ones (hence the name) hating super earth and carrying out terrorist attacks to demonstrate that hate.

Bugs: They are pretty much like the zergs, they act like a swarm, they are not intelligent but in great numbers they are extremelly dangerous and fun to fight as they are really unpredictable.

Illuminate: They remind me of the Protoss, they are the more technologically advanced race of all three factions, even humans, and rely heavily on shields for protection.

Each and every of these factions have weaknesses and strengths, choosing the right stratagem may change the whole scenario and the outcome of a single mission, being prepared and coordinated with your companions is also key as they can also turn into the main danger, drop pods and friendly fire are usually the main reason helldivers die during missions, which leads to funny moments, raging and frustration.

[h1]Graphics[/h1]

HD is not a demanding game, detailed where it has to be, some effects look great and the engine seems to do the job, many planets have different environments, forest, desert, volcanic, snow are the main settings, they may change a bit during daytime, dusk and nighttime, there is not much to add, HD runs smoothly and it's almost bug free, well optimized.  

[h1]Sound[/h1]

Besides gameplay, this is where HD shines, the music, the sound effects, the screams and orders from your companions, all of them create this tense sensation of being on the edge, calling for stratagems, reviving your mates, calling for them when they die, surrounded by countless enemies, making a mistake while calling for help and stratagems and the music keeps on adding more and more action to it, once all that is gone, everything returns to normal for a while, rest a bit, think the new tactic, call for ammo, resupply and continue, the music and environmental sounds will be there for you, the screams of your enemies will drown in explosions and bullets. Top notch sound.

[h1]The bad[/h1]

HD is filled with DLC's for this and that, unfortunately they did screw up by adding boots for different terrain as a DLC, absolutely unfair for people that just bought the standard edition, as they are a critical add-on for snow planets, like the home planet for the cyborgs, a terrible decision that cripples the gaming experience of those who don't have them, snow planets are harder for a reason, they make the soldier walk slower and be a sandbag for the team and those who do have them. Besides this, thegame is ok on every other direction.

[h1]Final words[/h1] 

I have probably had the best laughs playing a game ever, play with a friend or friends and the fun is neverending, even more when new players join your public game and usually the laughs intensify as many of them die unnecesarily, screw up while calling for stratagems or any other eventuality during missions, avoid most level 50's (max level in game) as they tend to be really bossy and think they know it all, they complain a lot and can't cope with frustration.

One of my favorite moments so far went like this:
I took a randomized load out into a hosted game with people that I didn't know.  They weren't very good and kept dying.  My randomized load out was sub par.  We made it to the extraction point, and things started to fall apart due to a bug tank appearing, since we were already at high alert with the enemy bug force.  The two guys who had the weaponry to take it out got taken out.  I didn't have the weaponry or stratagems to kill it either, but I did have a motorcycle beacon.  No one uses motorcycles.  They are too fast, so you end up falling into an environmental hazard and dying.  They are also too lightly armed to be useful.  I tried to carefully aim the drop point on top of the tank while helping the other remaining squad member run circles around the bug to keep it somewhat stationary.  It moved just a bit at the last second, but the front tire of the motorcycle still landed squarely enough to take out the bug tank.  I wasn't even sure that it was going to work, but it was awesome and hilarious!  We called in a respawn for the two dead guys and were able to survive long enough to extract on the shuttle.",1600614264,1600614264,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I do have two negatives for this game.  Which is why I knocked two points off.
One – the defensive missions are annoying because enemies can spawn right on top of you.  They should have it as wave attacks from specific directions.  

Two – Boss fights are NOT fun.  You have to use specific builds/weapons to beat them it seems like.  I don’t like it in games where half my arsenal is useless when fighting a boss.  Everything should be an option in my opinion.

[i][b]Arrowhead Game Studios[/b] are no strangers to the top down twin-stick shooter genre. Where I found Magicka's complex spell combos to be somewhat overwhelming & Gauntlet's authentic gameplay, although loads of fun, to become dullish over time, I found [b]Helldivers[/b] to hit that sweet spot between the two, while offering a much different sci-fi experience.[/i]

[b]Helldivers[/b] has a VERY strong Starship Trooper vibe, but it is used to good effect; while clearly taking its own unique creative queues. As a Helldiver, you are out to protect humanity from all manner of hideous alien species, in all the hostile planets around the galaxy. Each mission is randomly generated, offering different goals and layouts each playthrough. Along with this, there is also a number of different specific scenarios including some challenging boss fights in the late game plus a whopping 12 difficulty levels to choose from!
http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=590753025
In conjunction with the design choices & combination of mechanics used, [b]Helldivers[/b] offers up some intense coop gameplay, that actually encourages team work. Design dictating behaviour; It is nice to see a commendation/reporting option built in to encourage the community to govern itself against troublesome players. The coop/team work/community focus is strong throughout.

Levels being objective based, have tasks like bomb disposal, arming a missile silo, blowing up an alien hive or recover an important item. Each almost always requires team work to complete the task &/or to provide defensive cover. You also need to share ammo and supplies to best survive harder incursions.

Many of the objectives also require you to input a series of directional presses in sequence and without mistakes to progress. These start off easy but get quite long in harder levels, increasing the pressure & punishing mistakes harshly. This combo mechanic is also used when calling down your personal [b]Stratagems[/b] [i](re-enforcement orbital drops)[/i]. It is fundamental to the gameplay experience, and used in perfect balance with the shooter/action aspects of the game. 

[b]Friendly fire is ON![/b] One of the other key mechanics vital to the experience is friendly fire. Normally, unless playing with friends this can lead to frustration in online gameplay, actually turned out to be an absolute BLAST [i]*pun intended*[/i], offering up some of the most hilarious, calamitous failures & occasional epic recoveries I've seen. Lot of laugh-out-loud moments, such as the inevitable time when your team mate drops a reinforcement [b]Stratagem[/b] to revive your dead Helldiver, only to have the capsule kill them on your decent!

Surviving your team mates can sometimes be harder than the aliens :)

Controls via controller are responsive, precise & there are some challenging achievements to acquire on the side.
http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=602360106
Another impressive element of [b]Helldivers[/b] is the great customisation over your loadouts, each offering something different, but well balanced in a way not to have a go-to loadout. This encourages experimentation, keeps things fresh & used as a reward/unlock mechanic as you level up. The DLCs offer a much wider range of weapons & outfits to choose from, not required by any means, or offering any distinct advantage, but would recommend picking up the [url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/aussiedroid/recommended/396172/]Terrain Specialist Pack DLC[/url] with the 'Snow Shoes' as that is necessary in the Arctic scenarios. Working with your team mates' loadouts can greatly enhance your survivability & becomes crucial on harder difficulties.

The Mechs you can pilot are fantastic carnage inducing fun too!

Aside from the high quality, detailed animations & environments, there are three alien species change up your strategies, all performing very differently from each other. My favourites are the Bugs, perhaps it’s the throwback to Starship Troopers, but I do find them the most fun to play against. Cyborgs get on my nerves with some of the blocking mechanics used & swarms of Illuminate can be hard. 

These alien species are tied into a rather unique community feature where there is a War fought by all players in the Helldiver Community. Each mission success accumulatively counts points towards victories against the three different alien species, ultimately leading to a campaign to conquer their homeworlds. If players do not work together & push the aliens back, then they can overtake our homeworld. I really like the way this works, offering something to keep you loading the game back up on a regular basis, but it does unfortunately have one limitation in that it can prevent you from being able to play against some of the alien species at some points in the war. 

You may log in and find you can only fight Cyborgs for example, which can continue for many days!
http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=598177503
With all the variety in the levels, objectives, weapons & aliens coupled with the solid team oriented mechanics there is a lot of replayability to be had for the money, but ultimately as you progress to the top levels, seen a few wars & have everything unlocked the experience can become repetitive. Levels generally play out with similar tactics outside of the core scenario changes.

With such solid foundation & super fun gameplay overall, I would love to see content expanded for veteran & new players alike. More map variety [i](towns/cities/underground/night)[/i], more level modes/sizes [i](A-B survival runs, stealth runs, vehicle only levels, multiphase missions, many more objective types)[/i], more aliens or some sort of a game-plus mode or campaigns. Perhaps in a Helldivers 2: Search for More Democracy?

Although at time of writing this the online community [i](over a year since release)[/i] is still active, I have also unfortunately experienced many an issue connecting to games over my time playing. Does work 90% of the time, but some will simply not connect & dump you back at your ship. When it does connect, the game performs well.

Best played with friends, [b]Helldivers[/b] is well worth a look for any fan of coop games or twin stick shooters.

For Humanity, & most important of all .. [b]For Democracy!![/b]

Presentation: 9/10  The Bitsquid Engine fits the top down perspective of HELLDIVERS extremely well.
Characters and assets have a fairly high resolution to them, but at display resolutions like UHD (3840 x 2160p) and 4K (4096 x 2160p) they can appear a bit blurry.
The sound design is amazing. 
Weapon sounds have a real punch to them and the soundtrack is mesmerizing and changes depending on the difficulty or the enemy faction you're fighting against.


Gameplay: 10/10  HELLDIVERS is a top down shooter, you can play either solo or with 3 friends/strangers (don't play solo you WILL die).
As a Helldiver from Super Earth you have access to stratagems, you can call down via airdrop.
These stratagems range from supplies and light machine guns to airstrikes and mini nuclear strikes.
You fight aginst 3 factions: Bugs, Cyborgs and the Illuminate.
Each faction has different enemy types and attack patterns e.g. Bugs use heavy armored units, Cyborgs use heavy armored tanks and Illuminate use low armored units with shields (all depending on difficulty).
HELLDIVERS has a difficulty system that goes from 1 - 15.
1 = so easy that it's getting boring real quick
5 = nice but still easy challenge
10 = a real pain in the A**
15 = suicide sounds tempting
Special mention: you can play this game with 4 people in local coop on one pc with any combination e.g. 4 controllers or 3 controllers and one player uses mouse and keyboard.


Story: 4/10  There is a bit lore and additional informations for those who want it, but story informations are completely optional.
The main focus of the game is gameplay.


Conclusion: 24/30  Enlist today and join the vast forces of Super Earth.

It does a lot of things right; from the UI to the Gameplay to the unlock systems.

The galaxy conquer system is cool but after 4 years, it's shown flaws with some players just refusing to fight certain enemy types... Not that winning or losing a war has an effect on your character but it's obnoxious all the same and definitely drags out wars longer than need be. 

Also I probably would have moved the stratagem pistol unlocks into the pistol/secondary. A few OP stratagems just really outweigh the use of others in higher difficulty runs.... I'd probably do the same with Smoke/Incendiary grenade stratagems, and move them into the grenade slot option for wider variety of loadouts.",1595433431,1595433431,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game is absolutely amazing to play, for such an ""old"" game, the game has a relatively active fan-base and for once in a co-op multiplayer game such as this, going into missions with randoms is actually a viable strategy as the community is actually extremely friendly and teamwork is butter smooth all 'round.

Older players often join newer players and help them out and newer players listen to older players when they try to help, it's a very wonderful sight and a very very welcome breath of pure air among all these toxic games nowadays.

The community in this game has just ascended to the heavens and become practically angels, and the gameplay of the game is equally as good, randomly generated objectives and plenty of choices in planets/environments/enemies makes you able to enjoy the game for hours on end without even taking a break!

The game has 3 main enemy races, ""The Illuminate"", ""Cyborgs"" and ""Bugs"". Or as I like to call them ""Illuminati"", ""stormtroopers"" and ""holy fuck why is there so many tanks""
Each race has their own unique strenghts and weaknesses that the HELLDIVER arsenal has its own answers for, game progression is reliant on your own efforts and your own pace instead of a leveling system. Every level you get unlocks extra level specific weapons and items, along with letting you go into higher level planets (probably to prevent level 1 karens from going to difficulty 15 as their first mission and then blowing their ass off fuming to the manager how the mission didn't feel like the tutorial)

Every planet(mission) you accomplish either gives you a difficulty specific XP bonus toward your player level or unlocks a new armament directly reflecting the difficulty of what you just completed. Higher difficulty = Better gear unlocks.

Some of the DLCs for the game could be considered somewhat ""pay to win"" as you get some very OP gear right off the bat by simply buying all the DLC content, and even some(very few) of the non-DLC alternatives you unlock later on in the game aren't as good as the DLC variants which is a bit of a shame.

Overall the game performs outstandingly, with an amazingly lovable community, great gameplay, near endless replayability, very fun mechanics combined with great humor in dialogue makes for a very very good game well worth your money.

Nice graphics, good gameplay and responsive controls.
Lot of content, just be sure you buy the Digital Deluxe Edition (the only viable option IMO).
It's challenging, there's many satisfying weapons and vehicles to use.
HELLDIVERS is the perfect game for quick fun sessions.
It's a twin stick shooter so nothing very innovative but what it does it does really well.
The only problem i can see so far is that might become a bit repetitive after few hours.
I first saw this game many years ago and tbh now i regret not buying it before.

Highly recommended.

+ Procedurally generated maps, adds replayability
+ Meaty gun sounds
+ Everything supports team work, from vehicles to other weapons
+ Hard and challenging, but not frustratingly so. Unless you try too hard planets as a noob
+ Friendly fire always on. Adds challenge. Accidental TK happens a lot, part of the game
+ Very well thought out design. It's evident everywhere
+ Lot of guns, vehicles and gear to unlock, that have unique uses

- ... but lot of it is paid DLC. However, the best gear is mostly in the base game
- Most weapons are not useful in high tier planets, however still fun to use in early game
- Could use more enemy / mission types. After 70  hours I need a break, to not get tired

Macigka wasn't great, but this game is far more refined and thought out vision. Almost perfect.

Imo there still could be a slight balancing. Siccle and similar rayguns are a bit too ""meta"", bullet firing guns that need reloading, should be superior, because of their limited ammo. (It's also more fun to fire regular guns, because of sound they make) And mechs have too much ammo, when fully upgraded. They are not good against heavily armored enemies, but until that, with them the easier planets are a cakewalk.

This is a real shame, because the game CAN be a lot of fun to play. Overall, the game is a fun, squad-based game, IF YOU PLAY WITH OTHERS.

[b]Problem number 1: There are no AI players provided to fill your roster, which seems awfully short-sighted and lazy on the part of the developers.[/b] Lots of people like to play on their own or at times their friends are not online. Most of the lower-difficulty missions can be accomplished solo, but once you get into the harder missions, there are a lot ""defend this"" and ""escort that"" missions that are a real challenge without another player or two to cover other angles. Working together with other players and accomplishing the goals is satisfying, but a game this expensive should have the option to fill your squad with AI.

[b]Problem number 2: you have no control over where in the galaxy you play, or which enemy race you go to war with or attack.[/b] You are stuck in a world(galaxy?)-wide war that you cannot adjust to your own tastes, or affect in any meaningful way without playing the hardest missions where you keep getting your controls spammed so you can't control your avatar (more on that later). I've played for nearly 30 hours at this point, and I've only faced one of the three races. There's not even different servers you can log into set at different difficulties or different stages of the war. There is one login and one war. If that race of aliens everyone else is fighting isn't to your taste, too bad.

[b]Problem number 3: I have found the game is impossible on higher levels, thanks to one of the most tired and difficult video game tropes out there, the ""all your controls are backwards"", which the game developers thought would be a lot of fun to spam players with relentlessly at higher difficulties.[/b] I would just like to know if anyone, anywhere actually thinks having your controls flipped on you in the middle of a video game is fun? Has anyone ever had this happen and thought, ""Man, I love running the wrong direction while having my guy get shot by 10 tanks. It's really great that I can't dodge or aim or control my character at all, since my controls keep switching back-and-forth. It's even better that the enemies that change my controls are coming at me in waves of 10! Oh! And now 5 flying guys with cloaks and shields are coming that do the same thing! Hu-freaking-zzah!""

Seriously, the developers need to patch that ability completely out of the game. I bet none of the developers actually play-tested that feature and thought it was fun. It's challenging, for sure, but that is not the first and most important attribute of a game. Games are supposed to be fun first, then challenging in a fun way. There is nothing remotely fun about playing this game on the hard levels and getting blown-up while running around like a chicken with your head cut off, because your controls keep flipping on the X and Y axis.

Seriously, that last problem alone is enough reason to stay as far away from this game as you possibly can.",1593390707,1593390707,False,8,5,0.491414427757263184,0,True,False,False

I can't take this, the entire game is a giant left wing propaganda against the US going to war in Iraq, The players/humans are made to be seem evil, stupid, and bloodthirsty, George W. Bush appears in news stories and is called ""John W. Killjoy"", game essentially propagates the ""war for oil/bush lied people died"" slogan that came from the media post 2005.
Game is decent but this blatant political agenda is not even fun or lighthearted, it's mean spirited and totally one sided. it persists through the entire game.
Humans (americans) = evil
Right wing humans = really evil
Soldiers = evil /brainwashed
Everyone else = innocent

It happened on multiple occasions that we went online and were locked out of 80% of the game, because it was the end of the war (the community-driven progression). This can easily happen 100% of your play time, if you're unlucky enough to log in at the end of the war. That's not what I consider fun, and it makes it a -really- poor game for people that cannot log in often enough to see all the variety the game has to offer.

As a whole, I don't really recommend this game unless you REALLY want it. I can't think of anything else out there quite like it, so I can see why some people SHOULD play this. It has some great parts and mechanics, but it feels like it could not only have been done much better and fleshed out, but could STILL be greatly improved today, with just a FEW things, yet they haven't been fixed in all the years since launch.
IF you do buy it, get it on sale.

As for the game itself:
It leaves me wanting more, in a bad way. It feels like the gameplay itself is slightly incomplete, the lore is very barebones (not inherently bad, but they way it is presented makes it feel like there is supposed to be a good bit more), and some design choices are just BAD. It lacks polish in SOME areas, but in others it feels incomplete on a fundamental level.
1. It feels a bit clunky to control. That might be intended and be part of the challenge, but something feels off about it.
Part of it doesn't even involve the movement. For example, using the minimap radar: it doesn't REALLY update when it looks like it should, based on how frequently the pings go out. Dead bodies stay on the radar for several seconds (and it's not because they haven't despawned yet. They stop appearing on radar long before they despawn), enemies' positions don't actually update when the ping goes out. I mean it would be fine if they told me ""the radar can only give us a general sense of where the enemies are"" or if the pings would only show up when it ACTUALLY updates, but instead it feels very out of sync, and shoddy.
2. Graphics leave me wanting more. I'm not a graphics snob, by any means. And I understand that it has to be limited so that the console version can play smoothly.
I don't want it to be higher res or better textures for the sake of it. But SOME things feel way too flat, and almost look bland. That might be more of an art direction issue I have, rather than graphics. The Helldiver's faction specifically. Which is a big problem since that's who you play as.
I still go have issues with the actual graphics though. It looks like things clip through each other some times, and some things looks very cheap and uninspired. Like the drop pods despawning is just them sinking into the ground. Fair enough. But it just looks cheap.
3. The upgrade system is not good. You can upgrade pieces of your equipment with research points. I won't get into getting those points, because I think it's fine. The upgrades themselves aren't JUST stat boosts, like increased magazine size, or damage. Sometimes it changes how the equipment behaves, like making it go from semi-automatic to burst fire, adding a machine gun to the sidecar on the motor-trike, making projectiles penetrate enemies, making projectiles briefly stun enemies, making projectiles armor piercing, etc. That is GREAT.
The problem is, that not all of the upgrades are exclusively beneficial, but you can't toggle upgrades on and off between missions, without resetting ALL of your progress. Penetrating through enemies is great to deal with hordes and increases ammo efficiency, but if you are going to do a mission in a small arena, it's not so great if you have to shoot something in between yourself and an ally. I don't have a problem with friendly fire, or having to be careful with aim and such. But for crying out loud, let me choose to remove some upgrades if I want to. This punishes experimentation in my opinion. For example, I will never get the tighter spread upgrade on my Punisher shotgun. It might be GREAT! But maybe I don't like it, and want to go back to a slightly wider spread. Well to bad, I'll never know which one I'll like, because I can't go back if I don't like the change, and right now, the gun is ""good enough.""
3. Some BS. Semi-graphics things that directly impact gameplay, like cyberdogs often being partially in the ground as they run, from just their paws, up to the tips of their ears. It seems like they run on a flat plane set at the lowest point of the ground elevation. They don't change elevation with the ground, but everything else does. It impacts gameplay because you can't always easily see the cyberdogs as they charge at you, even when they are directly in front of you. It also makes it slightly harder to shoot them if you DO see them in time.
It's so confusing why this happens, because everything else at least loosely follows the terrain elevation, and it sticks out as a really glaring bug that hasn't been addressed in the many years since this game released. Why?
4. It's online only. I regret purchasing this game even if for that alone. It doesn't try to hide it, I've just come to dislike that model a lot since I bought this, for unrelated reasons. As far as I am aware of, they have no end of life plans for this game.

It feels like if you got a BIG wrapped gift you've been told (for whatever reason) is a LEGO set, and you can tell there was a lot of effort put into making it look perfect when wrapped (Idk, like clean folds, symmetrical, lined up patterns, hand tied ribbon bow), but when you open it, there is only a single main line BIONICLE set inside.
BIONICLE is great! But why did you make it look so much bigger than it actually is? Why did you go through so much effort to do that?
I'd have been fine if it was wrapped in the size of the actual product, but you set expectations, and failed to meet them, and I'm still disappointed about that, no matter how good the actual product is.

Perhaps a better analogy would be that meme image of the pepperoni pizza box with the little window so you can see a small section of the pizza inside with the pepperoni, but when opened, the only pepperoni on the whole pizza is what was under that window. I mean... the pepperoni is there... and it IS a complete pizza... but they didn't follow through with the pepperoni like they set it up.",1585758102,1585758102,False,2,0,0.463584542274475098,0,True,False,False

Helldivers is a fast-paced, basic, down-to-earth and awesome twin-stick shooter with a fun panoply of guns, vehicles, mutators, enviroments, enemies and so on. It has artillery calldowns, heavy weapons, chain-guns, HEAVY SATURATION BOMBARDMENT and best of all, not only can you kill the enemy... you can kill one another. And then return quick as a fiddle after getting gibbed as ""reinforcements"" drop-podding in to save Super Earth by sowing the seeds of freedom all over the inhuman monsters seeking to destroy democracy. So, quick! Grab your pulse rifle and have a nice cup of Liber-tea!

The biggest issue is the camera. Have you played a recent Mario game with multiple players playing at once, where you can get stuck against the screen edge and killed? This is a top down version of that. The camera needs to contain all players at all times, but has very limited space visible. I gather they wanted to force you to group with your squad, but I'd greatly prefer each player had separate cameras, and it was game mechanics encouraging being close.

Also problematic is that enemies just spawn around you on missions. Not spawning at a significant distance, but quite near the edge of vision or even visibly. This gives the game a cheesy feel, and means that the workable tactics are quite limited compared to what you might expect based on the theme.",1583639282,1583639282,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The basic gameplay is very good - it's a great co-op action game with friendly fire that really makes the friendly fire, well, friendly. The trouble is that the game disables large mission categories if the total playerbase is too successful at those missions. Nearly every time I have played this game, 2/3 of the missions are disabled, and worse, it's the same 2/3, because the remaining 1/3 of missions are not nearly as fun as the other 2/3 so players just simply put the game down when it's down to those missions. This is frustrating for veteran players and is a hard-pass for newer players. The situation has, if anything, gotten worse over time, because the gap in player preference - and the speed at which the 2/3 get exhausted - has accelerated with the matured playerbase.

This whole thing could be trivially fixed by either not disabling those missions or having a local campaign mode, but the chances of this menu-level fix being implemented at this point in the game's history is basically null. The game is in virtually every other way more appealing to me than Magicka, but after nearly 100 hours this one anti-feature has sent the whole thing tumbling down.",1582001726,1582001726,False,123,7,0.838358163833618164,0,True,False,False

I bought this game looking for a new co-op game to play with my friends and hoo boy, it did not disappoint. I honestly didn't expect to like this game as much as I do, but the humor, the emphasis on teamwork, and the replayability got me hooked.

I didn't expect it to be as tactical as it is. With friendly fire, limited ammo, the bountiful number of strategems, and sharing one screen you have to have good communication and teamwork to get through some the harder missions and choose your loadouts based on the enemies that you are fighting. Strategems are pretty much an air drop that is on a cool down that you can customize in your loadout and really bring a nice variety to the game.

The gun sounds are punchy and satisfying, the shadows look nice, and the gore is brutal and hilarious. You will end up dying a lot in a lot of ways, but almost every time it's easy to brush off, because of how over the top everything is.

Now as much as I like the game, one thing bothers me about it and that's the Galactic Campaign. As you will see on a lot of other reviews on here, the main campaign is a co-operative effort of all the players online and if one of the enemies is defeated, then they are not playable until the next war. Now I get what the devs were going for with this to give a greater sense of community, but it kinda sucks when you end up being able to only fight one race for a little while. Hopefully they'll maybe adjust the system in the future, but I totally get why that could turn someone off to continuing to play the game. The game is still alive with a lot of dedicated long time players and a lot of new players from a recent sale so you can almost find someone to play with. I don't really know how to end this review so I'm gonna hit you with a tldr in a second.


[u]TLDR[/u]

[i]Pros:[/i] Great game to play with friends and online strangers that will test your teamwork, great humor, active community, and nice gore/graphics.

[i]Cons:[/i] Campaign system is flawed to where sometimes you can only fight one race of enemies, very difficult to solo endgame difficulties, and the DLC is almost necessary if you don't want some things to be annoying.

Game is not playable solo
Nobody plays this game so you're forced to play solo
Same maps (The game for 5 days was stuck on earth siege which means you replay the same map over and over and over in the hopes of beating the siege. We lost. Even after i won over 100+ battles). Your wins do NOT matter.

After playing the game for a bit longer. Here are some additional problems

Updated Review:

Lots of glitches
Drops will often not drop at the proper location and kill you, team mates or mechs which are one time use in games
Pay to win (Best gear, weapons, mechs are all in DLC content which you have to pay extra for)
Game is simply not worth 20 dollars. Wait until a sale. this is basically a cheap arcade game
Screen has trouble centering on the host. You will often find yourself running up against borders of your screen to push forward.
Reload glitches. You tap reload go to shoot and your gun is still empty.
Not very imaginative in the way you have to collect research. They could have done much more.
Multiplayer PVP would have been a good addition to this game.
Constantly getting screwed by team mates who stay in one spot. You are forced to kill them (or die) to enemies because the screen wont move unless everyone moves.
Very small field of view. You will almost always die from things outside your line of sight.
Glitch where you have to click the Friends tab then multiplayer tab to see other players.
Alot of ""failed to join game in groups of 2 or 3/4).
4 crashes in 20 hours of gameplay
3 times my game froze when switching planets. Had to close game and reopen to fix.
I've had the game respawn me into cliffs/the abyss (insta dying).
9/10 times people who join your game will ALWAYS spawn on top of you and insta kill you without warning.
Without paying extra for the DLC playing snow maps is a no go
Players will auto join games that are on extraction just to get the free XP and bonuses and then leave after. Often dying in the extraction process and forcing you to lose the hard earned XP.",1580728741,1581125206,False,0,0,0.340729385614395142,0,True,False,False

There's a large variety of weapons, perks, and strategems(special abilities you can pick 4 of) and most all of them have a niche, even if the niche is being stupid fun like the motorcycle.  Community is great and there's lots of political satire laughs to be had if you look through the codex or read the news ticker.  If you're not, it's easy to avoid, as none of it appears during gameplay other than liberty and democracy one liners.

Pros:
+ Has a tactical dreadnought you can drive and other mechs, too
+ Designed around encouraging teamwork(crewed vehicles and certain weapons)
+ Tight controls.  Vehicles have weight to them and different weapons behave as one would expect
+ Strategem system is genius in that even if you're not good at mashing buttons, you can carry equipment items for teammates and not be deadweight.
+ Enemy diversity*.  Each faction requires different tactics to fight against and have enough variety that one loadout is ideal for everything, especially in higher difficulties
+ Cups of liber-tea!

Cons:
- Enemy diversity.  In both categories because after a faction is defeated, it can't be fought against again until the next war and not all factions are available to fight at the beginning of a war.  Haven't played the new random mode, so maybe this isn't a con anymore.
- Enemy spawn mechanics.  I'm not a fan of having all enemies up to and including tanks literally spawn on top of me(spawn itself won't kill you, but as soon as tank moves, you're squished)
- Very grindy after the first couple dozen character ranks.  Not a big deal as everything past 24 is cosmetic, anyway.
- Implying that democracies are best when constitutional republics are clearly superior.

All in all, highly recommend, especially on sale or if you have a couple friends to play with.  Remember, friends don't let friends dive drunk.",1579233616,1579233616,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

Helldivers is an top-view shooter game where players do procedurally generated missions in different planets to progress through a internet-based global campaign to free the galaxy. The main focus of the game is co-op playing, where up to 4 players can join a same match. It seems like you can also play locally with up to 4 players, as long as you have a keybord and additional controllers to support.

Helldivers lore universe is based around a satyrical approach of imperialist countries like the U.S.A. Its tone is very funny and over-the-top, with characters usually shouting ""For Freedom!"" or ""Have a nice cup of liber-tea!"" while they bring ruthless democracy to the outskirts of the galaxy. This is one of the few cases where all game mechanics have a good explanation in-lore, with the community also fully embracing the satyrical mindset.

Pros:
- Hard but satisfying playstyle;
- Interesting lore and character interations;
- Active and helpful community for a game of its age;
- Yearly updates in a in-game holiday at October 26th.

Cons:
- Slow gear progression might limit diversity and experimentation;
- The screen is shared among all group (requires getting used to).

It's a simple game with simple mechanics, but the way they interact is where the meat of the game is. You can play the game with friends or jump into random matches either is fun. If you want to play the harder missions you're going to have to unlock the upgrades for stuff.

FOR NEW PLAYERS:

Collect samples. To make this easier, I would recommend picking up the Ranger Pack DLC. This will give you access to the 'Humblebee' UAV drone. Use the samples (those little shiny yellow things you will randomly find on the ground around the maps) to upgrade your UAV first (it's near the bottom of the ""Stratagems"" tab). This will make it infinitely quicker to find samples. It also allows you to run easier missions (Levels 1-4) by yourself and pick them up so you can upgrade your weapons.

If you're a numpty like me, you'll be wondering where all your weapons are. Well, as it turns out, on the loadout screen you can hover over the weapon and towards the edges of the box, arrows will appear. Depending on your unlocks and the DLCs you've purchased, you can cycle through the weapons you own. I didn't learn this until about 30 hours in, lol. I was basically running around with the MG-105 'Stalwart' from the Demolitionist Equipment Kit (another of the paid DLCs) for that time, and I loved every second of it. I only switched away for the last 20 hours (I have 50 hours played at the time of writing this) so I could try the different weapons and upgrade them.

Different weapons are better suited for different maps/environments and enemies, so do not be fooled into thinking you can run with one load out. To maximise you and your team's chances of winning, you'll need to pay attention to where you're going and who you're fighting. 

You will learn through experience, you will learn by failing, but even in the most frustrating moments, you will be having fun :).

Also, newbies, if you're playing with M&KB want to aim I would recommend the old aiming system where when you right click to bring up the cross hair, it appears next to your character and you 'draw a bead' out to your target. The 'always on' system is a bit of a misnomer as while the cross hair is 'technically' always on, it is blurred out until you right click to make it visible. This means you can lose track of it on your screen and can cost you vital seconds reorienting your self. Stick with the old system. It's far better. Trust me.

Helldivers, it's time to deploy to the combat zone. Stop reading and come and spread managed democracy across the galaxy with us :).",1578180288,1578180288,True,3,0,0.53255915641784668,0,True,False,False

There is a great selection of equipment for different play styles and enemies, and DLCs are very cheap on sale offering even more.

The main negative players have highlighted the way the campaign works is an issue, and it is true that the the game's biggest problem (only problem as far as I'm concerned) is that once an enemy faction is defeating in campaign, it will be locked until the other factions are defeated and the campaign restarts. This can make it difficult for a new player if you have not unlocked the equipment you need to deal with the other enemies yet. The remedy for this just to make your game public. Other players can and will join your mission to help you complete planets and unlock new equipment.

- no onscreen minimap while playing, have to stop playing to see the minimap.
- no objective while playing, have to stop playing to see the objectives.
- no current objective indication, theres nothing like a current or next objective indication, you have to plan by yourself and find a way to communicate it, you cannot ping an objective like in any other games.
- once at an objective you have to find by yourself how the heck it activates.
- catastrophic camera management, stuck on the group, not on the player, visibility is awfull, there is a radar on the map but watching the map means you lose all your controls while its open.
- deployable stratagems just deploys at random places, never where you ask to, usually killing ppl when deployed.
- the only way to edit your loadouts is actually to launch a mission, if its on an other player game then its timed, so loadout management is pain.
- the mouse has no pointer by default, you have to press the rmb to hopefully see where your mouse is.
- in mission mobs just spawn in the middle of the screen without any concern for logic, no nest to obstruate, just constant random spawning, just kill faster than the game spawns them.

I played only 2 hours and already i can see this game is in fact dead with very few ppl actually playing it, the core planet was undefended, tryed to do a few missions to see if it can be saved but entry missions for new players yeld extremely few points and have no effect on the conquest bar, so new players face something not rewarding.
No way to just join a server like in TF2 and have fun with random ppl, in this game you have to be organised so you are forced to reach mutual understanding with any ppl from around the world.
Missions are quick and systematic, you've done one kind of objective one time, you've done all.
Missions does not follow any logic, just do the objectives in any order to optimise your time, this means that missions are designed to be played multiple times and known by heart (hence the map made very difficult to use).

Could have been a decent game but from the start the devs chose to make it much more cumbersome that it has to be, and when devs forget that they are making actual games which means actual entertainment then i'm no support of it.

The only thing that is good is the drop-in/droup-out that permits to have ppl join an ongoing mission, myself i have joined several games where the host was dead and just saved him, guy was happy but it tells much on the state of this game.

Havent played Alien swarm for a decade but it is 10 times better in an immediate hand on.

[list]
[*]Overview
Helldivers is a 1-4 coop top-down shooter, with a rather unique mechanic (inherent only to Arrowhead games) of using your ""special abilities,"" which involves you typing in a specific series of inputs form your keyboard. The game itself is based in a semi-serious, semi-comical and grotesque universe, that can make the experience simultaneously immersive, engaging, badass AND funny as hell. It's definitely more enjoyable to play it with friends, since the game doesn't really give you any quarter for playing solo, but it also has more than enough difficulty levels for you to pick the challenge that suits you best.
[*]Story
Naturally, there's isn't much of a [i]story[/i] to speak of here, but rather - the setting itself. And it's essentially a combination of Starship Troopers, a bit of WH40k and a little bit of something unique. You are a Helldiver, an elite soldier that usually arrives on a battlefield in a drop-pod (who said SPEHSS MAHREENS?!), constantly wearing a badass cape and carrying some big gun. Your objective is to deliver democracy to any alien, mutant or [strike]heretic[/strike] communist, wherever they might hide. All of it is done for the glory and continued supremacy of Super Earth!
Your opponents consist of tyranid/zerg/starship trooper-like bugs, cyborgs and technologically advanced aliens - the illuminates. They get in constant wars with humanity and it is up to you to clear out entire sectors, planet after planet, while also completing some different objectives that are randomly spawned for each mission.
[*]Gameplay
Helldivers provides rather fast-paced, fun, and surprisingly strategic gameplay. While you do spend most of your time simply shooting hordes of enemies full of bullets, you also have access to a plethora of different stratagems that you can call in from orbit, which involve consumables, heavy weaponry, defensive structures, powerful fire support and even vehicles. Your loadout is pretty limited, and you should constantly adjust it accordingly, since missions can have different conditions/enemies/objectives that require a specific approach. You should also coordinate your loadouts with your teammates, distributing the vital roles (ammo supply, support items like jetpacks or shields, heavy fire support, etc.) between yourself. Suffice to say, the higher the game's difficulty gets, the more unforgiving this experience gets, making you approach the game more methodically, rather than just running forward, guns blazing. Oh, and keep in mind that there's friendly fire in this game before calling in a nuke on your teammates' unsuspecting heads.
The game's progression consists of unlocking new weapons and upgrades for them, as well as some new perks and cosmetics. Sadly, that's all there is, and you'll most likely unlock the most vital weapons and stratagems that you're going to use most rather quickly. And since there's no legit endgame to speak of, you will have to find your own entertainment much earlier than it should've been.
[*]Graphics
Since the game originally came from PlayStation and it can be considered old by now, naturally, the graphics are impressive. They do the trick just fine, though. The visual style is somewhat cartoonish and simplistic, and quite gory, actually. The visual effects are pretty dope - the weapons, stratagems both look visually appealing; the models of characters, vehicles and enemies also look pretty solid. And luckily, the optimization is pretty nice even with total carnage happening on screen.
[*]Sound
The sound design is good - voice acting is dope, all enemies have distinct sounds, all weapons and stratagems have solid sound effects. As for the soundtrack - I would say it's pretty badass, setting the mood perfectly.

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
Helldivers is a fun, challenging and straightforward coop experience. It provides and amazing and fast-paced action that one would expect from a top-down shooter, and adds a level of skill-demanding strategic approach to it, that rewards quick reflexes an ability to adapt on the run. The setting only helps by gratuitous levels of badassery and a nice hint of comedy, that makes the overall experience pretty well balanced and enjoyable. The only real drawback this game has is that it doesn't last long - the amount of content leaves a lot to be desired, and the lack of proper endgame makes the player bored way too quick.

There are 3 diferent races we must fight against and conquer the universe, the game is perfectly balanced and uses a isometric camera (similar to most twin shooter games)

Combining the level up system, multiple weapons with customisations, perks, upgradeable stratagems, vehicles, planets, and their different biomes, cooperative play, and the game's system in which everyone from around the world works together to take control of the galaxy one section at a time.

The action is very tactical, measured yet frantic and incredibly team based.  Yes you can solo, but it requires experience, discipline and lots of unlocks.  Speaking of which many are locked behind DLC - yes you can play it without, but you're missing out on most of the unique (and powerful options like  healing drone) and direct upgrades to better guns in every way.  Unlocking perks and upgrading equipment is a lot of fun but it's also a bit of a grind, at the beginning it feels very unfair as you get fsking deleted and all your starting stuff is garbage.

It is intended to be a team game and is a lot of fun with friends  but friendly fire is a bit of a concern in random pub.  Plus your character is so slow at everything and the mandatory single screen per team means it gets chaotic and death is incredibly easy if everyone doesn't know what they're doing, where and when.  Comms are very limited and really need to use voice chat.

On bad points, the blimming invisible cursor really annoys me (the community voted for this!?) as you can't fire properly unless you aim, but you can't move well if you aim.  Oh, it also takes half a second to appear once you start aiming.  If you know where it is in the chaos.  All your weapons are ineffective if spammed, which you will need to do if on your own and surrounded.  Also you can get downed and headstomped while you bleed out.  Your own weapons can and will kill you, as well as anything the aliens or your comrades do to you.  Worst of all, INFINITE enemy spawns, and if you eff up killing watchers, more troops, more watcher will spawn which will spawn more enemies, which will spawn MORE enemies.  Did I mention you have limited ammo, looong stun on you being hit and reloads take forever?  Weapon swap is slow and call-ins are also very slow (120s) and/or limited (1 per mission).  It is intended to be a team game, with you backing up your team and them helping you with cover and support through combined arms and synergies.  It's almost impossible on your own as your loadout is a primary weapon, perk (can replace secondary pistol with DLC), and four call-ins such as heavy weapons, airstrikes, vehicles, defences and special equipment.  So you have to make compromises on your own - do you lose mobility, offence, defence or supplies?  In a team you would have multiple weapons in several roles (support, long range, point) and up to 16 special options (stratagems).

Tough as nails and vicious, I recommend playing with friends or open up your A-game for solo because you will have your ass handed to you.  Or join pub and enjoy the furious action, just be warned in good team you will dominate, but in a bad team failure is common.  You will also get kicked for being a noob or doing stupid things, read the guides.  Worthwhile on sale, make sure you get the DLC to get the cool toys.",1575669936,1575669936,True,2,0,0.510453224182128906,0,True,False,False

A top down twin stick shooter that encourages multiplayer. Plenty of fun running around slaughtering aliens to further the cause of SUPER EARTH.


Gameplay - 10

A twin stick shooter that allows you to ‘accidentally’ kill your friends.  You can use Stratagems which drop ‘hellpods’ with equipment, weapons whatever you need to complete your mission. And you will need them.  The enemies are endless, if you don’t clear them out fast enough, they will just keep coming and coming and coming. You can customize your HELLDIVER, yes you have to say it loudly each time, by changing their outfit or the cape. The cape seems..silly until you finish your first level 12 mission and earn your ‘species’ cape.  Then they’re like pokemon. 

On to the actual game though, you pick a mission and then have to land on a planet and finish the objectives. They range from finding survivors and escorting them to killing a certain number of enemies, to unpacking “truth” transmitters.  You cannot leave until the objectives are completed, or attempted and failed. Enemies will send out patrols, if you don’t kill them quick enough they will set off an alarm; which alerts others to show up and can make for a bad day. 

I mostly played solo, I learned early on that you can’t fight them all, i spent a lot of time running for my life and waiting on my Stratagems to go through their cooldown period so I can call in more ammo for my guns. If you move far enough away the enemies will stop pursuing you.  Thankfully.

 Once you finish them all you can call in the shuttle to take you off planet.   Of course it’s not gonna come down right away. You have to ‘defend’ the area for 1 minute and 30 seconds.  That’s pretty easy right?  Not always.  The enemy will start spawning in right away, and you can’t run away now. You have to stay and defend the landing area.  If you manage to make it onto the shuttle and get off planet, don’t get crushed by the shuttle as it lands, you’ll be rewarded based on your performance. Which of course gets loaded up to SUPER EARTH. When you finish an entire mission, you will get rewarded with new Stratagems, all helpful, but possibly deadly if you use them wrong. 

Story - 5 

There’s not much of a story here; Super Earth is ‘threatened’ by outside forces and it’s up to the HELLDIVERS to take the war to the enemy and win it all for Super Earth. You know to ‘protect our way of life’. The story could be better, but it’s really not needed; you’re just gonna kill everything/everyone you see. 

Graphics - 10 
Great graphics, no real complaints.  When you kill a big Bug with a rocket launcher, if you’re not running for your life, take a moment and appreciate the way it collapses and blood runs off its corpse. 

Controls - 10  (Controller) 

 I started off playing on a controller, not sure how good/bad the keyboard/mouse style would be, try it yourself. 
You gotta have quick fingers, you use every single button.  You better be quick calling in your Stratagems.  They literally can mean the difference between life and death. 

Repeatability - N/A

So this game you’ll do different missions but there are only 3 different types of worlds.  However the map combinations are pretty much endless. There is a lot of doing the same thing over and over again. Once you hit level 20 or so, you’ve unlocked most of the items/weapons and are just going around looking for the ‘samples’ to upgrade weapons. 

I’ll play for a few days, take a break and come back and play some more. It does get repetitive after a while. 
 

Music - 9 

You’re running across the desert to your next objective, the music is calm and serene nothing much is happening, you see a patrol of bad guys pop up. You kill 2 or 3 of them, but one sets off the alarm.  Suddenly enemies are dropping in all around you, or from the ground if you’re going against the bugs, the music becomes inspirational “Hero” music. You going to be fighting and possibly running, but the music lets you know you’re still alive. 

Seriously I really enjoyed the music. 

Difficulty - 10 

You have 3 different types of enemies, Cyborgs, Bugs and  Illuminates; each with their own style and weapons and hazards. From each of those 3 you can pick planets to invade ranging in difficulty of 1- Walk in the Park to 12 - HellDive.  And then there’s the bosses you can fight as well. 

I played solo games mostly, I was able to do missions 1 through 9 by myself.  Not always completing all objectives, sometimes taking an hour or more for 1 mission.  As the difficulty goes up so do the amount of enemies and the different types.  What you thought was hard on Level 4, just a scrub on Level 9. 

Adding in other players, even random people can either make it super easy or super difficult/frustrating. Everyone has their own playstyle based on what works for them, it can conflict with what you have planned or screw you up royally.  For instance if some idiot drops a minefield where you’re running as he gets eviscerated by a giant bug.  The bug then charges you and since you can’t move b/c of the mines, you wasted a good  hour having to start the freaking mission over again.

Thanks asshole. 

Multiplayer - 8   

Multiplayer was.. Interesting for me.  As mentioned before I was mostly a solo player, but I wanted to earn the Level 12 capes, the cyborg one is my favorite. You need other players or an insane amount of luck to finish a Helldive. 
Let’s not forget that all players contribute to the total war, everything you do gets reported back and affects the state of the war.  Didn’t fight off the invasion from the bugs?  We lost a territory, now they might get to SUPER EARTH and destroy us. 

The small problem with the multiplayer, and it’s a big one. Is that you can kill other players just as easily as the enemies. In fact, it’s going to happen quite a bit. You can try not to, but even the best of us will have it happen.  All you can do is call the reinforcement Stratagem and hope they aren’t too pissed. If they are, you might soon be having a little firefight that helps no one. 

The map can be a problem, it’s a top down shooter where everyone shares the same map.  Someone looking off to the right can cause some problems for the others who are now at the edge of the screen, not a huge problem but can be frustrating at times. 

In all seriousness though, the community is great for the most part, there are some jerks who will drop into your game and kill everyone and leave, they are the exception, not the rule.  

If you're the one running the game you can easily boot them and continue on your mission.

Another Liberty day and more stuff added to the game.  The random loadout makes me happy, gives me a chance to try all the weapons I never use and get better with them.

However, I do wish to clarify on the matter of DLCs where some people are not satisfied with (too many on release, should be free, etc)

Helldivers comes with 3 (5 as of 26/10/2019) free expansions which provides more variety for planets, missions, and enemies plus bosses.

The DLCs which are cosmetics + additional gear/vehicles/perk are slowly added over the months based on player feedback when Helldivers was still a Playstation exclusive. By the time Helldivers is available on Steam several months later, all the DLCs are already completed so it's not on disc or day 1 DLC or whatever you want to call it.

Regarding the DLC equipment, I consider most of them are side-grades instead of upgrades. While it does add some variety to how you can complete missions, they are not necessary and you can most certainly get the job done with base equipment. In the hundreds of hours I played, I was using base gear most of the time.

The only DLC I would consider mandatory is the terrain specialist pack for the boots which removes movement penalty on snow or swamp planets. Ultimately, you skill is what determines the mission success, gear is secondary.

So yea, this turned into quite a rant but I hope this clarifies things for potential buyers who may be put off by the amount of DLCs Helldivers has. If you want, just wait for a sale and get the DD edition for half price. It's worth it, but not necessary.",1528001326,1574863800,True,103,3,0.875791430473327637,2,True,False,False

It manages to make you feel like an elite Orbital Drop Trooper while also making you feel very vulnerable and mortal. I think this is mostly down to two things. 
Firstly, every weapon you fire feels like it has impact and weight. Every calldown you bring from orbit brings either death to large swathes of the battlefield or is a weapon that will bring death to anything fool enough to get near it.
Secondly, everything is friendly fire. Run in front of a buddy's gun: You die. Stand under an ammo crate being dropped from orbit -> SQUISH. Run headlong into airstrike: You'll be turned into swiss cheese with nice pasty red tomatosauce. Forget that there is a friendly machinegunturrent behind you while there's an enemy in front of you: welp, you just became a gory mess of once human parts.

Because death is so present both where it concerns you meting it out and being subject to it, it feels like you're constantly just hanging in there. That you and your team can only barely make the impossible happen because you are such fucking badasses.

Be it from dropping your equipment 'accidentally' on your bud, to just a mess of bullets being fired on wave of waves of alien fodder for 'Democracy'. It is so hilarious as friendly fire is permanently on, which is what makes the mayhem that much more fun. Plus, the overwhelming joke or spoof of bringing 'peace' and 'Liber-tea' to the uncivilized aliens that surround Super Earth makes the quotes so hilarious.
If you plan on getting this game, be warned, it is meant to play with friends. I love the multiplayer, as you can just drop in on other people's games and help them out. Please bring a microphone as the silent trooper gets old and everyone is on there to have a laugh.
Another addition, this is a top-down, stick shooter game. If you are not into that style move on, if it is your cup-of-tea, then awesome. If I was to relate the game to a similar one, it would be alien swarm. I would give this a 100% better game than alien swarm and was hooked on it once I played it for the first time.

The single player experience is very unforgiving, especially when it comes to suboptimal loadouts.
At the same time some of the most frustrating elements about the game can be the players seeing as how the screen is shared amongst the entire team all it takes sometimes is one person running off and locking everyone down. Learning to play around bad teammates was probably one of the most enjoyable parts of the game for me personally, simply another difficulty factor.
I would argue that, some of the DLC is very useful bordering on too good. Such as the terrain expert perk letting you ignore the mechanic which is meant to make snow maps difficult.
Besides that one DLC the rest is very much just more variety for your loadout and/or appearance should you desire.
Another drawback for the people starting to play the game is that the galactic campaign system doesn't do itself any favours as unlocking abilities require you to play particular planets from each enemy and in some instances those can be unaccessible for extended periods of time depending on the current War.
The game isn't without its problems but overall I think it is a very enjoyable experience.
Controller recommended.

Edits:
Proving grounds addition fun for a little while, not much longevity too them but fun modifiers. Wish you could play custom games and select your own honestly.

The added difficulties are so-so, 13-15 puts a lot of restrictions on what you can get away with in terms of loadouts since you need to bring pretty effective tools to deal with the ludicrous amounts of enemies.

It's one of the tightest co-op experiences out there, with moments of 'down but not out' as you throw a reinforcement strategem while downed, ressurecting your team, as well as yourself as you get killed. It is not an easy game, for instance, when you get downed in most games, enemies ignore you, in this one, the'll execute you. Friendly fire damage is not reduced in anyway, and anything that damages enemies damages allies, and vice-versa. There is no enemy/ally damage, simply damage. A careless shot could kill off one of your teammates, or your whole team with an air strike. Essentially, if you're good at coordinating with a team, and using communication, this game's for you!

Impossible to get the Strategems and items you need the most because everything depends on the community.

The graphics are decent, the sfx the sound, music is very well done. Perfect for the action. I also love the sarcastic humor of the theme and I've often found myself laughing on the achievements..

Make no mistake this isn't walk in the park especially on harder difficulties. The challenge is there and you have to work together with your diver-mates. But its also very accessible from the beginning and the difficulty scaling is very well done but everything depends on you... you can be level 40 but you have to LEARN how to play or you will die...and this I love..this isn't about your weapon or equipment  in the first place, (though equipment is fun and important too on harder difficulties) but your skills and how you can adapt to the moment and to your mates. 

If you have 2-3 other players who understands cooperation its like playing in the most successful rock band of the world. Finishing a mission without casualties is a real joy and very-very satisfying. Even if you have everything unlocked you always get XP until you reach the level cap. Which isn't a quick job.

Also this is the downside of these kind of games..if you have clowns in your band well it can be very frustrating. Fortunately you can kick these people out immediately. This game gives you the opportunity the have real fun with your friends and other random players everything depends on how you can work together.

Pros: 
The weapon system is very balanced overall (Some weapons are better, but definitely room to have multiple favorites)

Always fun to try different load outs

Cons:
The camera sucks. It focuses on the squad meaning in the beginning it is hard to keep track of yourself and later it is annoying when it feels like you can't see very far because of the centered camera

The progress is based on a ""community campaign"" where the levels and your to unlocks is tied to community progress. In spirit this seems like a good idea, you feel like you are part of a larger  war that advances as players complete objectives.

In reality, every time you boot up the game you have to be hopeful that some fun levels/unlocks/areas are open for you and your friends to play. If the community is not moving the campaign along, or it gets stuck (as it frequently does) on the final push to enemy homeworld, you have a scant few levels to pick from or some boss/survival levels that are at best boring, at worst frustratingly difficult.

Everything else about this game is fantastic, the negative review is tied solely to this mechanic, which has the effect of taking away your ability to play/enjoy the game you paid for on the basis of whether or not the community has collectively filled a bar that decides which levels you have access to. I can't tell you how many times either myself or a friend has been excited to unlock some interesting new toys to play with, only to log in and be stuck grinding XP, sometimes for several days in a row while we wait for the campaign to reset.

I must say the game is very imitating and hard to grasp at first for new players. You are pretty much left on your own to kind of figure out what the objectives require and also a lot of ""activations"" of the nodes require you to follow a random keypad or keyboard UP, DOWN, RIGHT, LEFT,etc... to get it going while you are getting swarmed by mobs of enemies! Trust me, in the beginning you will tremble trying to get the keys right, which are clearly shown on the screen, in the right order because of the adrenaline in you. Fail and it generates another random set of keys! Great concept of a game, very captivating and the victories or defeats are felt hard! I am so shocked that people are not aware of this game, as I was not either. I just found out about it 2 days ago? How did this slip past me? lol Get it!

The biggest issue is the art direction and story. Models are bland and there is no narrative to speak of. There are 3 enemy races and you select from a list of missions ranked from easiest to hardest. Harder missions offer more rewards. But there is a huge disconnect between the missions you select and what's happening in the game itself. Objectives in the game are meaningless as far as a greater narrative goes. Why am I clearing this minefield? Why am I hacking this computer? Much of the fault here lies in the Global War system. Essentially you are fighting with the rest of the multiplayer community to fight off the aliens and you can only fight specific missions where the war front is currently at. It's confusing and doesn't make the player feel like he's contributing much himself.

The actually gameplay is fine. You have a number of different guns, special abilities you can call down, and there's a lot of customization available. Each of the races is fairly unique though maps are not especially varied. There's a big emphasis on the multiplayer. I played most local coop which worked reasonably ok but difficult on a single screen. Online multiplayer got me team-killed immediately upon playing a match.

Helldivers might be fun with a couple friends dedicated to completing the toughest challenges. As a single player experience it's too weak to recommend.",1567434039,1567434039,False,2,2,0.484865158796310425,0,True,False,False

Ahem* Now that's out of the way if you do buy it I would highly recommend getting the DLC also. I personally hate DLCs and never buy them, but for this one I made an exception. The combo is usually on sale and the stuff they give you can be useful in the future as the game progresses.

This game is a top down shooter but the game play and the controls are tight. BEST OF ALL this game will make you laugh so hard. Usual scenario of HELLDIVERS: Most of the time waaaay too many enemies on the screen, many of your teammates will kill you more then once, there's stuff dropping around you all the time whether it be air strikes, weapons, or people (sometimes all of the above) however YOU WILL LOVE EVERY MOMENT OF IT. 

The community is really awesome I think that's the main reason the game is great. People are usually friendly because we're all trying to complete the mission and I've had many games where everything went smoothly and everyone was cool. I've played a lot of different multiplayer games and usually when I play online some kid is screaming about screwing one of my family members...and I haven't had that experience....in this game. so yes....massive thumbs up!

-Did I mention this was an awesome Split-Screen game?

It is truly great to have something like this on a single Laptop screen I can take and put friends on with anywhere. This is my go-to game for road trips & entertainment in the back of my family's SUV & when I have friends over when they don't want to play co-op online with their own PCs. I LOVE this game for that as it is hard to find fully-functional, fulfilling, split-screen games on PC these days.

-On single player? This game has also taken a lot of my time away because the grind doesn't feel repetitive at higher levels. 

Sure, if you're just finding these things that look like research capsules to unlock ""research points"" in maps & you've chosen just doing easy stuff to unlock some new vehicles/mechs/weapons to work on, it's OBVIOUSLY going to be repetitive and feel like an old grind, but that's because you wanted it to be like that. 

When all the CHAOS ensues after picking a difficulty 8 mission or higher? NO MISSION HAPPENS THE SAME WAY especially with online multiplayer! Awesome stuff happens. Funny stuff happens. Weird stuff happens. There's bosses. It's always something new. & for the record....There are FIFTEEN difficulty levels. 15.

The campaign is entirely multiplayer, and functions cyclically: at the end of each galactic conquest, the map will be reset. Star systems are captured by the player and his many thousands of peers on a planet-by-planet basis. 

My only knock against this title is that it can become repetitive. Nonetheless, I strongly recommend it to fans of the genre. It's tons of fun, and can be had at an affordable price. It is, as with most multiplayer titles, at its most fun when played with friends.

Like most games, Helldivers is best with friends. Local and Online play are supported, and you will share progress if you play locally.

LOVED: 
I loved that this game really makes you [b] work as a team [/b] with your teammates whether randoms online or with your friends. This game [b] doesn't pull punches [/b], but lets you decide what difficulty level you want to play at. I doubt many players will be able to ever play the most difficult levels - particularly casual players. There's no shame in that - every victory is celebrated. While your progression might be slower if you don't challenge yourself, you still contribute to the [b] total players combined effort [/b]. All players worldwide work to win the campaign together, there is no competition between players unless you want their to be.

Helldiver's sense of humor is excellent, it's worldbuilding is great, and I'd love to see more like it. While the Helldivers universe doesn't really every come into gameplay, it is good on its own and I wish there was more lore to discover.

This game lets players that have been brutally murdered by friend or foe [b] get right back into the fray [/b] with the help of friends without breaking the experience or even the plot.

One of the most unique mechanics in this game is STRATAGEMS - which are essentially airdropped supplies, weapons, explosives, bullets, napalm, or the like that all players have access to during missions. Lots of enemies can't be dealt with easily with small arms - but calling in a small nuclear warhead should do the job just fine... [i] as long as you clear out in time [i]. Or maybe use a smaller more humble DiveBombing Run, or the strategic HellBomb. Players can only bring in 4 stratagems per player, and some can only be used once per mission. 



DISLIKE: 
Related to stratagems, it is important that players can think as a team on what aid they want. Not every player needs to bring a supply stratagem nor jumpack, but if you are joining random players you cannot see what items they already have, so it is likely you are going to be redundant at best or lacking at worst.

The DLCs are totally optional and allow players to bring more gadgets, weapons, and perks into the fray. Seeing as all players are on a team, this doesn't give an unfair advantage over other players - but instead lets people who have bought the DLCs have cooler, flashier, and often downright more effective stratagems than other players. Because players are not competing against each other, this little pay-to-win problem isn't really a problem. For information, I own none of the optional DLC.

Unfortunatelly after hitting around level 15 game became grindy. Getting to next level takes forever. Getting upgrade points takes forever - 1 per level or 1 per 10 research pieces that can be piecked up and kept if your mission was success.

Helldivers feels like a rejected 40K title. I do not mean this as an insult, Starcraft was another 40K reject and it's amazing. Helldivers features intense PURGING of all alien species, with SKULLS as the banner for humanity. Just replace the empire with a cynical view of a futuristic humanity dominated by american stereotypes and you have Helldivers. 

So, if you have never played it, you probably wonder what is so special about it.

[h1]The good[/h1]
Helldivers has an EXTREME amount of customization and ""Building"" as in, you will have to work with your squaddies to build the best setup you can. Do we take vehicles, who is taking a short range stuff and wont be able to help with patrols, do we have an anti tank weapon that can be quickly used. This game will push you into a role to fight each of the three factions and you have an immense amount of FREEDOM to make your helldiver as badass as you want.

The game features 3 enemies that are diverse in how you have to deal with them. The bugs are melee only and rely on overwhelming squads and using their large units to break up your formations. The Cyborgs are armored to the teeth and require more firepower to kill than the other factions, working in squads and using tanks themselves. The illuminate are masters of death by division, even their base units create beams that force you to move out of the way, and they even have a flying ""Orb"" that can put down a wall and cut your battlefield in half. One strategy will not work for all factions.  

The game is satisfying as hell to play, because the difficulty really makes you feel like you have achieved something every time you play it. As in, this game is REALLY HARD on the upper difficulties. Difficulty seekers need not look further. 

In addition to just being hard, the game forces you to forget tired and incorrect videogame tropes in order to keep yourself, and your mates, alive. All weapons can friendly fire and will kill allies FAST. Reloading doesn't put your mag in a magic vest that reallocates the bullets to other mags like a typical FPS, if you reload at half mag, say bye to those rounds, they are gone. You will have to rewire yourself and be extremely careful to not harm your allies or yourself. If you call in an ammo drop near a vehicle, it may land on the vehicle and destroy it, good job, you just threw away your teams tank. 

As a result of the above info, the CO-OP is incredibly fun and intense. Some weapons require a ""Loader"" to help supply it with ammo, resulting in even more emphasis on teamwork. Tanks need gunners to man the turret, in fact most non-walkers need people to man guns, so teamwork is always necessary. Solo play is not impossible, and you get compensation one ""Auto Revive"" per completed objective so it's not completely impossible.

[h1]The bad[/h1]
Helldivers is a fantastic concept, but even the Mona Lisa has flaws.

The games balance can be a bit bass ackwards, some weapons really are ""Always takes"" and some are ""Never consider"" some of the DLC weapons completely replace ingame weapons in terms of use. 

As far as DLC goes, it is a pain to have to buy content, especially in a game where at base you feel like you NEED some DLC to be effective. That being said, 3 bucks is a very low price and you can pick and choose which ones you want instead of buying a massive DLC for 1 item. This isn't a big deal in my opinion. 

The real sin here is how the ""Perk"" system works. You can have 1 perk, these perks range from useless to holy-crap-take it. The problem is some of these perks do stuff like replace pistols or grenades, but this robs you of your perk. Would you take a smoke nade over being able to survive a lethal hit once every 20 seconds? No? Weird, I wouldn't either. Would you take a plasma pistol replacer over Heavy armor? No? Weird. 

Nades and pistols need their own bloody slots, it is silly that the perks account for ALL of these. Especially being some perks are basically necessary to survive certain levels. This has always been a problem and will probably remain unchanged.

The game features this ""Worldwide cross platform link"" gamestyle where every person contributes to galactic campaigns. Each campaign ends in an assault on the enemies homeworld or a defense of super-earth. This sounds like a fun gimmick, but it makes certain gameplay options unobtainable based on players progress. Say you just bought the game, get on, and see the cyborgs and illuminate campaigns are the only ones up, and the game is at their homeworld now. You cant get stratagem unlocks from homeworlds, so you are now locked into waiting for that to end before you can even really play the game. Gameplay is locked off based on things out of your control and that is not enjoyable at all. 

The community on this game really can vary. Many are helpful, all over reddit revealing strategies and how to use guns you may not yet understand the purpose of, but on the flipside many are ego-monsters who kick you for not using the right perk, or if they get themselves killed running into your gunfire. It really can vary, but when it's bad, it's nasty. Play with friends if you can help it to alleviate this and search online for the helpful helldiver player-tutorials, they are bountiful and quite helpful. 

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]

Helldivers has endured as a Co-op icon for years now, and even as it's playercount falls, I still love coming back to it with friends and trying my luck at it's difficult missions. The freedom of customization is intoxicating, and we need more of it. The flaws on the other hand are an ever-present sore on an otherwise great game, and one can only hope a sequel someday shows that has all of the beauty this game offered, plus important fixes and modifications. Even more freedom and variety would be great too. If you have friends willing to play it with you, this game is a no brainer.

DLC's should be about enhancements and aesthetics not for unlocking basic functionality in the game like the terrian boots, thats very deceptive and bordering on some shoddy buisness practices.

Community 9.5/10 ::: I have had only one person ever act like a dick in this game, yes occasionally you get a vet of the game thats been level 50 and has a billion useless research points commanding you in this way or that to get the mission you are currently on over and done with to the quickness they are used to and it can be a little jarring for new players but it is very seldom you will find someone that will flame you for not understanding, or just getting your grip on the patterns for reinforcements. Stay chill Helldiver fam.

Gameplay 8/10 ::: There is a lot to unlock in this game even more so when it comes to buying all the DLC. Which is totally not required by any stretch of gameplay as this game takes almost like a half take on how triple A games tend to do things and how some studies 4X games take to added content where a host can have the DLC and those who join the lobby have access to it. If someone has all the reinforcement packs they can bring them into your mission and you can use them yourself to test them out! (with their permission I hope lol). Weapons, stratagems, and high impact bug fvcking explosives can all be upgraded with research points which adds a climb to the game that if feel to a point slows the game down to either waiting until you have accumulated enough to max out your favourite load out or go on research farming runs. Never the less it is all very vercitile and pick and choose to your playstyle. 

Memes 10/10 ::: Have you ever wanted to watch an elite squad of four drop shock trooper looking mother fvckers all spew out green jizz onto a hyper-aggro cyborg mech tanker doing legitimately zero damage per tick yet spinning around in circles tilting the AI to the point of self destruction and failing the mission from purely laughing too god damn hard to keep your hands on the keyboard? Or calling in SIXTEEN NUKES AT ONCE AND PRAYING TO WHATEVER GOD YOU BELIEVE IN AS THE NUCLEAR HELLSTORM RAINS DOWN UPON YOU SEND HALF THE DAMN PLANET INTO A SPLIT SECOND RADIATION FUELED NUCLEAR WINTER. The memes are strong in this game, and they make up the greater portion of why i loved streaming this game and couldnt hold a proper meal while playing it because my stomach flipped so damn hard from the laughs.

Best played with friends over voice comms to really capture the intensity and ensuing hilarity (especially when they splat from dropping pods).

(Comments are on, they're always on)
So many rather good game[i]play[/i] design decisions, and so many terribly awful non-gameplay game design decisions.
Before I say anything, I should probably read you the Arrowhead Game Studios motto
[b][i]""A game for everyone is a game for no one.""[/i][/b]
I should probably say this review isn't for everyone.
Now that all parties are entirely excused from blame because of some words, we can go forward.

I'm not mad that the three top difficulty levels are just artificial difficulty increase through random chance, because I know how it must feel to have to tack on something just to keep the maniacs busy.  I'm very mad inside but will pretend that I'm not mad that 
bad guys will drop directly onto you, making you look like an idiot in a situation of no possible correct moves because it's only made so in certain circumstances.  I'm constantly endlessly seething with rage, and will not show it for you, that missions start and end with incredibly long unskippable screens that makes restarting take up to 45 seconds of doing nothing but pressing E.

What I will tell you I'm mad about is

[b]1. Retaliatory Strikes[/b], the [i]other[/i] gamemode in the game that makes half of all planets (groups of 2 or 3 or 4 missions) untouchable.  Packed into a small space with the aim to survive x amount of enemies almost makes sense, except when the bad guys don't come from a certain direction/directions.  They always arrive in random spots coming from up off screen with less than a second of forewarning before they start punching you.  That includes the overwhelmingly significantly more difficult team-effort enemies (tanks and stuff).  'Playing Retaliatory Strike' is the exact string of words that equates to gambling in Google translate English -> English.  It requires more than prayer to God, Allah, Buddha, and your own personal Spirit Animal to survive.  It is quite possibly the least fair chunk of game design, and it's not changing or going anywhere.

2. [b]DLC objective advantages[/b], where not having the DLC puts you at a significant disadvantage.  One example is [url=https://helldivers.gamepedia.com/LAS-16_Sickle]the LAS-16[/url] (go to the bottom, Detailed Analysis), a DLC weapon that is 1.7 times as effective as the [url=https://helldivers.gamepedia.com/LAS-5_Scythe]LAS-5[/url], a base-game laser gun that compares (the metric is DPS/HPS to account for the LAS-16's higher heat, where it's still better rather than DPS alone, where it completely eclipses almost everything in the game).  Another example is the [url=https://helldivers.gamepedia.com/All_Terrain_Boots]All-Terrain Boots[/url], which make half of all planets the same as the other half in that you don't need to plan ahead, because you bought the DLC.  (These boots also make doing boss fights on snow planets even feasible, where otherwise you would be disadvantaging yourself somewhere between 2 and 20 times as much). The crazy thing is not all the DLC even provides an objectively useful item.  It's just that some of them are so insanely powerful compared to the rest that if you try to pick 'em for style and pick wrong you're toast. 

3. [b]The War System[/b], which completely blocks you out from playing big chunks of the game because the community already did it before you.  Yes, the insects, the most fair enemy type, the community's favorite to play against?  They're gone first because there is a limited amount of effort you can put in against any of the three enemy types before they die off until you finish off the others.  When I first got the game during the last [strike]Christmas[/strike] Holiday sale, me and my pals couldn't play against the bugs until far after the New Year dropped.  Another [i]highly[/i] intelligent design decision of the war system is making the best possible gameplay (city defense) a punishment, and making the most boring possible gameplay (enemy capitol) a reward.  I would really like to show you, but I would like more to never have to play the game again.

This game is worth less combined than the value of the sum of its parts.  It is only worth looking at in order to cherry-pick the couple of good gameplay design choices to put into a different video game:

1) Dance dance revolution button inputs
2) Drop-in multiplayer
3) Interactive in-game menu (it's a spaceship)
4) Steam netcode
5) A good tutorial
6) L85's
7) Assisted reload for rocket launchers
8) Angle-of-incidence based damage",1546322347,1561755337,False,2,0,0.517241418361663818,0,True,False,False
394510,20435181,76561198069602510,0,39,4699,0,4591,1561869713,"With over 10,000 steam reviews, you'd expect HELLDIVERS to be a bit of a household name. However, I have had a genuinely hard time finding other people who have even touched this game. When brought up in conversation, I often hear that people have never heard of this game. Upon viewing the steam page, I often hear the response, ""Eh, it doesn't look like my kind of game.""

This pretty much tears my heart in two every time I hear it, because HELLDIVERS is an incredible game that you should NOT overlook.

HELLDIVERS (yes, I'm going to capitalize it every time) is a twin-stick sci-fi shooter set in an offbrand Starship Troopers universe. Levels are procedurally generated, and the campaign is a massive galactic conquest that is contributed by the entire community, similar to games like Planetside 2. There are 3 main factions that all have their own specialties and require delicate changes in playstyle at high levels. This game is seriously difficult on higher difficulties 9 and up, so be aware of that.

HELLDIVERS' customization features can be absolutely glorious. Please note that I said ""can be."" There is a wide variety of armors to choose from in the game, but with the added caveat that a lot of the (imo) best cosmetics are locked behind DLC. This is true heartbreak right here. On top of that, these DLC's add a ton of cool weapons that are locked behind a paywall.

This I believe is the biggest issue with the game. It is the only one that comes to mind with well over 75 hours played. The game isn't perfect, but this glaring issue is just unforgivable. Someone in corporate demanded that HELLDIVERS has loads of DLC. If you are interested in picking this game up, please just buy the Digital Deluxe Edition. The game goes on sale for cheap sometimes, and if you do bite the bullet it will make your life way easier.

That being said, this is a positive review; I have a lot of good things to say about this game with the DLC in my pocket. First I'd like to discuss the gameplay.

On a basic level, the combat is just good fun. HELLDIVERS can be equally enjoyed with a KB+M and a gamepad. Animations are smooth, informative, and don't get in the way of the game's tight controls. Gunplay is very strong, with good sound, visual, and haptic feedback (on controllers). Controls are tight, with lots of inputs to master. Calling in drops (you will be doing that a lot) has a high skill ceiling since it involves complex inputs. There are absolutely LOADS of things you can call in. Vehicles, mechs, nukes, close-air support, and you can even respawn your friends using a drop.

Maps are procedurally generated, with a wide variety of objective types to make the game fresh. Within these maps there are 3 factions to fight, each with their own quirks, special objectives, and respective bosses.

This game is no slouch, so expect to die a lot. Friendly fire is ON, and to hilarious effect. Expect to get team killed a lot if you can find a lobby. Expect to get crushed, nuked, shot, stabbed, burned, and bludgeoned. Maybe you'll be wrecked by a giant tank, or maybe by your fellow teammates.

That's the next thing: Multiplayer. Multiplayer is both local co-op and online, and both can be used simultaneously. HELLDIVERS uses drop-in co-op, similar to how the LEGO games do it. Playing with friends would be an absolute riot if I had any that owned this game. In my 76 hours of HELLDIVERS, I can safely say the best way to play this game is with other players.

From loadout variety to map and difficulty variety, it really feels like there's a lot of content here. Each match feels fresh, and the trickle of rewards you get from playing the game are worthwhile. There's a good reason why people in this review section are really excited about this game; suffice to say, it is very enjoyable. I can safely say that this is the best twin stick shooter I have ever played, and I have a hard time going back to play others after playing so much HELLDIVERS.

So please, purchase this game, sit down in your epic gamer chair, and have a nice tall cup of liber-tea as you mow down hordes of aliens in your mech, or motorcycle, or APC, or tank, or your even bigger mech. I heartily recommend this game.",1452384461,1561355651,True,2,0,0.541666686534881592,0,True,False,False

-You can win any difficullty on any mission solo (you just need enough skill and the right equipment).
-You get rewarded if you search around on the whole map. You can collect probes which give you research points and with them you can unlock either better equipment (more-fueled jetpacks, extra ammo for a mech, etc) or new stuff for your weapons (focking laser sights, bigger magazines, etc) ---> Higher difficullty = more probes on a map. Beware that those probes will only save if you (or someone else) escape(s)!
-You get new stuff after getting a level-up. New weapons, new armors (skins) and new unlockable calldowns.
-You progress on the galaxy-map with other players. 3 alien-races to fight against at the same time? Hell yea!

Mixed feelings:
-The camera ""forces"" you to stick to each other. The enemies still spot you sometimes from a place you can't see because of the camera. At the same time it ""forces"" to play as an actual team and not everyone by himself.
Don't get me wrong, I like to play as a team! But sometimes I could just shoot at an ally for running alone towards a point or leaving someone slowly behind, instead of shooting the enemy. It affects you, but not as much as the enemy spooting one of you outside of your screen.

What I don't like:
-Even thou you and your team got good internet connection, the servers have their limits. I once shot someone in the back and there was blood coming out, but he didn't took any damage. Same goes with ""walking someone over with a mech"".
-The DLC's all togheter are like 50% of your arsenal.
There is some equipment you will never or only rarely ever use, dlc-stuff included.
Some stuff is even unbalanced, in a bad way. But I won't tell anyone what not to use.
-Many players use the laser-shotgun (for a reason). It counts as the ""best"" weapon out of all for many players out there. Personally, I prefer the Laser-Rifle or Plasma Cannon.


Personal opinion:
-You either play this game non-stop or just a few rounds each day/week. Sometimes you find trolls, but there is a report and like system.
""Report"" = You don't actually ""report"" them, but you give this player a ""dislike"" which means this player will more likely be put with other people that got disliked when looking for a game in the multiplayer-list or waiting for player support after calling a beacon inside of a mission.

One thing in advance. I really tried hard to like helldivers. SO F****** HARD... But I just can not do it. Why?

Would you ask me:
""If you spontaneously think of a game that you really liked, where you liked the graphics, the setting, the gameplay, the controls, really EVERYTHING... except for ONE SINGLE BUT CRUCIAL detail, that's unfortunately so damn annoying, that it breaks your whole gaming experience and you're tired of playing it?""
... my answer would be: ""Helldivers"".

The detail that is at stake has already been hotly debated in various forums. There is a strong stock of supporters, as well as many strong voices against this feature.

It's about the camera setting.

When I bought Helldivers, I had made the mistake of not reading in the description exactly enough that it is a ""twin-stick shooter"".
For all the unfortunate souls who, like me, had no idea what that meant at the time, here's a short explanation.

If there is only 1 player on the map, this player can move freely with a fixed camera angle from above. The camera even shifts a little bit in the direction you are aiming for, and you have a bit more of a view in that direction, which could be great for spying on the terrain ... IT COULD BE.
Cause now comes the above-mentioned feature of the ""Twin Stick Shooter"" into play.

If 2 players, worse, 3 or 4 players are on the map, they are forced to share one and the same camera view.
Imagine it as if the players were connected with invisible, elastic rubber bands. And above the imaginary node in the middle between all the figures, the camera hangs rigid and fix. ALWAYS. No matter what you do.

The developers justify this feature with the fact that it is supposed to enforce the teamplay and that this game was made as a couch-coop-game. In fact, in my opinion, it makes the game unplayable.

Some examples:
You are on the battlefield with a suqad of 4 members. Suddenly a patrol appears on the right edge of the screen. Now all of the players have to aim in this direction. If not the angle of view shifts only partially there or stays stuck in the middle. The patrol calls for reinforcement. The reinforcement spawns unfortunately right in the centre of the screen, inbetween the players. In order not to die, they have to split up a bit, get away from each other. That means, one runs to the right, maybe two to the top of the screen, one diagonally down to the left ... And the view still remains in the middle ...
The problem is, if more enemy units are approaching from any direction, you can not see them! Simply because the camera can not be moved. The enemies are actually there, but you literally do not have them on the screen! So it may be that in such a situation you are disassembled by several heavy adversaries that are only five or ten yards away and that you might have been able to fend off, but since you could not see them, you're just dying.

The fact that there are sniper rifles in Helldivers at all seems completely meaningless. A weapon designed for the longest distances, but you can not see an opponent who practically stands beside you and pats you on the back because he's hidden under the edge of the screen.
And then he will of course hit you in the face.

Other situation:
You're on the road with a full team. It comes to a tough fight, a team member dies. Everyone has to withdraw a bit, let the fight fade away. The fallen teammate could not be resurrected on the spot because there were too many enemies, so he gets resurrected by drop pod. If this player had the misfortune to have worn particularly good equipment at his death, which he would really like to bring back, everyone must go there with him. Theoretically, you could say, ""You keep going, I'll get my stuff and then I'll join you."" Nope. It does not work. All MUST stay together.

There are some mission goals that would be much easier to win if the players were allowed to spread across the terrain even just a little without having to accept the penalty that they no longer have a view in any direction, but only see the center between them. While one team member does the work, the others keep the enemies off his back. But that only works if you see them coming ... again, I find the sniper rifles completely useless in this context. It would make much more sense if, as a user of such a weapon, you had the privilege of being able to move your sight not just a bit but very far in the direction you are aiming for. After all, you swap the fast rate of fire of an assault rifle against further view. Or not?

And that's how I experienced Helldivers playing online.
When I died, my team members did not let me get my equipment. I had to go with them, whether I wanted to or not. The camera would have followed the team, not me. If I had gone on my own initiative in one direction, I would not have seen my figure anymore and would simply have died once more. In some cases they just didn't resurrect me, even if I did nothing wrong.
Several times I died because I could not see opponents beyond the edge of the screen. I was shot by enemies with ranged weapons, who actually have a miserable range and damage, but since I could only roughly target them and almost had to shoot good luck into Nirvana, I did not hit them.
And that's exactly what happened to me again and again and again and again and again... until I finally asked myself, why for all heavens names I really do this to myself.

The answer is, as I mentioned in my introductory words, that I really wanted to like Helldivers! I wanted it! But this camera view just ruins everything.

If you had at least the freedom to choose, to decide for yourself, whether each participant in the group can run with an individual camera or if you play in a group with a fixed camera angle, I would write a big hymn of praise here! Helldivers is actually a great game and it would certainly still be in my personal top 5 of my favorite games.
No kidding: I would PAY for it if the developers would offer a free camera perspective as a DLC! I would buy Helldivers for the full price one more time, including all DLCs, if every player could have his own camera!

(The only reason I did not request a refund was that I spent at least some nice hours at Helldivers. But only in single player...)",1557528262,1557684128,False,10,9,0.484052687883377075,4,True,False,False

-We are the good guys! - A wonderful sense of humor in the fashion of Paul Verhoeven (Starship Troopers).

-Grow and learn! - A progression system that gives you new character skins, weapons, perks, stratagems (airstrikes, heavy weapons, vehicles, tools like attack- and repairdrones etc..) and upgrade points to enhance your favorite play toys.

-Adapt! - No classes, just pick your loadout before every mission. Look at your comrades equipment and take the stuff your team lacks. Or just play your favorite and most effective build which suits your personal playstyle most.

-Be proud! - Individualize your HELLDIVERS elite soldier with tons of helmets, armor and capes.

-Know your enemy! - Fight 3 different factions: Cyborgs, Bugs and Illuminates. Each with their very own units, different strategies, advantages and such.

-Be percise! - The game controls just awesome no matter if you use M+K or a controller (The game detects every controller just fine and lets you rebind keys).

-You are equipped for every environment! - Procedural created levels with several bioms and a big variety of different objectives (finding buried mines with a metal detector and disarm them, reload a giant mortar cannon, repair and fire it, steal alien technology, or escort survivors to the safety of a bunker and many more).

-Watch your step, watch your aim! - Friendly fire is always on - Everything is able to kill you. Everything!

-You are the veterans of tomorrow! - 12 different difficulties for a challange. The higher the difficulties, the more teamplay you need to be successful. The game is pretty well balanced. Almost every mechanic is a risk/reward one of some sorts.

-Work together to save humanity! - Up to 4 ppl local + online coop (at the same time if you want). Join a running mission on the fly by grabbing the mouse/controller. Or invite/join ppl via steam. It's pretty quick and easy.

-Do your duty, soldier! - Take part in an actual war. Every single player has the responsibility to change the tides. Take back the galaxy bit by bit as a whole community.

-Nobody will be left behind! - A really decent and friendly community. During all my time playing this game i've just met 1 toxic troll and very few ppl who play bad on purpose.

It has a campy aesthetic straight out of Starship Troopers, where the governing body for which you serve is much more of a totalitarian state than a ""Democracy,"" but this isn't its charm, it's just a bonus to get a few giggles out of before you enter the meat of the game.

The AI is nothing to shake a stick at, but then, it doesn't need to be when the swarm, the graphics are clean but not overly beautiful, allowing lower-end machines to run the game. Personally, I feel the game really shines through its co-op mechanics. Things normally limited, like respawns, power weapons and air support, are given a cooldown or delegated to teammates, and the screen position is locked on all players' positions, not just yours, making coordination a must.

Sure, some of the DLCs are lacking, and others are outright vital to progress at the level that most others are, but you can look past this, because the raw experience of dancing on the knife's edge with trusted teammates at Level 12 ""Hell Dive"" difficulty isn't something you can get from other games in as mass of quantities.

The tension is broken up with moments of calm as you scour the map for your objectives, exploring the procedurally generated alien maps and fighting off scouts before they detect you. 

Fantasy/Narrative: The story is cheesy and spoofy, adding some comedy as your men shout ""FREEDOM!"" and dispense fresh democracy to the aliens. Each mission is its own narrative, and the overarching story is limited to periodic ""wars"" which you don't really feel like you have an impact on (it's not very visible) yet seem to be won and lost based on player count. One main issue with these wars is that it sometimes restricts map and enemy choice if one enemy faction is wiped out and the other takes longer to get rid of so the war can restart, restricting mission choice significantly and causing the game to feel stagnant, though this is usually fixed within a day or two.

Challenge/Fellowship: The game is easy to learn and very accessible, and the later difficulty levels leave a lot of room for skill expression and strategizing builds and squad loadouts with your friends. Teamwork is reinforced through several mechanics, including entering several button commands to call in reinforce beacons, using support weapons, or using team weapons or vehicles. However, it's sometimes hard to find other players due to low player count, and often people don't know their mics are on. There is crossplay on console, which alleviates this a bit, but otherwise it's sometimes hard to coordinate with other players.

Discovery: There aren't very many map types to explore, and once you've played long enough even procedural generation fails to present you with many new maps or enemies to keep you surprised. The fun in discovery comes from finding out how each weapon, stratagem, or vehicle can be used to conquer the enemies of Super Earth. 

Expression: Each weapon and item offers a unique experience, and you can bring a very mixed loadout to each mission. Some may feel restrictive, especially snow maps basically requiring snow boots, but otherwise there's so many loadouts you can try and so many methods to find and invent to defeat the enemy.

Submission: Once you've figured out the importance of anti-tank weapons in difficulty 6 and above, and once you get kitted out with some devastating machine guns, dropping back down to difficulty 4 and stomping the low-tier enemies is good mindless fun to kill time or save some newbies (especially during free weekends). You will be trying your hardest on the higher difficulty missions, but the easier missions are still always accessible and sometimes popular in multiplayer lobbies.

Microtransactions: Not pay-to-win, but there are a few that make some parts of the game much easier. In particular is the Terrain Specialist Pack, which gives you snow boots (making missions on snow planets so much easier) and the Ranger Pack, which gives you an objective and sample (research points to unlock weapons) radar that helps with progression and playing hide-and-seek with mission objectives. Other than that, they add cool weapons and airstrikes that aren't necessary to play the game but add that little bit of extra expression, discovery, and pretty explosions if you like the game. Just some more options really.

Overall: HELLDIVERS is my favorite video game because of the many clutch moments, epic moments with teaming up and fortifying the evac site or leveling a small army with artillery. The player count is somewhat lacking, especially on off-days and times, and it's not nearly as fun in single player, but if you can get over these issues, this might be one of your favorite games too simply due to the constant action that also requires a bit of forward thinking, strategy, and tactics. 

Other: Playing twin-stick is nice, but it is SO much easier with a mouse! Also, be mindful of friendly fire, both giving and receiving it. It's part of what makes the game so tense!",1469319347,1549000786,True,1,1,0.525862038135528564,0,True,False,False

I was buying some local Co op games to play with my friends when we do a Lan party but we didn't get to go through it since I had a lot of Switch games to play. So I tired this on my own and at first it felt too easy since I was doing low difficulty, but when I did difficulty 10 and above, it's so hectic but fun as well. You do occasionally get those people who don't know how to watch for their allies or just stand around when there's a scout right next to them but it still add into the fun. If you take the game too seriously and trying to be a perfectionist then you might not enjoy the game that much, or your attitude might kill the mood for everyone else. There are accidentals for a reason so just enjoy and have fun. No need to take the game so seriously and start raging at someone who accidentally kills you or is unsure of what to do. 

Initially what made me buy this game was because it reminded me of Starship Troopers so I thought I'd give it a try, and in some ways it still does feel like starship troopers so get it if you liked the movie.

I've upgraded quite a few useless things but it's still fun to have

So what can you do?

Unlock new weapons and equipment (some through levels and some through clearing a planet)
Ride vehicles (motorcycle, HAV, Tanks, and Mechs) (unlocked by clearing planets)
Call for air support(drop mines, missiles, napalm, etc...)
Call in drones (scouting, healing, shooting)
Fight the protoss, Terran, and zerg(well they're called illuminates, cyborgs, and I can't remember the last one right now so I'll just say bugs)
Play through any difficulty 1-15(they'll probably add more later on as they did last year)
The war is dictated through the community (more missions we complete the more influence we have to win the war, not enough and we lose)
Get frustrated in higher levels because you were not prepared for heavy armor. 

Not a lot of downsides to this game really unless you are a perfectionist or absolutely hate friendly fire or top down shooters or if you get paired up with a lot of player killers which I've only experienced once.
Well I guess one bad thing is that since I've started playing, we haven't lost a single war yet so maybe raise the difficulty for influence a bit or something

394510,47916574,76561198046777942,0,56,944,0,916,1550549719,"This game has a lot going for it, but there are two main problems (really just one that is comprised of two parts) for me.

Let's start with positives.

The game is a mission-based, top-down shooter. The mechanics utilized feel fluid and cohesive, and the art-direction is good.
The game runs smoothly on an i5-7500, geforce1060. I haven't had any issues with performance so far. 

The first big problem is solo-play. Unlike games (such as Warframe), where you can feel confident in Solo'ing the majority of missions, this game can (and will) throw certain enemies at you that will inevitably stun-lock you and kill you. Other games share this feature, though not en-masse like what I have encountered in my short time of playing. While these enemies are weak, I've noted several times where my character could just not turn fast enough to hit the next charging enemy before being hit. This leads to a death that feels somewhat cheap, and leads to the next problem: respawning. Respawning in solo play is quick (which is good), but spawns you practically near the horde of enemies that just killed you, which isn't. This means you are likely to get stun-locked again, and lose the mission. If Solo play is not Intended, then just do matchmaking, and not allow solo at all. If Solo play is intended, then please adjust these issues. I recommend a brief invuln time to allow a person in solo a fighting chance (alternatively, have solo players be accompanied by a weaker variant of the Guard Dog Stratagem, similar to BOSCO from Deeprock).

I should note, all games mentioned are predominantly multiplayer focused, but this area is a spot where this game could do better. Take it with a grain of salt, as I haven't played for 100+ hours.

Multiplayer is hit-or-miss. In some cases, you can get paired up with a group who just do not like you, and TK you and then proceed to kick you out. Alternatively, you can have great moments where you and the group just shit around like idiots and have fun. I don't think this aspect should change, but it is worth noting that you are going to get a mixed bag of who you play with (also, not noticing a lot of US players, but that could just be poor luck on my part).

The cursor (despite being set to always visible), is hardly visible aside when aiming down sights, which causes your character to turn. This can lead to your character turning the wrong way (leading to stun-lock, in certain cases). If you have an option to set the cursor to be visible, please make it actually do what the title says. A hazy blob that blends in with the backdrop-landscape (which is beautiful), makes this game much more artificially difficult than it needs to be. Half of the difficulty shouldn't be having to memorize where I last left my mouse. Again, not advocating to completely remove the feature (as some players may like it), but please offer us plebeians a means of actually seeing the reticle.

These are very minor nit-picks, but I feel that the game could be polished a bit further to be more new-comer friendly, especially in terms of Solo play. I don't expect hand-holding, but I do expect challenge from the game itself, and not from the UI.

I recommend this game, with a 7/10. It has a wonderful art-style, and easy to pick-up and play controls. It falls flat on the AI mechanics in Solo that can feel over-whelming, and poor respawning implementation in Solo. Multiplayer is a mixed bag again, and I strongly recommend that if you play this game, play it with a friend who you can feel comfortable with dicking around.",1546063274,1546063274,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

What happens when the makers of Magicka decides to go to space and battle aliens? Can the recipe that made Magicka a success - be reintroduce into this product? *cough**cough*


What is it about?
Helldivers is a 4 person co-op, sci-fi, top-down shooter. The goal is to win this intergalactic war against 3 races so that mankind can prosper in space. To win this war, you'd be unlocking a variety of weapons, skills & equipment to get the job done. But the [b]ultimate[/b] question will be: Do you want to solo the battle? or play with other helldivers?


Controls, Visuals, Audio
Visually, It's really nice. Every bit of animation and detail can be seen on the character to the objects and environment. Explosions, lasers, nukes - the effect looks realistically.

Aside from that, +1 to the graphic team; each race, weapon, equipment's is designed distinctly. Every special units and boss fights were thought properly and provides different battle experience. Next, the programmers deserves +1 as well as all mechanics are in working condition. No crash/bugs ever happened. Everything is smooth. Kudos.


Audio, its good. Most of the time, the sound provides the ""feedback"" feel. You wont be hearing beautiful ambient rather screams of your teammates/aliens and explosions. 

Controls uses the standard WASD keyboard and mouse however, there are certain objects; jumpjets/certain weapon which can feel funny/when you completely forget.


Mechanics
You will battle from planet to planet, completing each objective in the mission will net you exp and successfully conquering a planet will reward you with either; exp, equipment's, skills. There are [u]various[/u] objective@activity to perform in a battle; escort mission, fetch, defend, assassinate a unit/terminate x enemy, scan mines and more. Every planet will have samples - you use samples to upgrade your weapons/skills/equipment's. Higher level planet spawn more samples however more mobs/horde will occur with some ""special"" units that are harder to kill. Aside from the standard planet invasion/defend battles, There will be boss fights. *ahem* bragging rights. lol.

The routine: Dive to a planet -> collect samples -> perform objective -> Escape 
Sounds easy enough ya?


My personal thoughts/My Summary:
I really dislike playing public games because they never fail to offer me the worst gaming experience with trolls/toxic people insulting others. I went into the game with the mindset of: I will only solo - unless I play with my steam friends. No public. Unfortunately as you advance to higher level planets, going solo gets you killed. Waste of time and effort. Ultimately I had to play co-op and behold my gaming experience:

I've been stomped by mechs/crushed by tanks/blown to bits by team mates/fall off from the cliff, burnt to death by lava, ammo drop on my skull, nuked by my teammates, Blown to oblivion with team mate RPG, turrets, grenades, mines, electrocuted, sprayed with acid, laser sniped by my very own team mates, my @$$ blown to bits by shot guns and the list goes on *sigh* cries silently in the corner.  Super earth produces super crappy warriors!

That my friends is the imported recipe from Magicka. Unless you are light hearted/sporting enough, you will probably enjoy the mess that your team mates are cooking - while being surrounded/chased by god-zillions of aliens. Else, well, the urge to rage-quit is 101% very tempting. 

Public games still get on my nerves unless I meet really good/sensible people. When I do meet them, I will commend them. For unruly players, I will report them. enough said. But then, this system can be or is being misused/abused.

The end game? once you've conquered all the planets, your focus would be on collecting as much samples as possible to upgrade every single weapon/skills/equipment's. The grind kicks in and this can feel really tiring.

At the end of the day, while I might complain about the missions and all that crap. At some point, I do appreciate the mess and action provided. For me, playing with friends is the ultimate ""fun"" experience. I once took my friend on his bike and went in circles smashing through aliens and avoided the escape zone. XD Or when I call down tanks for my team mates to wreck havoc/driving the tank in reverse. Or when my buddy keys in the wrong arrow key while scanning for land mine - boom - the entire crew guarding him died. Silly stuffs like that with friends are [b]priceless. [/b]


My Summary
Helldivers is a polished product and definitely one of the product that will test your friendships. Similar like Magicka, it offers horrible/fun moments depending on how you perceive the events. It's much more intense than Alien Swarm and with the ability to call down equipment's/skills, it changes the game dynamics. HD definitely has showed me that humans are jerks/idiots from hell/drama queens - but without them, life in space would be so monotonous. Oh what a dilemma. lol. 

*Lay down a SOS beacon*
So, on the scale of 0 - 10, my personal rating for Helldivers is a Giant Pink tank that's capable of launching Barney the dinosaur - That should be worth a 8/10. Yes, a jewel in my books. Now, ladies and gents, if you'd you excuse me I need to have my cup of Liber-tea.

[b]WOULD YOU LIKE TO KNOW MORE?[/b]

One of the leading Freedom Simulators on Steam; this game is well-worth a recommendation.

Liberating space from three visibly and functionally distinct factions of foes, this game plays like a cross between Magicka and Alien Swarm. Especially to the former insofar as it's very, very easy to pulp your buddies, and only slightly more difficult to bring them back following an accident. And there will be accidents.

Although this game is playable solo, I do much more strongly recommend it if you have a group of friends to play it with. Friends that won't mind being crushed by a drop pod, or a tank, or a dropship. Or minced by a strafing run, or blown up by some artillery fire. Or just plain shot in the back of the head.
To say nothing of the [b]actual enemies themselves![/b]

HELLDIVERS offers a wide variety of weapons and support abilities with which to carnage [strike]your teammates[/strike] freedom-hating scum, ranging from grenade launchers, to mechs, to micronukes, to squad-loaded rocket launchers, to a bolt-action rifle. Although the meta might only call for a few specific things, you're really better off just having fun with it. You'll find that some weapons and calldowns tend to work better on one faction than another, which allows for some experimentation and freedom in your builds.

The game looks pretty nice, and controls very well on a gamepad, although I know some people have taken issue with the PC controls. The difficulty display takes the form of a number, and ranges from cozy slow recon to absolutely horrifyingly tense and non-stop danger. Each of the 3 factions has a different focus on their power curve, as well as giant bosses that can be optionally fought.

The general gameplay loop is objective-oriented, and actually fighting things is usually secondary, if you can avoid getting caught by dealing with the patrols quickly. Which isn't always as easy as it sounds when you have the objectives to worry about, especially by yourself. Casualties in co-op can be quickly replaced by any surviving member of the squad by calling reinforcements, or by an automated lives system in solo play. This keeps the gameplay moving along pretty smoothly.

If I were to level any real cricitism of the game, it would be that the story and plot are nearly non-existent, if you actually care about that kind of thing. Some people complain about certain DLC being ""mandatory"" for high level play, but I honestly think you're fine with the free stuff. Do some investigation on your own, if it concerns you.

Definitely worth playing with friends. I wouldn't necessarily recommend it if you only plan on playing solo/with pubs, though.",1543286541,1543286541,True,1,1,0.514705896377563477,0,True,False,False

Helldivers is extremely rewarding, well made and full of chaos. I especially love the strategem system and how simple commands mean can suddenly become impossible to input, when it means life or death for the entire squad. 
The world is very immersive and well presented, and every mission transitions very naturally, from selecting it on the map and warping to it, to finally being blasted down in droppods.

You're a helldiver, able to customize your loadout to take on whatever you'll encounter. It's encouraged to build your loadout around your team to maximize your chances of winning though.
You upgrade your gear to make it better and you hone your skills to make yourself a better helldiver.

Some will say the game lacks replay value. I would disagree. I find value in the stupid things you'll come across, like accidentally dropping a pod on someone or the entire team standing by watching someone try to fight a enemy with melee and die.

Endless spawns of them in every mission. Repetition and extreme boredom eventually sets in big time because eventually only a few weapons and items are even remotely useful. Unless you are also in a group of friends using always on voice chat it's just going to be a nightmare of fighting to get correct camera placement since you are all on the same screen and often times the camera is the team's worst enemy. After around 10-15 hours in, you are REQUIRED to buy several $3 a piece dlc's to keep playing because without the weapons and calldowns they offer it would be impossible to continue playing on harder difficulties. Since they are necessary to even play at all on higher difficulties they should've been included in the game rather than seperated into like ten $3 a piece dlc's.

[h1]Now, if you've never played Magicka...[/h1]
HELLDIVERS is a top down shooty bangbang game with emphasis on multiplayer cooperation, like Alien Swarm. But unlike Alien Swarm, it has much more depth and variation completely dependent on player preference, kinda like Magicka. What? My comparisons are awful? [i]Fiiine.[/i]

In HELLDIVERS, you are a soldier fighting a grand war against three oppositions. In every mission, you and up to three others will be dropped in the middle of enemy territory. You are to complete as many objectives as you can or die trying. Upon completion and/or failure of every objectives, evacuation will be made available. After every three regular missions, you will have completed a planet, receive a greater reward, and also contributing to the overall war effort. zzz...

[h1]That sounds dull, even to me. At least it's out of the way, though.[/h1]
On the field, fire discipline is out the window. The difference between life and death is as small as a sidestep away. Friendly fire is on full; Whatever happens to the enemy can and will happen to you at some point. The reason? Because the camera is so darn focused on the center of every player. No, I don't mean individual players, I meant the center of EVERY PLAYER. You all share one screen. Be aware of your allies, manage your camera as a team, because their handling of destructive weaponry and stratagem could also be your head lopped. Although, it's not like you can't save yourself if someone else made a bad decision. I hope you didn't skip tap dancing lessons because you're going to want fancy feetsies.

As much as we try to avoid it, inevitably, ""accidents"" happen. A lot. It may be a norm to die, but it doesn't mean you should do it without care... even if everyone is quite expendable... I'll get to that in a bit.

Gunplay is quite simple. You aim, you shoot, reload, repeat. Most weapons are quite straight forward in this pattern. What makes this juicy are the strategic call-ins, aka stratagems. These vary from offensive (such as airstrikes or artillery), to defensive (sentries and traps), and special equipment (support weapons, tanks, mechs and ammo). Calling in these require manual directional input for every unique stratagems. In a sense, it takes a bit of player skill. It becomes muscle memory to frequent players, and those few seconds they cut really count. And you know what's a really important stratagem in this friendly fire volatile environment? Reinforce. I'm sure you'll get used to that input, too.

[h1]How many colors should you expect?[/h1]
Before every mission, you can choose between 15 perks, 22 primary weapons, and 50 stratagems, and 4 more which are standard issued (numbers include dlcs). Oh, I also should mention you have to unlock some through leveling. Every weapon and stratagem can be upgraded (with a couple exceptions). I recommend upgrading Reinforce first, as it significantly lowers its cooldown so that you may recover from an ally's mistake who recently died to your bullets. Mhm, not your fault. Don't worry about it.

Customization? Not really. Upgrades are rather straight forward. There's no revolutionary tech trees or anything. More points just means improving certain stats and adding characteristics to it. There's different armors and hats I suppose. Oh but ultimately the glorious cape! What kind of soldier are you without a cape? It's still all aesthetics.

There are three factions/races you'll battle in the game, as I mentioned. Equipments have varying levels of effectiveness depending on your foes. Each enemy units are unique, with different characteristics and behaviors. But as for how? Unfortunately I'm writing a review, not a guide. Stick your face in it and find out. Good luck, greenies! I wouldn't mind seeing a few more panicked faces.

[h1]It's bashin' time[/h1]
My signature move: complain. Because I believe people should be aware of the flaws rather than being fed by sugarcoat reviews.

[b]Repetition.[/b]
Very, very big thing here. If you don't enjoy the gameplay, you will likely not enjoy the game as a whole. Missions are randomly generated and while that sounds great, you'll still be doing the same few objectives over and over. The same enemies, the same-ish maps. But it can't be that bad if there's many of us maxed level siting on hundreds and thousands of hours still playing this right? That's up to you to decide. Psst! This is why I pirate games before buying! It's revenue~!

[b]Community[/b]
I only play on the highest difficulties so there should be a bit of consideration on player saturation. You may have a few other problems, but those aren't mine~ haha! ...Sorry.

You'll run into the same players veeeeery often. That doesn't mean the game is dead. It is still very much active and there are plenty of lobbies. Getting into a game is pretty easy. Hosting one doesn't take much as well. Someone will always join.

For a team-based game, this is bound to happen. Not everyone is going to get along. Through my experience, there aren't very much toxic people. Generally, most are quite nice. Grab your bayonet and give your teammates the good ol' poke to start a tickle party. Everyone will want to have a pillow fight with grenades eventually! (Actually no, don't.)

Bad players? Of course. There will be new players joining tough missions because there's nothing stopping them. Some people can't seem to stand it. Beware of getting kicked on the spot. I know I sometimes can't. But I normally don't kick people unless I have to. If there's earnest effort to improve and play for the team as a whole, I can usually tell. It's quite admirable. However if a player has no trigger discipline and is always unaware of the team's intentions, that's quite problematic.

[b]Balancing[/b]
Yes and no. People are going to yell at me for this one to defend their favorite guns.
Game's not that balanced. It's balanced ""ENOUGH."" Not to call any weapons weak or overpowered but to put out there that some weapons are just too effective, and are overused. I quite dislike these weapons. When you hit the skill ceiling, in the right hands, these weapons have little limitations, extremely versatile, and are generally the top dog of the game. Arguing otherwise is rather silly. Which is why the Constitution is the best g- [i]*muffled screaming*[/i]

[b]Difficulty[/b]
When everyone catches on and use the ""best"" equipment? The game is trivial, even on the highest difficulty. Heck, even a regular team of four that knows what they're doing is cake. That's why you'll often see a lot of high levels run around with foreign loadouts you probably wouldn't dream of using. ""Once you grow older, you'll understand why.""

To us, we just want to have fun. We've already had our learning experience through a few hundred thousand missions. It's the ""let's do the craziest things to challenge ourselves"" point. Thus the game is balanced ""enough."" Weak weapons are fine as they are because it's fun. Not showing off, mum. Just don't want a routine.

Although, don't take what I said at face value. The game can be incredibly tough, especially without experience. Even for those with hundreds and thousands of hours, ...things happen... almost always.

[h1]Yay or nay?[/h1]
Like I said, if you don't like the gameplay, it will be not worth your time. It can be extremely repetitive if you can't find your own fun in it, but otherwise it is replayable. Personally, the biggest pull in for me is the community. I've added a lot of people over the few months I've been playing. It's very easy to organize games with familiar people to trust and fool around with. It's nice to slack off when the galaxy is in danger.

If you do want to purchase, do get the dlcs. Not only are they a huge addition, they also improve early game loadouts. So that you won't bore yourself out.",1520153015,1542999154,True,44,4,0.813220798969268799,0,True,False,False

The DLC has even more unique and fun weapons and stratagems as well.  Last but not least you get to wear a cape and earn new capes, helmets and armor with cooler more uniqe designs!

About wars: Helldivers is always played online and every player contributes actively to the progress of the current war against 3 alien races with unique perks and troops. The goal is to spread democracy (literally) by claiming sectors until you get to each of alien homeworlds and wipe them all out of existence. When you conquer a homeworld, the related alien race will no longer be available until the war is over and everything starts from the beginning in a neverending cycle.

The point of view is shared across the whole team, a welcome feature that alone forces players to actually coordinate as a squad, rather than allowing for the usual, egoistic solo-in-a-team approach typical of other similar titles.
The top-down shooter mechanics are perfectly integrated with the objective-based gameplay, so don't let screenshots fool you: the attention to details is outstanding (animations, weapons mechanics and so on) and shooting all sorts of enemies is extremely fun, but it's better to be sneaky and avoid open conflict for as much as possible (enemy spawns do not have a limit, so you can't actually ""clear the map"" from hostiles). On top of that, kills do not award experience, nor research points to upgrade your gear (exploration and objectives do).

Difficulty goes from Level 1 to 15 (a heaven/hell difference in terms of gameplay) so you can pretty much find the sweet spot for your capabilities and have fun, while learning the ropes or refining your skills and unlocking new stuff, avoiding excessive frustration (even when going solo if you don't feel like joining public teams).

You can extensively customize your Helldiver both aesthetically (gender and armor parts) and gameplay-wise (main weapon, stratagems and perks). There's a large selection of weapons (from SMGs to Sniper Rifles, including everything in-between with energy and plasma weapons too) and stratagems (air/artillery support of various types, turrets, decoys, tools, exosuits, vehicles and whatnot). Perks, on their end, give powerful passive bonuses and if that's not enough, all weapons and stratagems can be further improved in various ways via research points.

All in all, if you'll play it for a bit you'll slowly realize much thought went into this little gem of a game. 

Here, just to add some, alongside some tips:
- When you're bleeding out, team mates can actually shoot above you while you crawl to safety, same applies when you get to cover.
- Enemies have different armor values, some of them can't be damaged at all if not with anti-tank weaponry. Same goes for vehicles (the rule ""front armor strong/rear and side armor weak"" applies here as well)
- Heavy specialized weapons like rocket launchers come with a pack of dedicated ammo and benefit from a second squad member assisting with reloading said weapon (""assisted reload"").
- Aiming at specific parts of larger enemies results in different outcomes depending on the weapon: ignoring the obvious ""weak spots"" on some of them, generally speaking if you shoot straight at an enemy's torso/head you will deal way more damage than normal. Also, mind the angle of impact of bullets when shooting to maximize your damage output.
- Maps' features are not to underestimate: snow and water can and will slow you down, bottomless pits are lethal (there are no invisible walls to prevent you from falling).
- Enemy scouts will ping your location to nearby troops and call reinforcements continuously if there's none in the general area. If you kill the scouts before they spot you or before they update your location to the rest of the enemies and get some distance, you can go back to sneaking around.
- When calling support gear and stratagems, the laser pointer shooting toward the sky will attract enemy patrols.
- Falling pods (support gear/reinforcements) will kill anything directly below them. The shuttle for extraction is no exception, be sure to clear the landing area or you'll be crushed right at the end of the mission.

As usual with co-op games it is best to play them with friends, but you don't need a gang of 4. You can easily play this with just one friend and still have a blast even at higher difficulties.
 
Everything is out to kill you. The friendly fire aspect is a lot of fun and adds to the chaotic feeling. There are a lot of ""clutch"" moments where your squad is down to the last man. Somehow they miraculously survive and manage to save the squad. It's exciting to be in these moments and even watching as your team struggles to get back up to strength after some (accidental) casualties is a thrill.

[b]If you're buying this I do recommend you get the DLCs.[/b] The [u]""Terrain specialist perk""[/u] is basically a must as it gives you a very useful perk: All-Terrain boots. These boots are just too useful on snow planets where your mobility is hindered. Aside from that DLC the rest just provides more stuff to play with. Not all of them are viable, but oh well.
If you're on a tight budget or only want to buy the essential DLC, use [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=573575644]this guide[/url]
Read the verdicts per DLC for a TL;DR of each pack if you don't have the time or patience.

The game is just a lot of fun. It's one of those games which quickly descends into chaos. It will put you to the test to adapt to changing situations and provides enough challenge through its difficulties.
The ingame encyclopedia is short and to the point. It provides good insight into the mechanics of the game and the minor details that could help you a lot. 
I keep coming back to this game. There is just something about it that other games can't deliver in the same way. Works well to play this in sessions now and then.

[h1]Some minor things[/h1]
The only gripes I have are
[olist]
    [*] AI enemies sometimes get stuck on city levels

    [*] All-Terrain boots are too useful to be locked behind the ""Terrain Specialist Perk"" DLC. With the correct gear you can ignore not having them, but not having them does feel like a limiting factor.

    [*] The camera takes getting used to. It is good, because it makes sure everyone stays together as the viewpoint stays with the team. The downside to this is that you cannot always see some stuff that are just outside of the screen, because everyone is scattered around. Aside from that it's fine and works well.

Now then Helldivers is an absolutly fantastic game! Everything about this game is great, seriously, everything!

Graphics: 10/10
The graphics are great (need I say more?!)

Sound: 10/10
The sounds of the weapons, vehicles and enemies are all different and impactful. The music in the game is more in the background and nothing really to write home about but it suits the theme and is good.

Co-op: 10/10
So the co-op/multi-player part of this game is just fantastic and caters to all different play styles. A team could be just a group of 4 players who are all fighting more like they are all solo then as a team but that is still fun and you can still win, although it will be harder to on the hardest missions. Or a team could be working together like a well oiled machine with the co-op gear and vehicles and just cutting through their enemies and having a blast, because it really is a blast and the community tends to be really good. The drop-in drop-out system is just perfect as well.
There is also offline play and offline co-op both of which a just massive wins in my book, (as I tend to be more of a single-player person to begin with). The offline co-op is a great way to just have some fun with some mates who are right next to you which is just great and is dying out in todays games for some reason so I love having it here. All of the offline playing works perfect and is a great training ground, I have alot more hours in the game but quite a few were offline testing weapons and what not by myself so I didn't spoil anyone else's game.

Enemies: 10/10
The enemies of the 3 different races that you fight are all diverse and unique and require different strategies to fight making for a great game everytime where you must adapt to win based on who you are fighting.

Gameplay: 10/10
The gameplay is just great, I really don't have anymore to say on the matter.

Now then I could have gone into every other detail of the game like character customisation (which I will say is another 10/10) or have told you about some of my best games but I think that I have said enough and will leave the rest for you to experience for yourself if you get the game.
So over all I cannot recommend this game enough, it was worth every cent that I paid.

I don't like that there isn't a ""pointer"" to know where you're aiming and the reasoning behind this is merely ""it would make it easier"". Possibly but it would greatly improve the quality of life of the gameplay. Make the pointer translucent or up the enemy health bars a little or something to compensate but not having a reticle is obnoxious AF.

Other than that, it's worth a buy. I really don't like all the DLC with all the really good gear that you have to pay for (ie the boots that are nothing other than essential for planets with anything other than dirt).

Helldivers is a top down objective based shooter, with an emphasis on team-based strategy.

[b]Game-play[/b][list]
[*] Helldivers is a highly lethal game, that encourages players to crank the difficulty as high as they can handle. The game strongly emphasizes multiplayer play, and the game runs a campaign that combines all the points that players earn throughout the community to fight a living war against 3 seperate factions.
[*] Helldivers relies on skill based gameplay, using the correct type of equipment during a situation is more important than leveling up which gives you more selection of equipment (but no skills)
[*] With three types of foes, boss battles, vehicle piloting and a plethora of weapons, playing has opportunity to become varied
[*] Stealth is somewhat of an important aspect of hell divers, each faction has scout units that will set off an alert a few seconds after they draw a line of sight to you, as well as roving patrols of enemies. Thus the name of the game becomes fast and hard. Move objective to objective as quickly as possible and kill any enemy that hinders you doing so.
[/list]

[b]Sound[/b][list]
[*]  The game’s strategic nature causes sound to be mostly used for finding patrols. Therefore in someways it is a little lackluster. The soundtrack consists of military marches and a little ambiance mostly. But you have the option of in game voice commands and there is a little voice acting.
[*] I would say the soundtrack is the weakest point of this game, as the gameplay and visuals are both extremely solid.
[/list]

[b] Visual [/b][list]
[*] The game’s visuals are enjoyable and convey the effects appropriately from electrical Tesla towers to laser rifles, explosions and toxin throwers. Can’t complain.
[/list]

[b]Conclusion (TL;DR)[/b]
I find there isn’t a lot to say about Helldivers. At its core its driven by game-play, graphics and sound take a slight back-seat to the gameplay. I highly recommend this game to anybody. The only time I would suggest someone not get this is if online multiplayer doesn’t appeal to them.

NOTE: I chose to do this review now, because just recently it received an update! I find it extremely satisfying when a developer releases even small content updates to show they haven’t forgotten people who supported their release.

ALSO NOTE: I made sure to play a bit of the game since the new update. I still find lots of games and the player base is still going strong.",1541870494,1541870494,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game cleverly uses a huge variety of mechanics to encourage teamplay, nailbiting situations and amazing crescendos of violence, coupled with some great writing and world building, a wonderful artstyle and absolutely outstanding audio, this game is a shining beacon of what wave based coop should be.

My only gripe is the galactic battle mechanic, while novel and pretty cool, means you'll often be completely locked out of fighting certain factions, for time ranging from a few days up to an entire week! Not very much fun when your favourite enemy faction is completely locked out whenever you try and play...

So I bought Helldivers expecting to play as single and as multiplayer. And what a disappointment.
Single player is a joke, you need to play a lot on the easy maps to level up, totally not worth it.
If you find people to play with you, that might be enjoyable, although there is the camera issue that for some reason needs to keep everyone in the same screen. It's difficult to see, manage and easy to get killed.

Get ready to repeat the same mission over and over again, everything is locked and you need XP and Research points to unlock new features and weapons.

Another frustrating thing is that DLC is almost mandatory. There are certain terrains that slow you down, making easy for enemies to kill you. Items that help players on this kind of situation should be part of the CORE GAME! There are planets that  80% is covered in snow! Imagine how frustrating this can be when you need to visit all the corners of the map.

It is set in a dystopian future where players fight to protect [b]Super Earth[/b] where the Helldivers are the last line of defense to help in the Spread of Managed Democracy. The game doesn't feature a typical campaign story as it follows an endless design where it gives a brief intro and then lets the player play at their pace, picking from 1 of 12 (now 15) difficulties in up to 3 different war fronts.

It is only by completing proceduraly generated missions and conquering planets that players collectively push back against the enemy factions away from [b]Super Earth[/b] and towards their respective home worlds. If the players can reach and defeat any of the enemy factions, those enemy factions are out of the game until only [b]Super Earth[/b] remains. Conversely if players are unable to keep any enemy faction away, they can initiate an attack on [b]Super Earth[/b] and blow it up. In either scenario, after a brief cinematic and some global war statistics, immediately as one war ends, another begins and the cycle continues.

The progression system used by the game uses both XP earned as well as accomplishment based unlocks and on-mission sample gathering to help upgrade various options in their arsenal. Leveling up by XP is based on completing objectives within missions which lead the player through a series of military ranks starting from Recruit all the way up to [b]Admiral of Super Earth[/b]. A player doesn't get stronger (so this is not an action-RPG), just gets different ranks keeping with the military theme and has access to some weapons and options that a starting player may not.

Along the way earning new Ranks, the player will unlock additional Primary Weapon options, Perk options, and cosmetic Outfits.

The accomplishment based unlocks have to do with completing planets across the full spectrum of difficulty the game offers. Combined together each Helldiver quickly accumulates a massive collection of loadout options.

The additional options aren't necessarily better as much as just different since there is a strong attempt by the developers to give everything pros and cons in an attempt to keep things generally well balanced. What this does is allow new players to play with more veteran players and the more significant difference between the players will always remain about skill, not progression.

In addition to all the base game content and continued developer support to grant players additional free DLC content, they also released a couple of free major expansions to the game adding in new Bosses (called Masters), a Horde variant mission type (called Retaliatory Strikes), and additional enemy units and objectives that can show up on missions. All these free additions have been complimented with a wide assortment of paid DLC options that provide players even more options for their loadouts. Indeed, many favored items seen in frequent use by players are from one of these paid DLC packs.

For myself, I have found all the paid DLC options to be worthwhile additions. Some more than others, but no regrets on any of those DLC pack purchases. It may seem like a lot if you are just now looking at the game, but I have been playing the game since it first released in March, 2015 on PlayStation and it may help you to know that the wide selection has grown over time as the developers continue to support while players continue to play and enjoy.

I decided to get the game again on Steam from scratch once it became available here and I continue to play on both platforms because I have made different friends I like to continue playing more with on both platforms. Steam and Playstation players cannot play with each other (no cross-play), but the Galactic Campaign of players vs the enemy factions in a global co-op campaign is shared between the two platforms.

Helldivers is the best 4P co-op multiplayer game (local or online) I have played to date. I look for and play a lot of co-op games, and I haven't found anything else that even comes close.",1511804375,1541178011,True,55,1,0.826642990112304688,6,True,False,False

First of all, think ""starship troopers rogue-like"". You're on a squad up to four people, landing on places to spread FREEDOM like the good soldiers you are. There are a couple biomes and every map is randomized, from the layout to the objectives, giving a bit of diversity to the game. Difficulty is a thing too : the more difficult a mission, the greater the rewards (which is... Obvious, right ?)
Regarding your loadouts, you can create a ton of these from a good variety of weapons and active abilities. Some work better than others where others just won't work as good.

This game is fun as HELL. Really. I'm enjoying it a lot so far. However, there's something that is a bit meh to me.
The majority of players are amazing. Talkative, fun, hardworking, polite. Then there is that minority of people who just enjoy to ruin the game for everyone. The ones who willingly shoot you down (it's a thing) then explode themselves leading to a mission failure just when you were about to finish it. The ones who don't care about you and your ammo that's down to zero, and only care when you kindly ask to wait for you to order some ammo just so they can kick you out of the game.

Unlocking new strategems is half the fun.. Using them is the other. Truly there's a massive arsenal available, from tiny guns to massive bombs, mechs, APC's, turrets and even a tank.
Playerbase is always there, even in the slow times, you should always be able to find someone to play with.

After launching the game, it seems like it doesn't support the Steam Controller, even after attempting to configure it.

The left joystick and D-pad mappings were seemingly swapped.  After somewhat fixing this, I was able to get the joystick to work but the Dpad still failed to recognize button presses.  

Did some more googling and saw that you could use the mouse & keyboard, but you had to be at the main menu.  So I exited to the main menu and the game crashed.  After sitting through the unskippable intro cinematic 5 times the game silenty crashed again at the main menu and I gave up and am now requesting a refund.

No crash logs were generated in where the dev indicated they'd be saved ( %appdata%\Arrowhead\Helldivers\crash ).  Had an application log in the Windows logs saying that the executable crashed, and didn't have any other meaningful information.

Specifically, all players are forced to be stuck on a single camera (designed as a couch game, was not properly adjusted for online play).  This results in constantly being hobbled by players going off on their own instead of staying with the group (it prevents moving too far away from somone, you just can't go further) and *much more importantly* it means you are CONSTANTLY being shot at by enemies who are offscreen and you can't see.

It offers both surface-level fun, easy to complete a few missions in under half an hour, and high skill scenarios that can up to an hour and a half to complete, depending how methodical you are. Additionally, the game is loved by its developers, and has seen numerous DLC's and updates since its release, often going on sale throughout the year. In addition, every ""Liberty Day"" is celebrated in one way or another.

Pros:
Easy to jump into at a moments notice
Having trouble? Call in backup by asking other players to dive into your game, and offer their own equipment for the cause after you've already started.
In-depth progression, with an absolutely massive set of weapons and tech that you can take.
Several vehicles and turrets, that fel extremely rewarding to master.
Practically every stratagem can be upgraded in some sense, and the process to both obtain and use the upgrade currency is extremely easy.
Little penalty for failing part of the mission, allowing you to still escape at the end with the loot and rewards, to a lessened degree.

Cons:
The difficulty scales very rapidly, going from a mission that is easy to solo while eating some random junk food lying around, to having your eyes glued on the screen a mere two difficulty levels higher.
Enemy detection range makes it incredibly difficult to do any kind of stealth operations, typically forcing you to always have to build your character heavy.
Slow turning rates make it so aiming can be a bit of a slog while trying to pinpoint an enemy from accross the screen, but this also makes it very rewarding when getting these long-distance shots. It's bothersome for me personally, but I cannot say it will affect everyone like it does me.
No way to link directly to someone's steam profile, so finding a friend in game becomes a tedious process of trading usernames and describing your profile picture.

Helldivers has always been one of my favorite games to, well, just dive into at a moments notice. Easy to jump into, easy to drag my friends into, and because its on sale so much, easy to find tons of new people to play it with via the S.O.S. beacon.

I would say it's their best game yet, or at least the most refined. If you're looking for a solid coop game with depth, many difficulty levels, lots of enemies, vehicles (three different MECHS!), equipment and weapons,  that you can pretty much always play online, then I can't recommend Helldivers enough. The theme (?) of the game, that's reminiscent of Starship Troopers is just icing on the cake, but oh is it tasty. The over-the-top cheeky taunts the characters make and the various story/flavour texts are pretty entertaining to hear/read.

You don't need friends (;_;) to enjoy playing this, playing it with random players is perfectly fine. There are always a couple games up, even in crazy hours and  the game is still healthy online thanks to the constant wars. The playerbase is overall good (especially on lower levels where people are still learning), of course there are toxic players (like in every multiplayer game), but since it's a coop game, I find that people tend to work together rather than against each other. Finding someone toxic is rare and there's always the option to host a game for yourself and remove whoever you don't like or just simply report them.
The upgrade/leveling system is fun, always gives you something to unlock/reach, until you unlocked all the upgrades you could, leaving only your rank. You get more rewards for finishing more difficult missions. There are 3 races to wage war against and deliver them the glorious invention of mankind, freedom and liberty. Other than the normal missions there are even bosses that you can fight for each race. As I said before there are lots of stuff to play with and try out and all of it viable (more or less) on missions. Finding the right tools/weapons/tactics for the right job is pretty fun. I would recommend trying everything out and see what works against what, following a guide that tells you what to use and do in each situation removes a lot from the game I think. Even knowing what to use in what situation, the higher difficulties are genuinely challenging and you can easily mess up if you don't pay attention or somebody doesn't pull his or her weight on the team. Since there are 12 difficulty levels, you can always find one that suits your need.
Not all DLCs are required, but there are some that makes things easier. These aren't op equipment, every DLC item is fun to use I think and they aren't that expensive when it's on sale. So if it's on sale and you're interested, I would definitely recommend getting the game with all the dlcs, it's worth it I think. Or if you want to save a couple of bucks there are guides that describe what DLCs to get. But even without any DLCs, the game is enjoyable, you'll just have less options in terms of equipment to bring with you against the enemies of Super Earth.
I haven't had many crashes myself, only a couple, but I heard people complain about it. I think the game is lightweight enough for this not to be a problem, since starting it up again is quick and it's not a performance heavy game.",1515589638,1539982998,True,2,0,0.545743286609649658,0,True,False,False

The game is best played with others, especially with friends, but there are Solo Builds out there for the introverted Helldivers who want to contribute to SuperEarth's Glorious Democracy without having to interact with anyone.

Helldivers has a unique system called The Galactic Campaign, in which every mission conducted by players contribute to a meta campaign that goes on for from a week to even an entire month depending on the number of Helldivers participating in. Every race of enemies has different traits, giving very awesome gameplay varieties. You have to take into account their strengths and weaknesses to prepare your Helldrop properly.

Most of the entertainment value of this game lies within its ability to ""generate chaotic moments"". 

Every bit of Helldivers wants you to go ransacking some enemy planet and then suddenly all hell breaks loose: there's an alert and enemies start swarming you without end. You throw grenades at your friends, you yell your comrades to duck as your auto-minigun opens fire over them, you catch fire, someone drives off the cliff, you die with reinforcement stratagem in your hand: suddenly everyone is back. This is a social game.

I suggest wishlisting and waiting for a sale so you get the ""everything"" pack, as grinding the stuff isn't what the game is about. It's about you and your friends using all kinds of experimental weaponry to fail missions.

Pros:
- The controls are simple.
- The combat is great.
- The graphics are pleasing.
- The goal of the game is inspiring and unifying, to the point that you actually want to fight every day and try to drive away the alien scum from the galaxy.
- It gets absolutely hilarious as squadmates can accidentally and randomly kill each other by shooting, bombing and crushing each other through drop-pods.
- The weapon and perk/ability choices are satisfying and keep changing how you experience gameplay.

Cons:
- It gets repetitive as there are only a few kinds of missions to complete. Different planets have different missions to each other, but if you play the same planet you'll definitely do the same missions you just did. Changing the difficulty ups the action, thrill and hilarity, but also increases the desperation of needing squadmates - making it alsmot impossible to play at times if you don't have suqadmates.
- You cannot play if you can't get online - which is generally understandable, but there should be an option to have a custom offline game against a species of  your choice etc - like a skirmish mode in RTS games.
- There are no bots/Ai/computer controlled squadmates that you could take into missions with you, so you end up needing other people online to join your game.
- The accidental and random killing of squadmates can make strategic plays into absolute chaos, turn victories into defeats or cause people to rage quit or become rude.
- The part of the screen you are viewing is shared with the 3 other people playing with you so your vision can be greatly reduced or altered if someone goes to an edge and you're not with them. This is one thing I would definitely want to see changed, so each player has the whole screen to themselves.

I would still recommend the game as it is to everyone. It's a fun, unique, well designed and thrilling gaming experience.

P.S. I definitely recommend buying the Ranger Pack DLC along with the game, to get the ‘Humblebee’ UAV as a perk/ability - It's an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle, capable of revealing enemies and hidden objectives at greater distances, and really helps find samples quickly and easily.",1532888400,1532888400,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

You may think that makes the game sound lazy or bad, but that would be far from the truth: it's excellent. The gameplay is well done and the humor still hasn't lost all of its charm, and the thrill of running and blasting everything with a bunch of friends and randoms online to ruin the alien hive is still awesome.

Helldivers, like its progenators, is a twin-stick shooter that allows you to combine inputs to use special ""spells"", or in this case, air supply drops in things like LMGs, tanks, or nukes. The gameplay is well done, and you will often go on missions online, joining in with up to three other commandos. While it's been a long time since I've played, servers were doing well when I did, and the game really comes into its own awesome, team-killing joy with a full team.

The music is great and as cheesy as it has to be, the heroic/hammy shouts of the characters are as the music, and the game itself looks pretty good. There's no story, except ""you are space America, go liberate the dirty aliens"", which is good enough for a few laughs and to go punch aliens.

If the game has any flaws, it's that the voices can get stale after long enough, and that it suffers from a significant portion of content behind DLC or grinding for equipment... but the game is still great without those anyways. Any game that gives me caped protagonists with cool helmet visors in space with guns is good in my book.

It's advertised as a twinstick shooter, but instead of having the fast twitchy action the genre is known for, it seems to focus on  large stretches of semi-stealth with small arena sections a few times within the level.

The stealth mechanic fo this game is that levels spawn with only groups of low health ""patrol"" enemies. If these are allowed to see you, they can spawn the medium and heavy level enemies, as well as drasically speeding up additional patrol enemies. 

It is possible to ""full stealth"" and not even fight the patrols, but most players seem to like semi-stealth - it's possible to burst down the patrols at long range, allowing players to achieve constant motion from objective to objective. This would make the game too easy, but it compensates a little bit with it's ""shared screen scrolling"" mechanic. Although this can be a disaster in games like Gauntlent (where a slower player can get pinned and everyone else has to go behind the wall to get him unstuck) the screen scrolling in this game seems to avoid this pitfall, and does a good job with its intended purpose of keeping some of the patrols alive to summon the actual enemies. 

The game has 3 alien factions to fight, each of which feel fairly different to fight against, especially because the patrols are some of the most drastically different enemies for each of the races. It has mostly seamless drop-in and drop-out co-op, and can even migrate hosts (usually). I bought it with the intent only to play with a small friend group, but public games turned out to be about 3/4 of my playtime. 

One of the game's stranger mechanics is the implementation of ""armored"" enemies - Medium enemies tend to have damage reduction except from certain angles. Certain designiated tank enemies are semi-immune to anything put the largest weapons. Generally, tanks are dangerous because anti-tank weapons can not be used as primaries, requiring some of the group tp put one in their special weapon slot (and even then multiple tanks can spawn at a time and long reload) Tanks do a good job of preventing overuse of easy to aim and wide arc weapons such as miniguns and shotguns. However, they also mean that their is a hard limit to playing the game as a ""loud"" group. It can be survived for a good amount of time, up to about 1:30 - 2 minutes, but continually fighting and spawning more enemies will eventually force players into a ""runaway or die"" scenario. 

The trailers heavily focus on multiplayer shenangians, and in-game, teamates are usually much more danagerous than enemies. Friendly fire is an inevitability, but the game is pretty gentle with it's regenerating health and respawn mechanic, so it's possible to shrug off a small amount of the friendly fire, while the times you are one hit killed by badly aimed rocket launchers or supply drops are also manage. 

Besides the standard missions, there are also retalitaory stirkes, and boss battles.  The former is a fight in a small arena about 1.5 screens wide, with enemies spawning at a high rate. Boss battles take place in arenas about 3 screens wide. Despite how small these two are, they can easily last equally long to normal maps, as Retalitoary strikes have high kill requirements, and bosses can get out of hand when first playing against them. Retalitory strikes are decent fun as arena missions, but the arena setup invites more direct comparision to normal twinstick shooters, and helldivers cannot compete against in the context of doing the same thing as them. 2 of the bosses (cyborg and bug) are easily avoided health tanks where the real threat is spawned minions. The third boss (illuminate) Is extremely annoying and seems like it was designed for a game with different movement physics. A bullet pattern boss is great in smash tv or binding of issac, but not really suited toward this game. 

The game's weakness is repetiveness. Their are only 3 meaningful missions types (normal, retaltiory, boss) and of those, only normal missions are particualrlly engaging. The semi-stealth is far too easy to optimize if playing solo, and although it can be tempting to do so to speed up the proggresion system, it is generally unfufilling. Multiplayer carries the game extremely hard, but can run into the same problem --- A well-oiled group can run into the same problem, particualrly if multiple people bring things like tesla towers or Napalm --- In some cases, even a single player bringing a distraction beacon can keep a lvl 1-15 (out of 50) group out of real combat for an entire mission on the highest difficulty. 

When a patrol does go off, it's severity again depends on the group - if somebody instantly airstrikes it, a single alarm going off hardly matters - it's only when they start chaining off of each other that they are really fun. However, when first learning the game, the patrols can appear too powerful - because every alarm spawns more patrols in addition to fighting units , you can get caught by large numbers if you remain in one area, with each spawning between 3-4 units.  So, the game kind of scares new players into playing too much stealth early on. However, the amount of fun to be had with the game depends on staying away from stealth as long as possible. 

Personality wise - the game tries some pretty decent satire of an overly trigger happy first world democracy with fascist overtones. It's pretty funny, but is almost entirely contained in the opening cutscenes and the crazy in-level dialuge. Player charathers can shout ""Have a Taste of Democracy!"" while firing their guns. and so on. Although what we get is good, I kind of wish it did a little bit more... it lacks the satiric edge something like Chester Williams:Super Cop has, and the setting does feel like it could go a little further... I thin there's an implication that the WMD's that the aliens are holding are a pretense and that the humans are the real aggresors, but the game doesn't have a further comment. The game's setup also keeps the aliens races weirdly zoned off from each other at all times. No word if they're united against humanity, or also fight each other. 

I like the idea of the game, but after 20-30 hours, you should be able to survive both the single player and multiplayer versions of the hardest difficulty for each of the three alien factions, and will have probbably done all the bosses as well. I think further multiplayer could give you a bit more, but it would  require a group commiting to using the bad/joke weapons or intentionally setting off alarms to make the game more exciting. However, for me, I don't really have much drive to keep playing the game. I'm going to try for one more big MP session with the friends I originally purchased the game to play with, and then I'll be more than ready to uninstall.",1531250950,1531250950,True,18,1,0.697602331638336182,0,True,False,False

Playable solo as well, though you will be restricted to certain loadouts and it will likely be tougher than playing with a team (unless your team sucks as well, then too bad). 
There's a very large selection of weapons and strategems to suit your playstyle, and you can get surprised as to how well certain weapons work on certain situations.
You get to fight against 3 different enemy races: Cyborgs, Bugs, and Illuminates. Each race has their own unique set of enemy types, and will require different strategies to tackle.
There's also multiple maps to fight on: Desert, Volcano, Forest, and Snow. Each map comes with its own environmental hazards, which will keep you on your toes (as if you don't already have to around your fellow Helldivers and enemies).

As with any game, there are some issues as well. Enemy position/spawn and AI bugs are common when playing online, and sometimes the game can lag so bad that you see players and enemies teleporting all over the place, or you get hit by stuff that you seemingly avoided.
You can get randomly disconnected as well, especially at the results stage, even after you've been in the same room for tens of minutes, which means you lose all progress unless the game kindly saved said progress for you.
Since the game uses a Peer to Peer network configuration, it's too bad that you can't restrict your matchmaking region when hosting to mitigate said issues, and even if you join a game that's in your region, you can still unfortunately face those problems.

Even with those problems, I would still recommend this game to anyone nonetheless.

At the 50% discount it's a must-have and at full price I'd still highly recommend it to anyone that enjoys co-op.

The average match duration online is between 4 and 12 minutes depending on the difficulty.
If you're stealthing it solo it will be between 15-35 mins, but that account stealthing even the highest difficulty missions.

All the DLC offer additional stratagems to use, none that are OP, as everything in the vanilla game can do the job, most of the DLC items are specialized items, like instead of using vanilla landmines, you might want to use barbed wire from dlc or instead of a mech with minigun and missiles that become anti-tank after upgrades you might want to get the mech from dlc that sacrifices a bit of anti-infantry power by changing minigun to flamethrower but getting a 90mm anti tank cannon on the other arm.

The base game has enough to offer, there's 3 factions to fight which each have their own look, feel, abilities and tactics playing against each is very different.
The region system of space is well implemented and so is the progression system.

Finally the netcode is super smooth, in my 40 hours so far I've not seen a single lagg issue except 1 time when the host confirmed his internet was being a bit wonky, joining lobbies and friends is smooth as well.

i'm a solo player.
i bought this game, intending to recommend to friends after i evaluate it.

This is almost co-op oriented game., not designed for solo player.
After tutorial and a few newbie mission, THERE IS COMPLETELY NO PLAYABLE MISSION FOR SOLO PLAYER.
So my thumb down is for solo playability only.
if you can always gather 3 friends or don't hesitate to join unknown open party, it may be very fun.

i expected ""fight and liberate planets one by one with friends"" style campaign, but it wasn't.
When launched, game connects to server automatically, and show world-wide situation and which zone you can play.
Thre's no choice but to attend the front-line map.
if you want to fight cyborgs, not bugs, but otter players have already destroyed cy's mother planet, you can't fight them for a while. Being restricted what to do is annoying.

Sooooo many DLCs are almost meaningless, at least to me.
They include avatar's skins(you can't see them while fighting because this game is top-down view) and additional weapons(needless, nothing special)

So if you can pre-secure friends to play with, and it's in sale,  you can enjoy.

Ordinary solo gamer (except elite-professional gamers) shouldn't buy it.
It's an act of donation, not a purachase if you are a solo player.

Varied enemy types, interesting and useful gear, interesting but not excessive grind, varied weapons, ability to choose whether you're looking for relaxed or hectic gameplay, great community happy to teach and help you rank up.

All the insanity and accidental TKing of Magicka, with a bit more technical skill. The main similarity is that your coordination, map positioning, and knowledge of commands for special powers (strategems) marks the difference between a new and an expert player. Better gear helps, but its not going to win you the game. 

The difference from Magicka is that you cant learn the maps as enemys roam and also random spawn. I think this adds to the replayability. 

Its early days, but I bought this game for the weekend and have put in most of my waking hours so far. Theres something addictive about this game - and I think it's the depth, variety, and reliance on teamwork.

The learning curve it's easy to get on with but it counts with an AWESOMEEEEEEEEEEE COMBAT. It's a simple shooter viewed from top with friendly fire and the screen is shared by all players (max 4 players at the same time) but you face tons of enemies (there are 3 races) 

The difficulties are pretty well designed and specially the ""mechanic"" of scouts. I don't suggest playing in low difficulties more than 10 hours or you will get used to doing almost nothing.

You have a huge variety of weapons (most of them are meh and some are pretty awesome <depending on the hands of the player>), an insane amount of stratagems which are in most cases all useful depending on your playstyle.

There are almost no trolls or toxic players in this game (which is hard to believe)



The only bad thing are the DLC's. It's true they are about 1 dollar when they go on sale but in some cases it seems like P2W. Some have pretty awesome weapons or stratagems. I still have like 80% of the dlc's but well hahahaha it's a worth game.

I have just discovered this game and I immediately adopted it!

Interesting game in which you can do solo or co-op games (which are the most interesting for me) and perform tasks like clearing a minefield, saving workers, activating tricks and holding zones!

I don't know where to start ... This game, in addition to being very beautiful graphically and without bug, offers a monstrous amount of weapons and stratagems that you can use throughout your missions!

In addition, you will meet and fight 3 different enemy races and face them on snowy, muddy, marshy maps, .....

Playing as a team is essential because all players (max 4) share the same screen, which means that all players must move together not to die stupidly in a corner of the map ^^

For the moment I met few trolls (some guys who destroyed my installations or shoot me) but overall, I met only nice players .... Note that a ""friendly fire"" is active constantly on the game, so be careful or shoot ^^

I don't know if my comment makes you want or not to buy it, but if you see it during sales, think of me and test it! It's worth it !!!!

I want to be able to recommend Helldivers. I love the co-op squad setup, and the variety of useful gear. I even like the little DDR-style minigame for activating abilities which is harder for stronger abilities. The three enemy factions are cosmetically and mechanically interesting. As a basic concept, I loved it.

Unfortunately, the game suffers from a few absolutely crippling problems.

First, there is virtually no content beyond what's required to make the game work. If you've seen a mid-level planet from a faction, you've basically seen everything that faction has to throw at you other than a few ""endgame"" few holdouts. You can experience all the content in the game in at most three sessions.

Second, the game never progresses other than weapon unlocks.  I used quotes around ""endgame"" advisedly. Helldivers doesn't have a plot (or story of any kind), characters, or even a setting other than space and fight stages. Since there's no story, the game cannot progress or evolve, and no matter how much you play the game, the universe stays the same. You can go through the same three stages over and over at various difficulties with very slightly altered objectives, but that's it.

Third, the entire online mechanic is awful. It seems like it's the result of a marketing idea gone wrong. In this basically unchanging world, everybody who beats a level contributes to this online overall war against the enemies of Earth. Of course, nothing really changes other than a graphic depiction of the galaxy divided into territories under various faction control. Everybody who plays the game shares the map. If you buy the game today, you'll enter the game at whatever point it has currently progressed to in the community. At certain critical thresholds, the progress map resets for everyone in the world simultaneously, and you start back at the starting planets. Of course, you can scarcely tell the starting planet levels from the others, so this is a meaningless event.

Unfortunately, [i]Helldivers[/i] revolves around a static world where the only ""progress"" is a map controlled by the world at large. There's no real sense of progress, and weapon unlocks don't count. So maybe one day someone will make it into a real game, but it feels half-baked to me.",1511412250,1522262911,False,1,2,0.395177185535430908,0,True,False,False

For one, It has been around for quite some time, and I have only joined fairly recently, so I would say it has held up to the test of time very well. However, it would seem that the game is finished being updated other than to stamp out bugs, so what you see is what you get.

You start out with a small arsenal to choose from. Your loadout consists of a perk, a primary weapon, and 4 strategems. Your perk can affect anything from the speed you move to the sidearm you hold, so it is very versatile, and very important. Your primary weapon is what you are holding when you spawn in. There are essentially two types of primaries, projectile and energy. I don't know the exact values, but it seems as though projectiles have more firepower, but require more ammo. The opposite is true for energy weapons, as they technically have infinite ammo. As long as you don't continually fire the energy weapons for too long, you can keep using the same ""heat dumps"" in your energy weapons. Too much continual firing and the weapons overheat, their heat dumps automatically eject. For a long time I preferred energy weapons, but recently I converted to projectile as I started playing with randoms online, so it changes from person to person. Strategems are the most important part of the game. Strategems include vehicles/mechs, ordinance, Support drones, artillery support, etc. The catch is you have to find a lull in the endless combat in order to type in the code to call in each specific strategem. This can be challenging, but to me is what makes the game great.

The galactic campaign has grown on me since I began playing, but I still don't necessarily ""love"" it. Essentially, you have 3 enemy factions to deal with at the start of every war. The community of Helldivers works together to push the enemies back to their home worlds. In each system, there are 12(?) different planets of increasing difficulty. Different difficulties offer different rewards, and different factions offer different rewards as well. The problem I have with this is that sometimes a war is finished with a faction before I am ever able to join in, and so I miss out on the rewards until next season. Most of the time this isn't a huge issue, but last season we defeated 2/3 of the factions and lingered on the last one for weeks. I played a bit to level up but had no way to obtain any new strategems for a couple weeks.

Overall this game is a lot of fun. Bring a buddy, or don't. I've had mostly good experiences with the community. Often times I will recieve help from players who have reached the maximum level, they are all really nice and respect the difficulty curve for newer players.

PROS===
- Theme is amazing. You'll want to punch aliens for freedom. Think Starship Troopers with a dash of WarHammer 40K.
- Fairly extensive weapon variety for $20.
- DLC Equipment is not necessarily pay-to-win and won't give anyone a leg-up over the weapons you earn by liberating planets.
- There are mechs. Walking battlesuits that dispense justice and liberty in equal measure.
- Survive a playthrough on the highest difficulty planet only to be made into a human pancake by the dropship.
- Tech tree has plenty of unlockables and upgrades for your weapons / equipment.
- Enemy variety actually forces you to approach combat differently depending on enemy type.
- Such a fun Multiplayer game!
- Kill aliens with drop pods.
- Kill your friends with drop pods.
- Kill aliens with your friend's drop pods.

CONS===
- The ONLY Con that I can think of off the top of my head... There's really no late-game. Once you've unlocked everything the game doesn't really have much for you to do.
- The god damn Cyborg hounds. F%ck those a$$holes.

My comrades and I fought for every inch we conquered on that Illuminate planet that day. Amidst the screams for vengeance against the unfeeling machines that had taken our homeworlds were screams for ""RETREAT! FUCKING RUNNNNN!"" in equal measure. We had done it, we had re-activated all the anti-air guns, even disabled land mines for the tank's approach, and we had even managed to rescue some stranded survivors. Stage 3 of Operation Freedom Talon would prove to be our downfall. Holding out against wave after wave of that robot hoard... They just kept teleporting in; coming in greater and still greater numbers. We held the line for a while but as the Psion plunged Julian into madness... I can still hear his screams in my bunk at night ""OH MY GOD HE REVERSED MY CONTROLS!"" I can still feel his hubris touching my soul to this day as he turned and accidentally (allegedly anyway) shot and killed our brother Kevin. I was forced to retreat as the countdown to extraction came closer and closer to zero. I narrowly dodged several sniper blasts with my jetpack and mowed down as many walkers as I could. My only saving grace this day... In capable hands lasers never run out of ammo.
As I looked skyward I could see the dropship break the horizon. I waved it down, frantically killing everything I could to clear the landing zone. That's when everything went black as my angelic saviour crushed not just my hopes... but also my body. My last thought was the Pauli exclusion rule.

[h1]Verdict :[/h1]
[b][i]The most fun that I've ever had ruining friendships; Necessary Purchase[/i][/b]

[h1]Democracy in Action[/h1]
http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1276508000
Super-Earth, our home. You’re going to get extremely tired of hearing that every single time you load up Helldivers, but I can tell you that you’ll never get tired of relentlessly massacring foes in the name of democracy. Helldivers is a game that flew well beneath my radar for a criminally long period of time, but now that I finally picked this gem up I’ve had some of the most co-op fun since the release of Magicka. I bring Magicka up because there’s a plethora of similarities between the two games, and Helldivers often makes me feel like I’m playing a Warhammer 40K version of Magicka. What impresses me though is that it draws upon elements from Magicka, it does so in a way that doesn’t actually feel like it’s doing so, instead taking the idea and making it into its own. I like that they’ve expanded on this genre of sorta-but-also-not-co-op, with mechanics like team killing that spice up the co-op experience with a bit of humor and organicality. That’s the most important aspect to a game like this, it needs to have mechanics in place that allow organic situations to foster, otherwise you’ll just run out of content to play through and face burnout. Thankfully, Helldivers does this wonderfully and allows for each run to be ever so slightly different than the last so as to keep you playing for the experience and not just to run through the content. This isn’t to imply that there’s some sort of content drought in Helldivers and there isn’t enough for you to play but, as with any game, regardless of how much there is, you’re going to eventually run out of content. Helldivers doesn’t face that problem because it doesn’t rely so heavily on using the content itself as anything more than a backdrop to your experience, like other games may. It’s a simple game with simple mechanics more than anything, and from those simple mechanics the devs have managed to create an extremely tactical yet, at times, extremely friendship destroying game.

[h1]Randomness and Replayability[/h1]
http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1276506448
 As I said the game itself is relatively simple, with each mission consisting of a number of objectives, increasing along with the difficulty, and ending in your extraction. This is just about the only part of the missions that’ll remain the same, experiences tending to differ wildly based on a multitude of factors like enemies faced, equipment brought along, or who you choose to play with. When it comes to equipment you can bring, there’s a king’s ransom from which to make a selection, from laser shotguns to anti-material rifles, even to beacons for calling in a thermobaric rocket strike, you’re never going to be short of ways to bring justice to the undemocratic. The weapons are all extremely enjoyable both in their names and their functions and feature a full upgrade tree with at least two significant advancements for each weapon. Some of these enhancements can literally turn weapons from useless to critical, all just with a few research points, hard-earned from sample-gathering. Gathering samples is your main way of acquiring upgrade points, though you do get one per level-up, but not only do those become increasingly sparse as the game progresses, one research point simply isn’t that much. Really you get samples by finding them scattered throughout each mission, finding up to 15 or 16 on some of the harder missions. I like how hard they are to find, it makes them satisfying and rewarding as well as providing nice little side “objectives” as it were for you to look for in between the main ones. The main objectives are all unique, and they differ based on which race you’re fighting at the time, sometimes you’ll be neutralizing a minefield and other times you’ll be setting up and performing environmental scans. I like the variety, each mission has randomized objectives so you’ll rarely ever get the exact same ones as last time, and each objective requires a fair bit of teamwork, but can be soloed in some cases as well. Not only do I appreciate the variety, but I also appreciate that these missions require a division of labor amongst your team. You can’t have everyone doing the objective, at least one some of them, you need to have some people on constant guard for patrols and some actually performing whatever the objective may be. This teamplay coupled with the random drop-in system makes for an incredible social experience as well, since you’ll be not only meeting new people, but engaging in almost team-building exercises as well. That sounds a bit odd, but that’s kinda what I can liken the gameplay to: a big team-building exercise where you and your friends get together and attempt to solve various objectives without getting pissed and murdering each other. 

[h1]Home-Grown Gameplay[/h1]
http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1276505519
I’ve talked a lot about the missions and the social aspects present in Helldivers, but now I’d like to get into more of the mechanics and content. Helldivers has a real focus on diversity in your equipment, giving you dozens of different weapons and almost a hundred different stratagems to use with the most prejudice possible. I’m in love with all the different stratagems there are and how absurdly fun they can be to wield, ranging from small tactical barbed wire and ammunition drops all the way to massive mechanized war machines and tactical missiles. There’s so many of them and they’re all so fun to use that I often find myself going through a crisis in the loading screen, not knowing which of the fantastic abilities I’d like to take along for the ride. The same goes for the weapons; they’re all satisfying and extremely reactive to use, and oddly I sometimes found myself opening fire even when nothing was there, just to feel the recoil and hear the impact. What’s impressive to me is that the stratagems and weapons seem to all have a place, and I’m often rotating them out to fit whatever the current situation is, which seems to be an organic way to get players to experience all the content your game has to offer. That’s a perfect way to describe Helldivers: it’s organic. Everything, from the situations you encounter in-mission to the weapons that you equip and even the outfit you choose to wear, it’s all organically determined. You might be fighting armored enemies and adapt to the situation with offensive stratagems like a tank-buster turret, or you may be in a winter environment so you switch to an arctic cloak. No matter how small, every little thing is determined by the situations in which you find yourself, meaning that you’ll be playing Helldivers for hours on end, annihilating both boredom and the enemies of democracy with extreme prejudice. 

[h1]TL;DR[/h1]
You can spread democracy a million different ways, but Helldivers by far has the best one. Hilarity and badassery go hand in hand, making for a fantastic team-based experience like no other.

You are a Helldiver, using an arsenal of weapons and air strikes with ungodly power to spread Democracy and Freedom accross the galaxy. The first time you and 3 other Helldivers unleash a bullet storm of Justice into the face of a seemingly insurmountable wave of enemies, and help Liberate them from their bodies, you can't help but crack a smile.

Simply put, it's one of the greatest co-op (online and local) games ever made.  There are so many options as to how you can approach each mission, the game never gets old.  The game can be as hard or as easy as you want to make it.  Play solo and farm samples, or team up and tackle harder planets.  A team of 4 grizzled vets can make a level 12 Helldive look easy, then get destroyed on a level 6 planet due to a misplaced stratagem call down and some not so friendly fire.  All 3 races are fun to play against, and you have to adjust your playstyle accordingly.  

This is also one of the few games that does DLC right.  None of it is needed to reach the end game, but it is fun to use and can breathe some new life into the game once you become the epitome of Super Earth.  Yes, the boots DLC is great, but it wastes your Perk slot and it does nothing that a jet pack or vehicle can't do.

I bought it.  4 player coop with Friendly Fire (though everyone so far is trying to play nice) and a very ""Starship Troopers"" vibe.  I'm only on my second day, but I like it.  One odd thing is the campaign is persistent sort of, so I tried playing with a friend and they didn't like it because the Bug final mission event was on and we got creamed -- no biggie though.  Lots of different weapon types and items available, so far it's worth every penny.

Update: Having played to level 20, I'm having fun.  There's a suprising amount of loadout options for different missions.  Despite it being friendly fire, people have been almost universally mindful of that (even I have killed people accidentally, those Mech rounds).  Unlike the Evolve community, the people are generally friendly.  I was only called ""an idiot in a Mech"" once and it was basically my fault for not paying attention ;)  Worth every penny.

I'm level 27 (outta 50) now, got about 100 hours in per Steam.  It's fun.  There's alot of nuance to the game, I just switched up my primary weapons yesterday.  I will also say that the community is the *least toxic* of any I've seen.  I've only seen one deliberate Teamkiller (and I rated him low) and people generally try and be considerate.  It's not perfect, but I wish Evolve was like this when I played.

Funny story: More new players with the Christmas sale, which is good.  But last weekend I got kicked 5 times without cause. -- I've never been kicked at all .  It's noob silliness, but the last one made my day.  See, the hellpods that deploy to the planets can be deadly... so the new player who didn't know me was busy kicking me (for no reason) and didn't have time to dodge out of the way of the hellpod.

Today I will be reviewing Helldivers a twin-stick shooter that has been on my radar for a bit now thanks to my desire for quick games and co-op.  As you may be able to tell I’ve only played the game for about two hours and did request a refund.  But, is this a game you should put your time into?

Become a Legend:  As stated above this game is a twin-stick shooter where you aim with one ‘stick’ and move with another.  These were very popular is old arcades and in co-op circles of the early generations of online consoles.  There is controller support (which I find essential for a game like this) and the replay ability of the game comes from leveling and trying out different combos.  The story is far from forgettable but don’t let that fool you into some epic narrative.  The story is based around humanity basically sending ‘democracy’ to the galaxy at the end of a gun…or a few million of them.  The enemy factions are all characterized as pacifist alien species that are somehow violent.  If you can’t tell it is a very tongue in cheek with a slap of ‘Team America’ and Starship Troopers thrown in.

So lonely:  In my opinion this game lives and dies based off the online community; thankfully this game still has one.  All the players I played with were friendly and at least communicated to some degree; increasing the fun of the game.  But sadly, after a few levels I saw really what the game was:  An arcade twin-stick shooter where the enjoyment was solely dependent on the community but otherwise honestly being rather shallow.  You play one mission you’ve played them all as there are limited objectives and the enemies are not super varied inside each faction and there just doesn’t seem to be much variety in playing styles to choose from as I felt some guns were just objectively better than others and the people I played with seemed to agree by their choices as well.

PC Mastery:  My understanding is this game originally came out on consoles and later on PC, which makes sense as this game feels more at home with a controller than a keyboard and mouse.  With that said they really should have done more to make the controls more refined for the PC as they are a bit of nightmare.  This is almost immediately resolved by simply plugging a controller in but feels this should be stated none the less.  The game didn’t seem to have any bugs that I noticed but I found myself annoyed by the lack of any real innovation, it seems like they just ported a stick shooter for an arcade machine with better graphics.  Finally, a decent amount of the game’s options are locked behind DLCs that admittedly aren’t that expensive but still annoyed me as I felt the game really isn’t up to snuff without them.

So, twin-stick shooters are a lot of fun with people.  If you have a few friends wanting to get this I think it would be a great addition.  However, alone is a no go unless you love meeting new people 10 minutes at a time.  I will say I did have a good time with mine and glad the game at least carried the parties from mission to mission.  Overall, it is really up to you, I requested a refund because none of my friends seem interested and didn’t see myself spending a lot of time on this game verse my other hobbies.  Regardless of what you decided, enjoy as always.",1515130139,1515130261,False,7,0,0.487649202346801758,0,True,False,False

Bought the whole bundle on sale and worth it for $20. At full price with all the DLC, probably not. 

Game has a loadout system with different guns, stratagem and perks. Loadouts are effective especially when tailored for specific enemy type/worlds and mission difficulty. 

Guns are plenty but most are trash and players will often find themselves sticking to a specific for each of the weapon types. Standard fare of action shooter weapons with lasers and conventional shotguns and auto rifles. 

Stratagems are called in via CTRL key and WASD key. Call in fire support from artillery to orbital lasers and personal equipment like shields, anti tank rockets or jump packs.

Perks affect your character's survivability, stratagem cooldown or deployment and equipment like stun grenades. 

Friendly fire is deadly and often laughably absurd. Drop pods are a serious threat to both friend and foe.

Very easy to level up and attain mission/planet specific rewards in equipment and stratagems. Thankfully it's only late game cosmetics that are hidden behind the grind wall. 

Enemies come in three types. Cyborgs, Illuminates and Bugs. Has both strenth and weaknesses to weapon types and stratagems so adjust loadouts accordingly. 

Game has a campaign event targeting one of the specific enemies every few days or depending on how fast the overall multiplayer progress goes. The campaign and game in general reminds the players of introducing ""Freedom"" to these enemy regions.

Good gunplay and the impact of having the right stratagem, perks and aiming feels satisfying. 

Overall, a fun game to be hold your attention for a couple of weeks or so.  Good blend of overly militaristic humors with responsive gameplay.",1514980414,1514980414,True,4,0,0.564233183860778809,0,True,False,False

Then the next thing is that you where spamed with the next walls of text, that there is a starmap and blabla... WTF?! click on a damn fkin part of the map and join... you dont need 4 minutes to read text for that.
After this the gameplay... truely trash. This is like a shooter which try to be ""special"" because implimenting stupid magika trash combos to do stuff, like orders bombs or revive year team members. which is only anoying and maybe kids find this ""cool"" but the gameplay is nearly ruined threw this.

Since then, the bug or problem that was ruining matchmaking has been fixed, so it's now easy to find matches again. 
So, bugs apart and old problems solved, the game itself is a good offering, specially if you enjoy playing games with friends. You control your soldier and have to do missions ""fighting for Democracy"" in space. You can do them alone or with friends in squads of 4, matchmaking itself is good and fast to find you a game to join. Each mission drop offers a sequence of different field objectives that you then need to endure and fullfill, fighting hordes of enemies trying to stop you. There are 3 different enemy factions, with different units and abilities. Each of those races has a home planet. Progress is linear, you progress through missions untill you get to that home planet and defeat them. While you can individually choose your next missions for you or your squad, the meta goal comes in the form of a war event with community goals. It will be the overall gathered results of all missions played by individual players to dictate if the community won, or lost the war for democracy.  
 As soon as a war cycle ends, a new one begins. Each time you can either win in spreadintg democracy to all the alien worlds, of get defeated and extinguished, as aliens conquer our home planet. 
Individually, as a player, you control your character in a top-down view, you can choose your loadout before each missions, and gained XP allows you to unlock better weapons, armor and equipment for your soldier. The game is light, fun and easy to understand, requires some skill and good timing analysis to decide when to use what from your inventory. 
All in all, I'll finish as I started. If you have friends to play with, it can be quite fun. If not, you can still have fun while matchmaking with randoms, since there is a rating system for players, and generally people are friendly and do try to play the game the right way.

The red light on my command console blinked at me. It was ever so subtly speeding up, telling me that in a few seconds the doors above me would open and I would be amongst my Helldiver squad... spreading Democracy at 200 rounds per minute.  I readied my MG-105 Stalwart squad automatic weapon, giving it one last check to make sure it would dispense freedom reliably.  It would be my first line of offence and my last line of defense against the bugs we were here to squish.
  
The red light was faster now... and slowly turning green.  I knew when the green light lit and the alarm went off, I would be in combat.  My auditory amplifier was coming live and I could hear the muffled sounds of gunfire above me.  Yes, there was Democracy to spread this day.  My heart was pounding at the chance to convert Super Earth's enemies yet again.  At once, the light turned green and the doors flew open.  I pushed up hard with my legs and my rocket assist boots kicked in, propelling me up and away from my pod.
  
The sound of gunfire was at once deafening and exhilarating.  The world seemed to explode around me.  The dopamine injectors kicked into full forward and my eyes lit up with a lust for blood and violence the likes of which have not been seen since Travis found that box of gerbils back in middle school.  I brought my Stalwart up and trained my sights on a wall of bugs moving towards my position.
  
As I squeezed the trigger and began to feel the climactic rush of Democracy about to leave the barrel, I noticed a 6-sided shadow around me, growing larger.  I looked up in time to see the bottom of the next Helldiver's pod racing towards me at 1000 meters per second.  I was about to take a full load of freedom right in my face... and it was magical.  I had time only to hit the ""max"" button on my dopamine regulator and feel the explosion in my veins as the pod crashed through me and into the ground, letting the next Democracy dispenser begin his mayhem.

**************

Helldivers is a tongue in cheek mixture of Judge Dread, Starship Troopers, and some Orwellian nightmare made real.  You play a raw recruit that will die, over and over again to fight in the war against the bugs, the borgs, and the squids.  In the 2 hours I have on record so far, the game has made me laugh out loud, sit on the edge of my seat, smile like an idiot, and just about rage quit.  

This is not a game for sissy mary's, you are going to die, a lot. especially if you play solo where it always seems like you have to reload at the WORST possible time, where calling in a defensive turret or some other strategem is always going to be an edge of your seat skin of your teeth affair. 

This is an unapolagetically twisted and violent twin stick shooter, which works pretty darn well with mouse and keys (I like the controller, but you lose a LOT of accuracy with your weapon).  The action is frenetic and satisfying, and the carnage is everywhere.

In a very real sense, this game plays like a moving tower defense game, at least in the sense that as much as you need to move around and explore to complete objectives, a LOT of the key objectives revolve around defening an object for XYZ time while enemies flock to your location.  This is good, but predictable, and is both part of what is fun, and annoying, because if you are playing solo, or even with a team you will need to use your ""strategems"" to survive (at the moment the defense turret is my oh S#@t button.   Strategems are these special abilities that range from ammo drops, respawns, air support bomb runs, and defensive turrets etc. 

However, you don't simply select what you want and it drops for you... Oh no, the game uses a brilliant mechanic where you need to input an up up down down konami style code to use these special items, and in the heat of battle this can be both infuriating, and brilliantly exhilarating.  

Of course what modern game would be complete without loads of unlocks and things to improve your power... Every mission has slews of items you can collect to give you research points you can dump into weapons that you want to improve, and strategems you want to buy. 

All of your efforts go toward a global campaign that everyone who plays contributes toward.  The forces of Super earth are at war on three fronts, and as the humans win, or lose, the galactic map changes, offering new worlds to fight on, new environments, and more.  Eventually through community effort, the humans either gain victory points, or the aliens do, and if enough victory points are accumulated by the human players, the humans will advance till they reach the alien homeworld.  Take that, and that part of the war is over. 

The war ends when the humans conquer all 3 aliens, or when one of them reaches Super earth. 

So there is always incentive to keep fighting. To add just a few more points to the war effort.  

In addition the multiplayer has a report/commendation system where good players can get commendations and this ranks them as a good player worth playing with, the matchmaker does it's best to match you with suitably good players, while people who get reported at lot (usually for being a griefer etc), get limited to only being able to join people with a similar bad rep.  This bad rep takes time to go away, and good comendations can repair your standings reasonably quick.  I don't know how well this works to limit griefing, but judging by the community opinion of the game, it must work well enough!

Sadly, I haven't tried the game with a group yet, I want to play it with RL friends more than strangers, and didn't want to be an embarrassment to a team of oher players who might know what they are doing.  So for my first 2 hours I avoided it.  Now I'm about ready to try, and from all accounts, multiplayer (with friends or strangers) is where this game shines. 

I already like it a lot, and I expect when I get going with multiplayer I will be hooked.

I was able to play this game on both PS4 and PC platforms and to say this game's overall community is less toxic than you'd expect it to be. If this game would be something, I bet my ass this one is going to be something next to Morgan Freeman. 

Anyway, technically the game is great. It encourages teamwork and situational analysis, I mean it's not rocket science but a little common sense on what your teammates need or situational awareness as they call it is the best contribution you can give. The game has enabled something called ""friendly-fire"" so you better watch where you aim so your teammates won't hate you or probably spam kill you or even get you back at the game. 

Controller-use is highly recommended on this game, or maybe it's my console-peasantry blood tingling over my body that's why I suggest it, I don't know I just feel easy to play using a controller instead of mouse and keyboard in this kind of game setup. 

Overall, what I like in the game is the replayablity and community-based effort to keep the game alive. It also promotes teamwork and cooperation towards each other. The only dislike is I cannot adjust the sensitivity of the controls but I guess I'll learn how to adjust after all humans was in the top of the food chain because of its capacity to adapt.

I highly recommend this game if you have someone to play to if you are a single guy like me don't worry there are vacant servers over the Internet that could accomodate your loneliness.",1513964635,1513964635,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I have to say I've never really been into twin stick shooters but wow what a wild ride this is! When starting out I was worried about Friendly Fire and never being able to do Missions on 8+ difficulty. But man was I wrong to be worried. The option to change your cursor helped me immediately enough to drop the klaser sight perk and try other fun things. And sure I have had my fair share of accidents but I say I am sorry and call down my allies.

The races are highly diverse and the weapons, perks and strategems are all viable minus a few outliers. DLC is not needy but it is handy! This is an absolute STEAL if you can get the game and all DLC on sale. 

It's a great time with a passionate community. Do not be intimidated when you are level 12 and you see a Level 50 drop into your game. Just follow their lead. They might jsut call down a tank and let you man the gun or a cool fully upgraded special weapon. And sure they might teach abotu ahrd knocks such as destroying your mechs and turrets but will tell you relax when calling in strategems and your guns will do you plenty good. 

Final advice: Have fun and don't steal other people's equipment. Commend good players! [When on ship hit escape key and right click over the person you want to commend's name and hit commend. It keeps them with the good drops and players!] And if you drop into a game where everyone is running away. RUN. It's a great community and I can say after 80~ hours I've only had to report less than 5 people in the time of all those drops but I've commended easily 70+ people.

PROS:
-Rules are simple, and gameplay is straightforward.
-Missions are relatively quick, and other players can join mid mission.  Which can be VERY nice, because there are times you are getting wrecked and need the backup.
-Unlockable and upgradeable weapons, stratagems, and gear.  As you defeat other planets, you unlock more and more gear.  Each mission you can find these little items laying on the ground, and once you collect enough you earn an upgrade point.  Those can be spent to improve all of your equipment/weapons.  It isn't at a grueling pace to get them either, so you will usually be able to improve equipment often enough.
-Teamwork.  This game really leans heavy on playing the harder difficulties with others.  Because otherwise you would be overwhelmed and die.  Some folks may list this in the CON section, but I feel like the company did a good job at making this aspect work really well.

CONS:
-There are 3 enemy races.  You are pushing into their territory and killing them off, etc.  Once a ""sector"" of planets is conquered, it is locked off.  The game is ""real time,"" meaning all players share that status of the sector locked off, so if you never played that region then you have to wait for the war to ""Reset.""  And that could be regions to unlock more gear you do not have yet.  Kind of a bummer.  That is pretty much the only real drawback of this game.

OTHER:
-Friendly Fire!  Oh man...this can be upsetting moments, or funny moments.  You can easily shoot a teammate.  Might do only moderate damage, so no big deal.  Or you were firing a rocket launcher and you aim was piss poor.  Results may vary.  You can also call in a piece of equipment that is a mech, and accidentally walk on teammates and crush them.  OOPS!
-The story/environment of the game is VERY entertaining!  While in the hub area of your ship, there is scrolling news stories at the bottom of the screen.  They are purely for fun/flavor, and can be quite hilarious!  It has a very...Starship Troopers type of feel to it.  You are Helldivers going out to ""spread democracy"" with your guns!  Your characters even say similarly motivating (brain washed) things while running around during missions.

This game is fun, challenging, and encourages heavy teamwork. 
Weapons have good variety and stratagems are awesome, i like the idea of keeping friendly fire on as it allows people to practice their aim and make strats.

The community is good, very positive and not much salty players. The commend and report mechanic of giving feedback to players is good because it allows players to know which person is a team player or a party crasher.

the only drawback to the game is that the DLCs of this game gives you and your teammates a huge advantage. If you dont have much money to buy DLCs i think the stock stratagems and weapons are fine but will make harder missions challenging.

If you like the movie then you will love this game. It has funny satirical story elements that go right along the same lines as the SST movie, and the best part is the story is mostly just filler because it repeats the exact same way every campaign season. 

The game play itself is phenomenal, I thought I would hate the shared top down view that prevents you from getting to far from you team and forces you to work together. But for some reason it works really well here. You just sorta start playing like a team after a while without even thinking about what you got to do. 

My favorite mechanic is definately that you have a radio that you can use to call down extra equipment, fire missions for artillery or aircraft, and even respawns for dead team mates. It adds an extra layer to the game without being obtrusive and is implemented in a way which is extremely well thought out.

I've had a ton of fun. The huge drawback is that once you get to the level 23-24 you pretty much experienced all of it and at this point, you simply grind for experience to level up.

Probably something like longer party raids with challenging monsters and great rewards.

Other than that it's an outstanding game. Very polished and fun to play. Great universe. Doesn't have much of a story, but you don't need it for this game.

Outstanding community and the game designed in a way that supports team play. I never saw trolling or bad player's behavior. I hate jerks in multiplayer games. It's one of the reasons I stay away from them. I glad I gave Helldivers a chance. It didn't disappoint.

The friendly-fire mechanic in the game requires you to focus alot on team coordination and not just shoting at the first enemy you see, aswell as causing some rather hilarious situations. 
Also no worries about running out of missions sense each mission will have a new set of randomly chosen objectives forcing you to come up with a new plan for every mission.

However the game doesen't come without it's downsides, one of them being the way the in-game campaign works. Sure it's fun working together with the community to gather enough points to conquer a piece of the enemies territory. However the problem lies in the fact that once you defeat and conquer an enemies home planet you will not be able to play against them for the rest of the galactic war (usually lasting for around 2-3 weeks). This leads to for example the ""bugs"" being defeated within week making it imposible to play against them for another 1-2 weeks which can be quite discouraging at times. 
Next is the reasearch point system which honestly is one of my favourite parts of the game. during your missions you have a chance of coming across samples on the ground, gather ten of those and you get a science point. These points are used to uppgrade/unlock weapons and stratagems but they are far to easy to aquire and the uppgrades are way to cheap. This causes higher level players to walk around with tremendous amounts of science points they have no use for. I dont like the fact that the hole idea of running around the map searching for samples is just rendered meaningless once you get far enough into the game.

Still though, no game comes without it's flaws and i think this is an amazing game if you want to team up with some friends and just have a good time.",1503776590,1511540652,True,1,0,0.502487540245056152,0,True,False,False

You can play by yourself but the harder missions will be much easier with friends. Up to four people can play together and teamwork is encouraged. For example, one player can carry a heavy anti-tank gun while another can carry the gun's ammunition, allowing for much faster reloads. You can play with random strangers but I strongly recommend playing with friends and using voice chat to get the best experience.

Also, this game has full friendly fire so you need to be careful. At first I was annoyed by the friendly fire, but after some hilarious experiences I can safely say I've had more fun getting accidentally teamkilled in this game than any other. 

The levels are all procedurally generated so no mission map or objectives will ever be the same. There's a large variety of weapons and special abilities that you can earn, and three different alien races to fight. A weapon or tactic that's useful against one race may not be useful against another - this encourages experimentation and use of tactics. Many times I've failed a mission only to say to myself or my team, ""That plan (or loadout) didn't work. Let's try this plan (or loadout) instead."" Seeing your plans pay off this way is really neat.

The firefights can be incredibly intense. If you've called for evac, and there's a horde of aliens bearing down on you, and you're down to your last few bullets, it can lead to some adrenaline-pumping close calls or last stands!

The graphics are adequate. The music is suitably epic during large battles, with alien ambience for the quieter moments. I particularly liked the ""Bugs Hard"" soundtrack.

The story is sort of a spoof of the movie ""Starship Troopers."" On the surface the plot is about how the soldiers of Super Earth fight to make the galaxy safe for managed democracy. But there are subtle doses of humor that I liked a lot.

Helldivers might seem like a generic run&gun type of game at first sight. A plain excuse to shoot stuff and avoid to get shot at. But you actually have to worry about so much more ! You will probably do things like :

- Shooting your teammates in the chaos and kill them
- Landing on your teammates and kill them
- Making your tank land on their mechs and kill them
- Being mad because someone took your gear and kill them
- Calling a Tesla turret in a closed space and kill everyone

But eventually you'll get better, eventually you will join a game right in the most desperate situation, right when their last teammate died. Then you get to revive the whole team half a second before a swarm of mobs guts you, come back from the dead, kill a bunch of monsters and turn things around.
There's more than one way to play and a ton of possibilities for your loadout. The game gives you a lot of opportunities to make you feel terrible or proud about your skills and the decisions you made, which in my opinion says everything about it's quality.

Right off the bat, Your given a pretty in depth tutorial, And i know this game has been out for a long time, Trust be been there with the game as it was first on consoles all the way, The game has a moderate amount to offer in terms of content.

There are plenty of weapons,strategems, And other neat gadgets at your disposal.
Though most of the items you use ingame, Many are shrugged off in a series of they can't or don't do enough damage end game 10 Plus or higher leveled missions.

Here are my pros and cons for the game
:PROS:
+Fun solo but to about 8 leveled missions, I managed to push 9.
+Insanly fun with friends always a good laugh.
+Indepth teamwork mechanic
+Heavy Friendly Fire based game (can be a con)
+Report/Commendation system (So you can get an idea of who joined you)
+Diverse tools ingame

:CONS: 
-Diverse tools ends up falling off endgame.
-Hefty on the grind side(Doesn't bother me though)
-Can get repetitive quickly
-You can't always use what you want, There has to be some compremises in your team(Doesn't Bother me)
-Most DLC isn't worth it and poor DLC practice, All Terrian boots the player HAS to buy them to do ice planets, And most of the items in the DLC packs offer very little for any real pay off, Fun here and there, But at level 11-12 end game missions, you'll barely use any of them if even a single one at all except drone boots and maybe a few others.

All in all the game is going threw time rather well, I still love the game after the several years it has been out but i hate the DLC practice in games that developers choose to take.
Without DLC this game is still amazingly fun, By yourself for a few hours but even better and funnier with other HELLDIVERS.
I give it 8/10
It's truely a fun game to pick up on a sale or something you can't go wrong.
Besides the HELLDIVERS need more men to fight the wars that have besieged SUPER EARTH.

It's a good game aside from the below problems. Looks like a mindless twinstick shooter, but actually has loads of coordination! Heck, you can even coordinate with other players as you construct your builds before actually starting the missions. Pretty awesome.

I'm not going to be writing this review to try to sell you the game though, I'm just writing it so you'll be aware of certain things I don't like about the game if you plan on buying it. [b]Read other reviews, watch videos of gameplay, and do further research and don't base your opinions entirely on solely my review.[/b]

[h1]The 4 aforementioned problems are:[/h1]
[u]1) Illuminates are really not fun to fight[/u]
There are 3 races in the game: Cyborgs, Bugs, and Illuminates. Throughout all the planets you fight on in this game, you will fight against one of these races at a time. The Cyborgs and Bugs are actually very fun to fight, while the Illuminates are not.

On lower difficulties, only the weakest Illuminate enemies spawn, making them the easiest to fight. On high difficulties, Illuminates spawn in large quantities, often on top of you, or if you're trying to reinforce dead teammates, ontop of their pods when they drop in. If the Illuminates enemies aren't close by, it's often because they are Obelisks or enemies with laser-sniping abilities.

Now, let's say you're playing a higher difficulty where all types of Illuminates spawn in. All of the special types that start spawning have [i][b]extremely annoying[/b][/i] attacks that feel plain unfair.

Illusionists fire projectiles that invert your controls, which are difficult to avoid because such projectiles explode (and any players caught in the explosion will be affected).

Council Members fire projectiles similar to those of Illusionists, except they [i][b]instantly kill you if they hit you[/b][/i], and they also home in. They also fire out a wave that inverts your controls if you're close enough, and it doesn't matter how big the wave seems at the time, anybody in the maximum radius of the wave is affected, instantly. The Council Members can also attack even if you stagger them. Very annoying.

The scouts sound the alarm so quickly you need a gun that one-shots them to deal with them effectively.

The laser snipers (don't know their actual name, and don't care) always are offscreen and annoyingly snipe your objectives.

The Tripods always spawn in large numbers and stay ontop of you or your pods when you try to reinforce people.

The Obelisks fire walls that instantly kill you, some utility strategems (mechs, tanks, etc.), and some objects, and make it so jetpacks are required since the walls block players.

[b]TL;DR:[/b] Illuminates are annoying and are not fun to fight.

[u]2) Content gets locked off as the community plays[/u]
I mentioned Illuminates being annoying. Now, think about how I said Cyborgs and Bugs are fun to play. Now, imagine only being able to play on Illuminate missions. This happens sometimes because people hate playing Illuminate missions and love playing Cyborg/Bug missions.

Every mission you complete in a sector of planets grants that sector influence points. When enough of these are attained, the sector is locked off and you continue to the next. When all sectors for a particular race are cleared, that race is out of the war and you need to wait for the war to end and for all sectors to reset to be able to play missions with that race again.

It wouldn't be so bad if all the races were fun to play with, and it especially wouldn't be so bad if often you weren't restricted to Homeworld Assaults (which are the last things done for each race). During Homeworld Assaults, you can't unlock items at all (unless they are level-locked items). Thankfully, only non-DLC items need to be unlocked, but this is still super annoying since you really do need many of the non-DLC items to play effectively.

[u]3) Music is super repetitive[/u]
I like the music in this game, good work to whoever made it! Only problem is, the music that plays during a mission depends solely on the race and difficulty you're playing on. If you keep doing Cyborg missions of difficulty 9 or higher, you will always hear the same theme. Minorly annoying, but hey, the music for the high difficulty Cyborg missions is awesome. I just don't like hearing it 50 billion times.

[u]4) Difficulty curve is dumb[/u]
Think of an exponential curve. It starts out super shallow, not increasing rapidly, and then over time the speed at which it increases skyrockets. That's this game's difficulty curve. Difficulties 1-8 are pretty easy once you get used to the game, and difficulty 9 is the ""I need to start paying attention"" difficulty. Difficulties beyond that (10-12) can actually be pretty challenging.

[h1]Conclusion:[/h1]
Most of what I have to say is negative, but that's only because I wanted to point out the flaws with this game. It's pretty good, but it's not perfect. The flaws aren't so bad that I wouldn't recommend the game. It's a solid game with fun gameplay for the most part.",1509928313,1510031490,True,2,0,0.527128279209136963,0,True,False,False
394510,36334389,76561198086907018,235,2,754,0,754,1510021303,"TLDR: A very fun game for a short time which afterwards to boils down to a pointless grind. Some of the DLC seems like it should be a feature in-game, with some way to unlock. The playerbase is great, but small, which prevents you from trying some of the more challenging gamemodes (unless you have 3 other friends who play the game as well.) Difficulty is binary.

Majority of the things that should be features, example: All Terrain Boots aka AT Boots, are locked behind a DLC paywall. There are few much less effective alternatives to this, but unlocking any of them is a pain. AT Boots is the only true remover of the Snow planet debuff which slows your character and prevents them from sprinting (in a game thats all about moving fast and killing faster).

The playerbase, while helpful and non-toxic, just doesn't seem to be big enough, as more challenging missions require more players for pure firepower in different direction, and there is very few playing above or at the 6 - Very Challenging Difficulty (it goes up to 12). Much could be improved with matchmaking (although the problem may stem from the seemingly low playerbase.

Diffculty in this game is also binary: Either you have the firepower and equipment to take out the hordes of enemies, or you are simply numbered. If you are outnumbed, this results in an 8 minute circle of 3 out of the 4 squad members dieing, one reviving them all, and all but 1 dieing again.

The game universe resets every 20-30 days so that you can once again win the war for Super Earth, which is nice so that you can continue playing the game but also very annoying since you have to watch the War Victory cut scene every few weeks.

You can play missions in three sectors of the galaxy.  Each sector is controlled by a different alien race.  The races have slightly different strengths and weaknesses, but are overall pretty similar.  The planets have slightly varied environments, but you do end up seeing the same level design over and over again.  The selection of mission objectives are not very diverse and include bomb sweeping, pick up and deliver, defend a location, destroy a location, or activate some equipment.

Repeatedly playing the game will earn you experience, and each level has a number of collectibles you can pick up to unlock research points.  Experience and research points grant you new gear or upgrade existing gear.  I found that the gear unlocked by level 5 or so was pretty much the best gear to use for my play style, so all future experience and research points just went unspent.  The vast majority of weapons and special abilities are garbage, so there's simply no appeal to keep playing and try to unlock better equipment.

Missions have varying difficulty levels which are adjusted not by the objectives you have to perform but rather by the enemies you have to face.  There are more enemies, and they are more difficult enemies, in the higher difficulty levels.  Since it doesn't take special gear to defeat those enemies, a low level player can be just as successful in those harder levels as a player with hundreds of hours.  This ultimately means you'll be able to experience everything the game has to offer in only a few hours of playtime without actually having to build up to anything.

Ultimately this game is a highly repetitive grind simply for the sake of grinding.  It grows boring quickly regardless of if you play solo, with friends, or with random people online.

I dont recommend it because of the camera and helldiver drop system.

The game supports up to 4 slots of tactical equipment that you can call in to support you and your teammates.
Ammuntion, weapons, mechs etc. some limited some not, mechs are limited f.e.
The most anoying thing in this is that, and this happens to me often, in the heat of the fight someone dropping extra ammo or a turret and I stand there with my mech fighting and get smashed by it..
Also as I joined a game I dropped on a full apc that was standing still in no ifght.
Those things make the game exhausting, because you have limited stuff and it get smashed by the game own system.
But thats not all.

The biggest problem that I see is the camera system. Its allways focused on the host, so that you have allways stick to him and follow him anywhere.
I got many times killed by that, here some reasons why:
- stucked at the max range of the camera trying to get cover but didnt make it
- ""atomic"" bomb was activated and 3 of us rushed in one direction the 4th but choosed a other one, so we stucked in the killzone
- aiming is horrible, results in many friendly fire 
- when covering a sector you see only some meters far and enemys can shoot at you out of your viewdistance because of this camera distance limitation... it often happens especially with cyborgs that they reach very fast melee combat distance because the viewdistance is so short and you could hit them early if the camera would be centered on you

Those are the reason why the game most of the time is very frustrating.
I already asked in the forum for a change maybe to a system like alien swarm has.
But soon was declined of the community because it would make people do ""less"" teamwork.
Those arguments are utter bullshit.
Because if you would go alone, you would probably die fast by this amount of enemys (depends also on difficulty).
Also happens this much that some guys just wanna walk there were 3 other ppl wanna go, so the one guy mess it all up.

A camera like in alien swarm would improve accuracy, reduce freindly fire and also increase viewdistance.
But as I already know and some ppl told me is this game primaly a console port with this deep in build camera system.
So it wont change.

The ""liberate planets = get strategems/rewards"" mechanic encourages play and allows you to decide what strategem to pursue next. Using them is fun, upgrading them is rewarding, and it is simple to activate. Just make sure the landing zone is clear...

As for plot, it's fairly bare-bones. You are a Helldiver, an ODST/Space Marine by another name, sent to pre-emptively liberate the galaxy from the terrorists at Cyberstan, the robots of the Illuminate, or the bugs of... the Bugs. Each enemy has their own ideosyncracies for fighting (cyberstani terrorists remind me a lot of the Orkz from 40k, the Illuminate are effectively ""control"" fighters who either summon big metal monsters or use forcefields to control the board, bugs are extra tough but have weaker points). Your goal is to defend Super Earth and our VERY WAY OF LIFE... before the enemies decide to one day attack Super Earth itself. By spreading managed democracy, you can ensure that Super Earth will be safe today, be safe tomorrow, and be safe forever.

The hyper-militarized fascist backdrop serves perfectly for the violent extravaganza of drop-pod deaths, friendly-fire turrets, and brutal sniping enemies. It may sound like a lot at first, but the mechanics are simple and the difficulty curve is nicely paced out from ""walk in the park"" to ""oh God why are there so many bugs and why can't I get 10 feet without dying"". It's truly optimized for a party of 4, and the drop-in system works wonderfully; I rarely have to wait long to have someone join my game, or I can hop into someone elses. The fact that it takes 2-3 missions to capture a planet goes a long way to ensure players stick together between missions, which helps keep party size up while also helping to ensure a degree of coordination and teamwork. When teamwork fails, the game lets you get back into the fight quickly provided your team mates actually call for reinforcements. I rarely wait more than 10-15 seconds to get back into the frenzy.

I highly recommend this game to anyone who likes cooperative shooters, ""last stands"" of any kind, and people who like to call in CAS every 10 seconds like an A-10 pilot owes you his daughter's life.

Helldivers is a great game! Though its probably not for everyone.

First of the graphics which are good for what it is. In my opinion it doesnt look terrible but actually has a lot of details.
The shading and the lighting are all great and very sharp with only a few times where the shadows look like cubes on high settings. But the detail in this game is also beautiful! Depending on what kind of biome you are on you will leave footprints or if you use laserguns and overheat them small canisters eject from the gun leaving a trail of smoke. It may not sound very great but its fun to watch that happen. Even better are all the bullets that lie on the ground after a big confrontation with hostiles. Such a joy to watch what happens on the screen if something goes wrong.

The sound is great with enemies haveing unique sounds that really set them from others appart. But the soundtrack is rather boring. It follows the simple dramatic horn and violin format most of the time. The tracks sound all pretty much the same at least most of the time. Also I wish there would be some more lines for the Helldivers. At first it may be fun to hear the things characters say when they kill but at some point its quite annoying. Also having to hear a RELOAD voieline everytime you hit reload is especially annoying with shotguns or weapons that have generally small mags.

The gameplay in this game is increadibly fun and addicting! Beeing a twinstick shooter you obciously to the usual things like running arround and shooting everything but the unique thing about this game are it stratagems. They are supplies or airstrikes that can be called down to you on the surface of a planet if you enter their activation code correctly. This is done by using WASD as arrowkeys. Putting them in a specific order will give you a beacon to call down whatever you want! This is something that may be challanging at first but gets more fun to do over time and once you can enter the Reinforcement code under a second you ll feel like a pro player. What keeps me playing this game is the need to be able to play the highest difficulty mission with no problems. This game has a neat learning curve. Depending on how good you are with games you ll be able to get good at the game quickly and have a lot of fun with it.
But untill that happens you shall die from your own supplies. this game has friendly fire enabled at all times and cannot be disabled. Its a part of games which makes you have to play carefull at all time. Dont shoot your friends on ´accident´ or stand beneath the rescue shuttle when it arrives and get crushed.

The progression is something that is nice and also not nice. There are 50 levels in totall and they ll take you more time to get as you go on ... obviously. But at some point you ll be able to notice the grind in this game. Ranking up after 25 can already take quite some time especially if you are not a good player yet. Weapons and stratagems are also upgraded by so called Research Points that can be acuired by collecting a certain amount of samples or ranking up. Getting these is simple and not difficult to do but you ll notice that you will have to grind for them if you want to upgrade more and more as you go on. Both the xp rewards and the research points will make this game feel like a grind that can or cannot be enjoyable because mission always are kind of same with diffrent maps and random objectivs. The only times it get somewhat diffrent is with bossbattles and capital defence missions.

Unfortunately this game has dozens of DLC of which some are undeniably good for the game. Which is why the Digital Deluxe Edition should be bought instead of the standart version of the game.

Generally is this game worth it? Yes I would say so but beware of the grind. Its a game where you have no story whatsoever and you ll be doing things over and over again.

I also do not recommend to buy the standart edition of this game. !! Buy the Helldivers Digital Deluxe Edition!! It will give you all the DLC that have been released so far. It will give you a much larger arsenal of weapons airstrikes etc. Should the Deluxe Edition be on sale its most definately a good idea to buy that instead of the standart edition",1509390242,1509393258,True,2,0,0.540636062622070313,0,True,False,False

This game is the perfect mixture of Warhammer 40K, Starship Troopers and a lot of sarcarsm, and as much as i liked it, i cannot recommend it if you are willing to spend hundrends of hours on it, or if you plan on not spending much money and buying a cheap game in exchange for a lot of fun or things to keep you busy

It is super fun and humorous, fluid, runs well, has no bugs, is very good optimized, colorful etc but by the 30 hours mark you will have already experienced everything the game has to offer, and past that, all you are going to be doing is grind. 

And is a bad grind too, because the rewards aren't that great and will not improve your gameplay experience, simply add to it. If you already got a Mech, a vehicle and a missle launcher, you won't need anything else to have some fun.

On top of that, the developers have pretty much abandoned this game. There aren't any bugs, never experienced any, but there are no updates adding content neither, so this game is in a stupid cicle of having a lot of players when it's free, a portion of those end up buying the game and staying for a few days or weeks, and then its back with another dozen or two players. So it's pretty much wasted money for anyone, since there isn't going to be anything new or players to play with.

I suppose that if you're going to play with friends for long hours then its fun, but don't illude yourself to think you will be winning a lot of ultra fun rewarding stuff to brag about or play more later, cause you won't.

The devs recently released an update, months ago, an anniversary update, but nothing remarkable, i think they lowered some prices and added a weapon? Anyhow it felt like a move to show up in the ''recently updated'' Steam list and get more people to buy a zombified game - eventually it comes back to life, and goes back to being dead.

Pros.
-Simple, tactical, twin shooter. A lot of unique, weapons with their own gameplay.

Cons.
-Some guns and weapons could be expanded on by the make the camera more personal to the player.
-Yeah, the camera in the game is tied to the squad. It doesn't really expand. Kindof a no man left behind scenario. So snipers and 1 hit kill weapons could use a buff by actually changing the camera mechanics and letting the player be free to roam with out being tied to the squad.
-Glitches. There are a few bugs and crashes to the game. It needs to be tweaking. Some of the ones I've experienced.

So, i thought i could have a lot of casual fun, also in Singleplayer. In a similar game to 'Alien Swarm' ( also here on steam, free). Helldiver comes with grinding your equipment. Which per se isn't wrong either, it's just the amount of grind. I just wanted a casual Twinstick game. So, that's me personally and not yet a reason to downvote

What made me downvote it is:
* You need DLCs to be better of and have an advantage in the game, like the all terrain boots. Sadly i just bought the base game, not the deluxe package. I hate pay2win stuff. Soloing a snow world without those boots makes you go really slow in the snow - every monster gets you. Not ideal for singleplayer.

* The crosshair issue. It's discussed throughout the forum and on the interwebs; It's a console port, so why do you want to enforce the console mechanisms when it is now on a mouse & keybard platform? Ok, you can also play with controller on PC (which is good), but when i resort to using mouse and keyboard, i'd like to have a crosshair. See aforementioned 'Alien Swarm' how to do it right. You need some kind of orientation possibility to indicate a directional intent to your character with a mouse...

* Also someone mentioned here in the reviews that the mutliplayer is pretty empty after the free weekends, and this game really enforces multiplayer coop. Alone in singleplayer, without your 3 squadmates does make it pretty hard on the same maps. With coop and human squadmates, it's a lot of fun and actually not that hard (depending on the map difficulty). Regarding the servers: It's apparently peer2peer, so at least  shut down servers won't be an issue, thank god.

I recommend picking it up only on 50% discount or less for all the content ( less than 15€). I personally refunded because it apparently is - at the moment - not the right game for me.

After 8 hours of Helldivers, my opinion is as follows:

1) the blurred cursor in a mission is *RETARDED*. It makes the game harder for no reason - PC and console players can't play together anyway, so crippling the game for the PC gamer feels like a stab in the ribs.

2) *BUG* that prevents your game from saving! If your player name is something like ""PLAYER #0"" then you're not going to save progress or unlock achievements. However, Steam still manages to track for how long you've played! After 2 years of the game being in release, I don't expect a ridiculous bug like this.

3) Friendly fire... imagine this: tiny screen bounds, everyone clustered together with high-powered weapons. Friendly fire will happen - a lot !",1509233409,1509311361,False,2,0,0.493615686893463135,0,True,False,False

 The game itself is fun in multiplayer, it's even exciting when you join a party (or someone else joins you) due all the chaos on the battlefield. The main problems I see, that would make it less attractive to anyone are the facts that it has friendly fire (which also applies to the enemy), and that almost anything can kill you amidst the chaos.

 Also, the game has basically 4 map types (snow, desert, volcanic and jungle), this sounds terrible in paper, but they are just a template to generate your mission. Basically, you can have a snow map where you have to rescue survivors, activate a communication tower and capture a zone or two, and after that it could be a mission about nuking  a nest or facility, retrieving a pack and disabling some mines.

 In the end, the point of the game is not to run and gun, if you stay and fight the enemies won't stop spawning until you either lose them or manage to avoid triggering any alarms while dealing with the current army. Basically, the game is more of a stealth game than a shooter, and what makes it shine is the teamplay and chaos.",1509310599,1509310599,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

+ fun birds eye tactical-ish shooter gameplay
+ humour
+ decent amount of vehicles, drops, airstrikes and guns to unlock
+ 3 unique factions to fight
+ hard bosses
+ only one person in a squad needs to own DLC for the squad to benefit
o plenty of fun if not efficient things locked behind DLC
- updates come out twice a year with barely any content
- multiplayer camera is very restrictive for the squad
- metagame can prevent you from fighting certain factions at certain times

[h1]My recent experience:[/h1]
Oh hey a new update is out and I get a free stuff just for starting up the game!
I download it, start it up and click play on the main menu. It shows me a map and some text about how sectors are being liberated. Skip past all of it. An unskippable cutscene shows up of me walking up to some dude giving me a medal and saying I'll be remembered as a hero and he's extracting oil from bugs or something. [b]CREDITS ROLL[/b]. Sends me back to the main menu.
I click play [b]AGAIN[/b]. Some more sectors being liberated, blah, blah blah. Finnaly lets me do stuff. I open the armory to look at the new uniform I got for the anniversary. The helmet is a reskin of the default and the armor's nothing special.
I proceed to delete the game.

[h1]Updates[/h1]
This was the 2nd anniversary update. It added a granade launcher turret, a smoke cloud and another boring airstrike.
The update before that added an m1 garand and a cape.
The update before that was the 1 year anniversary update which added a pretty cool laser shotgun and super useful armor admittedly.
So the game's [i]kinda[/i] still alive. At least as long as the servers stay up.

[h1]First time playing it[/h1]
I had a lot of fun with it when I got it. The gameplay was good and the unlocks, which I feel are the core of the game, were satisfying. Even played it with some friends. We had a tactic where one guy would get armor and a machine gun to tank bullets, one would get a rocket launcher to kill tanks and the third guy brought all the OP DLC vehicles that nobody else wanted to spend money on. When they got bored I spent some more time farming for upgrades and doing bosses, but I didn't really get too far solo.

[h1]The camera[/h1]
An important thing to mention is that in multiplayer, everyone sees the game from the same perspective. The camera focuses on the average position of all the players in the squad and you can't leave the field of view which makes running long distances while fighting off enemies a hasle.

[h1]The metagame[/h1]
The game has a server wide metagame where the missions you do contribute to the ongoing war by helping capture territory. This means that you get a new selection of random missions to do every time a territory is captured, but it also locks you out of fighting a faction if the war against them has been won. This can lead to only missions for one faction being available for as much as a couple real time days if they're the last one standing.",1509288846,1509288965,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Mission was succesful, All targets destroyed and enemy forces crippled. However, we lost the captian. Extraction was botched and the Cyborgs completly surrounded us. We kept fighting until we started running out of ammo, down to the last mag in our side arms. When the shuttle arrived, Captian Elis ran for the Machine gun and he drew their fire as we made it to the shuttle. I saw him... i saw him get torn apart by those half machine monsters, the pilot started taking off and we sit down and the trip was silent. Sir...

Hundreds of hours on the console, nearly maximum of the prestige rank. Game is still just as fun now to play.

Essentially it does everything right. 



The controls are tight and feel very fleshed out. Accommodating for every type of action a player can perform without being complicated. The game even having a system for pressing buttons in a code entering fashion to activate objectives and call in support, which feels very nice to use yet it doesn't feel obtuse or confusing at all.

The combat is relatively simple twin stick shooting, with a variety of enemy types and enemy abilities however once again remaining basic enough that it's easy to remember what each enemy can do without them losing their individuality. There's three different enemy factions, which also helps a lot for variety.

The gameplay itself is the games strongest point. The maps are totally randomized and are composed of very nondescript geography to the point where even after hundreds of hours it is rare to actually notice two maps that have the same features. The objectives are each unique, randomly generated and placed around the map, and are very understandable to complete. It just doesn't get boring, although the escort objective is obnoxious.

There is a variety of outfits, weapons, passive perks and equipment that players can choose from and gradually unlock. Which is the low point of the game is that there are certain things that are distinctly underpowered and have never been buffed, and thus they might as well not exist which makes the customization smaller then it could be.



The game does have a lot of purchasable content, and for twenty dollars for the base game it does feel like a lot of that content should have been in the game to begin with to flesh it out more. Especially with all the underpowered things in the vanilla game that aren't ever used. It still doesn't feel however like the game has less content then it should, and the main emphasis of play is just on shooting things anyways. The game has also recieved multiple free expansions and pieces of content so it's not like the developers were ransoming content away. The purchasable content has a few powerful weapons in it, but it isn't required to have them to be able to play effectively so players aren't majorly at a disadvantage if they don't buy it.


Although the game does have a low playerbase by now, it's still no problem to find multiplayer so long as you turn off the region filter in the search filters; and there's really no problem with lag at all. The game is very social in its matchmaking system and so it really doesn't require many players to be ingame for there to be options for drop in cooperation.


Other then the imbalance of certain items, the biggest problem with the game is that the progression of the games world wide online system is very bad. Certain online events lock players out of going on any other kinds of missions for that faction of enemies, which means less diversity and no access to earning certain rewards; for the duration of that event. When an enemy faction is defeated, it can't be fought for the duration of that online cycle which means it literally isn't playable content anymore until the world wide playerbase has completed that war. Beyond that, the Retaliatory Strike and Boss mission types are ridiculously overpowered.



The game is totally worth playing even if twin stick shooters, or even shooters, aren't your main thing. It's just that well designed, fun and replayable.

Each mission pits the players against against one of three distinct races, each with their own ways of fighting. Selecting a mission, preparing and deploying all flow together with ease. Weapon variety is deceptive, as they all fill the same role: killing weak enemies. The actual variety of loadouts comes from a set of special abilities, or ""Stratagems"". They range from simple artillery strikes and special weapons to deployable cars with seats for the whole team. 

The actual gameplay consists mainly of complering a variety of objectives(enought to keep the game fresh) and defending against endless hordes of enemies. Completing missions has ""rewarding"" written all over it, as every mission brings the players closer to unlocking a new toy, as well as progressing the entire playerbase towards their common goal.

I don’t recall being slowed down by untouched snow drifts, nor being routinely boiled alive by the gushing magma that volcano worlds like to troll you with, but the actual planet-type itself escapes me. We were there to capture it, and while we certainly weren't attempting that feat on the hardest of the twelve mission difficulty settings available, it was up there in challenge. There were three of us; I’m certain of that much. There were just the two of us at the start of the first mission, but a third jumped in mid-way through and, while we were nothing special, we were competent. We dragged each other through that first invasion with just a few hairy moments and a narrow escape when we finally completed all our objectives, suffering the most when forced to hold ground until a dropship arrived to evacuate us. But we dug in, weathered the last of the storm and then unashamedly ran like frightened girls toward the ship when it finally arrived. Two of us actually made it.

Mission one of three down, we ploughed on. Completing a full set of missions isn’t obligatory, but you soldier on for the prize at the end, be it a fancy new weapon or a fat experience boost. This time, our war was waged against the bug army. There are three distinct enemy races in HellDivers, but the bugs are by far the best. There’s nothing wrong with the robot or cyborg forces, both of which wield superior tech the giant insects don’t possess. Robots teleport in and cyborgs drop from the sky, but bugs come at you from under the ground, burrowing in from anywhere. Should one of their scouts spot you, you’re flooded with snapping claws, acid spit and near-unbreakable carapaces. One second you’re alone with nothing but the swirling sands for company. The next you’re, well... not. It doesn’t take very long at all for a screen to fill with homicidal bugs.

But we were making good pace, confident enough to leave the beaten track to try to hunt down hidden specimens that are used to slowly upgrade you Diver’s arsenal of weapons. We reactivated SAM sites and held off the herd that appeared to destroy it; we nuked insect nests and liberated strategically important sites. Our resource use was slim and slow, saving the big weapons for the eventual end when we called down that shuttle and the entire planet would turn up to try and stop us. But we were all good. Then the fourth character fell from orbit, and everything went to hell.

The new arrival was ten or so levels behind the current team’s average, but that’s usually okay; a decent team can often carry a rookie through harder planets that their default, unleveled equipment shouldn’t allow them to endure. The three of us were battle hardened; our chosen pulse beam rifles, sub machine guns and shotguns all fully researched to their most powerful apex. Even if our new member did minimal damage, it’s better than none at all, right? At worst, it would be a boon to have a new person ordering equipment from the ships in orbit above us. Even if they chipped in now and then with the odd ammo refill or a revive when one us fell, it would make for a better team. 

In theory, anyway. Dear, sweet, elusive theory...

1) This is such a great spinoff on the themes of Starship Troopers I’d say it might outshine the series itself, if that wasn’t heresy. The jokes are clever, & the game nails the absurd political/military dynamics. If the gimmicky lines get old, you can simply turn down the voice volume setting.

2) At launch they took a lot of flak for being “DLC: The Game” which was completely fair. Now, however, I can buy the game, and all DLCs, for $20 – a steal, for all that it’s worth. I’m again pleasantly surprised to see the community hasn’t died even after 2+ years. Even outside peaks in the userbase (sales, etc) there are more than enough pubbies to grab a pug game with. Feel free to look up the stats.

3) The progression is rewarding enough without being intrusive. Besides the cosmetic items common to every gorram game these days, there are upgrades for your existing weapons/abilities as well as more to unlock. The DLCs make this a great deal easier – which, again, they deserved a lot of criticism for after launch. Get it on sale, however, and you won’t worry about p2w locked items.

4) The campaign map analog is, personally, highly satisfying. It boosts immersion, & gives you a sense of purpose in slogging towards one of three enemies’ planets. The progress is shared across the entire userbase, whether you’re playing solo, co-op, or matchmaking. I can see how it would feel like a grind, but to be honest, if you’re playing the game to grind/looking for a game to grind in, this probably isn’t it. Helldivers is clearly meant to be taken lightheartedly, & the progression is mostly here as a supporting feature. The DLCs go a long way to reducing your dependency on unlocks/making the game generally more enjoyable. So, again, be sure to pick this up only as a bundle on sale.

5) Servers are stable and co-op is seamlessly integrated – with pugs & among friends. No issues personally, nor have I read of much. The game itself is thoroughly stable, & the graphics are accessible even to low-end PCs.

6) While it is playable solo, most of it is a steep climb if you’re not in a group. This varies depending on mission difficulty and player skill, of course.

7) As a small, personal aside: I immensely appreciate that you’re meant to aim for center-of-mass (headshots aren’t remotely as frequent in reality), and that reloading your magazine doesn’t magically keep any unused rounds from the previous one. This is another unexpected (and at least for me, pleasant) surprise – an immersive detail I haven’t seen in most other shooters I can think of.

So who is this for? I’d say if you liked Magicka (or disliked it for certain stylistic reasons); are a fan of Starship Troopers; enjoy top-down squad-based shooters; cackle gleefully while dismembering enemies of Democracy, Liberty, and Super Earth; are looking for a casual to medium-core co-op game with friends; or some combination thereof.

Well, that’s about all I can think of for now… I hope this recommendation helps. Bottom line: when it’s on sale, I’d give this game a 9/10 must-buy if even any of the features entice you. Go kill things for Super Earth! It’s great for Liberty, Democracy, and  FREEDOM! ...probably.",1498410894,1504219921,True,84,1,0.879149019718170166,2,True,False,False

Its only major hindrance, in my opinion, is its DLC implementation, though I have found this to be the case for many of Arrowhead's games. Many DLC weapons and stratagems are fun and extremely useful. I personally do not believe that any of the DLC is NECESSARY. Even the all-terrain boots aren't necessary because wearing a jump pack gets you around just as fast, in a different way. The all-terrain boots are even a trade-off since you give up another perk.

 If you are looking for a great cooperative experience with tons of opportunities for you and your friends to step on eachother's toes this is it. A satisfying shooter with a massive amount of potential viable loadouts and many different kinds of weapons. Great variety of enemies and how to combat them in the three factions. The game takes place over a large meta-war where you fight a three-front war against Cyborgs, Bugs, and the Illuminates (high-tech aliens). The war is divided into three branches for each faction, and you fight within a sector in order to gain enough community points to take over the sector and advance your war. At times the aliens will fight back and may gain territory back depending on if the community fights back hard enough. A small issue appears when two factions are defeated in a meta-war causing the remaining players to be forced to fight the remaining faction without an options to fight the others for variety. Not too big an issue since I believe all three factions are uniquely fun to fight, but can get annoying when you're burnt out on a faction. 

You will enjoy firing projectile guns, explosive guns, lasers of many varieties, pilot vehicles, mechs, stationary turrets, call down artillery, bombing runs, FLAMING NAPALM WALLS, you will kill your friends by accidentally landing a drop on them, you will kill yourself by accidentally landing a drop on yourself, you will kill GIGANTIC ALIEN INSECTS BY PURPOSEFULLY LANDING A DROP ON THEM (git gud). You'll unlock pieces of equipment for purely visual customization of your male or female Helldiver (helmet, armor, and cape). Pub games are pretty fun, too! text and voice chat, and a friendly community (tends to happen with cooperatively focused games!). If you enjoy cooperative games with a hard focus on friendly fire, a jovial attitude, and some good ol' democracy, you'll love the hell out of Helldivers.",1503076057,1503076081,True,5,0,0.563857436180114746,1,True,False,False

In HELLDIVERS, you are essentially the human race settling in a new home planet for what is called Super Earth. However, there are 3 factions that call for war and you are required to fight them in order to liberate their sectors to gain peace amongst human and other species. 

+ Large variety of equipment and ""stratagems"" (Call-ins that can provide support or bring in a piece of gear). There are a lot of weapons that you can choose for certain types of missions or if you're wanting to change your style. As for stratagems, there is also a large quantity of those that you can chose and a type for each different scenario, also has substitutes if you have yet to unlock the one you want. 

+ 3 different factions/species you can fight against. (Unless that faction has been defeated)
[list]
[*][u]Bugs:[/u] Oversized cockroaches that will tear you apart if you get swarmed. Or are willing to spit acid on you.
[*][u]Cyborgs:[/u] Some weird cult believing in mechanized humans. A combination of human flesh and metal.
[*][u]Illuminates:[/u] Aliens. Highly advanced and rather annoying with all of their gadgets.
[/list]

+ Enemy patrols can and will call for back up if you are spotted and haven't wiped out the patrol. Wiping out the patrol before they can send a signal will prevent their back up and you can continue on your merry way of completing the mission. However, allowing the patrol to signal for reinforcements will cause you pain and misery in the higher difficulties.

+ Very basic controls, stratagem call-ins require you to do some button smashing, but it's fairly simple. Until you screw up, that is.

+ A long ongoing war that will continue regardless if you lose or win. Losing requires for the WHOLE community to not play or to be so horrible that they manage to lose the entire sector, which allows the enemy faction to invade your home planet. On the other hand, winning will be a long, hard journey of triumphing multiple missions in order to claim important cities and sectors alike.

-+ Large amount of DLC. Can be see as a con as some DLC are not worth getting or if you're a not into paid DLC. However, you can get all of the DLC if you want to support the devs or get the Digital Deluxe Edition whenever it goes on sale.

-+ Small Stealth aspect, it's possible to avoid any conflict, but you better be looking on your map every 5 seconds and lie on the ground whenever you spot a patrol passing by. Be aware that suppressed weapons won't hide you. Learnt that the hard way.

-+ This can be seen as a con or a pro. The camera is based on the entirety of the squad, forcing you to stay with the team. Also causes issues when the team is horrible at placement, causing you or someone to have a VERY limited view.",1462321140,1502763481,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

i've never seen any other co-op game with co-op mechanics as effective as Helldivers. teamwork really is key in this game.

lots of features to encourage teamwork - you help a downed ally get up, resurrect them from death, provide them with ammos, gears, mounts, and more. enemies swarm you from all directions so you better back them up or die.

there are no personal achievements at the end of the game and xp/loots (for research points) are shared so that players can only focus on teamwork.

there's also Arrowhead's trademark permanent friendly fire to spice things up and adding more fun to the game. 

levels are procedurally generated so replayability is not a problem. lots of weapons/gears/skills available to fully create a distinction between your character and the others. controls on both kb/m and xbox controller are fantasic showing that Arrowhead/Playstation did not rush bringing this game to PC.

need i say more?!

again this game is probably the best game i've played here on steam. it's so good i already pre-ordered Helldivers 2 and 3.

FOR DEMOCRACY, FOR FREEDOM.

The easy missions allow you to get a feel for the game. As you move up to more difficult missions, it'll become very clear that you need your fellow Helldivers to accomplish the objectives.

TEAMWORK is very important. As such, it is a MUST to always respect your fellow players to have a great experience. The community is very much alive and helpful, so learning how to survive and spread managed democracy becomes much easier.

FRIENDLY-FIRE is also a very important concern. Always be mindful of your aim and the whereabouts of your team.

The game is pretty simple. Drop in. Accomplish Missions. Extract. That's it. There are many weapons and stratagems (The Helldiver's bread and butter) to upgrade and learn how to use. Once you've upgraded everything, you may choose to wipe your slate clean and start over.

You main gun runs out of ammo, and very quickly too meaning the whole time you are concentrating on ammo drops than shooting.

The Story itself might sound overly clichè, but the game itself is fun and actioned packed and makes up for any blandness with most of its gameplay elements. Whether you're fighting against Aliens, Cyborgs, or Bugs, the gameplay never seems to dull. Its basically a more tactical twinstick version of Destiny (seriously, the HellDivers look like the classes from Destiny) and handles really well. TeamWork and Tactical Precision seem to matter the most in this title, just be sure to not shoot your Team-Mates in the back of the head.

I do wish there was more customization in the game. The armors all feature the same dull hue, with the exception of a few biome specific variants. Its not a big issue but I just think it would be cool to allow players to further personalize their HellJumper.

Lastly, I am not sure if anyone else has this issue, but while using a controller, I can't use my Keyboard to type in chat. I will hit the Enter key but no chat box will pop up.

Set in a future where earth is a big alliance, under control of a managed democracy, this game already promises well. So let's see the

PROS

+Great backstory. I won't spoil it to you.
+Intuitive controls, and original support call system: You can call for resupplies and fire support using a peculiar key combination system, like cheats in GTA.
+Well-made weapons: There are quite a few weapons, and they all have their pros and cons, sometimes you are forced to change weapons because your current weapon isn't suited for the mission.
+Teamwork. A lot of it. The game offers quite a few ways to put your team to good use. From choosing complementary equipment, tanks, and assist-reloading heavy weapons, teammates are invaluable. Best played with 3 friends. 
+Unforgiving friendly fire: Yep. There's friendly fire. And a lot of it. Your teammates are squishy, and so are you. See that giant heavy caliber rifle in your hands? It oneshots enemies. And so does to teammates. 
+Good unlock and progression system.
+Democracy is life

But, not everything is good in HELLDIVERS. There are a few

CONS

-Too many DLCs. I get that the devs need money, but there are way too many, and adding stuff that is REQUIRED in some cases. Plus, the DLC equipment is all available from start and is not to be unlocked.
-A few bugs. There are few of them, but this few can easily be gamebreaking. Although rare, a bug could end your mission.
-Stealth could've been better: Having a suppressed weapon won't change anything, you can't go stealth.

--Verdict--
HELLDIVERS is a nice game, and strangely doesn't suffer from the port from console to PC. It will deliver a lot of fun with friends, and it will make you swear a lot. The pricetag is quite high and difficult to justify, because of the so many DLCs and the age of the game.

I really dislike the pricing scheme the extra DLCs and most especially the few DLCs that are almost ""required"".

One thing to keep in mind as a grunt on the ground, you need a solid Anti-Tank solution, your pop gun just doesnt cut it. Another thing is bring the ammo drop everytime.

A big part of this game for me is the thrill factor that it gives dodging enemies being swarmed makes it real fun. Adding in a "" race mission"" to this would be really cool where your squad goes against another squad to see who can finish all the tasks the quickest gets some extra XP or a new perk. Just another small thing that could be put in to keep the haste going.

Pros:
1. Very intensed fights and you don't feel bored or repetitive during a mission, every single encounter means danger.
2. Strategy needed, means that playing it with your friends would enhance the gaming experience, fortunately they do have random online co-op.
3. Lots and lots of upgrade to be unlocked. I've spent 22 hours on it and I haven't got all the most important gear fully upgraded
4. Varieties. Weapons and comands are just so many and it takes quite a while for players to find out their own play style.

Cons:
1. It wasn't a game designed for just one player in my perspective. Player would get bored after just 1 or 2 mission if he/she plays on his/herown.
2. Lack of varieties in missions. In game missions tend to be quite repetitive, escort, defend, destroy certain targets, set things up. From difficulty 1 to 12, missions are very similar. Only enemies become tougher.

You're a special operative designed to make a bright future for your Democracy Motherland, Super Earth, which is under attack by vicious Cyborgs, Zerg-like Bugs, and Protoss-like aliens.

The tips constantly claim this game is difficult when playing alone, however, I must debunk it. It's actually easier if you play everything alone. If you're spotted, just run for your life. When running, try to mow down those sentries on your way before they can sound the alarm to call in more reinforcement.

Also, playing alone is another good thing, since most of time players don't want to spend time looking for samples that can give you research points every 10 sample collected. It doesn't matter what kind of samples you collected, just pick them all up everytime you see them.

Research points is like the backbone of entire game. Don't spend it on just weapons, sometimes, it's fairly important to upgrade your strategams. From calling down ammo supply, to air strikes, they can be a game-chaging potential if you do it right. I suggest you save up all the research points, and don't spend any before lv 10. If you are in need of research points, then just go ahead and collect samples, but that'll be time-consuming and boring.

Now, if you wish to play Co-Op, be careful where you're aiming, since this game is fairly hardcore, that is, you can actually kill your allies even if you really want to help them take out the blasted aliens that are licking their faces. Don't ever do it. Keep in mind, this can happen to you as well, if aliens are very close to you? Just run and reload, so your allies can eliminate the threats.

However, I must say... this game is kind of just ""That's it"". Really, just that's all the game it can offer you. You're there to do the same things over and over, just RNG give you different objectives. But it's basically like this, Host looks for a proper landing zone, then finish the objectives, then survive about 1 and half minutes for extraction, then hop on aircraft to end the match. That's pretty much it all about. 

If you ever want to feel the excitement of being overrun, gun and run, then this game is for you. Double the excitement, or even triple it or maybe quadriple it, if you got friends to play with.

[*]Completing a hard misson only to lag out either because the host ""Migrates Client"" or it just boots you out.
[*]Getting teamkilled (granted this is a part of the game but sometimes when there is chaos all over the screen the entire team can get wipped out due the combination of team killing by accident and enimies swarming you.)
[*]Having to defuse a mine field: one of the many odjectives you must complete in HELLDIVERS is defusing bombs in a mine field. I hate these with a passion. You have to slowly walk around and search in an area for bombs and defuse them while enimies wander over and attack you. Not only is it difficult but you can spend way to much time looking for them (my friend was looking for the last mine for 10 minutes only to find it in part of the decoritive terrain)
[*]Your cahracter positioning their gun the long way (turning in a circle towards target but taking the longer circular movement)
[*]Getting kille because you and the other player(s) are to far apart causing the camera to focus more on one and not the other.

Later ended up being nearly two years or however long it precisely was. Several large updates for the game and a whole bunch of minor DLC. Hell might be as good place as any to just hop in. This game is when you cross Magicka with Alien Swarm and douse it in Starship Tropers vibe. In short it's a gem. 

The game on surface level is extremely simple. This is a twin stick shooter you play with up to four people. On missions you have various objectives you need to do, usually hold area for a little bit, defend objective, interact with objectives and so forth. You pick your weapon, your special perk and four slots for strategems (they function similar to magicks in magicka). Off to the races right? Yes and no. This game is deceptively involved. There is quite a lot of depth, tactics and strategy to this. Different weapons will perform differently against the three enemy factions. The HUGE amount of strategems offered really gives room for some inovative and crazy gameplay. Call down air strikes (of various flavors), drop down vehicles or mechs, call down special weapons, support UAVs and whatnot. There is just so much in here to contemplate that made me really giddy with toys that blow shit up.

Then you get to the difficulty. On lower difficulties you will stomp everything, on harder difficulties you face different enemy types from the faction forcing you to have specific properties in your gear. Be it anti tank, bug spray, or whatever. Harder difficulties become both tactically challanging and they also become far more hectic...which leads to a lot more of the good ole team killing shenanigans. If you played Magicka or Alien Swarm you will know well how that goes. My first mission ever in multiplayer here I ended up dying in the first 10s by a person joining my game and dropping down on my face. Thankfully just like magicka, reviving a teammate is simple and easy.

The game has a different design than what you expect. At all times there is a galactic campaign ongoing. This means you can end up joining at the end of one where there isn't much to do (or unlock). Still the cycle is pretty quick (few weeks) so you get your chance eventually. Completing any mission earns standing, and standing is used to progress the ongoing campaign.  

Unlocking stuff is done two ways (besides the DLC items).Leveling your character and completing planet's set of missions. Completing planets gives you new rewards (usually extra xp, strategems, cosmetics and so forth). If you complete one mission and you still have more to do and you leave, when you come back the sector might be completed from the campaign, however your game will allow you to complete the planet, which is really nice.

The game overall forces you to play in multiplayer if you want to finish all the content . You CAN solo it, but looking stuff up like that ends up pretty crazy. It takes specific gear and really knowing the game inside out. So you are more than encouraged to play with others. If you are looking for a singleplayer game, this isn't really it. You can do it, but game design isn't primarily intended for such. Anyway the reason to complete content originally is to progress your character, get better gear, get research points and upgrade said gear. There is a TON of it and it will take a long ass time to max it all out. However don't look at the game that it is the main goal. Main thing here is to play the game, first and foremost. Just doing missions is what this game is about. I find it easy to pick up and put down. I can probably leave this game for however long and just hop back in and have a blast (just like magicka).

This game is worth the price tag, especially on sale. It is far more than a simple twin stick shooter, and there is many of those out there. This game offers a challenge, incentive to get better and satisfaction in doing so. It is tactical, humorous and hectic. Easy to pick up and put down. It's a simple blast with little downsides to what it does. As long as you don't expect it to deliver something outside of its scope this game should give you a laugh, liberty and plenty of freedom.",1498885437,1499029085,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game is difficult, you can play alone, although it is not so fun, and it's true that only certain difficulties (the missions have an indicator where you can see the enemies and the difficulty) high difficulty missions are impossible to face alone. When you overcome missions and objectives you gain experience to raising the rank of your character and then unlock weapons, stratagems (request support, orbital attacks, vehicles, mechs, yes mechs!...) abilities, visual elements ... this things can also be unlocked with certain objectives, like conquer a planet. You can also upgrade weapons with new features. The thing is you have many things to continue playing.
There a galactic map and every battle of  every player count to an online global, when some number of battles are won the player can access to a bigger battles against epic bosses.

You summon objects from the sky, they kills enemies and your team mates half the time. You'll die from team mates more often than enemies in most cases. Difficulty ranges from easy to insanity. The biggest selling point for me is the satire/idiocy the game takes, I love the 'extreme democracy' kind of stuff. Overall I'd give it a 7/10. I'm sure there are plenty of people who could sink hundreds of hours into this, but the variety just isn't there for me. There are 3 races which you can fight against, each is a little different in how they'll approach you for combat, but the rule is the same, you can't hold out forever. You have to focus on objectives which are either, take & hold, escort (awful), disarm bombs (fun actually) and briefcase run (CTF basically). The objectives are simple, the gameplay is simple but slick. The real issue I have is the levels, really there are only 3 environments and every mission is a randomly generated re-hash of one of those. Even with ALL the DLC included, I just didn't feel like there was a lot of potential there. If I had some friends who were into it, maybe, but as it stands while I did enjoy the experience (and I previously got this on the Ps4), I just realized it wasn't worth the price tag for me, but I'm sure this could be a fun addition to plenty of peoples collection.",1498558511,1498558511,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Such a simple game yet somehow you just keep coming back for more because it is SO MUCH DAMN FUN... There's so much to do and unlock and every mission plays out randomly with different difficulties so you never know what you're going to get into. 

The community so far has been very helpful when you ask questions, they have a great sense of humor, knows how to have fun, and they don't mind helping you get what you need. In terms of progression it is great, there really is no ""best"" weapon or perk, it is ALL situational which I think is awesome because it means that you have a reason to unlock EVERYTHING. 

The 4-player CoOp is drop in drop out so there's no annoying ""host-migration"" whenever someone leaves or joins... The matchmaking is really simple to use and even has a filter to adjust parameters, making it easier to find a match you want. Friendly fire is permanent so if you're an elitist, this game is NOT for you because if you aren't killed by the enemy you will die to a teammate and it happens so often that you have no choice but to laugh it off...

If you're looking for an action-packed, insanely fun, mayhem fest of a shooter to play with friends or even alone, give this game a shot.

At first it seems booring as fuck, until you reach easy dificulty (dificulty 3). Then it starts getting interesting.

The mp is well populated, and its a caos because of the friendly fire, you might call an air strike and kill 3 of your teammates and then die and lose the entire mission, but its ok because you can hear them scream on the mic.

The game crashes to the point it is unplayable (at least for me) unless you play it on safe mode.

_______________________________________________________________________________

The game content is good, it has a good variety of diferent weapons (long range/medium range). 
It has perks and weapon upgrades, which you earn as you progress. 
It also has unlockable skins like borderlands.
A lot of skills to choose. (Support skills such as ammo packs, defensive skills such as a defensive turret and agresive skills those that will surely kill your friends too).

_______________________________________________________________________________

Missions sometimes feel repetitive, but each one can be compleated on diferent ways, there never is one way to finish a mission.

You have 3 races to fight agains, each with its unique type of enemies.

________________________________________________________________________________

Friendly fire is everywhere, when you drop you can kill your allies, when you call for ammo packs, for a turret EVEN WHEN  EXTRACTION SHIT COMES YOU CAN DIE. But this isn't a bad thing, this is what makes helldivers such a good game, what makes it funnier.

________________________________________________________________________________

Just remember, the tutorial is booring as fuck, the first 2 dificulties are also booring as fuck, then the game starts to get interesting. To make things even worse, the first 2 dificulties don't give any xp (almost) so you might be stucked there half an hour or maybe an hour. But at least the missions are short.

+Friendly Community, i met and made friends with good people here. But rude players still exist here and there
+Combat is quite fun and fast paced. Enemies will spawn on your left, your right, and sometimes on top of you
+Sometimes stealth is a must, and completing entire objectives without raising an alarm feels awesome
+Loads of air and ground supports(Stratagems) to rain hell on your enemies(or friends).
+Nearly everything on the screen can kill you. Fall down a cliff, get licked to death by undead dogs, get shot by a stray bullet. Death is regular in HellDivers

-Few playerbase, it's especially hard to find a public game in Asia
-On higher difficulty, combat can be quite frustrating unless the squad understands how to assess the situation
-Once you reach a high enough level, the game can quickly become stale
-Some DLCs are mandatory to progress without a hell of an effort(All-Terrain Pack)
-Game is no longer updated with contents

When you start up the game, you're met with a cinematic explaining the setting and situation. Following that, you'll go into training, where you'll learn the basics of the game; including the fact that a small mistake can mess you up BAD. Following training, you'll be sent into the field to fight the enemy on various planets. starting off, you have only one gun: the liberator, as well as a sidearm. The liberator is a very solid weapon, and there aren't really any direct upgrades to it later on. Each of the guns is unique, even if some are far better than others. There are a few kinds of planets you can fight on, each having their own specific characteristics. snow planets will slow down your walking (except for a few small areas), forest planets have puddles of water that will slow you down, desert planets have wide open spaces and narrow canyons between mountains/hills, and volcanic planets are usually black rock with geysers of lava spewing out of them; which will damage you until you get downed. There are 3 enemy factions you can face, the Cyborgs: communist robot ISIS, the Illuminates: mysterious, technologically advanced monks, and the Bugs: starship troopers: electric boogaloo. each of these factions have different kinds of scouts, that function in similar but different ways. I'd say the Illuminates probably have the most annoying scouts, because they're really hard to see until they spot you, are un-impedded by snow and water, and can move quite quickly. Each of these factions also has different units that they send after you, with different ways of deploying those units (but each of these ways are functionally the same). The Bugs will un-burrow around you, the Cyborgs will drop in from low planetary orbit, and the Illuminates will teleport onto the battlefield. The enemies that are sent at you vary in how annoying and how deadly they are, as well as what it takes to defeat them (keep in mind that hellpods can kill ANYTHING if you time and target them right). When you're dropped onto a planet, you have a list of objectives to complete, which you can see in the map at the start of the mission. You're allowed to spawn ANYWHERE on the map, even right on top of objectives. So why wouldn't you? Because enemy patrols are more frequent around objectives, you're safer the farther you are from them. On very low difficulties, you should have no problem with spawning on objectives, but on higher difficulties, you're gonna want to spawn somewhere really isolated so you have time to get all your support strategems in. After your objectives are complete, you need to head to the extraction zone, where you'll activate a beacon that will call in a dropship to pick you up. You board this dropship simply by running into the sides where the doors are. After about 15 seconds, or when everyone is in, the dropship will take off, and you'll be treated to a victory screen, where all of your experience and statistics are tallied up, so you can jerk yourself off to how accurate you were and how many kills you got. At the end of these missions, you're sent back to the bridge of your ship, where you can spend the technology points you earn by collecting scientific samples on the missions, as well as customize you outfit and read information about the aliens you just shot, stabbed, burned, and exploded. You're then able to continue your missions on the planet you were just on, or abandon that planet, lose it's planetary reward, and move to a different one. One last bit of advice, if you see a ""retaliatory strike"" mission, do NOT go to that planet, no matter the reward. That kind of mission is basically impossible, and you will rage hard trying to beat them.",1496255632,1496255632,True,33,2,0.730888545513153076,0,True,False,False

I have encountered either people that just dont say anything, or that are friendly, thanks to it costing money so not everyone who doesn´t care at all can flood this community.
The sounds are amazing, the voicechat helps you communicate eazily with your teammates but it is not necessary as you have 4 easy accessable commands that help to express what you want to do eazily and are translated to each persons language.

In conclusion i would recommend this game to everyone who wants to have some fun in videogames, becouse this really is very fun.

dungeon defenders was able to figure out how to make it work and it came out such a long time ago. Devs cannot blame the Steam Platform.

Helldivers is a Sci-Fi top-down shooter. You play as, well... a Helldiver. Your objective: Defend Democrasy! How? Shoot aliens! Yay!

You pick a team of 1-4 and you go to a planet. Complete different objectives to complete missions. You have 2-3 mission per planet. You complete the planet, you get a reward and you add influence to that sector. Get enough influence, you launch an attack on the capital of that sector, win that, move to the next sector and eventually get to the enemy homeworld where'll you'll launch a final attack. 

That's the basics. Now to why I reccomend this. 

I could go on and on of all the resources you have avalible. In addition to your primary and secondary weapon, you have a single perk and 4 stragegem slots. Those 4 are abilities you use to call down different things from your dropship. some things include a deployable minefeild, a heavy machine gun, an auto turret, a mech, a bomb dropped by a fighter jet, an ATV, a distractor beacon... The list goes on. Now, a lot of those need to be unlocked from completing planets, but you get a few things to start. 

There's 3 races to fight and many different enemies. All races and different and are countered differently. There's a lot of diveristy in your foes. Also, planets too are diverse, from snow planets to forest and desert ones, and even urban mission in rare occasions. Lotsa different stuff.

It's 4-player, so you can bring all your friends! Also, what makes the game even more fun is that EVERYTHING can cause friendly fire. You guns do. The stragemes you drop arrive in pods at supersonic speed. If that lands on little Billy... Hell, the reinforcemnet pods and the FREAKING EXTRACTION VEHICLE all can kill you if they land on you. Fun all around!

Downsides? Weeeell, at times, the game can feel grindy. You do have to do lots of mission to get stuff. You do start with comparativly little. Once you reach the higher levels, the game I find gets bland as there's not really anything else to introduce. 

All in all? Thumbs up. Go have some fun with your friends selling Liber-Tea.

Basically the settings of enemies are copied from Starcraft so you get a wide variety of different creatures and machines to kill and destroy. Visual quality is good enough for a game like this, so 50 hours of playing and even more if you have friends is what I can guarantee.

Most of this hype was shattered quickly through clunky controls, repetitive missions and no long time reward thanks to DLCs. Don't get this game if you want to play a good Twin Stick Shooter! I don't understand, how so many people could give a positive review, did nobody ever play a good Shoot-em-up.

This review will mostly focus on gameplay, as that was the reason i got the game. The intro cinematic was kinda cheesy and interesting, but it lacks any kind of later story progression, which could have keept me interested.

The camera completely works against you. Enemy’s often see you before you even can see them. It takes at least a second, until the camera decides to follow you, and when it finally does it takes another 20 seconds. If you are lucky the camera actually shows what’s in front of you.
Furthermore the controls feel super clunky. The player walks slow and shooting and aiming makes him walk even slower than a snail. Dodging also isn't really an option. The classical combat roll is replaced with a move, where the player goes prone and is even more likely to get shot. 
And whoever had the brilliant idea to add turn speed to a top down shooter, should get fired.
Shooting also just doesn't feel right. Weapons in your armoury are just statistics, that barley explain enough what it actually does. Then, when you go into a mission, you are limited to one gun and a mostly fixed pistol. This makes the actual gameplay monotonous, even if you have unlocked a buttload of weapons.
The idea of being able to send down further equipment and airstrikes sounds kinda cool, but its execution is mayorly flawed. You have to initiate a combination of arrow presses in form of an Quick Time Event. It greatly slows you down when use a new equipment don't know which combinations to press and when you learned and remembered them, it is just an annoyance. I thought the gaming industry realized 2010, that a large amount of QTE, are really bad.
The DLCs also killed any reward that progression would have brought. It killed any long time fun for me. If you truly want to get DLC for Helldivers, wait until you reached a higher level, before you get any DLC.
Multiplayer is also more of a hassle than help. The camera doesn't zoom out if players move into different directions making enemy’s outside your view even more of a problem. This also forces you to bunch up, but then you are more likely to cause friendly fire. You are also more likely to die to your friends than to enemies most of the time.
Oh, and the game also needs precise D-Pad input. This makes playing it with a standard Xbox 360 controller, which most people i know have, really punishing and adds unneeded difficulty.
The missions also get repetitive very quickly. After one or two hours, you've seen all variety the game has to offer. Most missions are just different kinds of walk from point A to point B, where you then have to do one of the arrow QTEs. The mission may be described differently, e.g. activating anti-air cannons, or blowing up alien nests, but completing them always needs a QTE at its core. Although there are three different enemy races, the game throws every different unit of the races at you at once, meaning after the first mission with every race, you have seen them all.

TL;DR: Don't expect a great twin stick shooter from Helldivers, maybe you can get some fun out of it in local couch co-op . And don't get DLCs after you completely sure you like the game.",1493713316,1493713815,False,4,0,0.424860298633575439,2,True,False,False

No queues, no wait, just action and destruction. 
I compare this game to warframe in many ways even tho it's different in view / abilities... mainly since warframe has the same 4 man team aspect and repeating challenges to do. I love how this doesn't require you to grind one planet all the time to unlock everything, also gives you the ability to reset everything to starter gear even tho it's not exactly needed.

You might get bored but i highly suggest getting a group through this game, find people with voice and use it well as this games inbuilt voice is perfect, has volume levels for each person and doesn't cause issues.

Pros--
Missions last 12 mins usually so fast gaming
I can play this game while downloading without lag..
I youtube this stuff
Great for making friends
Low requirements
Cheap
Fun
Decent graphics

Cons ---
Many people don't use any communication in game... some don't type or speak english at all... makes it harder sometimes for me.
It's not on sale still...

In the middle, you will be fielding hard-earned new tools, and barking now-familiar terms. At the end, you will be in sync, moving as one, calmly cutting down swarms of enemies, taking objectives amidst hails of shrapnel, and fading away as reinforcements arrive to crush you.

The music, visuals and attitude are infectious in a darkly sarcastic way. This game understands Verhoeven's Starship Troopers, and adds a dash of far-out Warhammer style.

There are so many good design decisions. Many things are unlocked by filling your XP bar, but strategems, the most significant, are behind sets of missions that you must complete - you actually have to accomplish something.

The controls are unbelievably polished for a top-down shooter. The turn rate and easing, the acceleration and momentum, it all gives your character weight. It's remarkably natural to take off the laser sight, and start aiming by feel. The vehicles are fun exaggerations of this.

The gear progression is cleverly laid out like an invisible tutorial. Whether from experience or from missions, new stuff arrives in a logical order, slowly increasing the skill, risk, and reward. And for the most part, it is skill and risk that rewards you - the overall power progression is fairly flat. You do get more powerful, but only if you can use your ever-more dangerous tools competently, and in combination. Entry-level gear never gets obsolete. That makes the co-op extremely flexible between new and experienced players.

The difficulty is really well paced, as you can choose what (hardness) level to play almost straight away.  I would strongly recommend playing the training mission, even if your an experienced gamer.
There's 3 different races to play against, the harder the level of planet you choose, the tougher the enemies are that will spawn.

The maps and missions are procedurally generated so you cant refine a route and repeat it endlessly, unless you keep failing the level.

My only major gripe is the DLC, currently £16 for all the items if purchased together or £36 if bought seperately.
In particular the ""all terrain boots"", make playing snow levels a completely different experience, and are only available through DLC.
The cynical part of me would think that this is a deliberate pricing plan targeted at younger players (I'm presuming it matches the console pricing).
Although i was able to finish a ""Helldive"" level 12 mission and a Boss battle I think I was carried by the players I was with due to them having much better gear than myself.

The game really shines in multiplayer, games can be set to public, private or freinds (so only your steam contacts can join).
Although you have health (and can equip shields) most things are insta-death,  (there is also a pick-up system ala L4D).
Lose focus for a second and you walk under some equipment that gets inserted from orbit: insta-death, shoot explosives too close to yourself: insta-death, fall off a ledge: insta-death, etc.
In single player you have a set number of respawns, increased as you complete objectives in the map.
In multiplayer your comrades can call down reinforcements (respawns), effectively unlimited as long as someone is alive to call it.

So much fun to be had I will probably overcome my skinflint gene and purchase the DLC!

In HELLDIVERS, you are some kind of Spacemarine/Starship trooper (And yeah the reference here is clearly visible), sent to conquer alien territories, bring democracy and defend your homeland ! For this purpose: Guns, vehicles, mecha and stratagems (some kind of special powers: Missile strikes, special guns, vehicles etc...) !

But be carefull as HELLDIVERS follows the same gameplay as Magicka: Team killing, crazy control combinations and funny situations. 
The more you play, the more equipment you get and the more options become available to complete the missions given to you on the different planets of the galaxy, located within three different territories: Bugs, Cyborgs and Illuminates. Each land has its own set of enemies that will progressively become stronger as the difficulty will be also increasing !

Useless to say that the game is mainly multiplayer oriented. But if you do not have anybody else to play with, do not worry as the systems has a matchmaking system through which you can join any party in-game and complete missions. I would definitvely suggest to join a party, as the gameplay becomes much more interesting and creates several funny and epic situations while battling hordes of enemies when completing objective !

Helldivers is a twin stick shooter originally released for playstation, then later that year ported over to PC. As a result, it is a game that was designed with console in mind. Thankfully, the PC port is great, as I use keyboard and mouse and love mostly every minute of it.

When you first get into Helldivers — with the exception of the tutorial, of course — you are on your ship. From your ship, you can use the Galactic Campaign screen, where you launch missions from; the Armory, where you upgrade your gear; and the Encyclopedia, where you'll find information on enemy types you've encountered. The Encyclopedia doesn't really tell you anything you don't already know. You can also talk to your crewmembers, but they're even less useful than the Encyclopedia and are mainly just there for flavor. This part of the game is much like Warframe.

As mentioned, you launch missions from the Galactic Campaign screen. This is the part of the game that feels a bit like Planetside 2. The map is separated into thirds. One third is the front against the bugs, one third is the front against the cyborgs, and one third is the front against the illuminate. Each faction has their own types of units, so you'll have to use different tactics for each one. Once you select a faction, you're given a selection of 12 planets, one for each difficulty level (difficulty goes from 1 go 12.) Fret not, for when you complete a planet on difficulty 3, for example, it will be replaced with another planet of the same difficulty. There is also a boss planet that you can assault if you gain enough influence (Influence is gained by conquering planets as mentioned.) On this map, the community is working together to complete missions, push the enemy back to its homeworld, and eventually win the war. The enemies are periodically pushing towards our homeworld as well. I don't know what happens when the war is won or lost, but I don't think it really matters that much.

Your lobby settings can be set to Private, Friends, or Public. On Public, any player in the game can see your in-progress game and join in. You may be thinking, ""Uh oh, griefers."" but I haven't seen a single griefer so far, so I wouldn't worry about that. What I will tell you to worry about is being crushed by a player when he joins in because they drop out of the sky in hellpods. If you set it to Private, joining your game is impossible, even if you deploy an SOS beacon, which apparently makes people more likely to join your game.

[h1]Now to get into the actual gameplay.[/h1]

Gameplay in Helldivers is a LOT like Alien Swarm, which is free, so if you want to get an idea how the game looks and feels, Alien Swarm can give you a general idea. The way missions are handled in this game is AMAZING. I've never experienced anything like it before. The way it works is, you are dropped onto the planet you selected, you have a few objectives you need to take care of, and the enemy doesn't know you're there. Each map is procedurally generated, which adds replayability. You select the place in which you'll drop, and the further from the objectives you drop, the less patrols you'll encounter. That said, you'll want to drop far from the objectives, especially on hard missions, so that you'll have time to deploy your strategems. Strategems are support you can call in while you're on the ground. These are called in by holding CTRL, entering a code, and throwing a beacon to designate the drop zone. You can bring up to 4 strategems with you. For example, my standard loadout is Resupply, Humblebee UAV drone, LIFT-850 Jump Pack, and EAT-17. [url=http://helldivers.gamepedia.com/Stratagems]Here's[/url] specific information on each strategem. I mentioned the fact that the enemy doesn't know you're there, well this game has a bit of a stealth mechanic. As mentioned, the mission area has patrols. Patrols are generally pretty easy to avoid if you're either by yourself or with a good group, but they're also pretty easy to kill before they can call for help. The stealth mechanic in the game goes as far as not alerting patrols, which is pretty fulfilling in its own right. If a patrol calls for help, the alarm doesn't last the entire mission, it only results in a short — but generally annoying — confrontation with enemy reinforcements.

The general theme of the game is hilarious. It's basically a spoof of the ""Freedom, democracy, kill dirty commies"" trope. I mean, your home planet is Super Earth. One of the loading screen tips will tell you to report your neighbor if they lift because that is suspicious behavior and they could be a cyborg. You'll often find your character yelling things like, ""HOW ABOUT A NICE CUP OF LIBERTY?!"" and ""FREEEDOOOOOOOOOOM!"" when killing aliens. It's pretty hysterical.

[h1]Now to get into the problems with the game.[/h1]

Helldivers is a great game. It does what it does very well and the following are mainly just knitpicks. The game's multiplayer features a shared camera, which means that your entire squad of up to four people are on the same screen, like in Magicka (Made by the same developer). This is great in that it forces the squad to stick together, however, this is also terrible in that you'll find yourself being spotted by patrols that you can't see despite them being practically in melee range. It's good that the squad can't separate, but it's terrible that your view distance suffers as a result.

The other problem I have with the game is that there is a good amount of weapons and equipment behind a pay wall in the form of DLC packs. It didn't concern me, because I got the Ranger pack and that had pretty much everything I wanted (Sniper rifle, UAV, and the Ranger outfit). The thing is, even though I would have probably gotten the pack just for the Ranger outfit, the sniper rifle and the UAV should be in the base game. I mean, that sniper is pretty much the only genuine sniper rifle in the game. The only other weapons in the sniper section of the weapons menu is a WW2 weapon and a got damn rail gun. Also, the UAV is too damn useful to be behind a pay wall. The UAV dramatically increases your sensor range and can be upgraded to detect objectives and [url=http://helldivers.gamepedia.com/Research]samples[/url], the latter of which are very valuable.
