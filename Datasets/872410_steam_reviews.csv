Much better than my expectation. I played version II long time ago, and recently played Total war 3K and Civ6. This game series is always unique, charming, and has its own style. It brings me back to good old days with some additional feelings from other mentioned games.  

Game play and design is probably the strongest point. I appreciate tons of game mechanics that rarely found from other games in the same genre. The aesthetics, graphics, character designs, and map details are also superb. It can compare to Total war 3K, and I also found many points it is even better.

Almost every entry has some abuseable cheese that makes the game trivial. I think this is the first one in this series that really made me appreciate the finer points of the stories and strategies of this period. And the main mechanic that accomplishes this is: the concept of a supply line.

All units on the field have to be connected by a continuous path of hexes in your color to your city. If ever that line is broken, by a fast enemy raid for example, your units are thrown into disarray and are easy pickings. Suddenly, you can't just rely on Guan Yu or Zhao Yun alone. While they can do the heavy lifting, you have to protect your flanks with all the other lesser officers. This means that there is actual strategy in battle, not just a measure of larger WAR stat. A late game showdown really invokes the scale of conflict which Zhuge Liang and Sima Yi clashed in, hundred thousand men a side, with the threat of encirclement and counter-encirclement. 

This is not a character RPG, like 13, but neither is it a tactics grind like 11. This is a game that invokes the imagination of the great strategists. You can snatch cities like Zhuge Liang took Nanjun from under Zhou Yu's nose. You can lay a cunning trap to burn your enemies overwhelming force, like in Chi Bi.

-Historic events. It has decent historic events to it that most of us enjoy, but are rather difficult to get all of them trying to do a long play through and is still missing a good chunk of historic events.
-Character customization is pretty great. Customize your backstory, your skills, (if you pay) you can make items for your characters to give you an edge. Ontop of that you can even make family trees and make it so if they have the same skill they will deal more damage together.
-Simplicity. It is rather simple to play, and not overly challenging which is a good thing but can also be seen as a con.

Negatives.
-Diplomacy. Really isnt much you can do. You can ally with someone but that's really about it.
-Simplicity. While I said it was a good thing that it was simple, The only thing in combat you can really change is your formation and skills. Everyone is basically infantry or potentially siege weapons.
-Unit controls. You can mess around how you please but when you start a month you have 0 control. Beat up the enemy and forgot to change a setting while you were trying to defend an area? welp your unit is going home now.
-City building. It is so bland. Every city is almost the same and hold the same function. Build it up to provide income, food and troops.
Things I wish it had.
-diplomacy options. 
Alliance options: attack this person, help defend this place.
Vassels;begin recognized as a power in the country would be nice sometimes (lol) They provide you with minor resources or offer help defending your territory if you get attacked and are close...or if in the month when you have 0 control they offer minor assistance like breaking your confusion or low moral moments.
-Combat. The simple rock paper scissors. Infantry, cavalry, archers (and siege weapons) would at the very least make it so you have to think a little more.

I think Koei needs to scrutinize what users want to develop in the game. I would like to briefly point out two the biggest shortcomings of ROMANCE OF THE THREE KINGDOMS XIV.

First, it feels too simplified in terms of game content overall (especially administration and battles). Personally, I think the biggest advantage of the Three Kingdoms series is the detailed and complex internal affairs and combat system. However, in ROMANCE OF THE THREE KINGDOMS XIV, these fields were excessively simplified, losing the unique historical atmosphere of the era of three kingdoms and degenerating into a simple city building simulation game. If it was a mobile game, it would have received better reviews, but it is not enough to receive good reviews as a PC game.

In addition, the players' intervention elements are reduced and the game development over narrow their options and simply historical+chronological flows makes the player passive, making it easy to lose interest in the game.

Of course, like other the Three Kingdoms series, character illustrations and soundtracks are still excellent in terms of its quality. In particular, it is no exaggeration to say that Koei's Three Kingdom Series character illustration has since become the cornerstone of the later three kingdom games’ illustration made by other companies. And the positive expression of 'excessive simplicity' mentioned earlier will be 'convenience'. The simplification of administration and battle system made it easier for beginners to enter the game and increased the convenience of the game.

Nevertheless, as a fan of the Three Kingdoms series, I feel very sorry for Koei's wandering without knowing the real needs of users. Once again, I look forward to the better development of ROMANCE OF THE THREE KINGDOMS XV.",1687200649,1687200649,False,27,0,0.724023938179016113,0,True,False,False

Keep in mind, this isn't the type of one you control one officer with making bonds like X and XIII. But it does its gameplay very well, introducing control and supply line are excellent additions. While at first the more automated system for battles took some time to get used to, but seeing how certain officers can mess up commands or you have to adapt around due to their personality and negative effects it really grew on me. I have many stories of a ""Reckless"" officer pursuing an officer, which forced me to adapt my plans based off a mistake of that officer. It does make you feel like a general and having to keep track of personality traits of your officers to trust them with the situation. Which I think is different enough from ROTK XI to get a pass while being a much bigger game in scale from it. 

My biggest negative with the game is the lack of officer creation, while we have 150 custom officer slots, this is 850 less than the last game. In this game, every officer will have a use, you need plenty of trash and filler officers in your force to help build your economy and be overseers for villages. So if there was any game to have the 1000 Officer cap, it would have been this one over XIII. (Also strange since the custom portrait creator still has 1000 custom portraits. So not sure if so many officers was creating a problem with the game and they needed to adapt last minute.)

Trust me, I am the last person to defend a 70$ price tag, (Make sure to grab it on sale) this game gives you enough content with everything that the asking price is actually worth it. I do not regret spending the money on this game, and if you were a fan of ROTK XI or IX style of playing, I'd recommend it. Just keep in mind, it is different enough it is not a replacement for XI, but it is pretty darn close. For those that enjoyed the building system of ROTK XI, you'll love this one even more.

872410,139395324,76561199088805501,30,5,1553,0,1553,1683440155,"Romance of the Three Kingdoms XIV is the latest in the long line of games centered on China’s historical period after the fall of the Han Dynasty called the Three Kingdoms Period. It is a turn-based strategy game where the player develops cities and fights in battles until they have conquered all of ancient China. As a fan that has enjoyed this franchise for decades, this game fails to live up to its predecessor’s reputation and I wouldn’t recommend anyone buy it.
	I’m going to start by saying that, in my opinion, RTK XI is the best. It is the gold standard of the series for the perfect blend of city development being easily managed but still strategically difficult to maintain as well as tactical turn-based combat that could present a challenge. This game doesn’t have that. The city development is too easy with no limitations and combat is automatic, taking away any kind of strategy or fun. In past games, every turn was limited in the number of actions you could perform. Sometimes how much you could do was determined by how many officers you had or how many Action Points you received every turn. RTK14 has “turns” but almost everything is done automatic. You can assign officers to recruit troops, train them, or invest in the city as usual, except it is not part of the turn. They invest in the city, recruit troops, and train them every turn, plus you can take an action. The worst part is that there are extremely limited actions to take. I mostly just “Search for gold” but that’s all I do every turn. The action system just seems really redundant. You used to have to choose between recruiting troops or investing in the economy; build weapons or build farms; recruit officers or plot against the enemy. It just doesn’t seem like there is anything to do beyond simple diplomacy and war.
	And the war is awful! It’s all automatic. You move the pieces and the computer rolls the dice to see who wins. Special tactics occur randomly or maybe not at all. You used to be able to control one of your forces to attack a specific enemy unit but now you just hope the computer doesn’t kill you off before letting you attack. There was a city with 5000 defenders and I attacked it four times with 20,000+ troops every time and it was a no-win scenario. It just makes you feel impotent when you can’t control your armies and lose. The game mocks you by offering lots of different “formations” with many battle tactics available but then limits how many are used and randomly activates them in battle (if at all). An extra layer of battle strategy previous games had was the ability to craft specific weapons (pikes, spears, bows, horses, siege) but in RTK14 you just choose a formation; there is nothing to build and nothing to do but march and die. 
	The game does have some good points. The maps are beautiful!! Very stunning geography and the regional colors are bright and pleasing. As you own cities and outposts, your influence in the area grows and it is fun to watch your nation’s colors spread across the land. There is also one battle feature that is an actually improvement and that the ability to cut supply lines. Moving your forces between an enemy and his fort/city will cause him disruption from being cut off from his colors. It is a good idea and I wish war was more tactical so that tactic could actually be useful. 
That’s all I can say positive about this game. As a fan of the series, I wanted this to be great, but all I have more complaints, such as how something as basic and simple as the user interface is terrible. It is difficult to manage, go back a screen, or cycle between cities. It makes for a bad experience and feels more like it should be only played on a phone or tablet. Stay away from this game! Even on sale, it’s too expensive and KOEI rips you off by selling the game in pieces (no diplomacy without DLC). If you’re new to the series, go play 11. If you’re fan of the series, go play anything besides this one! Stay away!

So KOEI, RoTK 15, please give the game Harem, at least add the function of marriage and do not limit the wives you can married and also do not restrict the possibility of marrying widows or force marriage other officers/lord's wife because this is part of 3 Kingdom and as Overlord, it is normal to snatch other lord's, officers wife and that happens to what Cao Cao did.",1683824674,1683824674,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

RTK11 had been my favorite up until my PS2 disk was damaged.  I considered buying a replacement but decided to try RTK14 since it was a similar game.  Initially my impression was not great, it seemed as though there was very little to do each turn. They even took away the basic functions like training and recruiting. Although as I continued playing a decided this was a good move, I could focus on other things and the game moved much faster. I played my first scenario as Cao Caojust to learn the ropes. I was quickly expanding and maxing out troops deployments in my cities, so I decided for more of a challenge... I played Zhang Yang in the Han's Loyal Retainers scenario... which was to frustrating since I really had no good officers and could not seem to recruit anyone. I tried a desperation attack into the capital districts but was quickly squashed. I ended it there. I restarted the same scenario as Zhang Fei who start in Runan surrounded.  I started by grabbing Xinye and thought I would delay executing the Event to trigger war between Yuan and Cao but was quickly being attacked on both side by Liu Biao and Cao Cao. I triggeed the event but Cao Cao ignored Yuan Shao and continued attacking me.  I didn't last long but decided to restart... this time I hunkered down in Runan and built up my city and let Liu take Xinye. He built up his forces but left me alone to present. I stayed on friendly terms to avoid being attacked. Cao Cao however was relentless. I triggered the event right away and Yuan went at Cao with everything he had... Cao Cao was transfixed on me.  Fortunately he came in relatively small waves and Zhang Fei and Zhao Yun worked great together at defeating them. Yuan continued eating away at Cao's rear and eventualy came for Chenliu. Cao finally seemed to realize the danger and redirected his attacks there and left Xuchang undefended. I hardly had enough troops but took everything I could spare and went on the offensive, praying Liu B would leave me alone. Somehow I came through on top and finally had a decent base of operations. From there I was able to expand West while Yuan ate up Cao's realm, although I knew once he finished with Cao I'd be next.  To sum up the rest, I conquered the capitols and Hanzhong by the time Yuan was ready for me and I made an alliance with Sun Quan who was initially locked in a huge battle with Liu B with more units fighting that I would have though possible... but after losing this he refocused on fighting Yuan with me.  Without his help I would have been slaughtered, but he chipped away and allowed me to take advantage of weak points.  *oh and also found that Xun Yu is a recruiting master in this game!  He brought in some amazing officers that nobody else could,

Anyway, just trying to say that the game moves much faster than previous versions I have played.  Less micromanaging cities and more time moving troops around.  I am really enjoying this game.  I am about half done now, although I have more troops than the other rulers combined so nothing more than a mop up now.

Yeah, I've played some games that are ancient. If you wanted to ""cheat"" or just tweak the game, you learned to use a Hex Editor. But you know what? Those games were innovative and compelling for their times. The ability to role play your character(s) was basic as hell, but it was fun. When I finished playing as Liu Bei, I WANTED to go back and play as the Sun family, and Cao Cao. Same thing with Bandit Kings. I got to know Lin Chong (my favorite). But then I also played as Lu Zhi Shen, Wu Song, Yang Zhi and all the rest. The experience was basic, the graphics were basic. But it was still FUN and it kept your interest because at the time, there really wasn't anything being done that truly was much more innovative. But now, there are games like Forza Horizon and Battletech. I have hundreds of hours on Forza Horizon 4, maybe near 1000?  I have THOUSANDS of hours on Battletech. I just bought Romance 14 a few weeks back, I've been sick, so I've played about 80 hours. I already am starting to drift back to my other games, and I'm having to force myself to finish my  SECOND game in this in less than one hour bites. Because the tedium of dealing with everything myself is mind-numbing - and the failure rate for NOT doing it myself has been awful.

A few examples of issues - my warlord has 105 intelligence. She tells me that recruitment efforts will go well. But the target general isn't there 90-95% of the time, so recruitment fails. 
- I give orders to generals in the field. Sometimes they carry them out. Often they stop and SIMPLY STAND IN PLACE DOING NOTHING for nebulous reasons. Worse, sometimes, instead of following my carefully laid out orders, they decide to continue on into Shanyue territory on their own ""initiative"" - and I end up going from friendly neighbors, to at war, with absolutely no input from me.  Really, the orders system is crude and clunky.
- my Emperor got married about 20 game hours ago. So far, there has been no interaction, role play, visual novel episodes, NOTHING, with his ""wife"" except the normal officer reports. She acts like they aren't even spouses.  I don't know, but this seems very 1980's level character interactions to me. Are they supposed to produce heirs? Future officers? At least talk about the weather, or the harvests, or ANYTHING? At least once in a while? I haven't seen it yet.
- WAY too much DLC content.  Look, I get that creators need to earn a living. But instead of charging people who already bought the game for almost everything of substance they could also make the game relevant to new buyers by adding that content for free, or at least only charging only a minimal fee to those who already own the game. 
- Speaking of added DLC content, it is pretty limited. I was amazed that diplomacy was not included in the original game, but was added as DLC. I was even more amazed at how limited it is.

I love Koei Tecmo games going back to when they were just Koei. Bringing Romance of the Three Kingdoms to gamers was incredible when they first did it. Toukiden 2, which came out years ago, was an absolute blast. This review isn't meant to be angry, or simply critical to no purpose. It's a plea for Koei to return to being awesome. They are more than capable of it.

Core game is battles but there is little you can do once you have 3-4 officers for dedicated roles. Its just slow pushing enemy to gain more territory basically forever, no economy to develop, no special tactics, and very basic diplomacy. There is just not much of anything in this game.

I've played the series for a long time, and even though it's a Lord-only system as in you can't play as underlings or officers, it does a great job of flipping the script and switching things up from the past few releases. Some pictures have been reused from XII and XIII, but there's a lot more new content. I liked XII a little bit, but had to port it over from Japanese. Regardless, this game to me beats it by a long shot.

This one feels more like XI, with the hexagonal map and different towns/cities scattered over different types of terrain. They did a great job with the mountains and rivers/water bodies. You can also setup temporary bases and actually cut off peoples supply lines when you surround them! Its more like a hexagonal grab, so any territory you occupy, becomes yours! No more being forced to sticking to certain paths or routes.

There's also extensive customization and importing pictures, and you can even edit the historical officers (with a DLC), as well as make custom scenarios.

VIII was my favourite of the series, but this one is now a close second even without officer play.

I like the idea of cutting the supply lines, having tactics etc. but the implementation is wrong. This game shouldn’t be turn-based, shouldn’t have one type of unit, and a map like this.

Rot3k XI is my favorite grand strategy game and rot3k XIV makes some changes for which I don't care and it makes some changes about which I have mixed feelings but overall its been pretty good thus far. On one hand I don't like the way combat works because of the lack of control but on the other hand it does add a bit realism in that it is ultimately the commander who is in charge of the unit but I feel as though it is a net negative. I don't care for the removal of unit types or buildings but assigning certain officers to do things in certain cities on a permanent basis instead of having them recruit or perform inspections or drills on a turn by turn basis is more realistic and requires a bit more thought and consideration on the part of the player, if only they had kept facilities and units intact I'd say city/force development had been improved but overall I'd say its marginally below that found in Rot3k XI. Having to take control of the countryside is a bit tedious but is again a more realistic change and it also requires more thought and strategizing, so I feel as though its a bit of an improvement, afterall farms and markets not already existing in an area until you order their construction always rubbed me the wrong way. Plots are essentially the same as those found in Rot3k XI so no comment there. The user interface is a bit more cumbersome and less easy to navigate, not to mention it doesn't look as good imo. The music isn't as good as either. Overall I'd describe it as a heavily modified and more tedious but in some respects far more interesting take upon the Rot3k 11 formula, I'd give it a 6.5/10 based upon my first impressions.


UPDATE: I'm giving this game another shot, initially I didn't play it much longer after I wrote the review because I got bored with it but now I've gotta say that after investing more time into my campaign its starting to pick up (Dong Zhuo during the yellow turban rebellion btw). This game gets pretty good after the first 4 hrs or so of managing and building up your initially small force. I imagine the game would be immediately interesting as He Jin or Zhang Jiao. Yeah just be prepared for a few hours of slow going until you've stabilized your resource production with your resource consumption and then you can pretty easily get into the warfare. The simplifications made from previous entries are pretty contentious and I'm still pretty torn about them but the game is better than my initial assessment. Its a pretty solid 7.5/10

But I also hate this game for its sexism.

1. the personality

There are some personality that can only be selected as a female character, like ""cheerleader"" ""deadly beauty"" and ""talented women"" (not sure how exactly they translated in english version cause I played with Chinese). And this kind of personality *CAN ONLY AFFECT MALES*. I mean, I am a female, I love beauty and talented as well, why can't they disable my ability? And, why the cheerleader only cheer for males not females? Just because they don't have dicks? 

(Additionally, the legendary ""god of fire"" Zhurong didn't get ""god of fire"" as her personality. Instead, Zhou Yu got it.)

2. The option that turn off the ""female character"" at setting

I am not sure why there is a setting for this. Though it is true that during that era most of female won't allowed to join wars. But isn't it weird that kids like Cao Chong can join the wars but the historical worrier Terieu (or Zhao Shizhen) can't?

3. The ability value for female character

I mean, I can understand that most of the female character never join the wars during that period, but is it necessary to just give them an insanely low ""power"" value (again I am not sure how it translated in english version but it is just a value that describe how strong they are personally) when they did nothing wrong in the history except just didn't born with dicks? I am not sure how the ""power"" was measured, but the game just makes me feel that the dicks are definitely extra credits for power value (or, don't have dicks is a penalty). If Lu Lingqi is Lu Bu's son instead of daughter, she might be even stronger than Zhang Bao (Zhang Fei's  son), cause both of them ""inherited their father's strength"" and that was neither true historically (Zhang Bao dead when he is still a kid remember). But instead, Lu Lingqi only get 70+ strength power, even weaker than the joker Xing Daorong.

4. The art for females *ARE FLIRTING*

To be honest. when I am writing this long I just realized that is this game just made for males to enjoy? I mean, I know that some females are famous for their beauty, BUT THEY ARE NOT FAMOUS NOT FOR THEIR FLIRTING!!!!!!!
For example, Lady Fan, Zhao Fan's sister-in-law that almost married to Zhao Yun. I read about her from both Record and Romance and couldn't find any words that she offer flirting to Zhao Yun. She didn't even know him! That was an arrangement made by Zhao Fan! While the art of Lady Fan seems to tell us a story that she is a woman in love and try to attract Zhao Yun with her huge chest, and somehow Zhao Yun shows in her dear list.

And, hey, the game maker, you are living on the Earth right? Can you just open your eyes and look at the people around you, and find out that males and females are actually looking all the same? Why the drawing style for females are so different from males just like they are from the different worlds? (And just pay more attention to women's chests, who the fuck are carrying those huge things that shows in the game? That will be LITERALLY breath-taking! Not all the beauties have to be Z-cup)",1631403970,1636145986,False,184,104,0.42259138822555542,54,True,False,False

There might be an audience for it, but I can't tell you who it's supposed to be. You have far too little direct control and choices to feel like a hardcore strategy game, but too many numbers of buttons to recommend it to casuals. 

ROTK has always bounced between RPG and Empire Builder and this one 100% falls into the second category. There's no social aspects, diplomacy is bare minimum, you need to play as the ruler and work to conquer all of china. This is all accomplished through ""Delegation"". 

Each turn you give 10 orders across your entire kingdom. This could be ordering an army to march, assigning someone a development task in town, approving suggestions and so forth. The limited orders means that you will rarely be able to micromanage a situation and instead need to rely on the AI to handle the details.

But the AI sucks.
 - When conquering a land, it'll often take an inefficient path that takes two or three times longer than it needs to.
 - The AI takes priority to stop and attack, even when that means blocking a hex that your entire army needs to pass through. I had a 60K army being held off by about 6K because the AI didn't want to surround them and continued to fight 1v1. 
 - Resources seem much more limited than they do in past games and the limited orders means that you can't always request what you need. 
 - Many plots are limited to when the AI requests it.

The end result is that I keep feeling like I don't have enough control to do what I need to, but micromanaging the AI to walk on each individual tile is tedious and dull. Even the limited control is buried under menu systems as big and complex as classic ROTK.   

But I will end with one positive that I love and wish more grand strategy games would do. The War Chronicles mode (Possibly DLC exclusive) puts you in control of a specific short scenario.

No really, now just one more turn... *an hour later*

It's definitely a simple entry in the franchise thus far. I've played 10 hours today alone. In any case, I think this is meant for newer players to learn the ropes. That being said, every single entry into the franchise is different in terms of gameplay. It took me a while to understand that you could only send troops from castles (technically cities) and not towns - and as as far as I recall, no other entry functions this way. So, I often have large armies on the field which doesn't make much sense, I guess? Anyway, once you learn to play this game, it's a fairly decent addition to the franchise. 

I still believe that the best are ROTK 10 and 11 hands down. Avoid 13 at all costs. As for this entry here, it's certainly not as complex as 10 or 11, but what can you do. Still an addictive game.

If you are wondering, I got the biggest bundle PLUS Season Pass 2. In case you want most things. Otherwise, there are a few more paid DLCs, but I wouldn't bother. Except the free ones.

I honestly thought I would get that for free if I bought the Strategy pack,but unfortunately that's not the case.

Secondly, a campaign takes too long to finish, you would be bored as hell clicking next turn when most of the time you don't have anything to do but to wait. Your armies take like 10 minutes to reach a base and 10 minutes to take it, it's unfortunate that the game is so slow since in my opinion the game without this problem it would be OK.

Is this better than ROTK 12 and 13? I would say it's an improvement, but nowhere near the fun of XI/IX nor the simple yet streamlined strategy of Nobunaga's SOI. 

There are a couple of problems: the pause and play crap is terribly implemented, for such a large map with so many units consistently moving and conquering areas, you’re reduced to just cat and mouse of taking and retaking, infinitely. Once you have most of your cities developed the only way not to waste orders is to get your officers to search the damn place for a few pieces of gold.
The unit AI is pretty bad too. I usually have to relay every single movement for all units in order to keep them from cutting themselves off their own supply lines. The RPG elements is non-existent so don't get this if you're looking for that. The grand strategy of it all is mediocre at best. 

The only good thing are the graphics, That’s it now you have a billion things to customize your officer with but in the end only a few tactics actually matter things that supposedly improve your domestics is almost displaced by the amount of officers you have on hand to search the city for gold to produce more troops per turn and pushing the max out of agriculture to keep your supply lines running.

Going back to the play pause turn base mechanic, in ROTK 9 (IX) its better implemented as you have phases and it structures your actions. Here you have to do everything at the same time and when you have 10 or more cities I found myself just creating districts and letting the AI do the work as I can’t be bothered to micro manage every officer;s actions or check out my battles to just wince seeing how badly the AI cut itself off from its supply lines  or remember to reassign an officer to an area once it's been re-conquered. Oh lets not even get started on how dumb the implementation of money is, you have to move your ruler from city to city to actually use all the money available to you... There are so much more I would write but its not even worth it.

I bought it on sale with all the PUKs and Seasons passes for 60 bucks, even with all the “extra” content and expansion features, I can’t even begin to imagine the agony of the players who had to contend with the  original iteration of this title.

KOEI Tecmo if you do read this do us all a favor and just redo ROTK 11 or 9 with these graphics, improve the AI and call it a day, it's not that hard, you guys came up with the winning formula already just modernize it for the 2022 crowd.",1632883874,1632885220,False,4,0,0.561046779155731201,0,True,False,False

With RTK XIV, this has not changed. This game has confusing menus which require you to click way to many times. The concept of patrolling to gain influence is interesting, but not well made and does not bring anything good to the game.

However, please a short review to explain you some things if you hesitate.

There are 3 rivals games actually : TW3K, RoTK13 and RoTK14. All very different. If you hesitate, i direct you to TW3K that has no Red Cliff battle but that you've more chance to enjoy. Because you've much more tactical freedom in battles and let's be honest, graphics and UI are just much more beautiful.

[h1]However here are the main differences between RoTK13 and RoTK14[/h1]

[b]Victory condition notable difference :[/b]

Playing RoTK13 main mode, it's a bit like reading a summarized version of the novel, from start to end. Every scenario corresponds to a specific event, for exemple the oath under the peach tree, that asks you some mini-missions to recreate the story. For exemple increase public order in a city, or meet a specific character, gift him something and recruit him, fight a specific battle before a specific date, etc.

In RoTK14 main mode, every scenario is like a starting date that reconstitutes the current situation of the different factions at the date of this event. But the main goal doesn't change, you've to subdue the full land. In every scenario. It's just the starting date that changes, even if you can trigger some specific events that for exemple kill a character or change an alliance. But there are no mini-missions like in 13.

[b]Battles and food supply system difference :[/b]

RoTK13 battles are a bit like TW3K battles but less beautiful. 3D map. You can move your units, and use some specific tactics related to characters to use. But that's all. TW3K battles are just tactically much better. However, on campaign map, RoTK13 offers a very interesting food supply system. Your army consumes food marching or besieging, and that makes the game on campaign map extremely interesting because food production is handled at city level, not at faction level.

RoTK14 battles are almost full automatic. Once engaged, you can't control your units, they act when you pass turn. Battles are directly on campaign map with hexagons. Food supply system has been simplified, you just have to hold a continuous path from the dispatching city to your army, to supply it. This system however allows to cut supply lines, coloring hexes between base and army. And it allows to build some camps, arrow towers or traps on these hexes.

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]

- If you're short on money and can live without Red Cliff battle, and just want a game to play with and enjoy, then buy the beautiful and comfortable Total War 3 Kingdoms.
- If you're short on money but can't live without Red Cliff battle and this epic story, or 2010 drama, then buy RoTK13 on sale to recreate this beautiful drama that i loved too. Yes i know there are no Steam achievements on 13.
- If you're short on money but still 100% decided on 14, then base game + puk is better to get an enjoyable sandbox with more tactics, traits, and foreign powers to trade with.
Puk adds more starting dates too, including Red cliff battle (not in base game), and season pass 1 & 2 add even more starting dates for this sandbox. 

If you've more or less money but want to know the pass content to decide, then you can refer to this guide for the content details, because it's not very precise on the store. Whatever your choice, have fun !

I had a good review when the game first came out because this game got a great system initially with huge potential to become the best RoTK game in the franchise. However, the development team didn't deliver after two years of tweaking with the game. One major item from my wish-list never got implemented, which I think has the most important impact on the game, that is:

Late game scaling and the system of delegation of control of lands to subordinates - These two features, if perfected, could bring this game to a whole new level. 

Late game scaling:
1. Cities should have varying population cap, some city should have low population to make it difficult to use as a choke point. Some cities should have high populations to be important strategical target. Cities should not be made the same in the late game. 
2. Supply scaling with troop sizes. Current late game usually has unlimited supplies, which means larger country will inherently have overpowered advantage over small country. When playing against computer, once the human player get past the early game, capture a few cities, then the game becomes pointless (challengless). One can just push out troops constantly and win the game. It's a scaling problem.

The system of delegating control to subordinates:
1. This is a great idea, but poorly developed. There is no long term gain from delegating work to subordinates. 
2. If the system from Nobunaga 13 is implemented here, where AI general gains greater macro management abilities through controlling lands away from the human player, the game would be much fun to play in the late game. Different types of generals will govern the delegated lands differently like what's done in Nobunaga 13. It's a great feature missed by KOEI. I am very disappointed.

Overall, I think the development team focused too much on extra scenarios (many of them are ridiculous and meaningless). A fewer scenarios with a good late game system will make the game much more complete. 

After two years of patching, I think this game is still incomplete, and money wasted on meaningless updates. Therefore, a negative review. I am saying this as a loyal and hardcore KOEI fan.",1579219972,1626360402,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The majority of turns I end up with so much spare action points that I simply couldn't care after a while and this seriously hurts the gaming experience.

I played Nobunaga's Ambition and I hoped that ROTK XIV would be like that.  Unfortunately, it isn't.  This game has a lot of problems.

1) The AI is at best dumb.  I would be fine with not controlling units in battle if they acted intelligently.  However, they don't.  Mid-turn you have no control over them and they will do nothing without orders.  They will see an enemy 2 squares away and do nothing to save an ally unit in need.  I think the opponent AI is just as stupid in warfare.  However, it is the lack of intelligent or even remotely historical AI that is depressing.  For example, none of the participants in Yuan Shao's coalition even try to fight together against Dong Zhuo.

2. The warfare is broken.  Since you don't have control over the units mid-turn and cannot lead them in battle, it is really a game of who has the biggest army with the highest stats.  There isn't any thinking necessary.  The biggest player gets to steamroll everyone.

3. There is not much to do.  Sadly most turns require no action, especially late game when the outcome is largely decided.  Since it takes many turns to move armies from one city to another (I get this makes sense given the scale of the game and the technology available to that time period), you can spend a long time waiting for a battle you don't control to happen.

I could go on, but TLDR: buy or keep playing Nobunaga's Ambition it is a far better game.",1620445064,1620445064,False,14,0,0.606483995914459229,0,True,False,False

Great empire building gameplay, you can micromanage a small unit to take control of the surrounding city. This makes a lot of sense, if I'm a farmer on the edge of said city why am I going to support the new ruler if I haven't actually seen them in force. This was before the time off TV and internet, gotta spread the word your in charge. 
Supply lines are a good upgrade too, you shouldn't be able to just send troops to edge of the map without influence there.
Automation in some areas is welcome, if I put Guan Yu in charge of training then he should still be doing that job until I say otherwise. IX was made that each turn you had to do said action which after awhile was cumbersome.
My major complaint against the game is the persistent Summary screen that pops up, I find I click it away fast not caring how much I earned. I should be more interested in the screen but maybe Koei can make a tweek it to make it more interesting. 
In all I'm enjoying the game because I like IX, if you are a RPG style Rotk player skip this installment. This version is focused on the empire building aspect not specific characters.

First Full Playthrough: I decided to play ""The Yellow Turban Rebellion"" on easy to get the hang of gameplay. I picked Hegin as my ruler since he would have the best chance of winning. 
I started out aggressive and Hegin died after two duels, so I picked my best officer to rule, Cao Cao. 
It was easy after that, formed a division that did a ton of work for me. 
The game on easy is mostly a macro affair where you have enough to do wherever you want, just keep spending money every turn.
Cao Cao was emperor before the the fourth year and total ruler by the fifth.
It was enjoyable but I definitely recommend starting on normal difficulty to make it more of a challenge. 

I started a new campaign on "" Anti-Dong Zhuo"" as Lui Bei on normal and the events that trigger on this scenario are worth my purchase... It's so much fun to see how things are playing out in the story by fullfilling the requirements.

One editor function they see the need to split it into four DLCs, added together it would cost you half the price of the expansion. And we haven't even started on the pricing of the expansion which easily rivals a complete game from other publishers.

The lack of competition for KOEI TECMO in this genre probably caused this. One would think that after 14 iterations of basically the same game in the same settings they would get the basics right but boy are you in for a surprise! 

Good, well-received features from previous versions of RTK were discarded. New half-baked features are introduced to replace them. Important features like plots and diplomacy still mean very little. This is simply re-inventing the wheel and yet they fail!

The Three Kingdoms era has never been more alive or more compelling than it is in this game.  I am running a kingdom, hatching plots, and launching military campaigns and having the best time.  In this game, *fear* Dong Zhuo and his vicious generals as they spill out of their gates to wreak havoc from all directions.  They’ve never been more threatening than in XIV.

本作算是对9的升级。战略上，相对于9代，你可以对部队有一定的控制权。11代虽然可操作性更大，但其实只有蜀国的几个神有操作的意义和感觉。14代的话，能打赢就可以选择不做无意义的操作。

内政就是蹲坑，类似12代。府的接邻效果相当于弥补了“城市”这个设计不合理的地方。按照之前游戏的设计，比如全国45城，而魏国有22个城，即使有的城比南方强一些，也只能算魏国占了天下的一半，而实际上光是土地魏国就占有三分之二。14代北方的城市，尤其是长安洛阳邺，府多人多接邻效果强导致经济大于等于南方两个城，算是更真实了。

武将的设计上，本作的重点是朋友圈+个性，然后战法可以配合上述两个点。虽然当前版本还不能结拜和结婚来“定制”朋友圈，但是各势力都有很高的可玩性，比如一刀9999的 刘关张 吕张高。只有吴国略显设计不足，没有特别爽快的组合，大多数亲爱关系只有两人，水战的各种特性用处不大，在政策面前显得微不足道。还有，如果周瑜厌恶曹操刘备还勉强说得过去的话，那么大小乔厌恶曹操是什么鬼。

单挑的话，和9代一样不能操作。9代的单挑只能发生在前排，武力差得多不用看，差不多的时候，看他们先出第一刀或者暴击还是很刺激的。14代的单挑完全不合理，只要不是方圆就会单挑，那怕是文官，如果你派了护卫或者吕布出去，还是会各种翻车。看了网上的说法，原来武力和一骑决定伤害，但是君主的主义决定了攻击的欲望。怪不得后期剧本我托管时我的军团单挑都没有翻车，原来是曹睿和司马懿的功劳。刚才我的吕布跟庞德单挑被人家完爆，不说了，我这就去献祭吕布，换张辽当君主。",1579180125,1613732208,True,0,0,0.445431351661682129,0,True,False,False

Koei had started the TK genre in gaming from 1985 as a japanese publisher developing a game from chinese history thats based on the novel. They have other influences from ZTTJ, Book of Jin, SGZ(For Shu records), the japanese manga that's different to the Guanzhong novel. When the series returns to ruler play, I have no problems with that, but the audience has been divided since officer play from ROTK 13 is fun. Others love to play the ruler because of total control. With 'total control', the player has all the options an officer is restricted from. My favorite historical figure isn't a ruler(Unless his name is Sun Ce or Cao Cao), but an officer. I pick the ruler my favorite officer is employed and that's how I enjoy Ruler play. Now after purchasing ROTK 14, a game that attracts the fans of ROTk 9 and 11, I stress to acknowledge the changes and content cut from the previous installment 13......

1. The map has been down scaled for the new battle system. 

2. The battle system is too casual. I'll explain this on detail....

3. Some certain officers have been nerfed from 13. No, there are hard nerfs. Since Guan Yu's nerf is necessary for historical sakes, but someone like Chen Dao gets nerfed for no good reason other than 'balancing' or Wang Ping and Zhang Yi(or any underrated officer of late period that isn't Jiang Wei) nerfed to stay with the novel's perspective.

The battle system on 14, you deploy your units and cut of enemy supply routes to gain an advantage on capturing cities. Integrating tactics with the right combination of officers can deal great damage towards larger units and by capturing a city; there's no risk into blitzing your way through Nanpi or Xuchang and gain a huge advantage over land to stack your capital up with resources. You don't really need to initiate plots unless you want to placate a village for territorial resources. Nothing else to do than tug of war over territorial resources. Creating forts only buff defenses, they aren't used as a supply checkpoint in this game like in 13 or an extra city like on 9.  Population does not play a role in this game and you can draft and drill as much as you like while keeping an eye on your city's public order.

This game is too easy compare to the more complex ROTK 11 on Ruler play. But, Koei wants to attract Warriors fans into ROTK by dumbing down the aesthetics and fun factor that made ROTK 11 great. This game will never be ROTK 11. It tries hard to look as good as ROTK 9, but it disappointingly isn't as the whole game been scaled down.

And it took 14 games to introduce the Siege of Yijing event for Gongsun Zan's forces. It's not hard to bring this on 13 while I spent my entire life playing Zhao Yun and creating events based on that. No debates. No marriages. Where's the fun in building my officer's Int and winning a debate with Tian Feng to recruit him into my forces? Every woman in this era can't decide their own soulmate and are preset with the wrong men that ruined them(Or too good for them).  Few are the right match, but it's great to change history when it comes to marriages.(Xin Xianyang x Deng Ai, Zhang He x Wang Yi, Zhao Yun x Zhen Ji to name a few I've done on ROTK 11 and 13)

Do yourself a favor, skip ROTK 14 unless you truly are that faithful. I felt betrayed by Koei since they made their Sengoku games better than Sanguo. They given Zhao Yun's specialty fishing, FISHING!! For crying out loud, they don't treat my main man the same way they treat Sanada Yukimura! They keep staying with the novel's POV and won't risk going faithful with the records. I know the records aren't perfect there's so much biase towards Cao Cao. I can go on with my rant, but that's enough for now. My point is this game isn't as complex as ROTK 11 or as fun as 9. I play both Ruler and Officer style, but everything I loved about 13 has been cut on 14 and the PUk did not bring those features back rather give us the option to trade with Rome or Goguryeo, etc. That's boring.....

Wait for Sanguo Heroes 8(Heroes of the Three Kingdoms 8) or move on with Creative Assemble's Total War: Three Kingdoms. I thank Koei for setting the bar on TK gaming since 85, but they have turned their backs on       western fans(it's a riot...) and keep paying attention to the sales of Warriors franchises. These days it's chinese SLG on mobile platforms that's taking my attention. Farewell Koei....

Pros: 1. Best tutorial ever! good job.
         2. Good BGM.

          3. uhmm not met my expectation....

PS: I have been playing this series game for at least 15 years. 
      I do love this game but I have to say it never fulfilled my expectation after San 11. (This is San 14)

      To be honest, I really wanted to give a ""NO"" review after watching the start-film. However, when I saw the logo 三国志, I decide to give u ""Yes"". 

      Many people at my age in China would have the same feeling as I have. If you see a lot of ""No"" reviews, it actually not too much about the game itself. We just expected too much, maybe. 

well, I dont know what the heck im talking about now......hopefully you can understand. 
at the end, Thank you anyways.

I bought it because I still had faith in KOIE but not any more. I will not not buy any game from this company anymore unless you have extremely positive ratings.
I expected that this company will make some changes in the DLC but in turn, it disappoint me once again. Nothing changes and the AI are still stupid on every aspects. And I only skip all my turns until I conquer next city or spot.
In this strategy game, I only focus on 3 aspect. Which first is management of your territory, second is war system, and  the last but not least is relationship toward others empires. 
For the first part, you have nothing to do with the management. Good and bad officers make only slight differences on building the basic facility. And your officers rebel frequently even with loyalty 98 or 99. Move over, you can do nothing but searching new officers in your management. This is totally terrible experience to manage your empire. 
For the second part, battle system is a good idea on cutting the support line. But the AI who manage the officer is an idiot. The AI always make the worst choice and I cannot adjust my officers for not being so stupid. So actually the battle system is ruining the cutting support line in real playing.
And regarding to the last part, that's really ridiculous. You need to earn the great general position to operate your  deplomatic operation. What the xxxx are this company thing about? So weak empire cannot find alliance with others weak empires? 
I hope people read my experience before buying. This game doesn't worth that price.

-After complete first round of the game-
The food supply for long distance city attack, it is always be sure to get ready enough food from main city. secondly, the transporter troops (for food and gold) is highly recommended to pre-sending even before the attacked city to be occupied. 
the skill that can stun the city troops is highly recommend for city attack.

But other than that iteration, I probably played ROTK 10 and 11 the most. The former of the two is an almost role-playing style experience where you choose one officer and decide what they do day-to-day. The latter of those two follows the ruler style of play, in which you control your kingdom and make decisions to govern it. ROTK 14 is of the latter sort.

At its core this is a turn-based map painting game. The artwork of the officers is beautiful, the music is sweeping, but extremely repetitive and ill-fitting for the era of the game. The gameplay in this iteration is perhaps overly simple. Most turns are simply spent rewarding officers with cash (a term which was actually used to describe a type of money in ancient China, by the by) to keep them loyal and just agreeing to the suggestions of my officers. In battle, you tell your officers what you want them to do that turn and the AI executes it for you, which often has unfortunate results. The opposition AI seems much more reactive during the combat phase than those following my commands! A power-up kit is being released soon at the time of writing, but I don't see that there's enough in it to significantly improve the game as it is. Doesn't have multiplayer and suffers for that. 

It's not a bad game per se, it's just not very interesting, especially if you don't already have an interest in the series or time period. So for that reason I won't recommend it.",1606470507,1606470507,False,7,0,0.564203083515167236,0,True,False,False

As any ROTK fan will know its series have 2 genre of play, from an officer POV (ie: 13) and Sovereign POV (ie:10 and 14)

Sovereign is more of my cup of tea.
If you are a ROTK fan and loves play the Sovereign style like me, you will probably ENJOY this game.

Very much similar to the acclaimed ROTK 10.
With a little of addition and takeaway features.

What I felt well done
In ROTK 10, I remembered there is only 1 skill per officer.
In 14, each officer are given more than 1 skill.
Each lord has a personality which can be supplemented differently by officer domestic special ability.

Tile areas are claimed by each lord (shown in different color)
Cutting off supply line (discontinuous tiles) is interesting and matter of fact, it is a good add.

In my first game, the AI will form coalition against you when you have certain % control of China

What I felt can be improved
AI - I think they dont do searching (to look for items or officers)
DLC - Never a fan of needing to pay for DLC especially when it is already AAA pricing, or just me.

This just doesnt feel like RotTK to me anymore. The battle system was a HUGE part of this game for me. 
It feels like the new RotTK is trying to go for a totalwar/civ vibe without the commitment. 
Also, whats up with autoplay? I think its brilliant to have an option to let the computer autorun your turn for a few rounds but to not be able to turn it off, whats the point?
Last point I want to say is, for a tedious management system it sure is lacking in what you can do with it.

I have been a REAL follower of this saga for years, not posturing as many of those who say it, and I have to say that it is one of the best titles in the saga so far. Contains elements from RTK 9 and 11 and is masterfully blended with new features like the interactive map and the positive and negative attributes for each character.
Apart from that, we have 200 new officers compared with RTK 13 PUK and all the main characters have their own unique Tactics, Quotes and Speeches when deploying their units, traveling and fighting battles and duels in the map screen.

The game lacks CG movies and video events, but seriously, who cares? We will get Event Editor soon and you can watch those battle CG's in XIII. I don't see the problem.

Each faction is easily identifiable by its characteristic color and the cities' domestic development system associated to it has been a success. It seems complicated, but in reality it is quite simple and you can master it with practice and spending time. 
You put an officer in each village that surrounds each city (if you have enough) and they will begin to manage them, take possession of them, and color them for you. Thanks to that, your income of food, coins and troops will grow each turn and your general situation will improve with the collection of resources each month. 

Duels between generals are automatic and exciting because many times you don't really know who will win. It is like the sequence of an ancient Chinese war movie. 

Best of all, create your own faction and put it as one more contender to conquer China. I am really enjoying playing with myself, my wife, who is the ruler 🤣 and my brothers as generals in my army. All of us, edited with our strengths and weaknesses (reckless, unstoppable, cautious, heedless...). A great experience and a very addictive game once you get to it. 

As a negative point I will say only 2 things: The rhythm of the game can be overwhelming at times. This is mainly because at the beginning you will need to ""start"" your city, place your subordinates, conquer neighboring villages, assign them to them and put them to work, and the other is that depending on where on the map you are, you could despair with the movement speed of your units. Remember that depending on which officer you use and the terrain you walk on, your troops will move faster or slower. 
For example, it is not the same that they go by road than by high mountains. Unless you use an expert general in forests and mountains, the speed of a normal type general will be slower and will suffer somewhat more, do you understand?

In short: If you are a fan of the Romance of the Three Kingdoms, you like Ancient China, martial arts, you are a fan of the saga, you are familiar with Cao Cao, Liu Bei, Sun Jian, Yuan Shao, Lu Bu, etc., you do not mind playing in English and you like to fully personalize your generals, this game, after a while of shooting, you will love it.

As many other reviewers mentioned, this game play is simpler than the previous.  But because it's simple, it focus on one area of the game play - making strategic decisions.  What's the best timing to launch an attack to a city?  How should you spend your money - recruiting troops or building defensive structure.  Should you retreat when your city is under attack when your troops are in the middle of an attack. Rather than having the best commanders to overpower the AI, you will need to utilize your average commander to be successful.  

Even though there are not a lot of actions you can do each round, i found in the hard level, every decisions are critical and one wrong move such as didn't attach a city when you have a chance or attack too aggressive and had your food supply cut off by the enemy, could be fatal.

A lot of the previous version i could multi-task but i found i need to focus a lot more in this version. And i do appreciate the creator is trying to create platform for to experience what's being a general like.

Basically if you played other KOEI Three Kingdoms games or if you haven't.
You take control of various warlords fighting for the grand prize of China around 180-300ce range. Taking cities and gathering resources to to field armies to conquer your rivals.

Generally these games come in 2 forms, either officer play or ruler play.

This one is ruler play. You control the overall kingdom/state. Issuing orders on a weekly turn based routine. After each turn your orders for the week will be carried out in real time. Think back to ROTTK9 .  rather than focusing on your daily tasks as a single character.
I'm a fan of both methods. Different strokes for different folks

On the map depending on what the warlord you choose, created ones included. Your faction will be given a colour. Sort of to show your sphere of influence and control. Easy enough.. The more you control the more income you acquire and the more armies you can raise. The more cities you control the  more your ruler rank increase allowing you to give ranks to your officers. Allowing you to field even larger armies... That's not all the colour map control is for either. During battle and your armies are engaged. It will act as a supply line because as your units advance into enemy territory. They will shift the enemy control colour to yours...  Should you or the enemy sever the colours link to one of the villages or cites. The units cut off will suffer penalties. So, you should never let this happen. While trying to cut your enemies. Comes in super handy against battles where you are hugely outnumbered.

The A.I... that's never been a strong suit for this series and not much different here. don't want to say much about it. lol.. really the only part that makes the game suffer. in my opinion. 

Can't complain about the graphics or the sound. The work perfect for a game like this. They don't need to be over the top. this is fine.

Honestly, I grew up on Titles 1-4. Nes, SNES. All were easy to get into. I spent many childhood years playing those four titles. It was before Dynasty Warriors. It was enough fun that as a kid I read the 1300 page Novel on the war ""Romance of the three kingdoms""

One of the best parts of the game was it was 1-8 players. So you and your friend could kill all AI over time then have an all out battle.

Part 4 also let you learn skills what if you had fictional mode on, besides creating officers they would retain their skills in future games. Hence replay value.

As a kid they were easy to understand and get into. Easy to follow. And fairly easy to enjoy and win.

Then Part 6 on Ps1 they turned it into a single player game. They turned the toons into Asian looking, and made it more of a city builder game like civilization.

I got a Ps2 later but couldn't get into it as again in 6 and beyond they turned it more into a city management and long drawn out game, and well if things didn't go well for you you would feel hopeless and why waste hours playing the game.

Despite that I did buy and try 11 and 13 again they keep ramping up options and micromanagement. But in doing so make it tedious for people who don't have insane hours and want to play and learn.

This game 14 again ramps up the micro management, AI even on easy mode just beats you down, and way to much to learn and max to really enjoy the game.

I really want to return to the fun this game was years ago but hey it keeps going after older and older crowds. As I said I played 1-4 as a kid, but there is absolutely no way I could recommend this to my son or nephews. Sure they will play Dynasty warriors but not this.

Koei needs to make it easy enough for younger players and casuals, and also have options for the adult crowd that wants a challenge. As they don't have that option and its not fun like #4 I will thumbs it down.

In four you had battlefields. If you mastered skills you could change weather to sun, change wind to any direction, and burn the whole battlefield. You could change weather to thunderstorms and call thunder to nuke officers and armies. Yes, it had duels. Yes you could call reinforcements. You could cause revolts, steal officers and all easy enough for a child to navigate the UI.

There is like no real diplomacy in this game, just fight, repeat fight. To me its really a shame, Let them get an English patch for 4 on steam and that is a better buy. So yea I don't get to make a joint attack with xyz ruler to fight ABC. warlord.

I don't get a change to offer my daughter for marriage in an alliance.

Then you got officers who have 90-100 loyalty who just say ""I am not happy, goodbye.

The game needs AI, bug fixes

I could bribe officers, even in and out of battle in 4. I could cause a revolt. I could steal rice from xyz city. I could place a spy and see all officers and stats. Place them in the other rulers army and he would switch back to my side if i attacked in 6 months. Heck you could assignat officers with your spy in the enemy city. And there was no PUK ""power up package"" for 1-4. Oh yeah and cause a flood big enough to wash the whole unit off the battlefield.

In this game every ruler just attacks you. In 4, when you were close or neighbors with a ruler they always try to make friendships first. So you grew to like some. In this one even on stage one, I am Ma Teng, part of the army to help kill Yellow turbans, only to be hunted by everyone else, from turn 1.

So go from 4 to 14.... and all above I can't do. Sure it looks nicer but it may as well be a mobile game. And not a user friendly one at that.

After beating the game.  All Ai rulers are hostile toward you.  There is no diplomatic screen where you can see all rulers and levels of hospitality, no at war, no marriage, no joint attacks.  May as well be Total War.  So this again makes the game combat only but no plotting or scheming.  In the early versions when you came close to other rulers they would greet you.  Try to be friends, give gifts, offer marriage, offer joint attacks.  And again it show you, you been allied for xxx years.  Or you have been at ware yyy months.  Not this one.  Feels very unpolished.
And right now there is some bug reported by many and I experienced it as well, that even officers with 100 loyalty the computer just steals from you.
 Another way its more total war and an annoyance is the raging aggressive barbarians.  Its ok to have them, but even in 4 you could select at start of game to have or not have them. Hence the game would be about the rulers and officers if you wanted to turn them off.  And even if they were on in 4, it would be an officer, that you could recruit if you killed them.  This round they give nothing just bothersome.  

After beating the game on Ma Teng, I saw in videos I watched as well as my playthrough, there are no horses or calvary.  Now this is strange as horses have been one of the three infantry unit types since one

How can you be Ma Teng faction or ancient China but no horse units.  They also took out the raise, plunder command after you win a city.  So these are two more things missing to make ir less enjoyable. 

I would also put in options or mods like turn off rice or gold depletion. Maybe officers won't leave you mod or option, once recruited. Again its not mandatory but would let the less micro management players enjoy the game and learn the UI and system, then turn them on next play through.",1583404822,1589714370,False,53,8,0.640013992786407471,4,True,False,False

This is a more modern version of 11, think it might take some of the best concepts of 13, but gone are the relational aspects of 13 i did not like.  First 8 hours and find it.. interesting.

No performance issues, might have a complaint that is does not support 32:9 aspect ratio, but does full screen and letterbox sides. You can stretch the image full screen with a lower resolution, but does not look crisp.

Update:

After near 100 hours, I would say this is the best to date. ( because of AI )

Battle: I tried my first game as starting in a corner, it was entertaining enough ( harder than other rotk games ), but became too easy. So i went to the method of a harder position and that being the ""Three Visits"" Liu Bei, then you have great generals but are surrounded. Playing this scenario has been one of the most challenging rotk situations that i have played. Not saying its impossible, but the AI is better than i have ever seen it. They will attack with a huge force and still retreat with 70,000 men if you bring too many reinforcements. The AI has never fought as wisely as this. The amount of reinforcements they bring from neighboring cites creates as much more difficult environment to take cites and much more entertaining. I liked rotk11 but it was very predictable and easy AI, I would have to 'let the AI' take the whole map and me fight back from a couple cites to make it challenging, but still was not really, the AI would send units 'piece meal' instead of together, and this does not happen anymore.

That being said, on equal terms i do not think the AI is going to put up a awesome fight, but will fight better than any other rotk i have played. If you do give the AI a stronger postion, with having half the map or more, and you are not in a secure position than the game ( i believe ) will be challenging, at least more than any other rotk.

Graphical upgrade i do enjoy, not perfect, but better than other rotk's.

I like the loose general control more because its more realistic. Combat tactics really change when you cannot control with precision or have predictable tactical damage.

Economy is ok, not really what the game has ever been about, but does have aspects where a constantly bombarded city or core will have its population become extremely anemic. Also, cities lose economic upgrades when attacked. It is a start in a better direction in economy tactics as well.

Do not like criticizing the developers much, think it was a decent improvement all around. This is the rotk upgrade i was looking for, probably never play rotk11 again, and coming from someone that liked some aspects of rotk13, but not the officer relational or troop movement direction.

This game focuses heavily on tedious micromanagement until you lose your patience and use the macromanagement features for the AI to automate the work for you. The myriad of problems made all 12 scenarios bland and boring. I will give a concise analysis on the 3 main systems that I believe make/ruin the game: UI System, Battle & Domestics Gameplay, and Balance & AI Issues.

1) The UI System is the largest contributor that makes this game boring. The UI commands are plagued with redundant confirmation screens and unintuitive UI mechanics. Every turn, you have x number of ""orders"" you can issue but you will most likely be issuing these commands almost EVERY turn just to use them all: Search, Employ, Reward, Estrange, Placation, and Suggestions. 

""Search"" can find hidden officers, items, and gold but most of the time it will just return you duplicates of common tomes or gold. If the search does not return an officer or rare item, they should just skip the screen pop up of the common tomes they find since you will amass hundreds of. 

""Employ"" and ""Estrange"" has the ""back to square one syndrome"" where after you perform the action, you have to start clicking from the main UI tab again and scroll down the character selection list all over again if you wish to employ/estrange another officer. What makes it more painful is it does not show you which officers are recommended by your warlord in the officer list until you reach the confirmation screen, making you go back and forth between screens to check if it may be successful or not. Also the recommended officer to perform the action is not sorted by the fastest officer to complete the action. Most of the time, the action will be canceled because the target officer has become ""active""(unavailable) by the time your officer arrives.

""Reward"" is so repetitive and tedious you almost have to do it every turn or two to keep all your officers loyalty at 100 or they will start getting poached by other forces. The patch made officers' loyalty decrease at a slower rate so you don't have to spend as much gold every turn but it still does not omit the need to perform it religiously. There is a trait, ""Benevolent"" that removes loyalty degradation for officers in the same city you are governing but you cannot assign governors manually(AI auto assigns base on rank and ability).

""Placation"" is also plagued with a redundant confirmation screen. This command is so silly where you can use gold to take control of sub-cities instantly upon success. The patch decreased the success rate but it is still high. Expect plenty of back-and-forth placation plots between the AI and you.  

Lastly, ""suggestions"" is extremely useful for instant battle plots/reinforcements and to boost your domestics but since only 12 overseers can propose each turn, controlling more than 2-3 cities manually is not advised, thus promoting the macromanagement mechanics.

2) The battle mechanics and AI are extremely ""dumb"" and easy even at maximum difficulty. You can queue up movement waypoints(6 max) but you cannot queue up attacks or build commands. If your unit annihilates a unit or completes a construction, it will sit idly for the rest of the turn until you issue a new order. Some of the formations, tactics, and traits are poorly balanced. 

You can build constructions on flat areas on the map but each area has a building quota. If you build a wall, you might run out of quota to construct other buildings. The AI rarely builds anything, occasionally camps, arrow towers, and walls. You can just build mass catapults on the map and watch the AI get slaughtered by running into them but the AI rarely attacks due to poor AI domestics/troop recruitment settings. Traps also expire over time. 

Troops can also magically disappear after conquering a city. If you deploy 1,000,000 troops to siege a small city. After conquering the city flawlessly, 950,000 troops will vanish because a small city can only hold a maximum of 50,000 troops. You cannot tell your armies to return to their affiliated cities after the target city has been conquered(unless the turn ends just before the units enter the city).  

The domestics of the game quickly snowballs and become tiresome to manually govern them. You have to set overseers, recruitment, and training officers for each node(cities, sub-cities, and walls) in order to develop them. It gets dull and inefficient because you constantly have to reassign them; thus promoting viceroys for macromanagement. When the enemy AI placates(it WILL, a lot) a node or snipe it with a fast unit, you have to reassign an overseer at that node when you reclaim it. When you march an army with officers that is also an overseer, they will enter the conquered city by default so you have to reassign new overseers at the original city. This becomes so mind-numbing that it is more efficient to assign viceroys to manage areas to support you with resources and/or have full delegation of their district(s). 

3) The gameplay and balance is riddled with issues. Gold is a major balance issue. The majority of your orders, overseers, prisoners, and constructions cost gold. You can also use gold to purchase supplies if there is a merchant at the city. There is little incentive to work on agriculture unless commerce has become maxed. If you become rich, you can technically whittle down your opponents simply with actions that require gold due your overwhelming wealth.

Some formations had specialized purposes pre-patch but the Arrow formation is now vastly superior overall. Ring formation has the highest defense and says it is for ""attrition"" warfare but Arrow counters the high defense with high offense while having superior maneuverability. Attrition warfare is terrible in this game since armies consume supplies every turn. Awl formation used to be great for sniping unprotected nodes, quickly building constructions, or cutting off enemy supply lines due to it having the highest maneuverability but having the lowest stats and unable to use tactics. Since Arrow has such high maneuverability now, it can be used to fulfill that role while also enabling you to turn around to do pincer attacks. The siege formations are terrible because of how slow they are, costing you ton of supplies over time. Not great to use except against walls. The siege formations are also not ranged units for some reason, the only ranged army in this game is when using the Goose formation.

The 2nd largest issue with this game is the poor AI. The pathfinding is atrocious, your units can get stuck in a traffic jam if 2 units are trying to go in opposite directions at a narrow path. The AI seldom attacks and send very little reinforcements(if any) when one of their cities are being sieged. Sometimes they decide not to deploy a unit at all or decide to deploy all of their city's troops, leaving the city having less than 1k troops and will immediately fall on the next attack. Coalitions in this game is a joke. You won't get swarmed by units like in the previous titles and there are no feint attacks(you cannot lure enemy units to protect a city and then deploy units to attack the true target city because the AI rarely reacts).

There are many other issues with this game and many quality of life changes that could have been done to improve the user experience, but for some reason, the testers and developers seem completely blinded to them. The repetitive UI, rudimentary AI, and unchallenging gameplay is truly disappointing. I bought the deluxe edition to support the franchise and in hopes of the continuation of the series but if this is the quality one should expect in the future, with much grief and reluctance, I prefer if this is where the series end and still part ways with fond memories.",1587325857,1587325857,False,162,1,0.918792247772216797,16,True,False,False

I have to keep trail and error to get the desired result. the intelligent factor of person does not seem matter at all in the battle.

Just too much information popup at the same time.

Koei has improved many of the core mechanic and making it better and less tedious, and AI is more challenging than the older games.

Still, even though it is overpriced, this game is worth the $$$ in my opinion because there is no competition, nothing can satisfy my Koei historical sim craving like how Koei historical sim does. I have played every single RotK fames since 4 (except 5) up to 13 and I have to say 14 is easily the best entry in the series overall. 

The AI plays in a much more logical manner, for example if you attack Liu Yong 23000 men troops, at least 16000 of them will be lead by Taishi Ci, if you attack Ma Teng then you will face Ma Chao with most troops, then his other decent general like Yan Xing, and if you attack Gongsun Zan you will face most of his troops led by Zhao Yun and himself (unlike old games where the AI loves to waste troops on trash generals). Skills and strong generals feel much more balanced instead of outright broken, gone are the OP general with few troops easily destroying 100000 enemy troops.

Make sure to play on Hard with ""suggestions"" disabled if you want a ""fair"" difficulty. On Normal difficulty, you actually cheat and earn more income then the AI, and suggestions are cheating commands (like being able to confuse enemy army or reinforce your own troops out of nowhere) that the AI can't use themselves.",1582984337,1584446439,True,3,0,0.534239709377288818,0,True,False,False

Okay so, to put it plainly I recommend the game, I’ve played a substantial amount of hours of it, and I will continue to play it. I’ve had fun with the game so far. I find it is challenging and engaging; having not played other instalments of the franchise, I think it’s a fresh take on the genre. The game can be intimidating at first, but you can quickly get with the flow of things and get into, would suggest a little look at the tutorial before jumping into it. I enjoy the management of your kingdom as you grow, having to prepare your frontline cities for war by transporting soldiers and supplies to them because thankfully you can't just instantly recruit huge armies as a force has to be built and trained over a period of time. I enjoy the council system and wish it could be expanded, having different officers suggest different courses of action with different goals in mind is exciting and interesting. In saying this, I think the game does have its shortcomings. The UI isn’t the best, and provides little information about a lot of things that are happening and explaining plots/actions. Players tend to be restricted when it comes to plotting and the targeting of plots when in war, there isn’t an option for you to manually select officers you have to wait and hope one of your officers suggests actions. To sum up my woes about the game it feels like Koei has restricted us in order to release more aspects of the game in DLC, but they don’t plan on releasing said DLC. I firmly believe though that if Koei went that extra mile, put in the work they could have a game on their hands that sets a new standard for the genre and challenges the likes and dominance of Total War (CA/SEGA) and Crusader Kings (Paradox Interactive).

Unfortunately I was a bit disappointed. The lack of Multiplayer is a severe reason, it was great back in the day hot-seating, but nowadays it wouldn't be too difficult to implement internet Multiplayer. They not adding this really ruins the game big time.

Okay, so now the singleplayer part. The graphics are great, with excellent leader pictures. I fondly recognised the leaders/officers from RTK2 with HD textures instead of the pixelated p;pictures back then.
The gameplay is much the same although very toned down, no doubt for a more arcade-y feel. Back in the day, when recruiting soldiers, you would have to buy weapons seperately. Training was also done in phases and was over multiple turns. This is all simplified in the recent game.

Battles were fought on seperate maps with individual stacks. This was a system like the battles in games like Age of Wonders. The tactical battles were very enjotyable and you could use many tactics to even defeat stronger enemies (piutting units on fire, bribing leaders (which you contacted beforehand) and taking over their stack of soldiers suddenly netting you a big advantage. Great times! The battles in 14 are all on the main map, and you cannot interfere. Duels (which in 2 could be issued manually), fireballs, etc. are all done automatically. A real shame.

Conclusion is that, it is enjoyable in singleplayer (especially with the Leader/officer editor and creating of a custom empire), it is just very simplified. The lacking of multiplayer is a big negative though. The many scenarios give replayability but the lack of the tactical battles, simplified controls and million confirmation pop-ups, the game feels more than a arcade/mobile-port game than a true strategy game. I will give a recommendation, but only just. You can decide for yourself if you find the missing features a problem or not.

I doubt Koei reads this review, but if they do, it is a missed opportunity not releasing RTK2 in English, as this version was already available back in the day.

The game feels intentionally gutted, features available in older titles are removed and apparently will be added later as DLC (in game edit functions that came standard with the last few Koei games I've played Nobunaga's ambition and RTK 13) or are removed entirely (the ability to arrange officer oath/marriage events were cut, controllable duels were removed, as well as debates). Though the cut/left out features are annoying, the main issues I've had with playing this game are functionality issues: the district viceroy AIs are ridiculous (a bandit army of 1250 went unchecked by my district AI for close to 4 in game months despite outclassing them in attack, defence, morale, and troop numbers while having enough supplies to march against them). They perpetually transport supplies, gold, and troops to the player controlled districts despite being away from front lines (weakening their ability to defend their controlled cities). Monthly income reports gather the entirety of the force's supply and gold income into one report, despite having several district viceroys appointed, and not having access to their supplies or gold stores. The amount of buildings, traps, and walls you're allowed to construct is limited or removed entirely for most territories combined with outposts' inability to have troops garrisoned making defending them tedious and repetitive (AI will go straight for the outpost and avoid actually claiming territory 9 out of 10 times). The UI is clumsy (making searching for officers in your current city and cycling through to find abilities, traits, and loyalty their own sections needing to be accessed by differing sections of the UI (whereas in previous titles loyalty was displayed with stats, personality traits were displayed with skills making for a smoother experience). Everything I found taxing about this game aside, there are some desirable things this game possesses. The new territory system streamlines resource production (gold, supplies, and troops are easily accumulated), world map is the most detailed graphically ever been, portraits are very well done in most cases, battles are simplified (skills/formation determine a units capabilities, meaning there's no longer units comprised of only cavalry/archers/footman) and events can be triggered manually by accessing a list of them by UI. In this game Koei has adopted an adding by subtracting policy in this game by leaving out features only to add them via paid DLC, it's a big turn off for me since there are previous entries in the RTK series that were released as complete standalone experiences (which later had power up kits released their already excellent games even better).

I've also emailed Koei support; if they give me any relevant info on the below, I plan to update this review to reflect their response.

So, the most important thing I wish I'd known before purchasing:
This is not an RPG. You do not control a character; you control a force. There are no unscripted character interactions, and as far as I've been able to dig no new interesting relationships form during gameplay.

Less important:
Recruiting enemy Generals is currently broken.
The larger AI forces steamroll.

Early impressions now that the English translation is out - the game performs well. No stuttering at all on a medium level gaming laptop from 2018. The most important thing for fans of the series to know is that this is a game that goes back to the ruler only mechanics. Meaning that you must play as a ruler of a force instead of any officer you want. So pending the scenario you start in, you have to choose either Cao Cao, Lu Bu, Yuan Shao, Kong Rong, Liu Biao, etc etc.

Then beyond that, this game also goes back to the turn based functionality of some older games in the series. You put in your selection of orders each turn, and they get carried out in a period after you click end turn. 

Here is the long version: 

I've been playing Koei games for a long time. And everytime a new game comes out, there is never a shortage of outrage, amazement, vitriol and lots of fun gaming. 

As some people have said on the forums, this is very much a Koei Romance of the Three Kingdoms game. Koei style historical strategy games go back to the 1980's. There are old American Revolution games, two Genghis Khan games, but ultimately Koei style historical strategy has been defined by The Romance of the Three Kingdoms. 

Always at the opposite end of strategy gaming as Age of Empires and Warcraft and Starcraft and etc etc, RoTK deserves as much credit as any of the aforementioned games in the creation of some of today's contemporary strategy greats. 

Games like the Europa series and Total War owe a ton to Koei.

It's nice seeing Koei getting some success throughout gaming as a whole. They've had some luck developing musou style games for franchises like Fire Emblem and Zelda. Their musou games are very similiar in that - if you like them, they're pretty much all great. If you don't like them, well, then you might as well not bother trying. 

Koei's biggest success lately is probably their incredible work with the newest Fire Emblem game on the Nintendo Switch. It was absolutely one of last year's best games. And definitely one of the best strategy games of the decade. And absolutely my favorite Nintendo Switch game to date. \

So going into RoTK 14, there is probably more for Koei to gain than say when the 13th game came out. There is probably a bigger interest in the period of history the game is set in due to the Total War Three Kingdoms game from last year, another absolute masterpiece. 

But again - if you've never played a Koei Style strategy game, you should probably expect a big learning curve coming into this game. 

It's infinitely rewarding. RoTK 13 is one of the games I've played more than any other during the 2010's. It's an eternal favorite of mine. It brings me so much happiness that during each generation of gaming, RoTK continues to have a presence and evolve. 

And so far, I do like the ruler as only playable character adjustement. Combined with the more fixed turn based elements, it makes the game feel a little more balanced and less overwhelming. 

But again - the main thing about a game like this is just diving in and making mistakes and learning what works and what doesn't. You'll probably have to spend about 25-50 hours before you get your bearings. 

And if that kind of thing appeals to you, this is going to be one of the great strategy games from the early 2020's. 

The performance will continue to improve as updates come out. And it does come with GeForce Experience functionality. So that can help you work through any bugs you might have at first.",1583010090,1583010090,True,1,0,0.509677112102508545,0,True,False,False

I will say the game is just not too fun when it is not too difficult to conquer cities from the West of the map to the East, and North to South.

Take for example. Playing Ma Teng at North West. Hit Chang An, Hit Wan, Xin Ye, and you can reach Xiang Yang, Jing Zhou so easily. Just 4 cities separate the partial Nomad tribes to the northwest and Yangtze river at Jing Zhou is not fun. During the Spring and Autumn period, Qing needed like 2 centuries to do this. 

RTK14 is too 'small' for me. Expecting a 'bigger' more advance game now with so many series. Just compare the maps in Koei's own Nobunaga's ambition: Sphere of Influence and this game. How could the Japanese map looks bigger? The map of China in RTK is like not even bigger than Kyushu island of west Japan. It will be great for me if those little towns in RTK adjacent to major cities are each of their own province to conquer making the game bigger. I am putting a thumbs down just for this reason.

Adequate. The system is best described as a fusion of parts 9 and 11. The game is about the ruler aspect, so those wanting to play individual officers are still better off playing 10 or 8.

Unit movement is grid based, but combat and tactic or plot use are automatic. When units march, supply and gold are automatically tied to the unit's home base. As opposed to 11, this allows every unit to build structures, but are unable to individually carry gold. If you need to shuffle gold around cities, you'll need to transport via another action. Conversely, you no longer have to assign specific supply counts to each unit, making deployment a ""bit"" faster. On the topic of supply, one thing 14 does new is area control. Supply still affects unit morale, and whenever a unit passes through an area, it links a chain of supply from your home base to the unit, when the supply line breaks (e.g., when the connecting hex is captured by an enemy unit), the cut off army's morale drops, which is nice (e.g. you can cut aid another force in the field just by cutting another faction's supply line). 

Duels are sadly, automatic.

Area development is conducted by officer assignment, with the officer slowly improving the commerce, agriculture or unit recruitment of the city where the area is tied to. As opposed to all areas being tied to a specific city, capturing cores will link it to your closest city in the area, allowing you to gain income. Area development also takes an aspect from Sid Meier's Civilization, wherein the officer assigned to the area determines how fast you can automatically gain control of surrounding hexes.

Since most tasks are automatic, you'll have a number of turns where all you'll be doing is to check for officer proposals and pressing the advance turn button. UI can also need some work, as its inconvenient to have to individually check each core just to examine its development level. By default, the UI also doesn't show all the info that may help the player decide whether or not a particular action is worth carrying out. A glaring example of this is the need to shift tabs just to check the number of days it'll take a particular officer to employ a prisoner. 

The game isn't as good as 11, but is thankfully better than 13. Performance can be better but isn't a deal breaker. The music is annoying so far though. Specifically, one of the main map theme sounds more apt for pioneering in the wild west instead of conquering China.

Edit: Oh hey, there's free DLC for Atelier Ryza and Legend of the Galactic Heroes. Thicc thighs with tea is nice I guess.",1582944607,1582945194,True,43,2,0.795011460781097412,2,True,False,False

* 占了土地先画格子。（话说查询武将的画格子数值极为不方便啊，望优化）
* 委任的电脑还挺聪明。（相对而言）
* 军队的行走路线需要提前预判。（见仁见智，此机制表现其实一般但有深挖的潜力）

不足-
* 剧情做的没有诚意。（注意！重点并不是手动触发机制，要问剧情怎么算有诚意，请参考隔壁的信长野望）
* 节奏慢。50多个小时通关，游戏中才过了2年。
* 能做的事情太少且高度重复。每季度必做三件事：提案探索挖人。
* 只能花根据地的钱，导致君主最大的作用就是不断在几个有钱的城市之间来回流窜。
* 后期较为无聊，全战三国也有类似得问题。（参考下信长野望的总无事令机制可好？）
* 文官老是被敌方武将单挑什么鬼？！
* 动态立绘动作僵硬。不如花心思好好做剧情吧！
* 为啥不能调整军队阵型？（哪怕调整阵型后，军队需要原地休息一个季度也比现在好）

I want to say there was a lot of hard work put into the game and the creators of this game really made a great effort in making the warfare realistic as possible.  

I want to say some positive things about the game:  1. Being able to achieve and activate story lines. 2. A city can defend against overwhelming odds. 3. Love being able to cut off food supply. 4. Easier to convince people to revolt 5.  It's harder to complete the game fast. 6.  Making diplomacy harder.

IMPROVING THE GAME OR MAKING IT DIFFERENT THAN THE OLDER VERSIONS.
What would make this game better for a long time fan (MORE NEW Scenarios never seen or done before):  More/New Scenarios (Not re-doing old ones) like Jiang Wei making the decision at the end to save Shu near it's fall, Yuan Shang and Yuan Xi decide to kill Gongsun Kang instead of meeting a horrible fate and retake the North,  Zhong Hui actually succeeding in his revolt. Zhuge Dan's Rebellion actually succeeding, but struggling. Jin Kingdom vs. Wu Kingdom.

Another option - Being able to abdicate the current ruler to a character you like the most or plotting to ""Assassinate"" or ""plot"" to overthrow your ruler.  Many players would love this option to be a ""Regent"".  Who doesn't want to overthrow Liu Chan and setup one of his sons?? Same goes for Wu and Wei. Making a favorite character in the game more central.  I don't want it to be like Romance of Three Kingdoms 13 (Worse version ever). Keeping it simple.

优点：
+ 非常有创新性的玩法，在之前13代的基础上有很大的革新
+ 更多的突出了三国中每个人物的个性，不再是一群强将打天下，需要仔细思考队伍的组合
+ 系统可拓展性非常棒 

缺点：
- 历史剧情稍显薄弱（比如，没有赤壁之战，希望会在增强版中加入）

武将单挑无法拒绝：
和之前几代处理不一样，但是作为主君，实际上是没有办法控制前线的状况的。设置有其合理性。

劝降：
劝降可以节省后期时间。但是有些势力，比如孙坚坐拥多城，手下猛将如云，也可以被轻松劝降，稍显不合理。

It's real time strategy game which allows you to control a massive number of troops the exactly way you like!!!
Say no to unpolished Web game that is more expensive than a 3A title.

No Power kit no deal!!




Jokes aside,
It runs smoothly on my GTX980 & i5 6600k combination. But it easily crashes in an hour.
Hope it could be patched ASAP. 

My first impression is that the new 3D map is stunning, geographically accurate! 
And it feels like playing chess as you plan on your next move then observe how things change, once it's commenced, your commands couldn't be undone. It keeps you nervous with that tension. You can do a lot of tricks like instigating proxy wars or obstructing enemies'occupation of a specific territory.

Your troops can finally change formation!~ And all generals have their own characteristics , both goods and bads which make every encounter every character so different. But you don't have much control on individuals which is a huge problem. 
For example, if a general is passionate, confident but reckless, he might run into traps on his own and be sieged, no way you can help. People even get into duel that they can't win. Strategists love crashing into Lubu for duel. Just Why on Earth does it happen? The problem is you don't have full control on your generals, and AI could be insane. That's why I don't really like the way the commands are executed. 

But on the administration side, there isn't much to do, you assign guys and select between Commerce/Military/Agriculture,
That's it!!! You can't build facilities, the ""city builder"" mechanism is gone. It leaves you no choice but simple web game kinda assignments. One click assignment!!! 
Wow, this is so innovative, KOEI.

It isn't a terrible game but it really needs a major patch to improve the experience.

I just completed the game and I would say, the AI is not really great but because it is a simple game with simple mechanics, it doesn't have to be or you will in a whole lot of trouble and the game would be unplayable. 

Unlike RTK 13, its not completely a number game in a sense that... if you have more troops you are sure to win. But in RTK 13, if you command your battles personnally, you can beat ai that outnumbers you tactically, but not strategically. In RTK 14, there are only strategical battles and you have limited controls on the outcome of the game. Most battles are won based on the quality of your generals and how you deploy them. putting all troops into one general no longer makes your troops invincible. Instead, spreading out your troops between a few competent or even average generals allows you to out maneuver single generals units that may have more troops then you.

Supply and supply ling is generally more important now. Having a single general with all your troops behind him is riskier to deploy as enemies with their troops spread between a few generals can easily be out maneuvered and have his supply line cut off. Rendering his troops losing morale and fighting capability, making it easier to destroy as it will be in a temporary confused immobile state. At the same time, deploying too many troops heavily burden your supplies. Food consumption in this game is high, so if you did not stock enough food supply, you might simply lose the battle because you ran out of food.

Terrain is a major factor in this game. If you do not study the terrain of your targeted city before you launch an attack, you may end up with a huge army, running out of supply before they can even put up a fight.

But again, this is a simple game. Most skills or abilities that generals or characters can employ are randomly activated, this includes duels. So its fun to hope and wish your awesome generals pull off some feats in the heat of battles while at the same time, fear that the powerful opposing generals do the same things to your troops.

Up side is, schemes are easier to pull off with a couple of high intellect characters which add some flavor to the game. Sadly, diplomacy is shit in RTK 14. It is not as important as in RTK 13. Developing cities is made easier and there is no need to micro manage that much, but because of this,. you will find that there isn't much things to do other than searching for treasures, characters and deploying troops.

Over all, its really as I mentioned at the beginning. It s a really really simple game. Its not as character focus or dynamic as RTK 13 but its a decent game. Very addictive too one might say but there isn't any wow factor to the game play. Its simply just drawing a line of attack and hope everything will turn out good. If you ask me which is better, RTK 13 or RTK 14. I would say, I prefer RTK 14 for battles and RTK 13 for character interactions and diplomacy.",1579849359,1579849359,True,13,1,0.598147094249725342,0,True,False,False

我强烈推荐这个游戏给同样喜欢文明系列和钢铁雄心的玩家。这一代就是一款历史模拟游戏。我玩了46个小时，感觉代入感很强。

I am also in one of the mod teams for Total War - Three Kingdoms. I have played for more than 400 hours and devoted countless hours in reading historical texts, learning game mechanisms,  and designing hero's abilities. My friend is calling me to work on new updates but I could not help myself - I was so addicted to this game and I could not switch my mentality. Making a simple comparison to Total War - Three Kingdoms is just unfair - these two are totally different games. 

我同时有在全战三国的一个mod制作组里。全战三国我玩了超过400个小时，更不知道花了多少心思在制作mod上面。新的DLC一更新我就被喊去赶紧玩，好做新内容，但对我来说这款三国志14真的很上瘾。两款游戏各有优劣。你能感受到KOEI在三国志系列耕耘30年的底蕴，你也能体会到全战三国更优秀的战斗机制。简单的好坏比较是不公平的，这两款游戏除了“三国”的内核以外截然不同。


Yes, I admit there are lots of frustrations at the beginning for Romance of Three Kingdoms. Those Powerpoint slides show are annoying as fxxk and the camera shift for besieged towns severely affected my experience. But I felt the adversity of those heroes in making tough decisions and truly understood how hard it was for the weak to stand against the power. Food supply becomes the number one concern. These elements make me to think like a real faction leader.  

我玩得过程中也有很蛋疼的时候。探索失败，不能多选，还有每次镜头被残血城池多次拉扯都很影响体验。可我在游玩的过程中能体会到群雄割据的险象迭生，武侯北伐的无力回天，甚至还有251英雄集结的群魔乱舞。粮食成了至关重要的战略元素。这些体验比我在三国志11中要有趣的多。

There are lots of places for the game to improve. That is for sure. It felt shiiiiiiiiiiity when you downloaded the game and it crashed. Nonetheless Romance of the Three Kingdoms XIV deserves more than 41% recommendation at the time I am writing this review. People are getting less and less patient these days. They drop a negative comment and leave. I think this game has huge potential to surpass 11 in the long run.

Go to Nvdia Control Panel and then change ""Auto to Nvdia Graphic Card"" , I think then the game FPS will be normal

Edit : 22/1/2020 8.53 A.M.

At first , XIV didn't include marriage system , socialize and  biosystem . 
If you wanted to play this game for that , I think this game is boring 4 you.
I played Romance of the Three Kingdom from V , I feel that the best of the series is XI .
Most of the people give ""Unrecommended"" to this game , Koei made XII XIII actually not that bad. Both of them got their pros , and they made that focus on General.

XIIII is focus on Monarch . Yes , after XII XIII that Koei back to XI now.
If you like the battle (Full-auto) , the battle can easily effect by General Skills . and  Simplified Internal system.

Pros of the game:

1)  General Skills is back to easy effect a battle now!!!
2)  If all condition is done,  You can make a history happen or not , just by a click.
3)  Food is being more important in the whole series , late game if you didn't make sure the source between your city your front will easily collapse.
4)  Strategy is being more important than before , you will not just using a single troop to occupy an enemy city .
5) This definitely is a advances of ROTK (General) series  , the time you spend in the game longer , you should feel it too.


Cons of the game:


1)  Diplomatic system is too boring 
2)  Internal system look like easy BUT IS WRONG . A simple action take too many clicks to confirm. 
3)  Although you have occupied a city, you need to occupied the area outside the city then you will get 100% gold and food . 
4)  ROTK XIV is not suitable for those people who first time and don't adapt ROTK series.


Conclusion:
The Three Kingdoms actually is a good IP . And for sure it's famous. Most of the people played the series without buying , all the time waiting for cracked Version . STFU for complaining this game . If you had known that  XII XIII sales ,  you will easily know that YES Koei don't have that much budget  for Whole XIV .  
I loved Romance of The Three Kingdoms series , so I wiil buy.
But if you buying this game for CG , diplomatic system internal system  , battle system  and marriage system. I will not suggest you to buy this . XIV for now is not worth actually , I will rather you choose Total War : The Three Kingdom.
I hope future the content update in ROTK XIV will full filled that the cons now we keep talking about.

I still remember RoTK13 brought me bad impression, and some people still love it though. So, to a gameplay, some may don't like, some others may like, you just cannot frame the game the way it's presented. RoTK14 is far better than RoTK 13 in my opinion. Any English user can be confident to go for it.
If you read review, majority were complained about slow and lag in game, also no voice during game. Both has been introduced officially a way to fix it. Game goes smoothly following their instruction.
I am a strictly English language player, but I do buy and tried to figure a way to play it. So my review could be like newbie as I am trying to figure out the way I can play until English version come out.
Some links could help you:
https://www.koeitecmoeurope.com/rtk14/system-domestic.html English
https://www.gamecity.ne.jp/sangokushi14/system-domestic.html Japanese
Compare the two site parallel, you can figure out most menu function, so you can start the game with basic idea.
Also read this, the manual, use google translate work perfectly
https://www.gamecity.ne.jp/manual/JuLnHe14/jp/4200.html
I still don't understand the plot and skill detail, but that's okay, I will have a chance to on Feb 28.
Pros:
Map is awesome, battle map is now campaign map, no separation! Vast and allow you build defensive structure again. Battle mechanism is like RoTK11, just Formations is now replaced the old Troop type ideas.
Organization structure is far better, you do see a good use of all generals for your empire, not staying idle at all.
I wish Search function could be order in mass, like pick a list of those who gonna perform the search, modifiable city (destination), then send orders out. 12 orders but doing one by one is painful. 
Oh, so items from Search is cool, meaningful with bonus stat, items are not just an object for show anymore.
Cutting supplies route is a great feature! That gonna decide many generals deployed in battle better than one single tiger fighting by massive dam on single target. You will love this strategic point.
I am sure the game would be more interesting to me when I can make use of plot and skills combo among generals.
So... so far so good.
Cons? Those negative review with unreasonable demand right now ruin the spirit of the game. You guys need to be more tolerant. Don't try to compare this to Three Kingdoms total war.

Work on your optimizations, Koei. I want to enjoy this game, not to get stuck at settings page scratching my head. From the initial bunch of previews, I have high hopes for this new gen of ROTK. Don't let that optimism sink.

EDIT: For now the problem seems to lie with Koei not optimizing the game for dual GPU setups. The solution is go to your NVIDIA Settings (control panel), choose ""Manage 3D Settings"", then ""Program Settings"", add ROTK 14 and select the preferred graphics card part as ""High-Performance NVIDIA Processor"". And....

The game is still locked at 30fps, no matter how much of a powerhouse your GPU may be. :(
But I suppose the good news is you get to play the game now. 

And the fact that after so many years of gaming publishers conducting business on STEAM, Koei is still arrogant enough to not give a damn about its game reputation (with no launch update or emergent hotfixes pushed out so far), has said plenty. Some may argue that technical issues shouldn't be part of the metrics when players review the game, and I normally agree with that.

希望改进和更上一层楼的地方：希望这些方面加以改进，让三国志系列从此代开始重获新生。
1. 游戏优化，让更多低配可以游玩；
2. 武将战法很多都是武力型、智力型，能否增加统御力型、政治力型、魅力型
3. 内政建议增加内政之间的相关性，就可以极大增加内政的复杂性和可玩性；
4. 断粮是个很好的主意，而且也有很多可玩性，但断粮机制需要改进
5. 每次dlc增加一个改进主题（参考p社），适当增加可玩性内容。
6. 最希望合理定价，稳固游戏玩家和增加新玩家
7. 增加更多可玩性（p社每一代新游戏ck2， ck3）：如迷雾、战场表现等更多
希望光荣从此代开始，重回玩家心中地位。",1579144106,1579144106,True,1,0,0.417032212018966675,0,True,True,False
