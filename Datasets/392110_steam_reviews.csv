It's fantastic as it is. As a 45 year old gamer, this is one of my favourite games.
Too bad Amplitude left it in the Dust to rot, when there were still a few bugs to fix.
They completely abandoned this franchise and i am glad HumanKind was such a let down.
They really deserve to be hurt the way they hurt this favourite 4x of mine.

First off, pirates in this game are ridiculous.  They are as powerful as entire civilizations, not merely nuances or mild threats.  They pop up like crazy, and really distract from typical 4X gameplay.. and not in a good way.  Turning them off solves the problem, but then you begin to notice the other issues.  

The AI loves peace, but hates trading fairly.  The starship combat is pretty simplistic, and really just a rock-paper-scissors contest -- it does look nice, however.  The ground combat is even simpler, boiling down to simple RNG rolls.  

The tech tree is.. confusing.  It makes sense on the surface, but planned progression is really hard to do, relative to most space 4X games, and min-maxing your empire towards a particular type of win condition is somewhat discouraged by something of a golden path through the tree.  Anyone who doesn't (carefully) balance their spending is at a pretty severe disadvantage, which is frustrating when you're trying to play an empire that wants to focus, to lend flavor to your experience, and experience different sorts of playthroughs.

You could sum it up as role-playing a character in a RPG, and being forced to multi-class every couple levels, having to choose more at least half of the available classes in the game, by the end, and then... well your character kinda plays a lot like everyone else's.

The combat falls out of the tech tree in a very predictable manner, once you know it -- hence the golden path.  The AI always balances their rock/paper/scissors, so you have to as well, because going to town with just rock is going to get you defeated even if the AI seemed to be going with scissors, to begin with.  

You can't, for example, build a society that thrives on cheap, low tech ships, because balanced high-tech is weighed far above industrial might by other factors, like tiny fleet scale limitations, and other should-be-default-game-functionality which is locked behind randomly scattered aspects of the tree.  Combined with tech scaling, and simplistic combat strategy, this leads to a forced level of balanced research across the board, or you can't hope to win in combat.  Then you're forced to play by building supports for your starting species weakness, rather than utilizing their strength, and the game becomes boringly uniform.

The game is pretty easy to pick up and play, and it's nice to look at, but if you want strategic depth, and variance, you should look elsewhere.",1707122832,1707124414,False,10,0,0.579296469688415527,0,True,False,False

- Navigation , the display for ships is limited to 4-5 rows . And it scrolls by 1 row . It is a pain to find something , like 100 rows of ships .
- Navigation for constructing ""buildings"" is the same, limited to 4-5 rows . Say you have 30 different building types, you need to scroll 1 row at a time for 30 buildings . Times say 20 ""star systems"" . Navigation is painful
- AI is bad . So there is not much replay-ability once you understand the AI . Like , AI will almost always attack the empire with the weakest ""military power"" that is on its borders . So , just keep your military strength slightly higher than your neighbor and ... that is about it. You will win the game hands down 100 out of 100 games.
- Game map is totally random. So ... in this game you need like 4 end-game resources, sometimes if you are unlucky you get zero resource, sometimes you get all. This game is less skill and more  RNG/Luck
- Weird bugs, like ; mod ask you to ""accept terms"" before activating but the link doesnt work , you need to save the game 2x to save it once ; otherwise you cant save the game .

I normally play the Endless series on ether serious or impossible. But the AI in this game is insane. Does your race have a weakness? then all the AIs will some how focus on countering that and build up massive military. Does your race have insane Eco and started on a bunch of garden worlds. Don't worry the AI that has terrible Eco will produce twice as much as you on barren planets, with no Eco upgrades, and have military 5 times yours. 

Then there is the Stellaris copying. Stellaris isn't a 4X game it's a Simulator. Unfortunately Endless Space 2 took a great deal of the over complication that Stellaris had and added it to the game. Why do we need government systems? and why does it have to be a random role based on arbitrary numbers we can't see? Government types if you want to include them should have been handled the way transforming planets are handled. Which is pick and choose for what you need.

Worst thing thou is terraforming is dead. I like the options available for terraforming however not being able to terraform down, so that you can then terraform into a better planet. Or terraform into a planet that is better for your pop size in emergencies removes all strategy from terraforming.

I have marveled in the joy this game has brought me for years as it really did live up to the Sequel to Endless Legend I wanted. 

The game itself feels greater and better than even my overwhelming love for Endless legend. Much like Endless Legends, amplitude was there the whole way beside its community. I spent another numerous hundreds of hours into the complexities of Endless Space 2. While the UI very clearly fits the style similar to Endless Legend, I found this game way easier to navigate and learn, though that may be advantaged with my deep familiarity with Endless Legend.. 

Even further, like Endless legend, the steam workshop the game has the same enormous replay-ability and customization for its factions, more even I would insist. Just just like with Endless Legend, be careful though, outdated mods have certainly caused frustrations even here. To the credit of Amplitude, it feels way better than modding Endless Legend because there has been some clear work on a greater polish here in Endless Space 2.

In contrast to my review on Endless Legend, I would recomend even casual 4x players to at least take Endless Space 2 under consideration.

The base game is very bland and it alone is not enough of a reason for me to recommend it, it's like skyrim, mods make the experience much more enjoyable, but unlike skyrim, there is about no mod support at all for it.

Edit:

Ok, after over a year I tried playing this game again..

First thing I did was to go see the reviews of the new DLC.

First DLC has overwhelming negative reviews, complaints about the DLC breaking the game with new mechanics that make heroes worse.

Ok, skip that one, then next DLC.

Not only it's full price for less content than A MOD in the workshop, the DLC breaks the game, if you install it you can't colonize systems outside of hyperlanes.

And the cherry on top of all that. the game still has, after almost 2 years, the same memory leak problem, it takes TWENTY MINUTES to process a turn on a system with 32GB of DDR4 memory.

In order to have any hope of finishing A SINGLE GAME on my lifetime, it's faster to save the game, go back to the menu, load, pass turn, then once I'm finished with the stuff I want to do on that turn, I need to save the game again, go back to menu again and load, then pass turn, this time it takes ONLY 2-4 minutest o process the turn.

Stay away from this game, period.

Further edit:

Tried to play the game again.

In the time I was away from the game, they managed to break EVERY. SINGLE. MOD. including award winning mods THAT THE DEVELOPERS THEMSELVES GAVE AWARDS TO.

Do they at least point towards which mod caused the problem?

4) Ну, и да. Читинг в пользу АИ тоже бросается в глаза. А можно без этого, господа разработчики? Можно сделать лучше АИ, а не читить на всем что можно. К примеру пираты.

First thing I want to note is that there is no story campaign or anything else here, each 'game' is individual. And that's a good thing because each game takes forever. If you're a slow thoughtful player like me who likes to take in the scenery and read most of the story, one game can literally take 16 hours. It can take far less than that if you want, but you're sacrificing some of the experience to do so, and it's never exactly a fast game.

I wouldn't bother with multiplayer. If you've seen Sseth's video, you may want to, but things have changed in the years since that video. Now the only way to play multiplayer is to set up a game on Discord in the one group of hardcore nerds that play this game. They have a laundry list of balance mods they use and demand as the only way to play. Its just not fun or the same as the regular game. Also with how long this game is, even a fast game taking like 4 hours, good luck actually setting one up and finishing it without someone quitting or the game disconnecting at some point.

Endless Space 2 is great for what it is; a 4X strategic empire building game. I love all the options you have when setting up a a game, so no two runs feel exactly the same. This game has been praised here on the great graphics, music, and gameplay. It has that 'one more turn' feel, as its quite addictive to see the accumulated results your many decisions unfold over time.

One thing you should understand is that to enjoy this game, you have to make your own fun, because:

-The CPU is really, really dumb. From my second game onward, I've steamrolled the games with very few points of feeling challenged. I always play with some self-imposed rules just to make it interesting. 

-Some rules I suggest are; No economic victory, as that's way too easy to get by accident. And either no allies, or only one. If you actually ally with two or three other empires the game becomes a joke. The dumb CPUs need to band together against you to put up any kind of a fight.

-Don't focus on military might too much, because the CPU doesn't know how to wage war. They will never really threaten you, especially with ground combat. They make fleets of mid-tier ships that patrol the map, occasionally fighting you, but never pressing advantage or taking territory. They send endless scout ships around for some reason more than anything else. They also don't prioritize developing their heroes, so very rarely do you have powerful heroes to contend with.

-I recommend the Workshop item that disables Behemoths for all but the Hissho (if you have the DLC for them). Behemoths kind of ruin the game, they invalidate a large amount of the ships. Its like in Chess when you promote a pawn, 99% of the time the queen is the best option. 99% of the time a Behemoth is the best, and most boring option here. Also the CPU is completely incapable of dealing with them, exacerbating the lack of difficulty.

-Most of the DLC is good. I recommend everything except Penumbra and Awakening. I only recommend Supremacy with the above mentioned mod. The base game, or plus the music/cosmetic DLC packs, is still plenty good. I personally don't care for most of the DLC factions. I don't like playing even the popular Vaulters on single player because the braindead cpu will never find you, it's like cheating. The Riftborn I think provides the most fun, somewhat challenging game.",1704304889,1704304889,True,1,1,0,0,True,False,False

Please note that this game is more about resource/tech/military balancing, and NOT about space fights or diplomacy per se.

Some playthroughs will be easier or harder than others because of the procedural generation (seeding) of the galaxy and wild variability in AI behavior. To me that makes the game better, not worse, than some of its rivals. 

Highly highly recommend, and kudos to the dev team for constantly listening to user feedback and striving to improve their games in many aspects.

Original Review: This is a great space turn-based 4x game.  All the races have meaningful, unique mechanics that make them play differently offering lots of replayability.  The battles play out in cinematics similar to the first game, but the quality of the ship models is much higher this time around.

> Generally this game feels a step back from the developers previous games such as Endless Legend e.g. they removed ability to directly control units in combat and added nothing particularly interesting in return
> The game is very bad at explaining basic game play mechanics: keep wiki and forums close
> And even then the game is over bloated with unnecessary game play mechanics e.g. who cares about hacking?
> Illusion of choice: The game offers seemingly a lot of options... the problem is that most of them are borderline useless. e.g. in combat you can equip your ships with cool bombers and fighters, various types of cool sci-fi weapons, the problem is that they are basically extremely cost inefficient. Just slap beam on your every ship and live happily ever after
> Cool, interesting sci-factions which are attractive only on surface, their ""coolness"" does not translate into gameplay mechanics at all e.g. Cravers are supposedly scourge of the galaxy who have one goal in mind: Consume the whole world.

> Terrible, uninteresting quests (go there, fetch that etc) lot of times the game also often feels like a whac-a-mole, missed one planet of your enemy who is situated at the end of galaxy? too bad be ready to face endless hordes of enemies after several turns

At release the graphics were very demanding but on an average PC today I think you'll do very well, and the style will age very well I think. The variety of ships and races is all fantastic and mostly interesting. I definitely prefer them over Stellaris and Galactic Civ default races. I love the variety of gameplay between the races which all play noticably different unlike some other 4X games.

The part I dislike most is battle and formations. I dislike both having to unlock battle formation cards through research and only being able to pack a few at a time. Either let us pack all of them as they are researched or don't block any of them behind research and only allow us to pack a few. I'm not a game designer, so maybe my opinion is stupid on this, but that's how I feel. Not a fan. It also takes awhile to figure out the outcome of a battle based on your decision and sometimes I'm still wrong when I think I have it right. Again it might be my stupidity or it could be that the game is hard to understand here.

They have updated the game in 2023 with a new patch that makes the latest expansion, Awakening, which was previously a dumpster fire because it was outsourced by a 3rd party, a much better experience. I still consider this one optional, but I'd most definitely recommend all the other expansions. It's nice to have the extra race variety both to play and to play against.

If you're on the fence about this game and part of that reason is because this is set in space, you could look at Amplitude's other games. Endless Legend is an absolutely fantastic fantasy 4X game that plays a lot like Civilization, but the civs are very different instead of very same-y.
Humankind is their newest 4X, very similar to civilization, but between each era you have the option to completely change your civilization and your strategy. It's a great idea, but I don't personally feel like it plays well enough to want to keep coming back to it unlike my other 4X games. All in all I think Amplitude Studios is one of the best small developers out there, and I hope they direct some of their love to making more great games in the future.",1527026751,1700718356,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,1,True,False,False

 Pros.
Revolutionary UI, a real artwork. Great strategy mechanics, great lore.

Cons:
- Events are awesome in almost any game, but here they pop up so frequentlly that you get tired of reading them all and investing in their lore, so as much as the story is rich and well made, you will skip many bits of it.
- Simultaneous turn based: A great way to save time, specially in multiplayer (which I don't play). However, this mechanic comes with a nasty price: sometimes you are urged to quickly do some action in the very first seconds of the turn, in order to give you an advantage (or, more likelly, to not get toasted). In doing so, you will be in hasty, not pleasant at all, and you will quickly skip many notifications that pop up in the beggining of the turn, instead of calmly and joyfully appreciating them. A very commom example of this: You have some ships on a star system and you need to get them out of there ASAP, since the enemy fleet there is stronger. Therefore, you need to rush to get them out of there before the enemy can attack them. Gamey mechanic, destroys immersion and role playing. Also, the AI reacts on real time to some moves you make.

I still think this sort of gaming belongs to 20 years ago, it should really try to morph and evolve by attempting to incorporate more active action, by using 3D elements and real action sequences into it, kinda like a mix of No Man Sky's and a 4X or something closer to what Total War does.

The visuals are amazing, music is good
The gameplay is actually really great, with a huge verity of game mechanics and AI is not bad.
The only problem (At least for me), is that a lot of these mechanics are not very obvious, and take time to understand.
A lot of time and a lot of effort.
The key here, is to move through the turns very slowly and carefully, making sure you are in control of all aspects of the game with no exceptions.
Economy, diplomacy, hacking, research, exploring, quests, ship and ground force designer, hero assignments and their specialization, fleet composition and location, victory conditions, strategic and luxury resources, market situation, system levelups, espionage etc...

It is very easy to loose track of events and, after a few turns, the game turns into a mess. All of a sudden, you find yourself at war with most of the enemy empires, invasions start by cloaked fleets, you get a government toppled, pirates blockade your trade routs, you have no decent fleet to defend, and no economy to quickly build one...

And you have no idea why all that is happening and what to do next...

Its one of those games, that makes you read the manual

On the other hand, it removes factions that were available in the first game then sells them as DLC. The DLC is very negatively reviewed too, but from what I've seen that's down to mechanics introduced more than the faction thing. 

Ultimately, I feel like this game would be more enjoyable than the first game if they hadn't locked a number of the older factions behind DLC and then forced you to have bad mechanics in order to unlock those factions again. The DLC also seems unreasonably expensive for what is essentially a re-release of an old faction. Especially now that it's got such terrible reviews. Clearly it's not worth the price they've put it up at, and they should reduce the price to be in line with what the DLC is worth. 

Additionally, the custom factions are more restricted. In the old game you could pile any number of positive and negative traits into a faction to make them whatever you wanted. In this one you're limited to 8 traits total. Which basically means it's hardly worth taking any negative ones since they tend to only give very few points (5 most of the time) while taking up a slot. 

Finally, even when making custom factions you have to base them off a prerequisite faction and their mechanics. This means you don't really get much variety in the way the game actually plays. Whichever faction you base your custom one off will have unique researches and quests that fit their base faction. For example, I tried to play as warlike plant people, but all my story quests were about making alliances, incorporating other races, and generally being pacifist. It basically didn't work at all. So I hope you don't have any cool ideas for custom factions because they're not possible. At best you can play a slight variant of an existing faction. 

As I said, this was a close one because the actual game is vastly improved in many small ways. The first game has poor graphics (mostly due to a non-scaling UI on higher resolutions), confusing explanations, little impact from battle tactics and is just generally a clunkier experience. Oh and the pirates in the first game were hard as nails and unreasonable. So this game improves on all those aspects. All the little quality of life and balance changes are nice but they're not quite enough to offset the egregious reselling of previous factions bundled with (presumably) half-assed DLC mechanics. (Full disclosure, I've not tried the DLCs. Their terrible reviews and high price have ensured that I won't.)",1698938083,1698938083,False,2,1,0.498630166053771973,0,True,False,False

If you like war crimes, the stock market, colonization, and destroying entire solar systems with a giant space cannon, this is the game for you. It's got a bit of a learning curve but if you stick with it you'll eventually get it. Other helpful things I've learned are:

Don't even bother with alliances if not in multiplayer (which you should absolutely play with friends). AI will drag you into wars on the other side of the galaxy, be mad you cant get to them, and broker a truce when you are on the cusp of victory. Just better not to bother unless absolutely sure. 

If you are having trouble picking a faction to start with, I recommend the United Empire. It seems easy to learn with a decent power ramp up. If done properly you become a absolute titan of industry. 

The ship design mechanic has a lot of depth but the auto design function just does not seem to function optimally. Also newer ships will not use your updated weapons/armor automatically so you need to go in manually and do it yourself. Not the end of the world but it's kinda irritating.

Recently I noticed they had a recent fairly major patch and thought I'd give it another try.  I'm very pleased to say that it looks like this game is now reaching it's full potential.  

The senate system is unique in the genre and really gives the game a feeling of running an empire rather than just dictating everything.  I really like what they've done with the populations as well; you will likely have quite a diverse set of alien species in your empire by the end of a game.

Exploring curiosities has vastly improved.  Now you can get useful loot and scientific rewards (techs, ship upgrades, pops) along with the planetary effects.  This is good so that you benefit from exploring even if you don't plan on colonizing the system.

The strategic resources seem much better balanced now, giving you the ability to kit out your warships if you have access to the materials needed.

The UI is some of the best in the business.  Going from other 4x to this feels like upgrading from a pinto to a Cadillac.  It's a smoooooth ride, and beautiful to look at.

The quest system that debuted with Endless Legend is back and better than ever.  Branching decisions, good rewards, and it nicely accents the flow when going through several peaceful turns.

The art style, storytelling, faction variation, the balancing resources, the interesting research tree, systems of government and lawmaking, and many quests bring a lot to the table. However, there is a lot I don't like about with this game. Fair warning, this ""review"" will be unfair, biased, sarcastic, and will jump around randomly. It will also be straight up inaccurate at points due to my inarticulate rage.

tl;dr It's an ok game overall but a lot of the time it's annoying instead of hard and makes me want to eat kittens

Tooltips are often useless. Combat is boring and repetitive, and occasionally convoluted. Pirates just infuriate in annoying ways instead of posing an interesting threat and can fuck a playthrough by suddenly and inexplicably appearing and controlling a whole system early on, and can dominate the AI leading to a lackluster game. 
Some of the quests are just plain broken and it's clear no thought was put into them. One quest is assigned to you seemingly at random, telling you to keep a system clear of ""enemy"" ships. This arbitrarily includes scout ships from AIs you are inevitably at cold war with this early on in the game. This forces you to destroy these scout ships in attempting to complete the quest, making the AI hate your guts for another thousand years, only for one scout ship to slip through and make it to the system anyway. You've got a military fleet blockading the entire system? It can still destroy that scout ship this turn? Too bad. The quest fails you instantly despite your current ability to destroy the literal harmless, non-enemy ship.
Diplomacy is possibly the worst in any game I've ever played. I'll admit in other games if you ally with an AI it can lead to some pretty stupid decisions on their part, dragging you in. That's part of being in an alliance. You don't get any say in how the alliance is run here though. You have zero say in any of the decisions your ally makes and zero ability to veto it or even break the alliance and not go along with it. Even if you and your ally are at war with another faction, they may suddenly just declare war on another faction way stronger than you that you have a trade agreement and science agreement with, and there is no chance of mitigating the political damage. The other faction will hate YOUR guts for life and make it its mission in life to destroy you, even if you break the alliance and offer a peace treaty. If you have been losing a war and are just starting to turn it to your favor, your ally will end the war, forcing you to pay tribute to the enemy you were just about to start crushing. You will join in an alliance with an AI only for them to, I shit you not, declare war on EVERYBODY. Think of jumping in to an uber and hearing the Al-Qaeda intro theme playing.
Diplomacy isn't just bad in alliances. factions will send you not-so-subtle-at-all hint pop-ups every damn turn telling you that they'd love a trade agreement. You send them a trade request. They scoff, take a crap on your proposed treaty, shove it into your mouth, laugh at you choking on it, and then shoot your dog for daring to suggest something so stupid. Then the next turn they will take up your entire screen again suggesting they'd like a trade agreement while you are trying to move your fleets around before your enemy does in some pseudo-real-time movement kind of feature. Even if, after begging constantly for a trade or science agreement, they actually decide to accept the proposal, they will almost immediately cancel it because they can't afford it. 
If you make it to the late game and are murdering fools for being such pricks throughout the entire game, your enemies will pester you every damn turn asking for a peace treaty but also demanding half of your resources along with it, even while you are in the other room committing their immediate and extended family to summary execution and burning their worlds and popsicle stands to the ground around them. The ones that aren't your enemy at the moment are, again, *every single turn*, asking for you to join their Accords of Troglodyte Decision Making alliance so that they can immediately end all the wars you are winning, leaving you sucking your thumb wanting to just throw political etiquette and morality out the door and just murder them instead. These AI that keep kissing your shit and cum covered boots, tongue and all, were the ones murdering your scouts, taking your prospective systems early on, fucking with you at every turn, and running over your Christmas gift pet dog every New Years Eve since infancy. 
Quests can sometimes seem like they are just being thrown at you to distract you from the fact that every single academy quest node you're supposed to gain control over spawned at the opposite hick-end of the galaxy where all the six-toothed high-school bullies are squatting with their roflfleets of infant-stomping Ford pickup-battleships. Of course, visually you'll never tell the difference between a leaking dinghy and a doomfleet. The extent of fleet visualization is a single image of a ship. It ranges from small-ish ship to *gasp* big ship! How exciting. Behemoths look a bit interesting but that's as far as that goes. You will never feel proud of your fearsome armadas of military might, since it looks like a fleet of glowing space-canoes rushing towards your foes to fearsomely beat them with some sticks. 
Exploration and expansion are no better. Sending out your little scout ships to search planets around the galaxy is pretty interesting at first. However, repetitively discovering 5 titanium or 3 XP for your throwaway scout ship until an AI decides it doesn't like the paint job and blows it out of the sky with a dreadnought gets old after the second or third game, and wasting several turns to pump out a new throwaway space-Christopher Columbus got old the first time. Moving the ships around itself was a drag from the beginning, and I got irritated and bumped it up to the fastest animation setting before the first playthrough was done. Expansion is only any better because it's much more expansive, pun-intended, even if its almost as shallow. As each game progresses, building up each system becomes more and more of a chore. Before your know it, you'll be spam-clicking building options just to fill up the queue, hoping that system doesn't come back to bother you anytime soon. Of course, each system is at least somewhat unique so the build queue will, instead of a-z, be a-z but in an exciting twist, h comes before g instead of after. It all depends on whether your system consists of 5 perfect earth-like planets (not likely), or a single spherical fart cloud that's a little too warm for comfort. Visually it's not like you'll ever be able to tell the difference between your home planet that's been developing for centuries and some wild-west hobofest planet in the fringes of space. The only difference will be that your extremely developed, metropolis-matted uberplanets will have some pretty little lights on it. If you're lucky, and do a little tap-dance, some of the lights might even move! Isn't that great? No, no impressive urban planetwide cities that reach (visibly) into the skies, or fleets of satellites and space stations more visual than a firefly. Centuries of development gets you some mood-lighting. Anyway, systems have an option of assigning a construction policy I believe, but I don't trust that mechanic as far as I can throw it not to do something stupid like build wonders everyone else will get to first rather than focusing on the basics, so I stick with the repetitive micromanaging rather than letting another mechanic screw me over.
Some things about the game are either stupid decisions or just plain broken. You sign a close-borders with another faction? Well, that's great and all, but their pillagefleet is just going t",1583957231,1695760057,True,0,0,0.508574724197387695,4,True,False,False

This game has alot of potential but really falls short of the mark. It's one of those games you really want to get into but find yourself picking up and dropping quickly; but always coming back to time and time again.

Pros:
Aesthetics and Ambience - can't beat it!

Story - Great lore building and unique IMO for a TBS; decisions have real consequences long term in game play.

Fun - I mean legitimately really fun, the first time you play it's great. It's 2 -3 hours of actual ""ooh that's cool!""

Cons:

Unbalanced - Badly, once you or another civ get ahead in any area, it's game over for anyone else. Game is literally over within a 50 turns and you still have +100 to find that out, but the game goes on for another 500. There's typically a point where you're watching yourself lose and have no means of recovery; it basically kills the game at that point.

Pointless features - Once you've seen one space battle you've seen them all. It's pretty much a redundant feature once you've built large ships/had 2 or 3 play throughs. Was clearly meant to be fleshed out, but devs obviously stripped it back. Really disappointed in this.

Repetitive - At +100 turns, every game is the same, no matter what civ you're playing, no matter what your goal is, not matter what the victory conditions. It all converges on the same same style of play.

So in summary, really good game for maybe 50 turns the first time you play; and you'll always be coming back to it. But end game and progression are dead. It's a game built around an initial concept  or studio pulled the plug halfway through dev and they polished off the concept.

tip: Mod the hell out of it to make it playable for long games.

It made no sense that my ally could unilaterally decide to end the war that I started, and it was just the definition of taking away player agency. I thought it was a one-off event (or unlikely) but it happened again in a short span of time.

This means that if you want to have complete control of who you are at-war with or who you are at-peace with, you can't have any allies. And this was simply too frustrating for me to deal with.

(I hope they retcon it- which they have done before so no reason they can't again). You can pretty much skip ES1 unless you want to read the faction quests. Dungeon of the Endless is a fun tower defense on Auriga and sets up EL. Endless Legend is boring and slow af, but is a neat side continuation of ES1 and sets up the story for ES2's Vaulters/Mezari who are the apparent main characters.  The universe building is just so good and combined with the art and music create a very immersive and unforgettable time. The game itself is pretty good for a 4X, streamlined and replayable. EL is far too slow and lacks dynamic decision making. ES2 however becomes quicker and more dynamic as you near the late stages of a game. I really hope they don't let the series crumble into nothing and continue the story with another Endless Space game, it's their best.

Avoid the final DLC for sure and a couple of the others are iffy. Base game is excellent.

EDIT 8/2023: Feels like the game has been changed quite a bit. After reflecting on the game after years I think it's actually pretty mediocre. I love the Endless universe, the music, the artwork, the atmosphere... but as a game- it's pretty lousy. If you have a bad start, things just snowball. No dynamic decision making. Fun? Nah. Super RNG based, tedious for the beginning and end game, AI cheats super hard now, tons of mechanics piled on that just requires more management. Amplitude should just focus on making stories and maybe a visual novel or something because their games are boring and lackluster as evidenced by Humankind's recent failure.

The fact is that I have a real love-hate relationship with ES2, and it's almost intolerably bad without mods.  Miraculously, that actually seems to be changing as the studio hired some of the brightest minds from the modding community to help fix the game, and their work so far has finally compelled me to give a thumbs up review for the game.  Unfortunately the programmers are on a limited contract, but I hope they are re-hired till such time as all of the horrible bugs and design choices that have inexplicably remained in the code for years are fixed.  Amplitude completely lost my trust with how the release and post-release development was shoddily managed, especially with money-grab DLC content dropping while leaving so many bugs intact.  This latest move is a major positive step and I hope they continue.

Now what I do love about the game, vanilla or modded, is the general atmosphere and very laid-back feel, beyond the typical vibe a turn-based 4X game like Civ.  The music is fantastic (I even play some of the tracks on road trips), it's visually beautiful, and involves creative and thoughtful planning throughout.  The negatives with this game are impossible to ignore, especially if you have experience with other 4X games.  Civ 5 is my favorite in the genre, as I find the overly complex Civ 4 and Civ 6 to get far too tedious when you start scaling up your empire and have to deal with district placement across 30 cities, for example.  Playing this game feels like I'm on a wave shifting between satisfaction and frustration.  The UI is terrible and there are basically no hotkeys so it's almost entirely a mouse-only game.  I could go on for a long time regarding things in the game that just piss me off to no end.

Currently I own the first 2 DLC, but refused to buy the last two based on Amplitude not addressing game-breaking bugs (especially in multiplayer which is way worse).  If they continue to clean up the game as they have been with paid community help over the past few months, then I will almost certainly buy the other 2 because there really is a lot to love in the universe of ES2, and the mitigation of the bugs will allow us to feel far more immersed in that world, instead of troubleshooting another desync.",1692631844,1692632082,True,32,2,0.729476094245910645,0,True,False,False

However, just like another of the developer’s games, Endless Legend, the last DLC is terrible and should be disabled or just not purchased in the first place. The developers have finally taken action by contracting a fan to push out a patch for it three years after the DLC’s release, but in my opinion three years is a long time to hold off on basic balance patches.

For the first few matches I would recommend just playing without any DLC at all, as the game will already be a bit difficult to get the hang of for someone coming from a game like Civ 5 or 6. The game isn’t actually much more complicated, but the logic and way things are represented is very different.

One advantage of Endless Space 2 is that the different factions actually play significantly differently. In comparison to Civ games, where each leader has marginal stat differences, you are able to have very different experiences by playing different factions. I feel like the choices that you make are significant and interesting. In other 4x games it is often impossible to predict the correct next move, but in ES2 I would usually be able to make informed decisions.

The main disadvantage of Endless Space 2 is that especially with all the DLC installed, there is simply too much going on. Not that the game is complicated, the important things are actually very simple. The complicated systems that require the most tedious micromanagement actually tend to be the least important. 

You are constantly being bombarded with notifications for quests, random events, political elections, hero level ups, hacking, etc. and eventually you will realize that most of the time these things are literally not even worth clicking on compared to things like battles and research topics. This ramps up especially in the end game where there are dozens of these notifications each turn and their impact is close to nothing. I appreciate the touches that these systems add to gameplay, but when a system impacts the gameplay significantly less than random chance I’m just going to ignore it. A good example of this overcomplication is combat. I have only the vaguest idea of how combat in this game works and have literally never spectated a fight, but I do perfectly fine anyways since all the weird stat interactions don’t really seem to matter. Shields beat lasers and hull beats rockets I’m pretty sure but whatever.

Overall though, the fantastic presentation of the game makes it worthwhile to stick around. In games like these context is very important to the satisfaction of playing, and ES2 delivers on that. Compared again to Civ 6, which has extremely bland presentation, ES2 wins hands down.

I would definitely recommend ES2 if you like 4x games already and want an interesting remix of the genre, but I probably wouldn’t recommend it to a newcomer as its a little rough around the edges.

- Forced Truce sucks.  Just...yuck.
- Load/refresh times between turns are agonizingly long by mid-game, and downright painful late in long games.  This was/is an issue in ES.
- AI is very prone to unhappiness.  Numerous ""completed"" systems would rapidly trend from ecstatic toward deep unhappiness once their governor moved on, and for no discernible reason.  Massive food surpluses quickly become food shortages, and it all goes to hell from there.
- Tech Tree is more difficult to follow than in ES.  Branching & dependencies aren't clear/intuitive.
- Colonization seems much slower/more difficult to accomplish.  Takes forever to get Arid blessing, for example.
- Feels more difficult in general.  First try got my rear handed to me by Cravers by turn 30 or so on normal mode.
- Trade Company component is neat - can make sense of trade routes now, and investments in the companies return tangible benefits.
- Space battle scenes are prettier, but clunky.  Camera is all over the place, views often show nothing, ships physically touching each other...I dunno.  Needs work.
- Ground battle scenes are uninspiring.
- Hero boats are weak.  Liked it better when they were simply absorbed by their assigned fleet.
- On the fence about the relationship between luxury resources and settlements.
- Hero skill allocation table needs to show what system or fleet they are assigned to so I don't have to go back a step to check.
- Things got screwy around turn 90-ish when I purchased several improvements on a few systems.  That turn wouldn't end pending something, so I saved and reloaded.  Came back OK, but from then on ALL the improvements on all systems reported that they had been purchased and would be available next turn though they still carried their industry cost.  I could no longer purchase improvements.

I do like it overall and understand that this is in beta.  Lots of work yet to do, but they're on a good rolling start.

RELEASE UPDATE:
While there are fewer bugs and performance seems better, this thing is still in beta.  AI needs to be retooled - it's way too bipolar.  Biggest deal-breaker now is the incredible over-colonization penalty - it ruins the game.  Populations swing from Ecstatic to Mutinous and there aren't enough corrective technologies (or anything else, for that matter) available to correct it. Every system rapidly descends into mutiny and there is simply NO recourse.  Game becomes an exercise in futility at the point where your empire finds its groove and things are getting interesting, and is soon no fun to play.  Political swings are far too dramatic as well.  I suffered through the early access months (I will NEVER do that again) and things looked good initially for the release version, but it is not ready yet.  Ampllitude, you gotta fix the AI and correct the ridiculous tendency toward mutinous populous - they make the game un-enjoyable right at the point where it should be the most engrossing.  Turns it into a frustrating slog.  I won't play again until it's corrected.  Cannot recommend the game at this point.  Lots of potential, could be great, but currently broken.

UPDATE:
Played quite a bit lately after staying away for a while and happy to note that the game plays a LOT better now.  Most of what I had to complain about seems to have been worked out.  Have not tried the last two expansions.",1478493309,1691811415,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Most 4x games follow a simple formula for me, being a civ fan I didn't expect anything more or less from Endless space 2. I was wrong. From its presentation, to the soundtrack and the factions, this game is something special. It has all the frameworks for an excellent power climb to the top, while also providing quests and that presentation again to increase the player's immersion. In many ways I would call this game an empire simulator. Managing your systems doesn't get tedious, Combat information is readily displayed, and the music always kicks ass. 

One of the main staples of the game is customization. Being able to upgrade and choose almost every module on your fleets makes for some creative armadas. Not only that, but some research is mutually exclusive, meaning you need to choose one or the other, which increases the replayability of this bad boi.  Ship models and module slots vary from faction to faction, further encouraging the player to experiment and explore the game.  

I would say the greatest feature of Endless Space 2 is the accuracy in which they portray the economy, An empire can invest and trade in a variety of different ways in order to advance itself. Monopolies are difficult to achieve, and its important to maintain a war-chest of Dust and strategics before heading off on the warpath. The resulting conflict can have entire corporations (which you can form) to be cut off from the rest of the galaxy. The enemy may privateer your trade network, costing you either dust or even population in transit. The availability of Weapons of Mass destruction also play a large role in the diplomatic and realpolitik struggle.  Some enemies or potential allies you will face might be Samurai Birds, giant triangle people from the 69th dimension, cannibalistic lizard-bug-men, Pretentious Australians, Tree DUdes or Hot Lizards with massive cans and a more massive bank account, you may even be playing as any one of these or more choices. Did I mention she's got steam workshop? 

All in all, I have very few complains about this game. The Academy DLC sucks, but there is a mod to NERF them. Other annoying aspects include the hacking system, which I personally do not enjoy. I also dont enjoy the million notifications I get every turn about ""NOt HAViNg A HaCKInG OpERaTiON"". Although managing politics can be fun and immersive, it can also be straight up bullshit. You're in a war and your ally wants to unilaterally end it, where you will be having to pay a significant tribute? Well you better have a thousand influence to reject it, or you are fucked. Sometimes, the game doesn't give you a choice, and your AI companions can force a peace instantly if they have pacifist as the majority party.  This can derail an entire campaign, taking up valuable time and resources in order to get around it. 
Another issue is Ground invasions, I don't get it nor will I ever I think. I just spam tanks and the Blitz card until they all die. Seems to work, I guess I'm okay with ground troops in the game. Maybe with time I will learn to properly appreciate that mechanic. I guess its also quite annoying when other civs get ahead in the global quests, and luck of the draw on starting systems and surroundings really influences the flow of a game. 


So, just to clarify my opinions on all this sheiiiieeet.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Graphics- I like it 
Music- I love it 
Ship Design- I love it
Battles- good stuff
Empire Management- Good stuff 
Economics- Very immersive Like it a Lot
Faction Variety- Good stuff+DLC+Workshop 
DID I MENTION WE'VE GOT WORKSHOP
Hacking- BAD
Forced peace treaties- MEGA BAD 
Diplomacy- almost Ok but the Forced treaties make it kinda suck if you're playing single player. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

OVERALL SCORE; 9.3 out of 10. Might be even better than Civ V.

I had almost no bugs in my entire playtime, only once has the game stopped proceeding to the next turn while i was in a multiplayer round with a friend. But the gamwe autosaves every turn, so this really was not that big of a deal. I'm also happy that this game works (almost) flawlessly on wider aspect ratios (I use 21:9). The only tiny nitpick here being that some of the in-game cinematics get stretched, for example when settling on a new planet. As someone who came from the civ games, i felt right at home, and many systems are similar in their function.

There's so many little fiddly things and none of it makes anything interesting.  So much of the game is just busy work designed to slow things down and that's it.  There's far too many things to research, so many little things split into even more little parts to, again, just slow things down and give the illusion of progress.  Diplomacy is limited and it's pretty clear no thought went into it as the voice actor for whatever faction you're addressing will outright insult you while, at the same time, the text will have them begging for help or some such thing.

In summary I'd say that all the teams that worked on this did excellently with the single exception of the team that actually made the game part of the game.  Combat is basically a power point presentation or an excel formula, You can make basically two very minor adjustments and other than that you either choose to watch a power point or just get the results as if you'd plugged in numbers into an excel formula.  There's far more busy work than there should be which ultimately means that victory is a real pain to achieve, no matter which one you try to go for.  It's a long winded very boring game that's more about tiny incremental numbers than actual gameplay.

But it just feels half finished, despite being released 6 years ago. 

- Random early events basically wipe you out, forcing you to focus entirely on military in order to have any chance against them. 
- Pretty UI that is incredibly opaque. I didn't find a screen that let you see colonizable planets or information about systems. You have to zoom pretty far in before the UI will show you anything about a system and so you're stuck scrolling Endless-ly across the galaxy looking for hints. Maybe it is buried in the scanning screens but I find that part of the UI just very unfun to use.
-  Quests and events feels disconnected and nonsensical to the point that i stopped reading the flavor text and focus entirely on the bonus. Quests forced on you by the game result in the whole map lighting up with quest markers making it difficult to actually get to the ones you want. You'll fail a lot of quests, get used to it. The quest pane is terrible. The fact that you can only have one quest up at a time and you don't get notified for most of them at all means checking progress is tedious.
- The siege mechanic creates problems that don't exist in any other game.
- The tutorials are a nice attempt but they just don't don't do a good job. Appropriately, Game Makers Toolkit did a video about bad tutorials and kept showing footage from this exact game. I see the effort they put in, but more playtesting was needed.
- The hacking mechanic is weak. It should just be part of an espionage system. There's no way that I can see that lets me really control the paths chosen, it's just whatever the game feels like between the notes you choose if they're across interstellar gaps.
- Weird bugs. I'll blame the CTD on Proton, but the known bug with buildings no showing you what they do has been around forever. Some quests just never progress no matter what you do. No idea why.

I own all 9 of the expansions. I'm not missing out on anything here. Maybe I'll look into modding it. But I can't recommend this game. Stellaris' lore is not as fun, but the game itself is so much better.",1690076279,1690076279,False,13,3,0.529355943202972412,2,True,False,False

I originally wrote this review after ~70 hours in this game. Against my own advice, I have continued to play and now have almost 300 hours. Unfortunately, even though I have enjoyed some aspects of ENDLESS Space 2 (enough to keep playing it), most of the things I mentioned in my original review still stand. 

While I am now better at navigating things like the game's AI diplomacy system and combat, I still don't feel like I clearly understand these systems; most of the ways in which I think they work are still just guesses. (And regarding the AI, some playthroughs feel normal, and others have incredibly inconsistent and seemingly random AI behavior for no apparent reason.) 

Some advice on how to play specific factions in the game or how certain mechanics work can be found online, but a lot is still missing, and it is hard to figure out what to search for to solve a specific issue because the tutorial (and game manual) and actual gameplay does not offer a good foundation. 

If you are willing to deal with the steep learning curve and frustratingly nebulous mechanics, this can be a fun game, but I still don't feel that I can recommend it (especially for full price).


ORIGINAL REVIEW BELOW:

I really want to love this game. 

Endless Space is very pretty (great visuals, good atmospheric music), and it has a lot of really neat, complex mechanics that the devs clearly put a lot of time and thought into. 

Unfortunately, those mechanics are never adequately explained in the game's (frankly terrible) tutorial or easy to look up in game documentation, online, etc., and some of them don't seem balanced or well-integrated with each other. This means that many of the most complex strategy elements of the game feel confusingly random and don't reward thoughtful gameplay (or any gameplay). 

Want to conduct diplomacy? There's no clear way to gauge the power or resources of your opponents, and their attitudes and dialogue options are practically nonsensical, even once you figure out the opaque set of rules that governs diplomatic pressure and influence. ""I have no choice but to declare war on you!"" says one AI, before proceeding to do no such thing. If you're going to get back-stabbed, it's probably by the AI who is labeled something like ""Receptive"" not the ones who are ""Angry"", ""Aggressive"" or ""Sneaky"" (or the one who just said he was declaring war). I genuinely think there is very little correlation between AI behavior, vocal lines, dialogue in text, and attitude (as labeled by the game). Basically, assume you could be wiped out by a much stronger AI for no reason whatsoever at any time, regardless of your diplomatic efforts!

Many mechanics that are essential to even have a shot at victory on the default difficulty settings are hidden three layers deep in menus and only pointed out by the tutorial long after you need to have been employing them to have a chance of winning. I have played this game repeatedly and still struggle to locate very essential things like leveling up systems, military units, and ship designs. 

It's incredibly frustrating to carefully strategize and manage multiple types of resources and upgrades and tech trees and politics, only to watch yourself inevitably losing the game due to some other mechanic that you know exists but can't find any details on how to use even after six playthroughs. 

Please don't waste your time or money on this game.",1682302839,1688752870,False,21,5,0.548841476440429688,0,True,False,False

Solid mechanics, solid graphics, solid economics, with a distinct focus on diplomacy and government, but rather disappointing combat systems. In particular, the game lacks the detailed ""war goals"" system that they added in Humankind, and in my opinion that is for the best - when I have decided another empire needs to stop being, I don't want some arbitrarily imposed system telling me that just because I have taken over their planets doesn't mean I get to keep them.  It manages to avoid the trap of being overly detailed for the sake of detail alone, as many systems (such as transporting pops between planets and the trade systems) are heavily abstracted, which makes it much easier to play.

There are a few qualms I had with it, though.  First, the tech web does not make it easy to tell where critical techs are.  There are many techs that don't really give you much, interspersed with techs that are much more influential, and the game doesn't really do much to help you tell those apart.  The game is also very biased towards tall empires, as the approval penalty for too many settled systems is quite punishing until the late game unless you have very specific government setups or access to specific luxury resources.

In my opinion though, the biggest flaw of the game is its combat.  To me, the space combat system is very unappealing - you pick a strategy card, and you can tweak which of three ""lanes"" your ships go in, then the combat plays out on its own without you being able to influence it in any way.  The game's tutorials never explain how this works, so until I looked up a forum post explaining it picking a strategy card was a guessing game, and I'd often find my superior fleets absolutely butchered by inferior opponents solely because I picked a bad strategy.  Further, ships operate on pre-determined AI routines based on class, which you cannot change, and ship builds at even tech levels lend themselves to a simplistic RPS-style counter system, where if your ships are all short ranged with no shields you're going to get stomped by a fleet that has all energy weapons, but you can't tell what weapons ships have until you've already committed to an attack.  Planetary combat has the same problems, but the RPS system falls apart because you can discover Tanks pretty early, and setting your armies to 100% tanks will pretty much destroy everyone until someone else gets aircraft, at which point you hopefully have a tech lead on them.",1688709308,1688709308,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

Strategic gameplay is streamlined around building resources, this includes generating political/diplomatic influence. Can be described as a game about making colored points go up, and using colored points to buy/build/research things.

AI is a bit stupid, especially in the Awakening DLC, although I think that could be a design issue around faction goals. Without spoiling too much, one of the new faction goals is to convert and subsequently give away star systems to a 3rd party faction. The victim getting converted and gifted away has no reaction to this at all, no diplomatic hits on your relations etc, feels weird.

i was playing as a custom Vodyani (just to avoid all the ARK mechanics which i didnt understood very well) and after a long and gruelling multi-year war with the Horatio, i finally manage to get a hold of the cluster, driving them back through the wormhole and forcing a truce, i ended up with a few worlds filled with Horatio population, and after a few turns, they started being more... horatio.. demanding comodities, partition between themselves and others species, wanting to be recognized as ""superior"" and the like...
so i did what i considered best at the moment, i move them all to a terran planet a few systems away, entirely to themselves and only comodities to bring the luxury the Horatio deserves.
after a few turns, the Horatio population settled in this planet and praise me for my swift action against their problems, and when that happened, i freed the planet from my rule, leaving it as a free colony of Horatio, in a beautifull planet all to their own in a secluded and protected system.
then i used that planet to test my new Planet Cracker.
F*** you Horatio.
Xenocidal jokes aside, i love this game, and i tire myself of trying to convince my friends to try it.

This game has made me feel the full range of emotions: excited, smug, angry, bored, frustrated, gleeful... and although it sounds like there are more negative emotions in there than positive ones, I keep coming back to it. I keep wanting to peel back the layers and try to understand just what the hell is going on and if there is anything I can do to actually get better at this game. 

That's the hard part. Endless Space 2 has this wonderful post-apocalyptic galaxy full of lore and characters and plots... but that's all background noise to what this really is: The *most* random 4x game. Everything in this game is randomized to a degree that can make or break your run before the first turn. What do your starting planets look like, how far away is the nearest star, how far away is the nearest colonization planet, how far away is the nearest minor faction, how close is the nearest major faction... and can you trade with them or are they going to immediately declare war?  

Everything about Endless Space 2 is so randomized that watching Lets Plays or strategy guides feels almost pointless. When a YouTuber can colonize 3 highly-coveted ""atoll"" planets in 10 turns and you spend those same 10 turns exploring uninhabitable toxic and desert planets with no curisoities worth exploring it feels like... what's the point? 

That's the frustration of Endless Space 2. The moment to moment is fun and setting up your game board is fun, but the entire system runs on the ""snowball effect"" where factions who are powerful early on have such an enormous advantage that it is difficult to catch up to them in the late game. And so if you don't roll a good starting area, you might waste 50-100 turns not realizing that the game was rigged from the start.

Oh and also the battles (both in space and on the ground) suck.",1686956089,1686968771,True,5,1,0.588224828243255615,0,True,False,False

Pros:
You can spend 5 hours absorbed in this game and not even notice.
There are many aspects of this game that allow for a fully strategic game play.
Endless lore is fascinating

Cons:
Hacking mechanism is a complete waste of coding time. I hate it and wish it could be disabled.
The AI is pretty dumb and late game becomes pretty combative if you aren't the largest military
Scoring mechanism is extremely confusing and there doesn't seem to be any details available
This is the biggest con of the entire game- this game glitches, locks, and crashes ALOT. Like every game. There will be some halt on a mechanism and for the entire rest of the game you can't do something you're supposed to be able to do. (combining fleets for example)

The Nakalim quest to bring half a large galaxy under the academy's control was nearly impossible. Play 80-90% of the game needed to achieve that and all of a sudden turn ending hangs up. It freezes on end turn, save, or start new turn and no matter how many turns back you go to an auto save it still freezes...
That achievement took me 60 hours of restarting my game over and over and over again to achieve.

Now that I have 100% of the achievements of this game done, I honestly probably wont play it again for several years... just long enough to forget all the crashing problems.
That said, it was fun getting this far.

Pros
Every faction feels different
Game has amazing visuals and soundtracks
UI is very clean 
Lore and world-building is SSS-tier
Endgame is interesting and meaningful
Opbot  <3
Horatio is perfect

Cons
Again : Endgame. Endgame can be overwhelming because it has some kind of race mechanic that ""overrides"" established alliances.
If you go with pacifist route, minor faction assimilation quest will definitely be overwhelming.
Early game all out wars are absolutely discouraged if you are not a warmonger faction .
Academy's Vaulter or Librarian roles are  absolutely worthless.
Spear of Isyander breaks the balance. Academy quests start too early imo

I still recommend this game to 4X fans, yet there was something missing from it. But first, all the reasons you *should* buy this game if you love 4X strategy!

Endless Space 2 keeps with Amplitude Studio's tradition of gorgeous 2d and 3d art work, rich lore, crisp UI, and overall five-star presentation. This game is gorgeous and envelopes you in it world (or worlds) while playing it. And it does this without sacrificing the mechanical depth expected of a 4X strategy game. You will spend a great deal of time learning, optimizing, and enjoying the fine-tuning of your star systems, their planets, factional and alien populations, your government systems and so on. When it comes to the 4X overworld, empire building experience, this does it on a galactic scale with ease and style that is hard to find anywhere else.

It also has deep writing, lore, and exploration of its factions. Every campaign comes with a story to compliment the one you will be writing on your own. And this adds the engagement you have with your empire, and only helps you build that history of your empire which makes these kinds of games tick. ES2 is a full package in that regard, and does it so intuitively, engagingly, and stylishly it is impossible not to recommend it.

Yet, I love Endless Legend for marrying that same praise with tactical combat. A feature which is sorely missing from ES2. Both ground invasions (which are understandbly cut) and space battles (far less so!) are more like mere cutscenes you watch after selecting a doctrine. I sincerely hope this is an area of the game that gets attention in a sequel. More control over my epic carriers and fleets would be warmly welcomed here.

It also really strictly limits the upper ceiling of your expansions, and I don't know why. If you want to paint the galaxy under your colours, be prepared for some unhappy colonists. This dampens the momentum of lategame a lot.

Pros:
-Stunning presentation and artwork
-Crisp, attractive UI
-Deep empire building mechanics
-Great lore, writing and story quests
-Great unit and hero upgrading
-Great faction diversity and design

Cons:
-Lacks tactical combat for space battles
-Less visually immersive with armies than EL

Building a space empire is just a really cool idea for a game, and the presentation is really strong. The soundtrack and sound design in general is great, and all of the different factions are hugely unique and very interesting.

However the actual reality of playing the game is an exercise in frustration. There is no ground combat, and there is only a very limited space combat system. The bulk of the game is focused on researching new technologies, building infrastructure and doing diplomacy. You will spend so much time looking at the research screen, diplomacy screen and building queue, mostly trying to figure out what the fuck all the different resources do, which you need at this particular moment and how to get them. 
90% of the game is realising you need the purple resource to do diplomacy, wanting to build a building that gives you more of it, however you don't have enough of the orange resource you need in order to finish building it this century, so you find a research that will give you more orange resources, only to realise that you have too few blue(science) resources, so the research will take 40+ turns. Does that sound fun to you? Because it isn't exactly what I imagine when I think of a sci fi game where you build an empire. 

With most factions you cannot even declare war on people unless you have enough of the purple(diplomacy) resource. You actually need to save up a resource in order to have the ability to declare war on somebody.

Space battles look amazing, similar to Master of Orion remake, but with better control over tactics.

The early and mid games are the best parts since I'm still exploring the map, growing my power and I still want to avoid trouble. Unfortunately this is because the AI cheats early so they get ahead, but since they can't actually play for real, the player will first catch up and then leave them in the dust. I usually end up getting so strong that the late game becomes somewhat of a chore since I've effectively already won but just need to reach the win condition (also because there's just more to manage).

The AI also likes to develop a military early but never expand it. Nearly every single war I've had had gone like this: enemy provokes me but doesn't attack, I declare war and my vanguard fleet defeats their entire military before my main fleets even arrive, and then it's just a matter of logistics of slowly introducing their population to my empire or the airlock.

All of that sounds pretty bad, but it testifies to how strong the main mechanics of the game are that I keep playing it despite the flaws.

So after playing for approx 130 more hours since my first review (in Early Access even) I think I want to add a few things. 

Overall: 
Yes, I do still recomend it. It is a good game overall. Good music, solid integrity, good lore, cool mecahnics and are fun and immersive. The downsite are that it get too tedious over the turns you play. Like REALLY tedious. Way too much stuff happens that you have to do or ignore. If Civ 6 feels like a game that you never going to complete a game in, then Endless Space 2 feels like that game had a child. 

Pro: 
- Amazing music. Give a raise to the guy that wrote ""unstable molecule"". I can listen to that song for hours.
- Nice graphics. Don't need more or less.
- Good variety in fractions and you can create your own as well. 
- Explorations are well done. It's so much fun to explore the space. 
- The lore are very well done imo. You get the feeling that each fraction had a well thought meaning behind them. Top quality.

Cons: 
- Trying to hard imo. ES1 had it way too simple, here it's in overdrive. Make some of the stuff automatic please. (like the ability to hire an assistant that can take care of all the minor issues that pop up. 
- Simultaneously turns do not work well. You can both move at the start of the turn, but since you get 5-10 new notifications every turn, you can't close them fast enough to move your fleet or do something before the AI does. Imagine you are in a race getting to settle a outpost first. Since you get so many notifications, you can never win the race against the AI. Against a Human player it's so RNG as who got the least amount of pop ups.  
- Tedious ending. In the begining there are just enough to keep you occupied. Once you have 15+ systems shit takes forever. Pirates incoming in a system far off your armies, hacking need to be done, dialogue, unhappiness, max star systems before negative bonuses, etc etc. I spend like 2 minutes on each turn the first 50 turns. After 50 I go up to 5 minutes approx, and after turn 100 I use 8-10 minuets each turn and I'm skipping most tasks I can. ZZzzZZ. Make stuff more automatic. 
- Little to keep you hooked after the exploration of the galaxy are completed. 
- Require many DLC to get fractions. The basegame have way too few fractions for it to be worth it. 

OLD Review: (few days after release)
I loved Endless Space 1. I still play it sometimes. It had some issues, but overall it was understandable and fun. I beat it on highest level possible, so I feel I should know how to play this game. But I don't.
I know this is early access now, but I must say I am confused of what I think of this game. It looks good, but it is just way to complex. Right now I stuggle to understand the basic of how to even win against simple pirates. 
I don't understand the politics at all, I don't understand what to research to get better ships. I don't understand how you can defend far away populated areas because if they are outside your system moving takes forever. I don't understand how the reasearch in primarily is working, I don't understand what structures is important and whats not. It is all so confusing. 
I still have hopes for this game, but I fear they have and will not include Multiplayer Co-op. I don't know where it is. And if that is so, the only thing people was screaming for in ES1 is still ignored. 
I put this on 51% yes as recomended. I am very confused and hopefully it will be easier after a few more games.",1492097148,1681157778,True,1,1,0.479942679405212402,0,True,False,True

To those familiar with Stellaris, Endless Space is less complex, but adds a very well-crafted coat of personality and atmosphere on a 4X genre that usually lacks in that domain. Focus is put on story, with an actual choiced-based questline to follow with each species on top of the shared quests that sets this game apart.
The art is beautiful, showing off the many varied species, and the accompanying soundtrack is just as wonderful. A game's music has a huge impact on me, and I'd put Endless (as a series)'s soundtrack over Stellaris by a very comfortable margin.
Unlike Stellaris, you can't design your own species (well, you can, but I really don't see it as fitting into the game's experience), but each species is so distinct from each other in playstyle, story and tone, it's a work of art.
There are still some rough edges left, but not anywhere near as many as in Endless Legends. I will be looking forward to what Amplitude puts out next.",1680911339,1680911339,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Easily my favorite 4X game. The ""FIDSI System"" is subtly complex and intuitive. Modifying ship blueprints is exactly my flavor of micromanagement but you can click the auto button instead if that isn't your bag. Diplomacy is better than Civ or Stellaris, at least in the mid-late game when you've researched the right tech from the best tech tree I've played in a 4X game.

The clincher for me are the Quests. There are random events like in other 4X games BUT each nation has its own story-driven quests that guides you and characterizes their existence in the Endless Universe. It's also so good looking... I want every loading screen in my wallpaper folder, and the animated Heros, leaders, pirates are all excellent. Space battles are much much smaller than Stellaris but more cinematic (unless you skip the visual) as you can zoom in on each of your ships and fly your camera along with a missile barrage into the enemy flotilla. It's my favorite 4X combat system, though I imagine that's a small fanclub.

If nothing else, it's nice to see such a high quality game challenge Stellaris' domination of space-themed 4X.",1680654815,1680654815,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

First, the graphics is way ahead of its time. Innovative GUI elements and an overall ""light"" feeling place this product in 2024 rather than 2014. It's a decade ahead of its time.

Second, the soundtrack. There is no other game which I play listening to the original soundtrack. After +100h, all other games are so repetitive and boring. Not ES2. It's perfectly balanced, in tune with the atmosphere and... just perfect!

The gameplay is, again, a fast-paced, exciting experience. So much can be said about it.

Overall - this is one of the games dearest to my heart.

There is, however, a major damaging issue. I am unable to continue past turn 50/60, no matter what. So the game hangs, and there is no way forward. This is such a shame this fantastic game was not fixed for such a long time. There are tons of reports on Reddit and steam. The game was abandoned in a broken state.

I did everything possible to fix it, following all advice, tips and hints. I am pretty experienced and tried to mod it myself, or at least understand where the error is. (no, dark matter is not even in the library).

Everything to no avail.

If you think of buying it - all right, but beware, you might very well hit the same issue and cannot continue in the late game. Proceed at your own risk.

Negative because I expected better/more watchable combat from the reviews. It's ugly close, can't see shit from far away and the auto-cam is garbage.

Good buy for 10€ if you dont have Stellaris already.


Update: Played a bit longer, but now instead of firing it up again I decided never to come back. While a bit good ;) it doesnt call me back. There is just nothing in the game really calling me back. Never finished only one story/race. I dont know how people manage to do multiple.

I don't remember exactly what was wrong with this game at release but I remember there being a lot of pretty bad gameplay bugs. Apparently the main one was the battles being broken and the units moving the wrong direction. However, they have clearly fixed all of the issues and this game is a solid successor with a lot of fun and interesting additions and features. A unique and great take on the space 4X genre with a lot of customization potential. The primary issues is a bug that breaks a few of the improvements/buildings - the tooltip textbox will just not appear on some of them until you save and restart the game. It also seems to apply to their functioning - I built the trade center wonder which allows the player to skim between 10% and 25% off the top of every player's marketplace transaction. However it didn't work until I restarted the game, which unfortunately was substantially later than when I first built it.

Thankfully, the not-functioning side of the bug seems exceedingly rare so I wouldn't worry about it too much. Still worth a play through for fans of the genre.

Old Review:
The combat is clearly broken and vastly worse than the first. When I am attacking a worn down group of ships with an army of vastly more firepower.... and I lose half of my ships because the ''movement'' makes my ships moving AWAY from the enemy, causing my ships to be unable to fire at them while giving the enemy completely safe and full attacks....

Did I mention they were worn out (half dead) and vastly weaker in quality?

Personally, don't like to do too much research before buying/installing a new game, just to avoid any kind of spoilers. It's just that i enjoy to explore and discover all the small details myself, but enough about me. 
   Aprox. 100h and i enjoyed each one of it. The planetary systems, the progress, expansionism or AI aggressivity on hard difficulty (which is not that bad as the next difficulties, 2 or 3 over this mode) but for a casual and moderately experienced strategy player like me was enough to have an awesome experience.
Like most of the games i play, i expect to keep me focus solely on the one i've just installed and started, that means it needs that ""spark"" , to keep me excited, curious and wanting to play more, and more until it's finished, and this one has done that. I must admit, I'm not that kind of player to dissect all aspects of the game and play with multiple character or races , even achievements. i really don't care too much about it, trying to do as many or become a ""completionist"",so i completed with one race, but this is one of the few games that i would play in another year or two again, with a different race and maybe some extra DLC's.
   Overall, good game worth the money. The better the offer the best for you, but even with full price, still no regrets for me.

Enjoy!

From merchantile frogpeople, a civilization of clones, bloodthirsty bioengineered conquesting cyborgs, and polygonal creatures from another dimension, the potential of ""what is out there"" seems, well, endless.

Painstaking efforts have been made to make each race of aliens unique, with unique focuses, playstyles, and storylines, that are rich in worldbuilding and introspection about their place in the universe.

At its heart, Endless Space 2 is a long scale board game, that will take many hours to days in order to complete a single game. Each turn will require many decisions to be made or planned out in advance, while the AI or your human opponents do the same. Endless Space 2, as far as 4X games go, is on the simpler side. There is inevitably a lot to process and make sense of, and its very easy to lose track of what you're doing as the seemingly nonstop flow of new things keep being introduced.

I still disagree with the community content pack being stuck behind signing up for their website or whatever, but they released all the DLC for free (except the newest one) which is a pretty chad move and more than enough to change my opinion.
My previous review is below:

This game. It's not a bad game, but it's fucking shady. It took some debating with myself to rate this down, but I think it's really better not to buy it despite the fact that I enjoy playing it.

This game, isn't the cost that is advertised. It has more DLC than any game I've ever seen, as well as things that are needlessly locked. For example, perhaps the stupidest thing in this game, and the one that most convinced me to downvote: You can't play on a 6 arm spiral galaxy unless you register online for their shitty website thing and link your steam account to it. Completely idiotic. They are trying to force people to use something nobody would ever use otherwise by locking features of the game until you start using it. They also release MINOR DLCs like penumbra, and then charge insane prices for it like $15.99 holy shit. Honestly, don't buy this game, because they don't deserve the money from it. Company has gone to shit.

As for the actual gameplay though, it's not perfect, but it's pretty fun. Somewhere between endless legend and endless space 1. Nothing that new or groundbreaking though.",1553833965,1677955074,True,0,0,0.600185215473175049,14,True,False,False

It's like Risk, but in space! Who doesn't love conquering the galaxy with an army of sentient robots and giant space creatures?

The game has a variety of unique and fascinating alien races to play as, from the hive-mind-like Horatio to the cyborg-like Sophons. Plus, who doesn't want to lead an army of cute, fluffy cats into battle?

You get to design your own spaceships and watch them blast apart enemy fleets in epic space battles. Who doesn't want to feel like Captain Kirk or Han Solo?

The game has a complex and engaging diplomacy system, so you can build alliances with other empires and try to become the ultimate space superpower. Or you can just blow them up. Your call.

You can customize your faction's government, from a democracy to a totalitarian regime. Who doesn't want to roleplay as a space dictator?

The soundtrack is epic and atmospheric, so you'll feel like you're soaring through space while you play. Who doesn't want to feel like an intergalactic rockstar?

The game has a great sense of humor, with silly and entertaining events that can happen during gameplay. Who doesn't want to see giant space monsters get drunk and start singing karaoke?

Overall, if you're a fan of strategy games, sci-fi, and epic space battles, Endless Space 2 is definitely worth checking out. Plus, who doesn't want to be the ruler of the galaxy?",1677707047,1677707047,True,5,0,0.570200562477111816,0,True,False,False

The game is really pretty and has some interesting ideas but ultimately falls short on design because of three flaws in gameplay.

1. Endless space 2 relies on you doing a lot of mental math to figure out how much all the system stats are going to get buffed when you build an improvement. There's a lot of different improvements and you don't want to build the ones that give you only a little return. You want to build the ones that combo with your planet types or resources or something. Anyway, the game's UI doesn't do a good job showing what improvements are worth building. It doesn't do math for you and after it's built it still doesn't call out each improvement and show you how much they are contributing to your resources generation. This gets kinda confusing quickly when your shipping pops around from planet to planet in a solar system or even between solar systems. Or you are terraforming your planets so now they don't work with the improvements like they used to. And the game doesn't even feature quality of life features like not showing you improvements that don't do anything if they are built in a system. It's just a lot of math and for all the cool overlays and graphics and weird UI do hickies they have in this game, the ones that you would want the most like aren't there. Well because there's is all this math that is going on behind the scenes that you are constantly making gameplay decisions about, it becomes sort of radiculious middle and late game when you have twenty five different building decisions to choose from and 5 don't even doing anything in your system and 10 are too expensive and your adding up numbers to try to figure out if you want to build the interplanetary transports or bunch or red crates that just add a flat bonus to production per planet and eventually you just go, naaa, I'm just going to build some specializations and hyper holo whatever thing and delay these questions a couple more turns.

2. So while your lost in all the absurd planet debuff and buff wondering why in gods name they didn't make the yields per pop update after you built improvements you eventually realize that you aren't just supposed to be picking the best improvements for your systems, but also the best techs so you can build the best improvements first. And woza, this tech tree just really takes the cake. It's a huge circle, which is great, because as you progress through the tech tree the number of options you have to pick between just expands exponentially. First its 8 techs, then your staring down 16 and then you decide to start skipping a few because you find out that they actually get more expensive if you research them later and you get bonuses for reaching certain tech levels that are really good so you want to rush to the ones you want fist and then the next thing you know you're staring down like 40 techs, and on turn 86 you realize you completely missed the ass whipping tech that gives you like absurd food or something and the AI got it way ahead of you and has like way more pops than you. When the tech tree becomes combined with the ""what improvement do I want to build next?"" simulator you wind up just becoming exasperated and retreat to the search bar just to find out it can't even search for planet features or resources you might be interested in. Again, it feels like a first pass on something that could have been good with a good search and better quality of life features.

3. The scraps. The diplomacy and politics system feels really really really under done. The influence points you use to do diplo or politics actions don't feel valuable. You won't be racing towards those techs to make sure you can get a treaty faster than everyone else or sign a big law because the politics of your citizens is really hard to micro manage. And you'll blow through them really fast trying to make peace with everyone if you don't want to spend your days conquering even more systems to play the dreaded what to build next game on, only to accept an alliance and then get dragged into wars with all your former friends. Diplomacy systems don't feel good in a lot of games. This ones feels very tacked on. But somehow has more detail than the trade and populations systems in this game. The trade system works? It's bad. Trade systems also tend to be rally bad in general too in these games but this trade system just feels like someone in the office said, oh, we need a trade system, and a programmer was just like,  ahh, I'll take a pass on it. And here its. Build two improvements. Click this shippy button a couple times. Make money. woza. All the notifications every turn about population growth or population leaving without any explanation. It feels lazy. It kinda works because you are motivated to only control so many systems because otherwise you get a debuf and you can move pops around by the fours in the later game but please, I don't need to have turn by turn updates on growth and pops leaving.

In short complexity in a lot of 4X games becomes logarithmic pretty fast. And when you feel swamped and your realize the AI can't even keep up very well without cheating and then you just kinda realize you are just playing a jumble of rules to have an excuse to watch spaceships blow up.

I have only played a few hours. the tutorial windows obstructed the game screen so I turned the tutorial off.  You can pretty much figure game play without it though. nice simple graphics. I am playing on laptop with low range i5 equivalent CPU with integrated graphics and the game loaded and played wonderfully.
 
 I am currently recommending  the game based on my limited play time and watching a couple videos.
I didn't see or notice anything special for this genre but is very similar to many other 4X but not too much micromanagement.

You will be surprised by unexpected problems here and there, but even if you lose, it feels satisfying.

Oddly, the space battles somehow feel less satisfying to watch than the battles from Endless Legend to me.

If you don't, it might take a bit to grasp some of the more nuance mechanics, but an understanding of 4X game types will go a long way for you.

All the factions have their own unique ways of approaching the game and despite each being setup for a specific victory type, you can get pretty creative with each faction if you want to stray from the traditional playstyle of your race, you have some options.

Every faction, including the DLC factions are all pretty fun and creative, and they can all be pretty fun to play as.

1.  The game is driven by icons, and for a first time player it is extremely hard to know what some of the icons represent.  There are some that I still do not know, much less understand what they represent or impact.  There is no online reference option.  (How freakin;' difficult is it to make an indexed online reference?)
2.  For someone that loves to expand, know that they are severe limits.  I played the largest universe and I won because I had 40 star systems out of maybe 150(?), and I barely did this due to the penalties.
3.  The tactical side of combat is extremely limited, as it is pretty much the biggest fleet with the biggest weapons.  It is very frustrating that the extent of tactical combat is limited to ship design and whether the ship is a long, medium, or short range, and yet you can not group your ships into the proper range.
4,  On the good side, the graphics are beautiful, and the game is very immersive.  You do feel like this is a living, breathing universe.
5.  Planetary management is relatively easy and effective., which if you like larger universes is critical.
6.  The two major similar games that I have played are Galactic Civilizations 3 and Stellaris.  Endless Space 2 is head and shoulders better than Galactic Civilization 3 (which felt very stale and limited).  While Stellaris is much more interesting in terms of quests, more customizable competitors, more immersive gameplay, greater technology development, overarching story, and better challenge, Endless Space 2 does not have the horrible planetary management system (that makes Stellaris almost unplayable unless you love SimCity, in my humble opinion).
7.  While my comments may sound negative, Endless Space in my opinion is the one to own of this group, although I have not seen if it is as replayable as Stellaris.  (Note:  I was not able to finish Stellaris games the last two times I played because its planetary management system became so unwieldy that it was taking an hour to finish a single year of 200 year planned game.)

Bottom line: Endless Space 2 is one of the best 4X titles out there. Unfortunately, that doesn't actually mean a whole lot, as there are hardly any decent 4X titles in existence.

ES2 truly earns the name ""Endless"" with its absurd number of mediocre features, few of which actually improve the game's experience. Depth can be found in the systems, but with the poor balancing (both between factions and within a single playthough), you'll be at your wit's end trying to scrape enjoyment out of the game. I'd recommend you go play modded Civ V instead, or Sins of a Solar empire if the space theme is important to you.

My main struggle with grand strategy games set in the future is that tech. trees are non-intuitive, and essentially need to be learned from scratch. (Unlike Civ, where you can pretty logically understand if you invest in ""Ballistics"" you'll end up with more guns). Endless Space is worth pushing through the initial confusion phase, though, because each game you can peel back another layer and build a deeper understanding - which is rewarding in a way that more intuitive TBS games aren't. 

Apart from that, the game is beautiful, and the story lines are rich/detailed. The UI overlay is particularly well-done, and you can hover over just about anything on any screen to learn more without having to go down a rabbit hole of menus. Highly recommended, leave the tutorial on if it's your first time playing and read through it. I'd recommend playing as the Unfallen to start, even though the game lists them as having an ""advanced"" mechanic. I think their expansion rules are more intuitive, and, obviously, VERY PLAUSIBLE.

Mostly playing ES2 on the steam deck and Stellaris at my computer. ES2 is very playable on steamdeck, but Stellaris is difficult and clunky to control and it wasn't an enjoyable experience. 

That being said, I was having a great time with ES2 UNTIL the DLC's went on sale and I scooped most of them up. Hacking is a weird side game that I really would rather not be bothered with. Behemoth's were interesting, but then became this weird unbalanced and high level nuisance for me and my enemies that really didn't enrich the game for me. The barrage of requests and objectives laid out by the Academy, I don't even get WTF the academy is and I don't want it. The DLC's made everything worse, not better. 

Originally I had a very satisfying game loop going and an addictive 'just one more turn' vibe going as I explored the different factions and playstyles, but now my enthusiasm is fading and I wish the DLC's had been more worth it. 

As for Stellaris, I find it goes into very granular detail, which isn't always good, but the exploration and making contact with aliens and archaeological dig sites and plot lines are all very interesting, dynamic, and fairly realistic. I don't enjoy the planet management system at all and much prefer the Civ/ES2 version which is a lot simpler. Another gripe I have with Stellaris is that I'm CONSTANTLY pausing the game, it might as well be a turn-based game because I'm pausing the game every month or two as it is as technologies get researched or events happen and you need to make decisions. I'm torn because the technology system in ES2 is kind of boring in that you can see everything laid out in front of you, but the Stellaris system has it's own issue of not being able to focus your scientists to tech development you're going for and instead playing a weird luck game, the best option would be a combination of both systems. That being said, I really like the empire development, combat fleets, storylines, race flexibility and advancements, and the more organic flow of the game in Stellaris. It also has a better end game with Galaxy shaking crisis' that add a layer of challenge to the entire arena. 

In conclusion, if you want to play on steamdeck I recommend Endless Space 2 and wouldn't bother with the DLC unless they're on a massive sale and even then you may want to go into the advanced settings when starting a game and really tailor what you'll be using. 

If you're playing on PC I'd go with Stellaris, the DLC are nice to have, but it can be a lot even if they are discounted. I'm a big fan of Paradox games, but if you're just getting into a game it's a little overwhelming to be looking at hundreds of dollars in DLC content. At some point they should start just integrating older DLC into the base game, because how can you expect someone to pay $300+ for 1 game (right now on steep sale the entire thing is just shy of $200 CAD). The additional races and options really do make a difference in the game, so maybe try the base game and then pick up some DLC when they're on sale. 

Both games look great and have good visuals. Both games ran great, both on PC and on Steamdeck. I get about 2 hours of play time of ES2 on steamdeck per battery charge.",1672511035,1672511035,True,120,0,0.907004177570343018,0,True,False,False

I've not played Stellaris so I have no means of comparing it, and even if I didn't from my own research I don't think it is something to bother with.

The user interface is very well designed.  I love the various factions you can play as, each feeling very unique, with their own unique characters, quests, etc.  To top it off, there is wide variety of options for customising each game (I play solo only against AI).  The game has great mod support, too (and there are some fun cheat/sandbox mods if you want to just mess around).

The only warning is that there is an environment variable you will need to set to make it run on Windows.  Some issue with the version of OpenGL it uses.  Just do a Google search and you can find a few posts on what to do.  It is easy to do, and once done you are golden (you may need to search for this issue relative to ENDLESS Legend as that has the problem, too, and that is how I found this out at first).

You can customize your ships with different weapons/ utility/ armor/ shield upgrades to have your own unique fleet of ships. Each faction comes with its own heroes that all share the same mastery skill upgrades, but in different orders to benefit playstyles and faction benefits. The heroes can pilot your customized ships or can be assigned to govern a star-system/ Senate. Very fun addicting game with tons of hours of gameplay. Also quite graphically beautiful.

The Bad: Despite having good graphics, the hero ships are ugly and don't change per faction. Also the sound effects were very lame and don't change when you upgrade your weapons (lame machine-gun sound on a late-game weapon is lame). I prefer space simulation with real Sci-Fi explanations. The fact that you can have humans colonize gas-giants and other barren worlds simply with a science tech feels not very scientific. You can terraform worlds, but only after you colonize. Also you can only manage entire Star-Systems rather than customizing your planetary worlds. There are no ground or orbital planetary improvements, just the same Star-System builds per each unique faction each game (a good and bad thing). The science tech tree pretty much has you focusing on the same elements each game, which are industry > dust > science > influence = approval > food, which can get stale. Speaking of stale, you build the same Drone Network improvement first in every star-system, why build anything else?  The game can bombard you with menus after menus at the upkeep of each turn which was annoying. The spiral galaxy is boring to play because the constellations (basically islands) are linear trains that are separated from others. Other galaxies feel nice at the largest scale, but still feel empty with not as many Star-Systems as real Galaxies (or even proportionally close for immersion sake). 

Despite the fact that I mentioned a lot more annoying points, and I would say the game isn't for everyone (especially Civ fans)... I have TONS of fun + game hours playing this game.... and at the end of the day Fun >> Annoyance. 8/10 game.

Closer to Civilization than Stellaris and a solid basic game with a good quest structure and interaction with other empires. The tech tree is also large enough to sustain the whole game.
Basic game mechanics are simple and good, from space fleet combat to planet invasions. The fleet designing is also a bit easier than Stellaris, thou I still prefer the Stellaris realism here.
A downside are that alliances between AI players do not change throughout the game.
The trade system is a bit broken, mostly due to a persistent bug that prevents you from getting a good overview. I still prefer the Stellaris system of trade that allows more freedom; well except for the intolerable space pirates in stellaris that are much more elegantly handled here where they have planets and when they are destroyed they do not come back.
However there are a few negatives as well -the DLC's.
It seems like the creators left the DLC's to others as they are very poorly adapted:
•	Behemoths can create great unbalance with their planet destructive powers.
•	Don't get me started on the hacking DLC. That is completely useless and invokes more grief than anything. I consistently stick to defending my outer planets and that is it. It is like a minigame completely out of context.
•	The Academy DLC works fine until you are forced to destroy it. After that it becomes a nuisance. As long as it is funded it continues to spit out endless fleets to harass everything. If you then conquer their planets, the fleets appear from nowhere.
Overall a very good game with some DLC problems. 
I would probably just buy the basic game.

Think of ES2 as ""baby grand strategy"" as you would a baby grand piano. It's not a fully open 4x experience, and thanks to those development constraints they were able to get pretty fancy on some game-play elements. It's a beautiful game, clearly worked on by at least one person who loved it, and it's yielded some great (and some boring) hours of replay.

It's not a perfect game as the UI still has some ""nuanced"" state forgetfulness, but it's consistent forgetfulness so players can adapt pretty quickly to it.

I honestly have never made it past turn 20 and thought, hey when I put this down I am going to come back and continue playing. Of the near 200 hrs I've put into the game surely most of that has been looking at either the main menu or loading screens. 

Not because of optimisation issues, but because the AI B lines straight for your surrounding systems to colonize before my scout ship can move at the beginning of my turn, or the random events that curtail any advancements made in either expansion, exploration or research. The first few turns race to spam as many colony ships out to uncharted territory so that I can keep the  random AI pirates, who are completely above anything I as a player can handle for I don't know how many turns, from taking over all available systems to spam hugely powerful fleets, comparatively. The AIs inability to trade or do any type of diplomacy that isn't absurd, no I won't give you my home system because the game spawned us two systems apart and you're angry I colonized to close to you...

Pros:
- Pretty decent empire management systems, makes you really consider your decision making before you take them.
- In terms of size and performance, very little issues with how the game runs, it's as smooth as butter from what I've experienced so far, and I've been running only the largest galaxies in my games.
- The core mechanics are decent, quite a thorough planning requirement for any encounter, from fleet composition, to ground invasion compositions.
- The graphics are definitely something else considering this game was released back in 2017, and I'm writing this in 2022.
- Quite a variety of different factions and races, and minor civilizations to compliment them with a unique population management system to boot

Cons:
My only problem with the game is the various game breaking glitches when it comes to ending your turn, several on the forums report as early as the 2nd to 11th Turns. Mine occurs roughly between 70-110 turns, never made it past 110 in any of my playthroughs. 
- Pending Turn bug is where a random Ai glitches out due to decision making and game processing malfunctions
- Ending Turn bug is either where the market doesn't refresh, an Ai is causing the malfunction due to invading a conquered planet, Ai not able to take action due to the current status of their objective being altered by the player's(us) actions.

The game in general is amazing, and is definitely a must-play, but considering how game breaking glitches like the one I'm experience still exists 5 years in, it only takes so many restarts before you get bored of it. I've got a conflicted recommendation for the game, buy if you have the funds to spare it, but don't expect much from it. 

And for those that claim ""There are ways to fix the glitches"", I paid for a playable game, not to troubleshoot bugs and glitches that are 5 years old. Endless Legend was leagues better than this.",1668942822,1668942822,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Actually, I wouldn't even call in a learning curve. ES isn't actually complex, the mechanics, all in all, are probably more simple than many other 4X titles. The problem, is that ES 2 is arguably trying to keep these mechanics hidden from you, rather than teaching you what they are. Tutorials in 4X titles were never easy but ES2 is by FAR the worst I have seen.

ES2 general apporach to teaching you how to play the game, is throwing a bunch of of User interfaces at you and hoping that you actively explore them with kin interest as if it was an open-world, and not just a bunch of stale datasheets with occasional prompts. Even when you actively search for something you may not find it in the game. I dislike going to outside resources for a game but with ES2, I had to repeatedly google stuff like ""How research new ships"" (The military research tree is a trap), ""how to build tanks"" (you don't, you juss allocate them), ""what is that symbol in ES2"" (combination of stuff), ""what do you get by consuming a planet"" (nothing) and of course, ""how do you win"".

The main new thing in ES2 that distinguish it from other games in the genre is the animated 3D space fights and that's a waste of good effort. The fights aren't interactive, aren't engaging and don't teach you anything useful. Ships sail in space in the pretermined path and shoot at each other, exploding occasionally. Very soon, you will just end up skipping them. 

To conclude, I had some fun, but that kind of game is a large investment in terms of time and I think stellaris is just better. I am not a juge fan of paradox but judging both base games, stellaris is both more complex, more engaging and less tedious.   I suspect multiplayer might flow better with ES2 but never tried either of them.",1667818010,1667818010,False,13,3,0.619982540607452393,0,True,False,False

Not to mention easy mode is not easy and its overtly time consuming as if the ai has to decide whether it wants you to play it or be a dick. The idea of jumping into the game is not a good idea and often there is alot of backtracking to progress in a ""bad map"". The AI may be tolerant enough but is still likely the mechanics of the game will not play out correctly to progress and require several attempts and reloads of the very same steps to play out. While you can expect to be lucky often times you simply still cannot out-perform the unexpected curveballs or random-generated prize pools being inefficient, as well as not have favored conditions to ""maximize"" your status of your own Nation (not to mention those of others). There are very forced strategies that make the game not very strategic at all and more of a slough through the same type of gameplay despite boasting of different playstyles, the opportunities to express yourself as a uniquely thought out strategy are shortlived and overall second-in-line to the ""mainstream choices""  (especially since the AI buckles down late-game as loses out on extra ""options"")

Nothing bad just too short-leashed to have any fun at all except to speed run what would take over 300 turns to even win at a normal pace.

In most part this is due to “endless space 1” and in some moments of “endless legend” experience. Buy only with a bundle discount.
So here are cons and pros:

Pros:
++Beautiful view of the galaxy(planets, background, UI, etc) and space battle animations.
++Upgraded version of espionage called ""hacking"" - very interesting mechanic, including some new features like sleeper agents, block fleets movement, etc. 
++Feeling that the universe is more realistic because they added different types of star systems instead of just single planets - a lot of info about each of them, also star systems can have a variety of suns, moons, anomalies, etc. And a list of unique ones including “auriga”.
++A lot of quests - for faction, competitive, hero academy, with different choices and some time long consequences.
++Behemoths - gigantic space battle stations for mix purposes like for military, economic or scientists.
++Political parties and voting(it could be much better if we have more government types and more differences between them), but this is still a new and wholesome improvement.
++Trade system has nice upgrades and visual style but it is broken as hell.
++Pirate league - very cool and challenging feature.
++Some planet improvements like specializing and deep terraforming.

Cons:
– Studid AI, even at impossible difficulty. Other endless games are much better.
– I like to create a custom faction for my style of game, but despite devs gave some limitations on creation with custom factions they will be OP if you know which traits to pick(without any hacking you literally can make smth very broken).
– Some broken combo for ships like stacking hp regen on ships that can make the fleet absolutely unkillable(tested in multiplayer).
– Minor factions are smth that will be game changing and give a very big “snowball effect”, especially if you set a big number of them. It is too easy to obtain them and they give huge benefits at the early stage of the game.
– Game has less option on creation galaxy than previous endless games, even on huge map it feels not big and too empty.
– Major factions, they deleted some nice ones from the first game and created new ones which are just combinations of previous, but unique one like the umbra choir is just too broken if you play it well with it or create a custom faction with its trait.
– A lot of features from diplomacy are useless and unplayable with AI, like alliance where ally AI can set a peace while you are winning the war, without even asking you about it.
– Decreased number of hull types for ships - they have some difference like 1 passive for medium or small but it’s a trash feature. And for the visual part they are much worse than the first game.
– Imbalance major factions affinity - like vodyani have best ships due to the number of possible slots, also all factions have their own tech improvements but some factions have more benefits than others.
– Too few quantities of wonders and special deeds from tech tree.

Very creative faction design. Several of the factions play uniquely and almost each one has its own impact on how the game unfolds.

Well-designed quests and events with rewards that usually feel both valuable and timely.

Hero system feels good and custom-designed Hero ships are a great addition to the series.

Combat is rather simplistic, and ultimately a multilayered rock-paper-scissors system. This is where the various empires start to feel much the same, with little real factional asymmetry in combat. This can feel a bit boring, but fortunately you can auto-resolve battles without having to watch them if you like.

Also, the mod system is a bit annoying. The game does not save preset mod lists, and in fact forces you to manually activate the mods you wish to use each time you load into the main menu. At least you can load your most recent mod set, but I have lost track of how many times I've loaded a save before realizing I forgot to load my mods first.

For old-school space 4X players: take the basic system development of MOO2, add a whole bunch of stuff with political parties, and change the combat to be one step above auto-resolution.  Make diplomacy more complex but surprisingly opaque (plan to do some wiki reading about ""diplomatic pressure"").

Most of the UI is very nicely done, though the fleet management is a bit klunky, and the research screen zoom toggles between ""so close you can only see a couple of things"" and ""look, tiny dots"".

I didn't enjoy managing the internal politics.  Stellaris has some similar concepts, but somehow it's less of a burden there.

I had 2 crashes in my first 18 hour playthrough, but both were recoverable thanks to autosave occurring the turn before. I did not encounter any other bugs.

I am so far vastly enjoying this over Galactic Civilizations III which felt very generic and had lame combat.

The devs nailed it in basically all aspects of the game, and it also feels like a full and finished title without any DLC. I have no DLC atm but will definitely buy some now that I know how awesome the game is. Only thing I'd improve on is more UI options to assist with micromanagement of newly-built ships sitting in hangers, population distribution, and planet construction.

I will edit this review in the future to compare it to Stellaris once I buy that later.

If I compared this to Stellaris, I would rate Stellaris the better of the two but at the same time I do appreciate the TURN based aspect of this game. However..... what in the hell are these forever long wait times between turns. Ive never played a game with a slower time between turns and as of now I have 11 hours logged. I would almost bet a 5th or 6th of that is just waiting. Maybe Im over exagerating but believe me.... Its very noticable compared to other games Ive played.

Ship Design is well done, but I agree with another review about the ship combat not making too much sense. Winning seems to be just tilted towards the AI but it is very cool watching the fights. 

The technologies are good, and I definitely like the colonize system as well planet managment.

Overall Id still recomend trying this game. The turn based is definitely something I think has its appeal vs. The RTS style of Stellaris etc.

I will be playing more of this game, but I'm less inclined because of the opaque and boring battle simulations.

That's a skill issue but I am flying blind here. However, behemoths are fun, the economic and research systems are amazing, and the world is fun to learn about. If your interested in this game, I'd say give it a shot. It has far more pros than cons for me.

-Exploring
-FIghting
-Developing your Empire
-Researching tech
-Diplomacy
-The AWESOME soundtrack
-The deep lore

And so, why do I get frustrated? It's because of a single bug that has been in this game nearly since launch and the devs don't seem to be able to fix. It's about the things you research not showing you what their benefits are. And the problem is, it's not only a tech-tree problem. I research a building I don't know what will offer me when I build it and then when i try to build it, it also doesn't show me the benefits. And I know I am not a dev and this bug might be harder to fix than it sounds, but in a game about Expansion, I can't blindly build things and expect my ""Empire"" to thrive. I have waited for so much time for this thing to be fixed and I feel that the dev team has moved on to new projects, so this is why I post this review, as I don't expect them to fix it in the future. And no, I don't want to have an online guide open so I can check what each building does when the bug appears, or restart the game, as many suggest in the forums. It's a 4X game where two of the Xs, the Exploit and Expand, don't function unless you ignore that you are doing them suboptimally.
And these games are all about doing the optimal thing.

First, let's get the minor gripe out of the way to eliminate any misunderstandings. The game maybe called 'endless space' but it doesn't mean what you think it does. The map is not endless, in fact it can be rather small without mods. The 'endless' bit refers to an ancient dead race in the game.

With that out of the way, covering this in two sections, gameplay and atmosphere.

On the gameplay side of things, this game is very functional, and the UI is user-friendly. It is turn-based, and has a number of things that progress each turn, such as system productions, research, battles, ect. Everything is very intuitive and easy to grasp compared to most space strategy games I have played, and the game is quick to remind the player of something they forgot if they end their turn prematurely (IE, if you haven't got any research going on, the game will bring up a banner telling you this the first time). For the most part it functions rather well. It has plenty of functions to tinker with, such as laws, the marketplace, heroes, ect.

Then there's the combat system. Its a hands-off sort of system, but not entirely. You do not directly control ships in the heat of battle, and unlike the first Endless Space, you only get one tactic to use. Ships can be arranged and given a tactical strategy prior to the opening sequence of a battle, at which point you can watch (or not) the two fleets duke it out. More often than not, it ends with the destruction of one of the fleets in early-game, but by late game there will often be survivors of a losing battle. Ships engage each other in up to three separate flotillas with their own firing arcs respectively, which means some flotillas will not be able to target each other due to angle and distance. And the ground combat is a bit less intuitive, but cinematic nonetheless. You organize your forces into a mix of infantry, armor, and aerials, give them a battle plan, then send them into battle. there are plenty of passive factors that can have an effect on the battle, and there are empire-wide upgrades for troops, but for the most part it is hands-off.

However there is a bit of a flaw in the pacing. Without mods, the game is rather quick paced, in fact lets not beat around the bush, you are racing the other empires to get to an established state. You can do this by expanding rapidly (playing wide) or only using a few systems at first and focusing on system and tech improvements (playing tall), but a capable fleet is a NECESSITY in the game, so keep this in mind. This is less a flaw with the game itself, and more along the lines of my personal dislike for rush strategy games. Can be fixed with mods.

Now the atmosphere. After playing a lot of other space strategy/tactical games, including but not limited to, Stellaris, Homeworld, Stardrive, Master of Orion: CtS, and Sins of a Solar Empire,  I can confidently say that in terms of overall atmosphere, this game surpasses all of them when compared individually. The soundtrack and effects are a harmony to the ears, the ship designs are varied and interesting, the planets and animations pertaining to them are works of art, and the space battles are F###ING SPECTACULAR!! Honestly, I can't come up with a single criticism in this field...well, except that with the Supremacy DLC, the behemoths should be a bit more tailored to each factional appearance instead of being all identical. But honestly I could care less about using them. Let me put it this way, each playable race [b]has a different orchestral suite when you play as each of them[/b]. I challenge you to find a game that goes to that degree of effort just for atmospheric ambience.

Overall, I'd give this game a solid 8/10.

If you like sci-fi and strategy games, then you will most likely like this one. If you are looking at reviews trying to decide to buy or not, just do it. Having said that, this game is really paradoxically great and horrible at the same time. I both love it and hate it simultaneously. I've never had that experience with a game before. Here is why... the things that are done well in this game, like the graphics and space battles are done really really well. The writing and world building is decently good, with a nice variety of species each having a different perspective and their behavior in general matches their ideology. The mechanics of the game are also very good. It is a game about economics first and conquering space second. If you are part sci-fi lover and an accountant, you will love this game! lol

Postives:
1) Graphically this game looks amazing.
2) The species/ship design/world building is really well done.
3) The Graphical User interface looks absolutely gorgeous (however there is one major flaw in the UI design which I will talk about later - Popup windows)
4) Stability - since it's release and the first time I played this game back in 2018 stability has been improved and many bugs have been fixed which were present in the initial release. So if you are looking to buy this game in 2022, you are lucky in that most bugs have been fixed.)
5) Each planet has it's own characteristics, and looks amazing!
6) The ship designs/Space battles are incredibly well executed! There is a camera view AI that does an amazing job playing virtual cinematographer where you are getting 'like you were there' kind of cinematic approach to each battle scene complete with cuts to closeups/wide angle shots, as well as key shots of various ships exploding and firing. It is really well done, and no two space battles are ever exactly the same looking, which is fantastic! And the space backgrounds with planets look really good. 

The negatives:
1) Popup Window Hell - While the GUI is incredibly beautiful, there are some fatal flaws with the UI design on this game, and the incessant use of popup windows is the number one thing that totally sucks about this game! If you like having your game play constantly interrupted with annoying popups that constantly fly in your face as you are trying to do things and then force you to have to click on them to close them ending with you getting a case of carpel tunnel in your hand from clicking on so many fricken popup windows by the end of a long game, then this is for you. lol No seriously, the guy who designed the UI to include these popups should be shot. The game should have been redesigned without any need for popup windows.
2) Second most annoying thing - again GUI related - Popup tool tips/information. The way the GUI is designed is it has a slow firing popup container within a window that typically has the information you care about. For example, lets say you are scanning a planet with a probe. You fire that probe from your ship, and then you get this fricken popup window with a large picture in it and have to wait about 1 second or 2 before a tiny box in the bottom right hand corner appears telling you what you actually found on the planet. That popup delay is annoying and the fact that the key information that you really care about is delayed and relegated to a tiny corner in the UI is also annoying.
3) Tallent Trees/Science Research Trees - This involves 3 major flaws. First is that the GUI designer decided to use a circle layout for both, which, while it looks really cool from a graphical/aesthetic perspective, functionally it totally sucks. Second, is that in these circular layouts there are only icons without any word descriptions for each thing. That means you have to mouse over the icon every single fricken time, and wait about 1-2 seconds for an annoying popup tooltip to appear telling you what that thing is. That totally sucks and is something I hate about this game. Ideally they should have standardized the tallent tree flow with grids and used text based descriptions and standardized them across all heroes so that you don't have to constantly mouse over every time to figure out what it is. Not to mention that despite the differences in the graphical layout between heroes, the characteristics by and large are basically the same thing. So it's not like some characters have unique abilities that only they have, which makes it silly to use these non standard layouts without labels. The ""coolness"" of the look of the GUI and the popup tooltip information wears off after about an hour, and then you wish you could toss the computer and the game out the window for frustration of having to wait for it every time.
4) Selecting ships/fleets while on the map is buggy, and in the interface. It's difficult to sometimes select a fleet and or deselect a fleet with your mouse. This is a basic functionality that you use a lot in the game, and it's basically broken/doesn't work as it should all the time reliably. This would be a bug, I guess. 
5) The music while not horrible, is just okay. It's not something amazing and I ended up turning the music volume down to zero in the settings and now I just put on headphones and listen to my own music and or listen to the Stellaris soundtrack instead. The music in Stellaris is really really good compared to this game. 
6) The DLCs totally suck. Don't buy them! I won't go into too much detail on the DLCs but most of them are a waste of money. There is one DLC I ended up uninstalling - it was one that turned the Academy into a new faction and introduced some new 'woke' alien species that resembles a typical black/endogenous/transgender trans-human, complete with an over the top homosexual sounding person to do the voice over, which made me almost vomit on my computer screen. The libtard message is strong in that DLC, so avoid it at all cost/don't waste your money. In the main game you get a taste of this type up thing with THE HORATIO, who is basically a homosexual human male who loves himself so much he clones himself millions of times to become his own ""species"". This was very humorous, laughable and well done. While the woke species in the Academy DLC is not well done, and basically has no humor/satire involved and as a result sucks.

Below I will list all my complains with the game.

---AI---
If you intend to play with AIs at all, then be ready to not have fun. The AIs are overly aggressive, even in situations where they should never be. For example, I had an AI with no ally or alliance, and lowest in term of score, declare war to my alliance of 4 factions in the top 6 in the game.
Even faction that are ""pacifist"" will keep declaring war to you and attack you relentlessly. It feels like the AIs difficulty level only affects how aggressive (for no reason) they are.
In terms of relationships, like trading and such, its also terrible. The AI will actively refuse my truce when I just killed all of its fleets and took multiple systems, but at the start of the next turn, he will offer me a truce with some dust as a bonus. 
Randomly, an AI at the other side of the galaxy will propose you an alliance, sounds great right? If you accept, you are generally now at war with half the galaxy. But it is the only way to ever be in an alliance, otherwise they will refuse your alliance, no matter what.
Allies will refuse proposals that clearly benefit both of you, without any draw backs.
Allies will constantly declare war to everyone, and you cannot know which ally is doing it, not that you could do anything about it anyway, you cannot kick someone from an alliance.
In short, any difficulty above hard just means it will be the galaxy vs you. On hard even pacifist are warmongers, but it is still winnable (but grindy, tedious and annoying).

---Behemoth (giant special ship from a DLC)---
They are stupid. Giant (pretty much) unkillable ships that serve little real purpose. There are multiple types of behemoth you can get, but it is never worth the science to unlock them and the production to create them. Just try it for yourself if you want, you will quickly play games without making any.

---Umbral choir DLC---
Playing the new Umbral shadow faction is kinda fun, although you generally don't do much and win without really interacting with other factions. It add the hacking mechanic, which is fun with the Umbral Shadow and infinitely annoying, tedious and honestly useless with other factions. I generally never use the hacking, or do extremely long hacking just so I no longer get the pop-up to assign some hacking every turn. Defending against hacks isn't really realistic (100% rng, nothing you can), but don't worry, hacks do next to nothing, except as the Umbral Shadow faction.

---Academy DLC---
It adds the ""Academy"" that is a neutral faction that really does nothing, but ask for your resources in exchange for powers, that last a few turns. You have to be the top donator of the specified resource, or you either get nothing for it or a random power if you are in the top 4, but not first.

Powers:
Academy fleet: Access to a fleet of overpowered ships you can conquer the galaxy with. Thats the review I saw elsewhere, I have never used it.
Academy funds: ""fake"" dust you can spend to trade with other factions, they will all refuse your offers so you will just lose it.
Academy knowledge: You gain access to unuseful information about other factions systems and heroes.
Academy policies: You gain access to some policies that your gouvernment can't currently have. Pretty good, but the power lasts for way way to few turns and is never worth paying for.

In the end, I never interact with the Academy, it isn't worth the resources at all. But it does help in way, the Ais will spend A LOT to get useless powers, so it will slow them down.

---Minor Factions---
The idea is neat, it sometimes works great. You can interact with them to try and raise your friendship with them to gain resources every turn from them. When you reach 50% friendship, you can do a ""mission"" for them to assimilate them to your faction. This is a MAJOR problem. First, the mission is chosen randomly, seems to make sense, but its not the same mission for each faction that interacts with the minor faction. Some can be finished in a turn, others require you to have a specific fleet power orbiting a specific system for 10 turns. What will *OFTEN* happen is that if you get a long mission, someone else will get a short mission and assimilate them first, even if you started your multiple turns before them. Second, it means that you can assimilate a faction within a handful of turns or it can take up to 20-25 turns, its complet RNG. You CAN save scum it (reload until you get a decent mission), which is strongly recommend, otherwise you will basically never have a minor faction in your empire.

---Factions---
Factions are pretty diversified, can't complain here. They all(?) have their own unique mechanic, making them some what unique and different. You can also ""make your own"" with great limitations. You have to start from an existing faction, which is understandable, but I wish we could create a faction that has a mix of the specially mechanics from factions. You also cannot make overpowered factions, even if you intend to only play against AIs.

I will update my review if some of these are fixed, but since it was released years ago and there are still a few game breaking bugs that never got fixed, I doubt anything will ever be changed.",1633637310,1658201866,False,23,0,0.672724366188049316,1,True,False,False

I wasn't. This is an incredibly solid, all around fantastic 4x game with some of the most gorgeous visuals and soundscapes of any modern game. 

The one and only weak point that I have found is diplomacy seems rather basic EDIT it got patched, could still use more work but it's decent now EDIT It also would be nice to have bigger fleets (even upgraded tech your fleets are going to be pretty small, though ironically per ship it's comparable to MoO II sizes) and the fleets stack so you're probably going to end up with like 3 stacks of 3-5 ships each for awhile. I'm guessing part of limited engagements would be GPU power? EDIT this got patched too, they introduced new ship classes.

I would absolutely highly recommend this game to anyone who's a fan of strategy. If you're into 4x games despite handling some things differently it is extremely easy to pick up and very intuitive, altough I imagine if this is your first 4x you're going to need to do what everybody used to do and just read the manual (reminds me when games used to come with a full book in the box explaining everything, strategies, lore etc) although tutorial mode seems to help a lot. The factions are all very unique with different feels to them and minor factions, genuinely alien aliens, all in all it basically gives everything I'd wanted in a 4x. So far no bugs, no crashes, no stuttering, just a very smooth glorious game. EDIT the game actually does tend to freeze at times, and sometimes I wind up with errors in improvement description boxes.

EDITed: so I've played it a lot more, and I have to say this is a fantastic game. Everyone once in awhile I miss certain things about Endless Space 1 oddly enough, but this is indeed a fantastic game and probably my favorite 4x at this point. It has its own unique style which I enjoy although the best way to describe this game in a nutshell is ""quality not quantity"". This includes a sense of needing bigger fleets or wanting a larger tech tree or more races (which the devs constantly continue to improve upon btw) to the very mechanics of playing more tall than wide. In fact unlike a lot of other games where it's a mad dash to see who can get the most systems/territory in the first dozens of rounds, this one actively penalizes you for doing that in an effort to balance out the typical unstoppable blob of doom. You still sort of can, but it's just extremely resource and time intensive, and particularly depending on the faction feels like you're just trying to choose a wizard class and turn it into a sword fighter (which you can but why?)

I would strongly recommend this game to anybody who likes a good strategy game. It actually has pretty much everything I would want in a 4x, finally.

2nd Edit: after spending well over four hundred hours playing this game I can faithfully attest that it is the best 4x game to be released since Master of Orion II. Seriously it's amazing. Most games I can find fault with even when I think they're spectacular. This game is virtually faultless in every regard and Amplitude is now one of my favorite most amazing studios ever. This is a buy it at full price game. Get it. Seriously.

3rd Edit: date 15 July 2022 A.D. old terra calendar date and I am still playing and enjoying this game greatly. It remains as of this writing possibly the best, most well made 4x game that I have ever played, and is every bit what kid me playing Master of Orion 2 could've possibly hoped for in the future.",1530586061,1657886280,True,11,0,0.583599865436553955,0,True,False,False

Random events also add some depth to the game where minor civs, what government type you have, and what expeditions you explore all have some bonus or penalty to give.

TLDR; solid 8 out of 10.

Reevaluated:
7 - because I found a serious flaw on Endless (probably works for lower difficulties as well).
I kept getting beaten when 2 of the 3 AIs ganged up on me. Started over and reduced the node density, thinking it would require me to place my fleets best strategically while also allowing me not to get overrun by 3 30+ CP fleets on the same node constantly, slow the pace a bit, giving me a little more breathing room.

Turns out that the AI will send a fleet to one or more access points they have to you, as expected, and then declare war. However I only experienced the AI sending a single fleet from each point, once that fleet was beaten they would only send a few scattered ships at the time, often not using the hyperlanes.

They also didn't defend their own systems or attempt to reclaim them (except (almost exclusively) exploration ship blockades). The AI seemingly only gathered their ships into decent sized fleets, once I take many/most of their nodes - I can only speculate, but I suspect before I confined the AI to a smaller area, the distance in turns between the ships was considered too big to consolidate them into a proper fleet.
Using just 4 fleets, and keeping no large fleets at home, I took the galaxy losing only 8 ships in total, and meeting little resistance, because they retreated their ships to death.
Also when I wrote the original review I had forgotten how needless and ridiculous juggernauts and obliterators are. Seriously, I have taken out 3 Behemoths/Juggernauts (can't remember which) and another 23 ships, when I had backed an AI into a corner, with a single Ion Wave, granted most of them would have been at half HP, but still stupid.

Original review:
There are a few things that aren't great (bandwidth I'm looking at you) and some of the DLCs have been quite pricy, so I suggest waiting for sales on those.
However, unlike many other games ""cough* Planet Zoo ""cough*, these DLCs doesn't feel like blatant money grabs and will for the most part enhance your experience.",1645743861,1656694320,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This is a very good game that has the addictiveness of a empire builder. The art style has a nice fluid 2D style like that I first saw in Dragons Crown and Odin Sphere. About a year ago I sunk about 40 hours into a playthrough just to have the game hang up and freeze while loading a battle. I drop the game for a while.I hear about the devs releasing a series of patches to fix known issues.I start another playthrough today - the game hangs up and freezes while loading a battle.The Endless series is something I really like, and how it spans across multiple games and genres (Endless Dungeon) gives fans a lot of content to explore and a great world and history to flesh out.But when people are complaining that 2 year old bugs have been left unfixed, and having two playthroughs ruined from the same issue - it leaves a really bad impression and makes me wary to invest 30 to 40 or more hours in a game of theirs again.

The variety of races, galaxy configurations and victory conditions means it has a lot of replay value but sadly the AI is awful and seems hard-coded for races??
The ability to play a specific race with varying degrees of AI competency is surely not too much to ask! There is a general difficulty modifier but that's a very heavy-handed way of tweaking the setup that produces some pretty big swings in the results.

Oh yes and also you get to choose which exactly number will get you VICTORY111111 after getting to X value. The gameplay is ridiculously slow, wars are kinda stupid, alliances are kinda stupid, what you do at the end of the day is just watch the buildings get built and numbers go up, thats it.

Idk, it may be fun if you have like minimum 2, but really like 4 friends who are ready to buy this and spend a whole day playing, and then maybe you would find it fun and play several times more until you figure out some broken way to win or get bored of building buildings like me.

The races are all okay and different enough, but the differences don't change the gameplay that much. Plus they don't have new story lines and leaders during each new play through. Yea there are usually two or three choices during each quest stage, but once you've played one time with each race, you know what's going to happen. Don't bother trying to create a custom race. The story lines are the same and the customizer is excessive and overwhelming. At least the special events and items from probing are random. You will enjoy running around the galaxy and searching planets for interesting finds. This is definitely a strong point of the game. 

The diplomacy screen is weird. It's so hard to tell what other races are after, it's expensive to actually make agreements, and it feels impossible to make them like you, unless you can force peace on them, which doesn't seem to have any negative repercussions. Then they all declare war on you at the same time and you don't know why most of the races were even mad at you. Most of the time, I just ignore the diplomacy menu. 

You have to fight pirates, who always spawn in a system you need, but you don't start the game with a ship capable of fighting them. Why do I need to research a corvette class ship that's in the second tier of the research tree? Speaking of the research tree, it's not bad. I like that you have to do research to unlock colonizing certain planet types. It also doesn't feel excessive or overwhelming like some other games in this genre. You actually have fun reading through techs and planning a path.

The galaxy is usually viewed zoomed out while playing, but it can be zoomed in to the star system where you can probe with the right kind of ship, and it can be zoomed into the habitable planets, and into a single planet as well. You're build tab actually builds based on the star system, but each planet can be upgraded in several different ways if you research the tech and have the right luxury goods. All of this is really great with one flaw. You can move populations between colonized planets in each system, but there doesn't appear to be a way to move populations to other star systems. Maybe this is changed in later DLC, but you can find populations of minor races while probing, and they convert into a small ship that moves independently toward your star system. So I don't know why there isn't a similar function for your own populations.  

The early game is a blast, but the late game is just missing something. You'll get through most of the quests and expand to a point, but fighting to domination is just a slog and it will probably take forever for your ships to just get over there and then get back. The leaders could add a lot but you always get the same ones for each race and it takes forever to get new leaders.

- well built out back story and races
- AMAZING soundtrack
- gorgeous visuals and aesthetics 

But what is also has is some of the worst decision fatigue I've ever known in a turn based strategy. You can't go a SINGLE turn, even in the early game, without being bombarded by about half a dozen or more decisions or pop ups requiring you to decide between some arbitrary ""more cash less happy"" or ""more happy less cash"" decision, or yet another quest added to the half dozen or so other quests. It's just so much to tackle every single turn. 

That and frankly I find the battle system that Amplitude uses completely boring, didn't like it in Endless Legends, don't like it in Endless Space. You design ships (which just means upgrading to the highest level of whatever you already have), shove them in a fleet, throw in hero if you like (which grants the bonus of frequent pop ups to remind you to upgrade their skill tree), then pick a tactic card when you Engage in combat, but you always pick the same card and tactics, because they're the one that works, and then a little movie plays. Yay. 

Again, it has soooo much going for it, yet something just irks the hell out of me, and that's coming from someone who loves TBS and sci-fi - I've a stupid amount of hours well into frankly embarrassing triple digits for things like MOO2, Stellaris, Battlestar Galatica: Deadlock, etc, etc. but I can barely push past 50 here.

Have you ever felt that the current 4K strategy games are too passive? Well not here! You can feel the tension every game, starts of with fighting pirates and exploration, but alliances are formed, and the warfront explodes. Amplitude does this very well in their other games as well.


Why to get the game?:

1. It is better than Stellaris, always was, always will be

2. Soundtrack, couldn't ask for anything better. It is much better than stellaris. I don't know how to describe the Soundtrack. Can't stop humming to it. Not too repetitive either. Every race has its own theme music so whatever race you are playing, you are always in character. The only track I'm not a fan of is the elections. Thanks so much FlyByNo!

3. The actual battles in-game look like the ones in the trailer. (Unbelievable Right?) Can't stop watching the battles. Stellaris battles boring af.

4. Battle strategy actually exists compared to stellaris. Not only that but it works really well. Not too complicated.

5. Heroes, they work simpler and better than the dudes in stellaris. Assign them to a fleet or system and watch them thrive.

6. Tech tree makes sense. You can develop more into warships, empire development, economy or science and exploration. stellaris tech way too random.

7. Races are beautify unique. From a dude who has been cloning himself and perfecting himself, to trees that want to 'branch out'. From an empire 'craving' for war born from the ancients, to soul-infused robots that control time from another universe. From irresponsible scientists that blow things up 'for science', to an empire who only wants to trade and own everything in the galaxy passively. And whats not to love about a so called United Empire forged out of influence or dust lovers who simply want to rip essence out of everyone else for their church. Lets not get started on the guys from the DLCs.

8. Galactic currency, can be used to buy out literally anything, because dust can do literally anything - if you have enough of it. Includes strategic and luxury resources like all 4X games should. Strategic resources work in ranks while luxury resources each provide unique bonuses. 

9. Ground battles OK, could use more enlightenment. Don't watch the ground battles unless only to listen to the music. At least the invasion system means you can siege the system before invasion, drop off troops and fly back to go get more. 

10. Victory! the victory conditions are done well. Science requires almost all the techs, not all of them (I'd say get the good ones but they are all good!). Of course you always got the Domination of capturing all capitals. The one of getting a certain number of systems is annoying. It says that they are close but really they are not and it doesnt tell you how close. I would prefer it if it tells you how many systems away they are. Your two options are: rage war against them (Fun) or ally yourselves with them (so that they need more systems to win and it gives you time to prepare). There is also a economic victory for literally owning like 75% of all dust in the entire galaxy or something. If you like timing you can win multiple victories in one turn. For example: you take the last capital which brings your total systems up to the required to win on the same turn you build the last wonder. 

The game needs more good reviews. Please recommend this game to others. This game, even though it currently has very positive reviews is underrated. I need it to be Overwhelmingly Positive. Help me.

* It has a ton of creative but poorly executed mechanics. A ton of things that should be cool, but turn out to be ""just another production booster"", that You go through in bulk.
* It has great writing and setup, that just doesn't matter, because questing is pretty bad and irritating.
* It doesn't communicate well... Theres a lot of little mechanics that You need to track, that You will not be taught about, or You will be taught by annoying popup that covers the interface. It doesn't communicate well the victory conditions, nor allows to track these conditions well. You won't know that there are weapons that shoot rockets unless You read on forums.
* The UI and the animations itself is beautiful, but damn counter-productive. To level up a hero, which You will get to level up a couple of times each game. You will have to drag the mouse 6-8 times across the screen to press a button. At this point it's just flashing annoying images in front of You...

The only thing that would make this game perfect is if you can control the land and space battles, however with the amount of mods you can do before you enter battle makes up for it.

game although it's not a bad game and it's actually very good game which is 
obvious when you play it although it's not perfect [/h1]

I really like sci fi games taking place in space.

That why my hopes for this game (as for any good looking space game) were quite high.
After spending 50 hours with it, I can definitely say one thing... It's a good game, It's certainly not perfect... But it's still a good game. 

I'm not gonna explain exactly how this game works but before pointing out good and bad sides of it I have to say that personally... I don't see any major flaws of it. Of course I would have changed few things but none of its flaws are that bad to make it unplayable or annoying. After that short introduction of ENDLESS Space 2 let's talk about it's good and bad sides

[b] <GOOD SIDES> [/b]
1. ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC FACTION DESIGN
Seriously, they look great and apart from the looks, each of them differs (at least a bit) in case of gameplay.

2. GRAPHICS
ENDLESS Space 2 looks great, much better than Stellaris (in my opinion)

3. SPACE BATTLES (one of my favorite battle mechanics in all strategy games)
Ok, I didn't mean battle mechanics but battle... cutscenes? I'm not sure how to call it
but I absolutely love it. And yes you can't control your ships during battle which is quite sad and it's one of the thing I'd change, but it still looks amazing. The moment when your ship starts to fire missiles at the enemies
looks and feels great.

4. EVOLUTION NOT REVOLUTION
I feel like many games today (espacially AAA titles) are trying to add some crazy features and change everything.
ENDLESS Space 2 on the other hand is simply evolving and that's also why this game is so good (although it's also it's biggest disadvantage for me).

[b] <BAD SIDES> [/b]
1. EVOLUTION WITHOUT (some major!) REVOLUTION
A moment ago I said that one of the good sides about this game is that it's not trying
to make some amazing revolutions. although there are some major changes I'm still
missing something new. I will be honest, this is personal for me. Because nowadays I'm having problem finding new games with fresh mechanics and don't get me wrong, there's a big chance that ENDLESS Space 2 would have been much worse if developers decided to add some new mechanics but I still miss something new in this
title. Of course there are some major changes but none of them is entirely new in the world of strategy games
This is the biggest disadvantage for me in this game and of course there are some thing that I don't really like (like a system for expanding the planets) but none of them feels wrong and makes game bad
[h1] VERY GOOD 8/10 TITLE
IT'S NOT AS GOOD AS STELLARIS
FOR ME (ALTHOUGH IT DOES MANY THING BETTER!)
BUT IT'S STILL WORTH MONEY AND TIME

Their forte is creating visually and aurally attractive games with truly unique factions that play very differently from each other. And this game delivers what is possibly the best Turn-Based space 4X game available on Steam. All the factions in the base game require the player to take a very different approach to the game and not just play the same game with each faction (Of course, you can try to do that if you play on the lowest difficulty settings).

Not only do they have different play styles but their ship models vary from race to race. The Riftborn have ships with lots of weapon slots on them and so they can make hard hittersz while the Unfallen have ships with lots of defensive and support slots but only one weapon slot.

The factions also have their own unique quest lines which grant the player new heroes or improvements to build on their colonies. These quests are in addition to the many collective or competitlve  quests that are ongoing in the game. You can ignore all of these if you just want to play a 'straight' 4X game but you will miss out on some powerful rewards.

There are a lot of unique and innovative game features in the base game at the end of its life. The Hacking system is a bit of a marmite-like feature - you'll either love how different it all is or you'll find it a complete distraction and boring but it sure is different. I have absolutely no idea why they didn't take the government and laws system from this game into Humankind. Especially as each race in your empire has different political biases so that you can find yourself sliding towards Militaristic governments  if you assimilate the 'wrong' independent civs. It's simply one of the best systems I've seen in any 4X game like this.

I'd like to add that unlike some space 4X games, this game allows you to design ship classes from your hull types which don't auto upgrade to the newest version using that hull type. If you create a dedicated decloaker and call it 'Snoopy', it will only upgrade to the newest version of the 'Snoopy' ship and not the latest hull type like other games when you upgrade your fleets. I design all manner of specialised ships to incorporate into my fleets and I wish other space 4X allowed me to do the same.",1648955289,1649210941,True,12,0,0.610696017742156982,0,True,False,False

Do you like mindnumbingly beautiful symphonic and electrical soundtracks with hints of what sounds like space fireflies whispering into your ears after an evening of dropping acid? well this games soundtrack is going to be a positive for you, as it is for me. It is gorgeous and encapsulating.

Have you ever wanted a UI in a 4X that gives you every possible ounce of information you have ever wanted on sixteen different scales and platforms for your drooling little human brain to comprehend over and over until you eventually lapse into a coma of knowledge? If so then ES2 has the UI for you! Its overly complex as f*ck and takes far too long to register in your brain which part means what but once you get used to it (400 hours in) it makes complete sense and you will use it to your advantage more than the AI will! (because they are dumb as sack of hammers and about as threatening as an unvaccinated toddler on most difficulties below the hardest two)

Races! They mean everything to people who are not boring as shit and care not for the aesthetics of your average 4X games, though ES2 is far from your average 4X. The races are very diverse! Carrying their own traits and quirks, Spacefaring and planet based units, abilities that do everything from warping time to shooting a massive f*cking deathstar-esq hole through an entire system and literally voring an entire planet, political standings and parties, government archetypes, along with their own unique ways to completely lambaste and destroy every possible living (or synthetic we don't discriminate in our genocide here in the universe of ES2) organism that does not heed their conglomerate will and ultimate goal to f*ck you and everyone in their way.

Such wonderful races include...
Science crazed suicidal space midgets!
Trees, but they're space trees :D
Bug people with a trade confederacy and tiddies!
Bug people but with a voracious hunger to eradicate everything (less tiddies)
Space dust religious fanatics with the sweetest god damn cloaks and apparel you have ever seen.
Edgy cyborg bird samurai people with extra regicide sauce! (supremacy not included)
And so many more... with more to come in the future aswell as this game is still supported and gets updates! (as of early 2019)

There are so many ways to play this game over time. Whether it be pacifism and galactic peace and prosperity, economic glory and wealth beyond rapport, Religious supremacy and control, complete and total annihilation across all words, or just a general “Go f*ck yourself” ez science victory ( so glad they nerfed that shit). If the complexity of the gameplay does not pull you in then I could only hope the beauty if the game does. The landscaping (spacescaping?), cinematic introduction shorts, and beautiful pre-built (and custom built) races; major and minor. All brought me a euphoric exploratory wonder i hope that if even it is a fraction of what i felt just upon loading up my first campaign that you too might feel the joy i felt on some level. Even if you don’t care for anything aesthetic or lorebound to ES2 if you were to look at this game at its very most basic values and down to just the fundamentals it is stunning, thrilling and an overall one of a kind 4X game. It is highly worth picking up if you know what you are doing, i can't say id easily recommend it to someone new to the genre because of just how in-depth it is but if you care to do your research online and don't mind reading tutorials its easy enough to learn especially if you have played Endless legend or the previous title Endless space.",1552181332,1647994859,True,80,41,0.804508507251739502,3,True,False,False

Multiplayer isn't something I've had a chance to try, but the framework is solid and I look forward to finding opponents.

I've been enjoying a very well developed game, it also acts as a great writing prompt. The art while sparse is well done, the soundtrack a good offering in the industry.

The game play mechanics do lend itself to hoard tactics late game against the AI, but the early to mid game allows a lot of out of the box strategy as well as tactical responses to random or unforseen events.

 More actions to use said tactics, and you can very easily just fall into the hoard tactics and tech race that WILL dominate most of your late game strategy. 4 Stars on a 5 star scale.",1647717029,1647717029,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Pros
-The game and soundtrack are just beautiful looking and sounding from ship designs to systems.
-Each race is actually unique to play and you have to change your playstyle for each one
-The game has an amazing a rich lore and IMO the best in the endless series so far
-The UI is very streamlined with hidden features to make things easier for the advanced player

Mehs
-AI can be a little dumb and passive
-Game really shines when you have a lot of human players and not as many AI, war actually becomes strategetic against humans

Cons
-Some AI do many times better than the others in almost every game I play the Lumeris are at the top and Vodyani are almost never good as a human player, others have their hits and misses such as the Unfallen.

All in all this is probably the best 4X out there, maybe not in single player but the game shines when playing with friends.

Meanwhile SEGA, your owner, decided to stay away from their credo ""Games out of Politics"" and block certain regions to prevent purchases from ordinary gamers, your long time fans. I know a lot of people who bought the whole endless saga with all your dlc's to support you back in the old days. They are simple gamers from different countries, with different features, age, gender, life. Your games united them. Your games made them feel free from the downsides of real life and all the dirt that was somewhere there outside their homes. They came here to struggle with the game mechanics and to build strategies, to do in-game politics and not the real ones.

I've bought your games, gifted them to my friends, shared this gem with everyone I knew and advertised it as long as I could. And I know a lot of people who did so too. 
But for now it's obvious that ""Games out of Politics"" doesn't work for SEGA anymore. 
If you wanted to affect politicians, then why did your publisher decide to get rid of simple gamers, the ones who supported you since you had no publisher? Who did votes in your devblogs? Whom did you ask any time you wanted to make a new faction or a new dlc? These people were among them.
 
Gamers don't make real wars, the politicians do.

ES2 is amazing in so many ways: The UI, the general atmosphere, the music. The way info is brought to you works well. Exploration is amazing. Minor factions, heroes, huge fleets, behemoths, pretty unique factions. The Endless Universe. Wow, what more could you ask? 

Well sadly, so many systems are boring or complex for no reason. In the end, they make the game frustrating and leave you bored and unwilling to start a new game. One more turn? No thanks... Here are a couple of examples. 

The elections and political parties system is a total snooze fest. Just ignore it. Combat is boring as well, you barely have any control over what's going on. It always seems to favor the AI, somehow. Don't even mention diplomacy...

The tech tree is super hard to navigate, it's hard to find stuff you're looking for. The luxury resources are nearly useless compared to Endless Legend, as they're only used for upgrading your star systems. 

Late in the game when everyone's at war, it's even hard to spot, or select fleets and figure out what belongs to who. That's ridiculous. ...So many pop-ups! 

I'd love to recommend that game, but I can't. It has too many shortcomings that make it boring as hell. You often buy a game for its cool stuff.

I think the game is pretty enjoyable in the early to mid game.  However, like all 4x games, it becomes a slog to manage everything in the late to end game.  The different playable races are pretty cool, with each one having a uniqueness that changes the gameplay to make things more challenging or interesting.  It is too bad that, unlike Stellaris, you can't seem to reverse engineer tech after a battle.

However, I really don't want to micromanage the pops on each planet.  Just let the pop naturally jump to the planet they like the most or give the most bonus and call it done?  There is an automation feature, but it makes some nonsensical choices most of the time.

Combat is simple ... forget everything and just load up on missiles and beam weapons and fire away at long range.  This strategy works about 99% of the time against the AI.  I've never felt the need to balance Long, Medium and Short range builds because the battles still suffer from the doom stack trope.

Although there was this time that the nearly defeated enemy decided to sneak (or maybe I wasn't paying attention) a doomsday ship into my system and blow up a planet.  Something, something crying out in agony, something ... However, one turn later (with a terraforming beheamoth) and I have a newly minted lava planet that I can terraform further?  Terraforming is just ... broken ...

I also get annoyed by this artificial penalty for conquering too many systems.  So what?  If a system is 100% Ecstatic but becomes unhappy because I conquered 4 more systems, what gives?  Oh, all I have to do is build happiness buildings on my planet and they're magically happy again?  Ok that's ... not really fun ... just more micromanagement and excuses to spend science to happiness buildings ...

่แต่ผมกลับติด endless legend งอมแงม
ทั้งเควสต์แทรกเนื้อเรื่อง ระบบการเล่น เมคานิคต่างๆ ที่ทำให้แต่ละอารยธรรมมีความแตกต่างกันจริงๆฟ้ากับเหว (ไม่ใช่แค่มียูนิทพิเศษนิดหน่อยแบบ CIV) 
ข้อดีทั้งหมดของ legend ถูกจับมาใส่ในเกมนี้ และปรับปรุงระบบต่างๆให้กลายเป็นเกมสร้างอารยธรรมแห่งดวงดาว
Endless Space 2 = Endless Legend + Endless Space
รูปแบบการเล่นทำได้ดีมาก แต่ละเผ่ายังคงมีความแตกต่างทางการเล่นที่ต่างกันโคตรๆเหมือนเดิม
ถ้าจะให้พูดข้อดีแล้วล่ะก็ ความแตกต่างในการใช้ยุทธวิธีในการเล่นแต่ละเผ่า คือจุดแข็งสุดๆของเกมนี้เลย อย่างเช่น
- เผ่า aggro โหมต้นเกม ที่ต้องบริหารจัดการการใช้งานทาสบนดาว
- เผ่ารวย เน้นใช้เงินซื้อทุกอย่าง (แม้กระทั่งดาว)
- เผ่าที่มีระบบดาวได้ระบบเดียว แต่ใช้วิธีการแฮคแพร่กระจายสายลับเหมือนเชื้อโรคเพื่อยึดทั้งกาแลกซี่
- เผ่าหุ่นยนต์ที่เน้นการสร้างประชากรของตัวเองในโรงงาน
- เผ่าที่มีประตูวาประหว่างดวงดาว
-เผ่าแวมไพร์อวากาศที่ต้องคอยส่งยานไปดูดเลือดจากแต่ละระบบดาวเพื่อนำมาสร้างโคตรยาน Stardestroyer
- เผ่าต้นไม้อวากาศที่คอยสร้างรากชอนไชไปตามระบบดาวเพื่อยึดครอง
เมื่อนำจุดดีจุดเด่น ข้อได้เปรียบและข้อด้อยข้างบน มาผสมกับการสร้างจักรวาลใหม่ทุกรอบการเล่น ทำให้มั่นใจได้เลยว่า ทุกๆการเล่นของคุณจะไม่เหมือนเดิม และต้องคอยปรับเปลี่ยนกลยุทธ์อยู่เสมอ และเกมเพลย์ยังไม่บังคับแนวการเล่นของแต่ละเผ่าอีกด้วย
กล่าวคือคุณจะเล่นเผ่านักรบแรงงานทาสที่ไม่เน้นการทหารแต่เน้นศาสนาเพื่อเพิ่มประชากร หรือนำเผ่าเทคโนโลยีมาใช้ในการเร่งวิจัยเทคโนโลยีทหารตั้งแต่ต้นเกม เพื่อปั๊มยานเลเซอร์อาวุธหนักมาไล่บี้ต้นเกมก็ได้ บอกเลยว่าคุณสามารถคิดเพลย์สไตล์หลากหลายมาแก้ทางเมต้าได้โดยใช้แค่ไอเดียของคุณเท่านั้น
ตัวเกมยังมีระบบเควสต์แข่งขันที่คอยส่งเสริม (และยุยง) ให้ผู้เล่นคอยสู้กันตลอดเวลา (ไม่ว่าจะเป็นด้านเศรษฐกิจ, ทหาร หรือเทคโนโลยี) ทำให้เกมนี้เป็นเหมือนเกมกระดานที่คุณสามารถเล่นกับเพื่อนคอเดียวกันเป็นหมู่คณะได้ 
สรุปเลยคือถ้าคุณชอบ Space 4x สำหรับผมนี่คือเกม Space 4x ที่ดีที่สุดตอนนี้

Various quests weave together story elements to help give you direction beyond what is emchanically optimum at any given moment. 

Each pregenerated species is different enough that you have to approach their game play differently. This imparts a strong measure of replayability. This divergence also creates disparity. Once you understand how each species plays, it can become easy to proverbially game the system, and a lack of parity between species is revealed. For better or worse, these trends continue through the expansions: Each new species is unique, some leaning heavily on newly introduced mechanics, like behemoths and hacking, but again there is clear disparity among the new species.

The expansions also introduce mechanics elements that slowly bog the game down. At least one of these, the Academy, quickly becomes obnoxious, as there is no way to actually eliminate it, so it's fleets will continue to magically spawn and try to take systems.

Like similar games, Endless Space 2 suffers in the end game. You can quickly find yourself clicking ""next turn"" just to get the game over with.

Pros
Different Ships for the different races
Within a session, you can upgrade your ships and planets, even to the point of terraforming later in game
Nice variety of technologies to pick from
You get option to either watch the battles, or skip if you want faster game
Multi-player, including co-op against AI (Big plus in my book)
Lots of options for difficulty and universe setup
With the right techs, you can blow up planets.  Gas giants especially explode nice.
Custom races give you some cool options for replay
There is just something fun about conquering the galaxy :)
There are a lot of report and selection screens, but they are well laid out
Lot of subtle player helpers in the game, like different shape for types of technology, ability to rename planets of fleets to help keep them straight, etc.  I wish more games paid this much attention to detail.

Cons
The technology screen is a bit clunky to move around in, but you can still get everything done by zooming in and out

For those two reasons alone this game totally delivers  as a chill experience of awe and discovery.

There are some cons I would like to highlight too. First, the game interface is very cool and sleek but not so intuitive, really. I have played about 35 hours at the time I am writing this review and there are quite a few things I do not know. Same happens with many of the game mechanics, I still do not understand some of the tech and dependencies, particularly stuff like hacking, the Academy and super-weapons (some of these are from expansions). 

So, this is a game that can become quite opaque and difficult to understand what is going on. As an anecdote, my first play-through I thought I was winning and doing quite well, but actually an enemy empire had significantly advanced their ship tech and wiped me out. I still only have a very faint idea of how combat works. I think the game could do a better job explaining, I do not have the time to go browsing around the web. That said, trial and error is working so I imagine I will figure things out. 

I got most of the expansions on a bundle sale because they add cool factions to the game. Have not had the time to play those much yet. I have heard the last expansion, the Nakalim, is quite bad, but I do not know personally. I do think that the expansions can make the game quite expensive, so I suggest people get them on a sale if they really like the game.

Fresh edit: I'm conflicted. On the one hand, this game is great. It does a turn based galactic strategy thing well and I enjoy the various options for doing stuff and how stuff is done. It's all rather engaging and exciting if you're the type of person who could get into Cookie Clicker.

On the other hand, it's a giant time-sink with no progression outside of the progression within a round. Even if a round goes poorly and you're bound to lose or be severely restricted in your growth or exploration, it's better to soldier on because otherwise you're losing hours of play. I own all the expansions, but I turned them all off because the expansions are quite game-changing. I'll turn them on as I play more, but there's enough to do and get used to in the base game already.

It has a silent story of rising and then falling, and then rising again from the ashes. It can be highly addicting. The mechanics, complexites and randomness of everything can lead to tens or even hundreds of hours of fun. Even if you only posses the vanilla game.
The reason behind that is that each faction is extremely unique. Unlike ES1 (Endless Space 1), factions are extremely different from each other. Posses powerful gameplay-defining traits and abilities. Some even require unique resources or have a unique approach to resources. One faction may require food to grow, another may require industry to be built, another may require harvestable from enemies *blood-like* substance to grow. One faction may use influence to heavily increase its production, other gains passive bonuses to science but suffers as a jack of all trades, master of none faction.
Balance is not key here. Obviously, if you looked hard enough, you would find out that things are shit.
Vodoyani are probably the worst faction in the game, and Riftborn are stupidly overpowered. However, the thing is that...
No one ever bothered to look hard enough. There's no meta, because there's no multiplayer, and the game is so stupidly random and easy that it does not matter what faction is strong and which one isn't.
Every single faction has its own quirks, and playing them isn't about winning, it's about utilizing them to their best advantages and their worst weaknesses.
Technologies serve less as powerful boosts to everything and more like ways to make up for your unlucky spawning location. Military development can be sabotaged by poor diplomacy. Food output can fail if there's not enough science to allow a faction to spread quickly enough throughout science demanding planets like Lava, Gas or Barren.
Science empires can fail if they do not make up for the fact that their industry is complete garbage.
The way how this game's gameplay works is like this...
You are given a mallet. But you have no hands.
Then you are given a computer which you can use telepathically. You have an infinite amount of time and an infinite amount of resources, figure out how you are going to use the mallet.
And there are a lot of ways to use the mallet.
You can make up for your lacking industry by building a massive population and boosting it by per planet bonuses of structures that utilize multiple planet systems to give you massive industry, science and food boosts.
You can find strategic resources like anti-matter and use it to make up for the fact that everyone hates living on lava planet, by giving them structures that give you free approvaly ratings (popularity, population happiness). Then you can colonize lava planet and use its massive industrial output to build a massive fleet and protect yourself.
Lacking science? Go find a planet with high science output and learn to live on it.
Lacking population? Figure out a way to gain the most food on system or perhaps use the migration mechanics.
Feeling like colonizing additional systems but the game tells you that your population feels stretched enough already? Switch to Federation and gain extra systems before triggering disapproval maluses.
Your favourite party got kicked out of the government? Switch to dictatorship and enforce it, and then use propaganda to keep it in power.
Not only does this all feel so unique and expansive, and mechanically deep, but also realistic.
Beneath the layers of gameplay Endless Space 2 is a brilliant commentary upon our modern day politics. Even though it happens in space and with weird quirky sexy aliens, things still work by our rules. Governments have to trick their populations via propaganda to go to wars, and in order to gain this propaganda power they have to construct illusions of their own grandiose. Democracy loving nations may become twisted and horrifying in order to attain some imperialist goal like growing in size. Militarist dictatorships fall apart due to a failling economy. Leaders of nations disappoint their people by trying to gain leverage with more powerful actors behind the scenes.
Approval ratings of populations are gained by distracting them from things that are currently happening via consumption.
Military-industrial powerhouse is sustained via unbelievably strong economies.
Factions around the galaxy are fighting or ignoring each other in order to reach their own personal goals.
Everything just flows around like water in some spinning blade wall and the things just are bright...
I recommend this game.
If it's not on sale, just buy the vanilla experience and don't care about the DLCs.
The original vanilla Endless Space 2 will always be the best due to how simple and beautiful it is.

Firstly the major issues with some DLCs, e.g. Awakening with nearly everyone is considering as just game breaking or Dark Matter, which has some bugs that are still not fixed.
Secondly no good wiki neither ingame nor online exists which is really annoying when you are new to the game and have to go through steam/reddit posts to find stuff and yes there is a fandom wiki, but it is nowhere near being complete.
Finally you have no endgame, if you play for a fast victory you can win before you reach the most high tier techs and if not the balancing of the high tier techs is just broken.

tl;dr:
If you are looking for a scifi 4x game, especially when you are new to this genre, wait until Stellaris with its DLCs is on sale and then go play Stellaris.
If you already have Stellaris and are just bored as me maybe buy this game on sale but do not expect too much.",1643555325,1643573316,False,3,0,0.5,1,True,False,False

With that said, understand that this is a COMPLEX 4X Turn-based space empire stategy game. I had to look up the 4X part myself - It's just a term for explore & conquer. However, don't believe that's a simple process for this game. Note: This isn't a build your force and beat all comers in outright battle kind of game. I wish it was. Instead there are ""Certain Conditions That Must Be Met"" by your empire or allied faction to win the game. Otherwise you will play the game for over 100 turns, thinking that you are doing great, until everything stops and a 'You Are Defeated' screen pops up telling you that you are a failure instead. This means there is a lot that you have to plan out ahead of time to win. 

Endless Space 2 offers Six (6) Different Ways To Win The Game, which play to the ""Various Strengths of the Different Factions"". These can be turned on and off when starting a match but are set in stone once you begin a game. In other words, just randomly going Rambo here doesn't work. 

The Tutorial Guide is handy and I do recommend using it to get the basic mechanics down but it never mentions the six victory conditions outright. So the game tosses lore, quests and political intrigue in your face instead of highlighting the final end goals that must be attained to qualify you for winning. That's a big negative in my book but I can't figure out a great way to solve that problem since 6 paths of strategy are employed here. I'm sure something could be done to emphasis that! 

So don't play this game blindly. Go online to the Wiki Sites and use the Steam Community to nail down a solid understanding of how you can win this thing. That's what I'm doing. 

And the animated space fleet battles are great fun to watch! The ground battle graphics suck but you can't have everything.

It's strange though, because I REALLY like Stellaris, and people criticize Stellaris for the same things that I'm criticizing this game for. The difference for me is that Stellaris has something to it that makes my imagination go wild, but Endless Space 2 fails to curate my imagination in the same way.",1643394520,1643394520,False,24,0,0.60062718391418457,0,True,False,False

There are better reviews out there, so I'll just summarize what ES2 does so well in the 4x genre: keeping your attention long enough for you to master the mechanics. 

The learning curve is hidden behind unique faction mechanics. For instance, if you play the Unfallen, you expand your empire in a different manner compared to say, a Hissio. So you're not exactly learning the game from scratch, but learning a race, just like how you would do in Starcraft. The mechanics that you need to learn grows organically for some of the beginner factions, and paces really well as you learn new gameplay mechanics when you actually need them.

Long story short, this is a game where if you dig deep enough, you'll find that the game designers gave a hell lot of thought to every single detail. Me, I don't like how the combat works (too simple for me), but it doesn't stop me from appreciating the sheer amount of content that you'll get from this game.

I kinda feel I agree and I get where they're coming from. That being said, I just can't get over the quality of this 4x strategy and I'm surprised it's not getting more attention.

ES2 is sure not optimized for newbies, it takes time to get into the game and there's just so much overwhelming the casual player right off the bat that most of my friends just drop it after a while, not really learning to get into the game. This is a common issue with many strategies in general — most other genres have learned to squeeze in relevant bits of tutorial as you go, but strategies — and 4x titles in particular — just shower you for hours with lots of data: resources, modifiers, interactions and so on. That alone can deter a potentially interested player from getting to actually PLAY the game.

I'm actually still somewhere in the middle of learning the ropes myself, but something about ES2 just got me hooked. Like the planet overview screen that lists its mineral and atmosphere composition — got no idea if that has any impact on the gameplay but that's so freaking cool I just find myself browsing planets and trying to find some relation between those parameters and world types.

Ultimately, this is a great-looking game that's best approached as a journey. You probably have to be willing to let it take you in — otherwise you probably won't stick around.

Oh and if you're deterred by the cost, it gets some massive discounts during sales, so at least wishlist it to help it grow. :)",1642573940,1642573940,True,1,0,0.507042229175567627,0,True,False,False

Why can't there be something that uses the Future without lame Magic or other made up garbage?

Well If you think space can be cool, and hate Magic Space with elfs and other stupid trash, then let me introduce you to Endless Space Universe.

Endless Space is about different races all of which are based on rules that could apply to this universe (minus one STUPID GHOST RACE, like fucking coming on. Get that out of this game) No magic, just different races via for control. There is a bit of lore on an ancient race that blah blah blah, but in the end you just need to build a bunch of ships, and start blasting the inferior races out of existence. 

PS. There is a race based on a guy who said ""Fuck you guys"", and just cloned himself a billion times. Such a cool concept.",1642431791,1642431791,True,7,3,0.513817965984344482,0,True,False,False

BUT if you say, compare this to civ (which is the more refined flagship series in this genre) or even endless legend (which actually hass some pros over es2 despite being much older), youll notice the limitations of the gameplay. ironically being in space means you have LESS room to play with. its like the only pointss you can travel to are the cities/nodes. which is realistic to be fair because theres no point to roaming around the endless void. but on ground, the map feels fuller and better to move around. which is maybe why they made Humanity. kinda disapointed that they removed the fantasy/scifi setting in that but ill still try it eventually.

392110,107662232,76561199230666977,0,21,421,0,389,1659218548,"I think this game is boring and feels clunky in some parts.
Perharps I haven't played long enough to see the meat of this game, but so far I've had a rather repetitive experience which made me stop playing.

I liked very much how diplomacy was handled. It's not just about giving gifts and making handshakes, but it's a real powerstruggle to see who is coming on top and can dominate the other, to see who can push their ""pressure"" bar to the other's side. Anything that would exert pressure on another nation in real life or in multiplayer games works here, making it feel more like you deal with real people/nations.

The game occasionally throws quests at the player, either in the form of a ""mainline quest"" that every faction gets, or random quests that everyone competes for or that just you personally to complete. There are also random ""events"" that affect your entire empire for a few rounds, where you are typically given 2-3 choices for different effects. For example, would you rather have +10 happiness in all systems at the cost of -10% industry, or would you rather have +10% industry at the cost of -10% spice?
 Some people don't like such randomness in their games, but I think it's a nice way of adding unpredictable situations and giving a better chance for underdogs, also causing you to potentially adapt your entire empire in response to something and giving it a different trajectory, even if I didn't like quests because that meant I had to do more micromanagement.

The politics system means that certain parties get political seats depending on what actions you take or happen to you. For example, if you doa lot of warring, you're pretty much guaranteed to get  the military party on the political seats. The longer a party stays in power, the more exclusive and powerful laws become available to you. These cost ""influence"" to upkeep per population and affect the entire empire. Yeah, there are a lot of resources and also special resources in the game which you might want to trade for if you want for example better ships or a wonder structure.
I feel the politics system acts like a momentum. If you get momentum into the ecologist direction, it's gonna take a little effort and giving up the exclusive ecologist laws if you want to change your empire's momentum. You can't go from full eco to full militarist in a few turns. But it's mostly a question if you really want that faction's laws or not.

The game has undeniably good art, even if I find some of the faction designs appear awkward.
I did not like the ""minimalist"" approach of the UI, I think it made it difficult to keep track of what was happening in some screens and also navigating through them. You'll get used to it eventually, but I didn't like it, and I think it helped to instill a sense of homogenity across the game - light-gray blue hues and minimalism everywhere. It could have helped if the UI adapted to whatever faction you are playing, so that you could have a more industrial atmosphere or worldview when playing as the Humans, for example.

Frankly, I have not played so far to get a good grasp of the game's flow, and I will not comment much on that aspect, but it seems there are many ways to combine and select technologies in an interesting way. I assume the gameplay can be good if you look away from the micromanaging and repetitive tasks, and the ship interface.

This critic ties in with the UI, but ship interfaces and using them felt clunky. It was also confusing for me when I realized that I couldn't send ships back when they were travelling on a starline - they first had to reach their destination and then do a 180 spin back. Maybe they're actually some sort of portal so it makes sense in lore? I don't know.

It's possible to get very different starting positions. Some people complain that this is unfair, but I think that depends on your view and whether you play multiplayer or not. It can be interesting for singleplayer.

There are a handful of mods for this game, and there still seems to be an active community for it. If you open the multiplayer list, it's likely you will find some games. I believe a lot of people use the ""get2gether"" thing to organize.",1641730371,1641731147,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

First some game play info: ES2 & GC3 are turn based while Stell is real time (but with the ability to pause and make decisions it can play like a turn based). Navigation in GC3 is grid based, while navigation in GS2 and Stell is from star to star via warp lanes (GS2’s tech tree does eventually unlock open navigation, but you can’t intercept ships in open space, only at star systems). Economy management in GS2 is at the solar system level, while GC3 and Stell are at the planet level. As of January 2022 both GC3 and Stell continue to see patching / updates, while GS2 has not been patched since the last DLC release in May 2021, which was released behind schedule and is of terrible quality. Now to rate each on a few key aspects (in no particular order)… 

Most stable base game: ES2

Most stable with DLCs: Stell (ES2’s last DLC simply does not work, but the rest are fine; also, GC3 is very stable, I’ve just had one or two hiccups)

Best graphics: ES2

Largest map: GC3 (it’s not even close, you can go crazy with this one with 35+ opponents and hundreds of colonizable planets; but you do need 32GB RAM and an 8 core CPU to pull off the largest map)

Best story line: ES2

Best ship customizer: GC3 (Tech tree in GC3 unlocks ship weight limits to do whatever you want with, while Stell and ES2 ships have modules to select different tech from, with Stell probably having a more diverse tech tree between the two) (also of note, in GC3 you can also customize the ship’s appearance, and players have come up with some cool designs, but appearance has no impact on the ship’s performance)

Best combat mechanic: ES2 (once combat starts there’s really not much you can do in any of the games, however in ES2 you can at least set formations which offer bonuses and can take advantage of your weapons loadout based on the range that’s most optimal; ES2’s combat graphics are pretty cool at least)

Best hero / citizen mechanic: ES2 

Best tutorial: ES2

Best races: ES2 (each race not only have different attributes, but some can introduce some really fun mechanics unique to that race, completely changing how you approach game play)

Best end-game mechanics: Stell (on this note, if you want something that’s easy and simple to win, Stell is not your friend, go with ES2) (GC3 does not have an end-game mechanic, which sometimes turns it into a grind fest) (ES2’s endgame mechanic is not bad if you’ve kept up to that point)

Most challenging: Stell 

Best ability to customize economy: GC3 (you get a set number of land plots per planet based on it’s quality to do with as you please, which can influence your population, production, research, etc; in ES2 planet size and quality influence your population cap and a small number of build choices; in Stell planet size and quality influence the amount of infrastructure you can build, and thus can influence population too)

Best computer-assisted economy management: Draw (each game allows you to put management of colony economy on auto-pilot so you’re not spending time micromanaging stuff and to be honest I hate all of them as I tend to be a little OCD about stuff; but as I haven’t come up with a better way, I’ll live with it)

I don’t have a clear cut favorite, as I tend to rotate between the three, but due to the amount of freedom in ship design, economy management, as well as open galaxy navigation, I tend to play GC3 a little more as ES2 almost feels restrictive in comparison.",1641442244,1641442244,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

ES2 is easily one of the best Turn-based 4x games out there, and up there among the best 4x games, period.  It's not as in-depth as Stellaris or Distant Worlds, but that's not really a bad thing.  There is still plenty of depth to this game and tough choices to make, but I find myself more relaxed when playing this game compared to the other 2.  

 What this game does best is let you have enough input in combat, ship design, and colony management without being too complex or excessive with micromanagement.  Nothing feels overly complex but there is plenty of strategy in the choices you make.  

Combat in this game is very unique, unlike any other 4x game you've played.  You have a say with what formation you want your fleet to be in (which is key since certain weapons perform better at certain range), but you don't have any direct control over what goes on, you just watch the action unfold in a cinematic battle.

ES2 is simply an overall solid 4x game, especially a turn-based one.  There is plenty of depth in this game without feeling too complex.  A lot of things feel simple and relaxed without it feeling dulled down or too easy.  That can be a good or bad thing depending what you're looking for.  The soundtrack to this game is also phenomenal, as well as the first Endless Space.

I like that compared to it's predecessor the combat system has been simplified to some extent, as well as the ship design aspect. I like the abundance of things you can do during a turn and the various aspects of your empire you need to keep an eye on. It's complex but without being overwhelming.

It still suffers some glaring issues. The UI hasn't been improved compared to the previous instalment, if anything is even more confusing and unhelpful. The same goes for the tech part, I personally think it's a massive failure.

Despite the issues, it's still a very good game and a must play for any 4x enthusiast.

LE: No it's fucking not, it's a shit game after all.

I dug a little bit deeper into this game and it has proven to be an exercise in frustration and not fun at all. There's no skill involved in this game, only luck. You have to be lucky to get the right planets with the right resources and the right neighbours. AI controlled players are way too overpowered and you don't stand a chance against them early on. Quests are ridiculous and not useful, sometimes you get a choice quest where you have to choose between two options thare are equally bad. Tech tree in particular is ridiculous because everything is shuffled around and there's no aparent logical connection between techs. For example, the tech to colonise certain types of planets can be very high up the tech tree and it can happen that you only have those types of planets around. You want to colonise that planet with those juicy strategic resources? Haha, fuck you.

A lot of the advanced weapons and improvements are very dependent on strategic resources that are quite hard to find. So, again, fuck you.

This game is way too dependent on a dice roll and this is making it artificially more difficult, alongside with giving the AI a massive edge, even on normal difficulty. This is not enjoyable, this is a chore.

If you are masochistic enough and you enjoy being fucked with a barbed truncheon up the arse without lube (virtually, of course) then this game might be for you.",1641155013,1641233196,False,2,0,0.480069220066070557,0,True,False,False

It hosts the same spirit as TI while hosting a plethora of unique features. I was particularly impressed when it came to the galaxy generation. As a result of the RNG on constellations (systems that are connected to each other via star lanes), system composition, faction placement, and undeveloped civilization placement (civilizations you can assimilate, destroy, leave alone) -- no two games are played the same. The available factions increase this variation further. For example, taking aggressive action while having a dominate ""pacifist"" population can result in uprisings in your systems, triggering certain effects that last for a specific number of turns. These effects can be triggered by a number of different choices. I feel as though I've barely scratched the surface as far as managing populations. The ship editor is fun and engaging if not a little awkward at times. Planing military action in ES2 feels more interesting than in games like civilization and the option to add ship modules and create custom variations of unlocked ship hulls can give you the upper hand during battles in which you're outmatched (when looking at raw firepower of your fleet versus the opposition) because you decided to focus on the damage type your opponent is weak against (projectile vs. energy / short, medium, long range) and you selected a battle tactic that increase damage while foregoing defense.

Every faction has their own distinct trait, but the game can become a bit stale after a couple of playthroughs. Except the storyline, which is all in all quite useless in terms of granting buffs, the endgame is quite boring. Not nearly enough detail put into combat or the amount of different shiptypes to make the endgame fun. If you have all the resources you can just massproduce the strongest ship, which depending on the difficulty you play on, just stomps the AI. 

Huge props to the studio for making free dlc:s and not taking 20 euros for a bigger expansion (I am looking at you paradox). 

Pros: 
- This game has the most amazing soundtrack I have ever listened to
- Amazing story
- Fun factiontraits 
- Pretty nice graphics
- Interactions between fleets are pretty nice (blockading and guarding systems)
- Good diplomatic systems between factions

Cons: 
- Micromaneging your planets are a chore lategame
- Combat is pretty boring
- If you are not playing rush-style then you spend a lot of time doing nothing as many factions

I am only now reviewing Endless Space 2 after having played three separate games as two factions (though I dabbled in other factions for their tutorials).

In Endless Space 2, you pick a faction, explore the galaxy, and decide whether you want to conquer, fight, research, or talk your way to victory over your opponents. The factions here are diverse enough to offer an array of options. For example, for my playthroughs as the United Empire, I focused on conquering while my planets pumped out resources to support my war efforts. These playthroughs included many fights (which you can watch if you choose, which is always fun). This is usually my go-to faction in strategy games: the dominators, conquerors, or authoritarian iron-fists. However, I also played a game as the Vaulters, a DLC faction focused on science and technology. I rarely fought unless I needed to, instead spending most of my time building up resources to support my research, exploring the galaxy for curiosities to support my efforts, and defending my systems while biding my time for a science victory. This was my longest game, and I found I enjoyed it a lot. In games like this, Endless Space 2 feels a lot like a simulation game; there are tons of options for you to build up your solar systems, terraform planets to focus on different resources, and construct wonders or improvements. In this sense, Endless Space 2 can be as relaxing or as relentless as you want it to be.

If you have any experience with 4X games, Endless Space 2 should come fairly naturally to you, though it has multiple tutorial options for players of all skill levels no matter what faction you choose or parameters you set. Endless Space 2 also adds a “Sandbox” difficulty (found below “Easy”); while I haven't yet played in this mode, it is likely to allow you to mess around and get used to gameplay before trying your hand against harder AI. As with the last game, I recommend starting on “Easy” difficulty with the tutorial set to on until you get your bearings. 

The one major criticism I had of Endless Space was how you could build up magnificent fleets with the latest technology and get decimated by a particular faction without understanding why. Basically, there are two types of offensive damage and defensive protection: physical (projectiles, hull) and energy (beams, shields). In the original game, it was extremely hard to figure out what your enemy was using, and therefore it was a crap shoot to figure out how to combat it. In Endless Space 2, this is a lot clearer. Each time a battle commences, a screen pops up where you can change tactics and battle strategies. Now there is a plus sign beneath each party, allowing you to view in detail their fleet and its physical/energy attributes. This helps you to choose your battle strategy (some strategies give you bonuses to particular damage/defense types, for example) and perhaps even your build of future ships. Diplomacy also offers you many more options here; as long as you have discovered them, you can attempt diplomacy at any time, and there is now a “suggest terms” option where the game will help you make a deal with another faction if what you want (peace, a trade agreement, etc.) is not quite up to par with what your opponent will accept. (The game will often add a tribute of a special resource, for example.)

What are my criticisms of Endless Space 2? You can no longer claim all victories in one match if you achieve them in tandem. You must instead reload old saves or start new games to go after other victories. That the original Endless Space allowed this was rare, so it's not a huge criticism. Though it is just as beautiful as its predecessor, Endless Space 2's loading screens (particularly the initial screen and the screen before each battle) are far longer. The original loaded battles in seconds; this loads one loads them in about 40-60 seconds. Sometimes, you'll choose to watch all battles, but the game will decide simply to auto-resolve certain battles instead. This bothered me. Every once in a while one particular faction will offer you the same diplomatic action for multiple turns in a row, clogging up your notifications. Horatio was my ally in one game and kept offering me a science agreement I couldn't afford; his notification popped up every single turn for over 60 turns before I finally could afford the resource drain and said, “OKAY, FINE!” 

Overall, Endless Space 2 is extremely similar to its predecessor, though it has a few setbacks and a few improvements. This is a game I will keep coming back to. If you already own the original and wonder if you should “upgrade,” I think it's worth it—on sale given the similarities. If you're looking at the franchise and want to know where to start, it's here. The two games are similar enough to where I don't feel you're missing out if you buy one over the other, though the quality of gameplay improvements make Endless Space 2 slightly better than the original. I continue to be impressed by this series and will support future projects by AMPLITUDE Studios.",1640808848,1640808848,True,23,0,0.743070721626281738,0,True,False,False

Endless Space 2 is the sequel to the original Endless Space game with new graphics, new art, and oddly enough a few new gameplay mechanics not only in regards to the individual factions but also in general. In the first Endless Space game there wasn't really a set storyline for each faction to follow nor were there optional quests that offered different rewards like resources, technology, and heroes. In this game each faction you play as has their own respective set of story-related quests. For example; The Riftborn are a species of interdimensional beings who have fled their own realm after a strange affliction began to spread through it all and they have to either adapt to a new unfamiliar universe or try to save their own depending on the choices you make in-game. 

Speaking of the factions, the game brings some older factions from the original Endless Space while also bringing some newcomers. Among the older factions so far we have the Cravers, the Sophons, the Horatio, the United Empire, and as of recently the Vaulters while the newer factions consist of the Vodyani, the aforementioned Riftborn, the Unfallen and the Lumeris. Much like the original Endless Space each species has their own disadvantages, advantages, and unique mechanics. For example the cravers will deplete resources of planets they've colonized much like they do in the first game while the Riftborn have the ability to create singularities that can be placed on systems which can slow down or even accelerate the amount of time it takes for certain tasks to be completed including the building of improvements and ships.

There is also the addition of several minor factions that while not playable can be assimilated into your empire with varying advantages in doing so. Several factions that were playable in the original Endless Space such as the Pilgrims and the Amoeba as well as several species that were not readily seen or even expanded upon in the first game such as Deuyvians. While sad as it is that several classic factions from the original game are no longer playable in Endless Space 2 its good to see that they're still part of the expanding universe of the game.

Gameplay-wise not much has changed, it is still a turn-based strategy game in which you can move ships and have them colonize and/or attack systems. It may take one or more turns for systems to complete certain tasks as mentioned before and you still have the option to pursue diplomacy and war wherever you see fit. That being said there are a number of changes and new additions to the game that might daunt players familiar with the first game.

First off, the research tree system if it can be called that anymore has been torn apart and rebuilt. You start off with a number of technologies available to research and you have to complete most if not all available options for a branch before you can go onto the next set of researchable technologies. It expands from the inner rings which consist of the technologies that you may start off with (depending on which faction you're on) and have available at the start while outer rings will consist of newer and better technologies that can benefit your empire.

The battle scene has been changed, rather than having to choose certain battle manuevers such as sabotage ones to counter offensive or defensive ones and vice-versa you choose one strategy for the fleet in battle and they stick to it when it starts. No longer will you have a timer to decide which tactics you want to use and what to potentially counter like a game of rock, paper, scissors. Another welcome addition in regards to ground battles is that you can actually watch the battles as they happen and you can even choose what strategies to take depending on whether you're defending or invading a system. Just be forewarned that you'll have to develop 'manpower' to not only supply your ground forces but also your ships.

A new addition to the game is the government panel which depending on which empire you are a part of means that there will be elections and various political parties that will try to become one of the only and/or many (up to three) dominant parties in the government. Each one has their own respective laws which can help your empire in a myriad of ways as long as you have enough infleunce. Also, if you have a variety of aliens assimilated into your empire they will be a part of a respective party that can infleunce elections if need be and on a different note the heroes you have regardless of whether they're a governor or a fleet admiral will be a part of a certain party as well and may end up even becoming leaders of the parties as well.

Resources are pretty much the same as they were for Endless Space, you still have FIDS (Food, Industry, Dust, and Science) but you also have infleunce which is spent to pass and maintain laws in the government panel as well as perform various diplomatic exchanges with other empires including treaties, trades, etc. There is also manpower which is a resource that is saved up for and later spent on crews for ships and propping up the defenses of your systems with troops.

I think anyone whose a fan of Amplitudes other games in the 'Endless' franchise will enjoy playing this especially long-time players of Endless Space. 4x players may enjoy this though the only problem is while you can create your own custom faction if you wish you don't have any story-related quests and you may or may not miss out on certain perks you'd have if you were one of the main factions.

One last thing I'd like to note that unlike its predecessor as well as its sister game Endless Legend, Endless Space 2 has steam workshop support so not only will there be plenty of mods available if you want to try them out you can also make your own and post them up for others to try out.

And I'll immediately get down to the inevitable comparison to the last one: I've spent thousands (yes, literally) of hours with that game series.

Civilization 6 is still my favourite strategy - let alone 4X - game in existence. But Endless Space 2 comes very close indeed. Whereas Civ has the purity and refinement that requires decades to achieve, which, let's be honest, no competitor has, Endless Space oozes style, slickness and ingenuity the other greats in the genre have a hard time matching.
Amplitude have created something unique and worthwhile - assuming this tickles your fancy - and that I would wholeheartedly recommend.

In all fairness the game is not without its faults. The combination of factions (some of which are objectively stronger than others) and game settings can leave you in dire straits from the very start, no matter how well you play. But that is at the same time the game's greatest strength. Every game feels very unique and special and if you're dealt a bad set of cards, well, who's to stop you from simply starting over?

I would recommend everyone who enjoys this kind of video game to also check out Amplitude's other titles, predominantly Endless Legend, Endless Space 1 and Dungeon of The Endless, although that last title is - while set in the same universe - a different breed altogether. I think they are a great developer who deserve more attention. And no, I am in no shape or form affiliated with them.",1640353285,1640353494,True,33,2,0.727930247783660889,1,True,False,False

While lacking on the political side compared to Stellaris, it still has trade and politics worthy of a Civ title, and so I'm perfectly willing to let it slide. At the end of the day they're different games, and while many reviewers compare the two, I think most ignore that important fact. You really can't compare grand strategy to 4X. 

The music for this game is incredible, the visuals are gorgeous, and the combat is simple but with the ability to be surprisingly deep when you want to get into it. Exploration, building, quests, heroes, are all incredibly well implemented. There are occasional stretches where nothing happens, but if you're a proactive player you should be able to constantly find things to do during your turns. 

If you can get everything bundled on sale, it's well worth the price. Even without a sale, the base game is worth it (though I caution you to wait for the DLC to go on sale). Some of the DLC additions are middling at best. The Nakalim are okay, and the Umbral Choir, while complex, is actually incredibly strong. They're fun to play as, but absolutely awful to play against. The Hissho strike the best balance as far as having a flavorful playstyle without being OP goes. Overall it's a mixed bag that heavily depends on the type of playstyle you prefer. 

Finally I highly recommend linking Steam and Games2Gether (Amplitude's Forum), because there are some free heroes and a small expansion available if you do.

Yet there is still room for the player to weave those stories into something of their own making.  I particularly love the missions and how those weave the story into the game play.  To work along side that wonderful story is engaging game mechanics and amazing replayability.  This is why I've spent so many hours playing ES2, more than is noted here (offline mode does not add the time).

TL;DR - Great story, solid game mechanics, and very high replayability make this a great recommendation.",1637761261,1637761261,True,15,0,0.651046514511108398,0,True,False,False

Awsome Game! 

Englisch:

PROS:

- a better Stellaris :P
- really attractiv design (Factions, ships, artwork, Faction introduction, etc.)
- Well made Main- and Sidequests
- suprisingly outstanding music (its rarely i notice music ingame, and even more rare its good music)
- its up to you if you want to bring complexity into the game e.g. in politics its pleasant to see how your factions pop up, grow and what they demand but you can also just skip the whole thing, or in economy you can smooth everything out or just let the autobuilder do the shoot-and-forget work for you.
- the shipbuilder is with the modul system comfortable.
- the interface looks sooo sadisfying smoth
- the factions have different core-gameplay
- beautiful spacebattles (even if they are more cosmetic then strategic)
- nice sub-factions each with a saml story
- good lerning-by-doing tutorial
- Small events with choices who matters

CONS:

- lots of reading
- 4X are a matter of taste
- the AI behaves sometimes a bit strange
- Diplomacy have some nice features but overall a bit weak
- DLCs are good but overprized

Deutsch:

PROS:

- ein besseres Stellaris :P
- Sehr ansprechendes Design (Fraktionen, Schiffe, Artwork, Fraktions intro etc.)
- Sehr schöne Haupt- und Nebenquests
- Auffallend schöne Musik (selten das mir Musik auffällt, und dann noch positiv)
- Komplexität ist optional. Angenehm zu sehen wie die verschiedenen Politischen Parteien entstehen, wachsen und Forderungen stellen. In der Wirtschaft kann man jeden Planeten und jedes System den Feinschliff geben oder einfach per Autobuilder shoot-and-forget.
- Schiff Designer trifft genau mein Geschmack, entweder baut man sich Schiffe die auf Waffen- und Rüstungstyp spezialisiert sind oder lässt den Autodesigner mit den neusten Mods ein ausgeglichenes Schiff erstellen.
- Fraktionen haben unterschiedliche Kern Mechaniken.
- Sehr schöne Weltraumschlachten (auch wenn diese nicht wirklich Strategisch sind sondern ehr kosmetischer Natur)
- Nette Mini-Fraktionen, jede mit einer eigenen kleinen Geschichte.
- Gutes lerning-by-doing Tutorial
- Kleine Nebenevents mit einer spürbaren Konsequenzen.

CONS:

- Viel zu lesen
- 4X Games sind Geschmackssache.
- Die AI verhält sich noch etwas unlogisch.
- Diplomatie hat zwar ein paar nette features aber sonst ehr schwach.
- DLC zwar gut, aber zu teuer

The first expansion (Vaulters) was good. The Vaulters had an interesting game mechanic and no changes had to be made to the other factions in order for the game to function as a whole. That's not to say that everything was perfect, but the game was still fun no matter which faction you chose to play.

The second expansion (Supremacy) added the Hissho faction and behemoths. The faction was interesting but behemoths are just bad in every way. You get the same boring behemoths for every faction, they don't add any interesting gameplay elements, and changes started being made to the other factions to balance them for the new mechanics... and the devs began stripping 'fun' elements out of the game in a half-assed attempt to balance everything.

The third expansion (Penumbra) added the hacking feature and the Umbral Choir faction, an invisible enemy that required all the existing factions to be changed in order to make them work. Aside from the fact that hacking is simply uninteresting, battle elements that were fun had to be stripped from the game in order to accommodate an environment where cyber attacks could be viable. Almost every faction's ships were modified in little ways that began destroying the viability of several original factions. The Umbral Choir faction was also boring.

The last expansion (Awakening) introduced the Nakalim faction with yet more uninteresting game mechanics. More changes were made to other factions and the result is a game that no longer works well. In the end, if you do not want to play the game with the last three expansions, game mechanics that were necessary for those expansions to work are now embedded in the game, affecting it even though the reasons for those changes aren't relevant if you don't own (or choose not to play with) one or more of the expansions. The result is a game that has morphed over time into something that is no longer fun to play and I can't recommend it.",1603664255,1634277664,False,31,1,0.764790177345275879,1,True,False,False

Amplitude just can't seem to figure out this crazy thing called 'balance' in any of its games, but they're so much damn fun that I just play them anyway and get really cranky about it.

The original endless space played with the idea of economy quite a bit with factions such as the harmony (who were unable to use 'money') and the amoeba (whose economy depended heavily on peaceful relations), but here in ES2 the economy question has a 2 word answer:

""More Industry.""

As such, there are a slew of mechanics, features, faction traits, and technologies that are inherently useless or, at best, of marginal value. This makes learning to play ES2 a matter of learning what to ignore, rather than learning what is possible to do. Of the 5 core resources (Food, Industry, Dust, Science, Influence) the only one that matters is industry, because industry can be used to build buildings that give the other 4, while the other 4 have niche uses (food for growth and influence for diplomacy) or can be generated directly with industry projects at a reduced efficiency. If you're playing Riftborn or a custom faction with their Continuum Sculptor's affinity, industry even replaces food for the growth mechanics!

Speaking of custom factions, Introducing a custom faction 'trait' limit is an excellent change from the original that seems to indicate that vanilla factions are supposed to be balanced for multiplayer. Spoilers: they aren't. 

I would have liked the base factions to be a little more comparable. Some factions, such as the DLC only Vaulters, are laden with useless or unhelpful traits with hefty point costs that seem to indicate the traits should be quite good, while other factions have interesting core faction mechanics that are fun to play but do not pair well with the traits their faction has by default. Some affinities (think faction mechanics) are also inherently superior to others, such as continuum sculptor and metafolding (good) as opposed to emperor's will or celestial vines (bad)

The AI remains dumber than dumb, the UI spams a ton of meaningless popups (that thankfully can be disabled) about shit that doesn't matter, and the implementation of 'hybrid' turns in the single player format makes for stupidly broken situations like trying to click the defend button fast enough to block the movement of an AI fleet that will pass through the system you're trying to blockade when you should have been there a turn ahead of them because they get to move at the same time you do and movements have 'delay' as the animations play out.

And yet, I love it.

-- Un Futurisme Mature, Intelligent, et Elegant. --

La premiere chose qu'on remarque dans ce jeu, c'est son elegance graphique, et l'originalité de ses factions. 
On a vraiment l'impression d'ouvrir une fenêtre sur un futur lointain, suffisament probable et cohérent qu'on peut le prendre sérieusement et s'y immerger si on le désire. 

Si on le désire. Car les Amplitude ne se gêne pas pour prendre a revers les cotés les plus étrange de notre civilisation pré-FTL par le biais de ses factions :

- The United Empire est un cocktail satyrique de la mentalité Militaro-Industrielle Americaine, ultra-Corpo japonaise et du culte de la personnalité façon URSS. 
Tout y est lissé par des discours d'unité rassembleurs et des néons rouge vif pour faire oublier aux citoyens les journées de 15 heures passées a assembler des monstres spatiaux destinés à, ouvrez les guillemets, civiliser la galaxie.

- Les Sophons sont les aliens typique de notre imaginaire collectif. Les petits hommes verts sont Petits et meme s'il sont surement vert, vu que sont des reptiles, accrochez vous pour en apercevoir un sans combinaisons blanche immaculée. Pour un Sophon, la Science est sa propre justification. Si une Philosophie ou Religion pose un problème a la Sophonité, c'est une Philosophie de loser, ou une Religion débile, et il faut dire que 9 fois sur 10, c'est dur de leur donner tort. 
Oui, S'il faut poser des sondes ""invasives"" et kidnapper des vaches pour lier Theorie Quantique et Relativité, alors on posera des sonde invasives et on kidnappera des vaches. Et ils seront tellement mignons en le faisant que personne ne pourra ""vraiment"" les detester, la plupart du temps. Des Scientifique de génie, peu concernés par les avis des paysans bouseux du futur, Vodyanis, et autres crétins.

- Les Unfallen. On passe a quelque chose de vraiment différent. Une race d'arbres millénaire, qui ont d'une façon ou une autre, réussi l'exploit de s'extirper du sol pour planter leurs graine dans le cosmos. 
Pacifique et Ecolo par nature plus que par choix, ils on besoin d'une galaxie fertile et verte pour sécuriser leur futur. Cela sonne bien, sur le papier, mais les personne ne va leur donner la victoire pour autant. Au rythme lent de la Nature, il faudra les aider a tisser des lianes, (litteralement) entre systemes solaire pour voyager et les aider a convertir la galaxie a la Paix Verte. De gré ou de force. 

- Les Cravers. La Plaie venue du passé ... venue des Endless.
Les puissants Endless, la race mythique qui créa le ""Dust"", et colonisa l'univers entier des millénaire avant nous, étaient, de toute évidence, au dessus des travaux manuels barbares tel que ""construire des murs"" ou ""saigner au combat"". Pour ça, ils avait les Cravers. Les Endless disparus, leur main d'oeuvre a commencer a sérieusement s'ennuyer. 
Seulement, comme tout ce qu'on fait les Endless, les Cravers sont fait pour durer. 
Jamais fatigué, tous branchés sur le même conscient collectif, une fois sur une planête, ils vont en ratisser le moindre recoin et se reproduire de manière exponentielle, au point de la rendre inhabitable en quelques années. 
La seule option ... construire une fusée rapidement. Un concept humain, mais aussi, 100% Craver.

As good as this game's UI and presentation are, its game systems are too isolated and choices both too voluminous and spurious to lead to engaging mechanics and gameplay. I refunded this one at just under 20 hours - enough to have a few full experiences under my belt.

Overall, I would characterize this as a video game adaption of a board game version of a space 4x you really like. The systems in place might nominally match the ones you'd expect... but the depth of each system is so lacking as to nearly not *be* a system. 
None of the systems have any integrated impact on the others. If you need science, build science and pick science, that's it. Same for every other resource. To dive in, I want to take a look at the 4 Xs in 4x:

Explore

Exploration feels like the most well put-together aspect of this game - travelling down lanes early and using probes to . The anomalies, however, don't feel like they're specific to the planet - just pulled from the top of a shuffled deck. They are goodie-bags like early exploration often provides in 4x, giving a reward for exploring, and the idea of sending probes out to scan for non-connected systems fits very well into the genre. Even into the later game, you'll unlock additional types of anomalies to scan, which provides a reason to keep your exploration ships and figure out. That said, the random deck nature of the anomolies leads to some jarring gameplay. Two systems away from your home, where you've been established for hundreds of turns, a recently unlocked anomaly might just be a pirate ship. How did it get there without you knowing, stay there, and then suddenly pop out? A great question, and one left unanswered by the game's design. It's an illustration of the limitations of the game design choices that make it feel like a board game. Oops, I drew the pirate card, guess i have to swing half a fleet back from the warfront towards home because I thought I could explore a planet I've colonized.

Expand

Systems overpouplate, but there's no automatic migration to help manage them; systems just silently get stuck full with a baked-in approval hit. This combines with a soft system cap that can destabilize your empire. My understanding is that there's high-level tech & building combo to help mitigate this, but if you're already in a situation where you're overextended there feels like little you can do. Pro tip: you can't vacate a system if it has rebel ships in it! That system will still count towards your cap of course, even if it's a dinky one-planet system. The nature of increasing this is down to a few government choices and the aforementioned tech, or by trying to boost approval. The over-colonization bonus applies to every planet equally across the empire though, and although it's in the empire menu it feels like something that should absolutely surface when you're about to build a new colony. The game has no mechanisms for sectors/vassals/etc that you create yourself, unlike other 4x games like Humankind and Stellaris. Overall, I think the systems in place do an OK job at some system scales and player counts, but it breaks down quickly on larger maps; there are plenty of features that rely on system distance to determine effectiveness.

Exploit

The game's base system resources should be immediately familiar to most 4x fans - Money (""Dust""), Science, Culture (""Influence""), Production, Food. As you research, you can unlock buildings to help you out, and in these you have some minor  variation (usually with an obvious optimum)that makes some buildings good on some systems, while others are better on different systems. Strategic and Luxury resources also appear, showing up on individual planets across the galaxy. The luxury resources specifically tie into the system upgrade mechanic, so your availability of luxury resources directly determines your system level; if you want to have systems that make money, you have to find the money-making luxury resource before deciding how to develop your systems. In the games I played, it felt like a struggle to make system developments other than food, which contributes to the aforementioned population issues.

Exterminate

Like a lot of games of the genre, the entire session feels like it's developing into The Last Great War towards the end-game. This isn't necessarily bad - except that fighting increases your internal military faction, even in a defensive capacity. If your empire *ever* destabilizes and you get rebellion across more than one planet, you'll near-permanently be stuck with a militarist-lead government instead of the one you've been working with the rest of the game. I can see how that makes sense - fighting begets fighting - but other games give you tools and systems to mitigate that type of issue. There are again some nominal tools here - your empires can have multiple leaders, and some government types allow you to more directly influence the results, but none of those truly address the design choices running underneath the decision.

[hr][/hr]

Outside of the mechanics part of gameplay, I want to bring up some of the universe design choices that contribute to some of my frustration. By default, the galaxy is teeming with life and you won't be able to go three systems without finding a minor civilization, pirate station, or exile via anomaly. A mostly empty universe to explore this is not. You can collect specific species to get minor bonuses from all pops of that type; the science ones give you science, the ecologist ones give you food, etc. They all have their own faction preferences, so you may suddenly get three now very unhappy Ecologists in your industrial empire. You can move species, but the only way to remove them is to send them to an already full (and suffering penalties) system.

Player empires are all presets with some coming from DLC; not my favorite idea but I understand the why behind it. They look beautiful, and the ones I was able to try during my sessions felt like they played and worked differently enough to make the choice meaningful. While I prefer the fiddly nature of creating species ala Stellaris, I still think these are in-general good choices with interesting gimmicks/unique features. While it's not my thing, it's clearly put together well considered, and encourages multiple playthroughs.

Lastly, I have to talk about the event system in-game. You get 'quests' to do specific tasks at what feels like random, with the game chiding you if you fail. There seems to be no way to not take a quest - as far as I can tell the game will choose a quest option for you if you skip doing so yourself. It feels like the game wants to parade you around to all of its systems one by one and go ""Hey, did you know we had this feature!"" over, and over, and over, and over. You can control what pops up or not categorically, which is a good feature more games should have, but the popup-athon is always looming and there's no real way to say, for example, ""Only show me anomaly results when a pirate pops out of one.""

[hr][/hr]

I have kept lots of crappy games on my account, and I don't often write reviews on Steam, but this game felt as though it demanded it. I have never felt so completely frustrated by a game that clearly has a wealth of developer resources but put in service of mediocre design that under-delivers on the promise of a 4x. Some games reach above their development budget; some games are over-designed and too complex; this game is neither of those things. Endless Space 2 feels like a game that was very deliberately designed, well put together, and it's just not a combination I like or enjoy playing.

I've enabled comments on this review because there may be menus, features, or options I'm missing, but all of this frustration is coming from my direct playtime which had to remain under a specific limit to meet the refund criteria.",1631405651,1631405651,False,147,9,0.719538450241088867,0,True,False,False

1. TERRIBLE EXPLANATION OF THE RULES: The tutorial somehow manages to be overly intrusive without explaining the basic stuff that you need to know. The in game tool tips are badly written and frequently ambiguous. The PDF rules fail to explain all the core systems of the game. And the fan-based wiki isn't well-developed enough to fill the holes.

So over and over again, I found myself quitting the game, to go find out how some particular mechanic worked. Only it wasn't in the rules or the wiki, so I wound up having to crawl through reddit threads, developer diaries, and promotional videos trying to glean some sense of how a key system in the game worked.

2. BADLY ORGANIZED TECH TREE: The key problem is that techs are not named or themed in any coherent manner, so it's a real slog to figure out what everything does and what you need to research. 

Compare it to civilization, where the tech tree is pretty intuitive: I research masonry, and I can build stone walls. I research navigation, and I can cross sees. I research the wheel, and I can guild chariot.  

In ES2, all of the techs have random names and effects. For example, if you want to colonize a snow world, you'll have to research something called ""Eukaryotic Sap.""  And if you're thinking that the same tech might allow you to colonize arctic worlds, you'd be wrong. The other effect of that particular tech is to improve your space probes. Because apparently genetically engineered tree sap will let your space probes travel further.

This may seem like a fine point, but it means that getting a handle on the tech tree is a constant pain in the neck. If you're trying to figure out what to research to gain a specific ability, you can't just look at the tech names and figure it out. You have to go mouse over every single little ability bubble and read the tooltip. There are around 80 techs, each of which unlocks 2-4 thematically unrelated abilities. So finding out which tech you need can be a time-consuming pain in the ass.

I realize that the game is dealing with science fiction techs that don't exist yet, but that's no excuse for having such wildly non-descriptive names. The game would be much easier to play if things like ""snow planet colonization"" and ""arctic planet colonization"" were grouped together under a tech called ""Cold weather adaptation"" rather than split up under two techs called ""Eukaryotic Sap"" and ""Graviton Research"".

CONCLUSION: It's a shame, because the more I understand the mechanics, the more I'm convinced that there is a pretty good game buried in there somewhere. But my time is valuable, and with ES2, I was spending hours either trying to hunt down an explanation for a game mechanic, or wrestling with the needlessly opaque tech tree.

It has the simplicity and straightforward-ness of Civ 5 and is a step down from Stellaris's depth. The only things it sacrifices compared to Stellaris is the inability to make custom races/empires and the use of micro in space battles since it's turn based.

The Endless Series is especially notable in that their UI/UX designers are SSS+ tier and make all the menus look great, easy to read, and have easy-to-comprehend stats and resources with accompanying explanations and icons for everything.

Notably clear for players new and coming back to the genre in terms of UI/UX.
Sufficiently deep for repeated SP and MP playthroughs.
Great soundtrack.

One *very specific DLC* will degrade both performance and enjoyment from the game. (Awakening DLC)

That said, here are some warnings going into it. The games drag on well past the point of winning. Like many 4X games, when you become the biggest and strongest player in the game, theres really no way the AI can catch up. The game then devolves into a mindless exercise in hitting the end turn button until you finally win. The AI is another issue. They are aggressive and expansionist, good traits in 4X AI, but they simply cannot keep up with the player, even on the highest difficulty. They will give you a headache the first 50 or so turns of the game, but eventually will fall woefully behind. I've never seen an AI get even close to winning a game. That said, playing with other players is an utter blast and the primary reason to pick up this game. A lot of the complexity that bogged down previous Endless games has been scaled back and we're left with a much more approachable and exciting 4X experience. Getting friends into this has been easier than any other 4X game I've played. The multiplayer is a fantastic experience.

As for the DLCs, they're just okay. They're not essential and some of the DLCs introduce mechanics that are better to be played without, especially when you first start learning to play this game. The knowledge curve isn't too steep (though the tech tree can be daunting at first) but I still would recommend not getting DLCs until you've picked up a couple hours into the game.",1628486012,1628486012,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Frankly put, there isn't another game out there that has quite so much character. Every faction in this game, regardless of their strength, has very unique core mechanics and an overall playstyle that's very different from other factions in the game. Every playthrough on a different faction feels completely different; I haven't played another 4x game that even comes close to having such diverse factions.

In terms of gameplay, I would say this game is likely one of the simpler 4x games. The DLC doesn't really add too much depth to the game (unlike, for example, Civ 6), and overall, the base game isn't terribly complex either. Constructing planets is done in somewhat of a simplistic manner, the tech tree overall is pretty simple to understand and use, and fleet and ground combat, while pretty, are fairly straightforward and simple in terms of how to win or lose at them.

The component of this game which really adds depth and complexity to the gameplay isn't the core mechanics; it's the racial mechanics. The core mechanics in this game are simple and easy to both understand and use; the player wins the game by properly utilizing and abusing their specific race's mechanics. Even then, however, this is likely one of the easiest 4x games to comprehend, making it an excellent choice for a person's first 4x game. That being said, even an experienced 4x player could easily get 100+ hours out of this game if they enjoy it; there's enough content in the game to challenge a player for a significant amount of time; more than enough to get their money's worth. 

Second off, I would also like to say that this game has absolutely gorgeous visuals and music. There simply isn't another 4x game that even comes close. This game looks great, and while it's difficult to communicate how nice this is in a review, it really comes across in your gameplay experience. The music and visuals really help to immerse and engage you in the experience of your gameplay. That said, this brings about a minor drawback, in that the game is slightly more performance intensive than other 4x games. 

I also think that the DLC for this game is both good and reasonably priced. Not really a lot to say beyond that. 

Unfortunately, I do think this game falls short in a few categories, specially balance and overall community. The game's balance is decent, but there are a few things in the game which are distinctly unbalanced, alongside a few longstanding bugs the devs have never gone back to fix. Second off is the community, which is rather welcoming, but unfortunately rather small. What this translates into is less community content in the form of mods and such and also less support from the devs in terms of releasing new DLC, bugfixing, and rebalancing things that need to be rebalanced.

The game is also one of the worst 4x games for a Co-op campaign. 

TL;DR:

Pros:
-Some of if not the best faction diversity in the 4x genre.
-Simplistic base gameplay makes it easy to pick up but variety of factions allows for sufficient depth to gameplay.
-Gorgeous visuals and memorable music.
-Solid DLC, has some bugs and minor balance issues but generally all worth it. 

Cons:
-Requires a good PC.
-Small community/not a lot of mods.
-Not as much dev support as other games in the genre.
-Poor co-op/online experience.

Overall, I think this is one of the best 4x games for getting into/back into the 4x genre, taking a break from other more micro intensive 4x games, or just enjoying an interesting world with rich lore and cool visuals.

I recommend getting this on sale with most of the DLC (except awakening) and the other Endless games (like Endless Legend). Endless Space 2 is very story heavy, and Endless Legend/Dungeon of the Endless helps you see the bigger picture along with origins of one of the DLC factions (The Vaulters). 

This makes it great escapism, especially if you are stuck in the house at the moment because of the pandemic. Each faction feels unique, with their own story, quests, lore and, most notably, mechanics. This is pretty unusual in 4X games, as story/lore haven't been emphasised since Alpha Centurai. Same goes for the very unique faction mechanics. Most 4X games like this tend to make gameplay the same for each faction, bar some different modifiers, and one or two unique units. The factions in Endless Space 2 play completely differently to each other, with their own unique ways of expanding, collecting resources, growing pops, unique buildings/units etc. The presentation/graphics/soundtrack are also second to none. 

One personal downside includes the system development. It tends to get very routine after a while, you'll be building the same buildings over and over again in your systems, with variations based on the planets in the systems you find. This is because a system's productivity/usefulness is based more on the type of planets you find in it, rather than the actual buildings you build. The buildings serve to improve the exploitation of system resources. So while there is system specialisation, the RNG will control how you develop the system. For example, if you find and colonise a system with predominantly desert/lava planets, this system will be an industrial/production hub of your empire. 

I also found combat to be pretty basic. You don't have direct control of it apart from some tactic cards you select at the beginning of each round. I never bothered changing the tactics cards even when I unlocked more through research. Some of the ground combat mechanics aren't explained too well, and it took me several hours to figure out how to improve my ground assault armies by including tanks and aircraft. Finally, the AI really sucks, and I'm not aware of any mods to make them more competitive.  

Overall, despite the flaws I still recommend this game, definitely worth a buy, especially if you can get it on sale.",1627302865,1627303252,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This is a space opera, where you play as one of the major factions of the galaxy and try to achieve domination (called Victory) through any of the 6 conditions. Will you achieve glory by brute and cruelty, or through wealth and friendship?
It did not took me long to learn up to the intermediate stage, so if you started in the same situation as mine I would recommend you to play this.
The gameplay aspects of the game - resource management, technology research, war, governance, factions (and their traits), economy, heroes, construction - are mainly favorable, and simple. It is not tedious and difficult, except if you want to expert on some of the factions, which hold unusual traits. I am positive on most except with the research system. It is too streamlined and rigid. The name, description, and type of the specific technology usually does not match with the feature or ability unlocked.
Now the creative aspects - story, lore, quests, artwork - is where I am truly impressed, and I commend it. It overwhelms the gameplay and brings a distinct flavor. In case you do not know, there is artwork at the game folder. The ones who write and draw the universe have the creativity, dedication, and the passion.
Being a space opera, there are just a few out there. Counting them I have fingers to spare. I am looking forward, and it does not have to be another game.
It is a wonderful turn based strategy for both expert players (there is a difficulty slider) or those who have just started. There are tales to listen, and it is yours to write one in Endless Space 2.

Pros:

Best Technology system of any 4x game I've played.  Unlike Civ games, you have to actually think - if you take the recommended shortest time research path you will lose, hard.  Unlike Stellaris, you still have agency in your plan, you don't have to wait for the right things to show up or study obscure math on the net to learn how to game the system.

Interesting factions with very different goals and gameplay.

Although space battles are predictable, they are fun to watch.  And the various ships are beautiful, with a design system that actually produces differentiated types that are useful.

There are many more...

Cons:

Some of the systems are so underdeveloped!  Diplomacy is a joke.  If you turn down a request it will be repeated over and over again.  The costs of actions are not clear at all, so it's easy to overextend.  Ground combat is so lame and repetitive. Getting access to uninhabitable planets is way to easy, and so is terraforming.  Upgrading systems is also too easy.

That said, it being more simplistic makes it way easier to get into than, say stellaris.
Each race feels unique to play and the story is pretty interesting if you bother reading the flavour text on missions.

What I also like about this game is that you don't require a near infinite amount of DLC. If you have a friend who already owns all the good DLC, you don't even have to bother buying any yourself if you plan on just playing the game together.
If the person who hosts the lobby has DLCs enabled, you'll be able to join and enjoy the DLC without owning any of them.

If you're wondering which DLCs are worth buying, here is a quick overview:

---Definitely Worth it---
[list]
    [*]Vaulters: Adds a new playable faction, ""the Vaulters"" with their own playstyle, also adds the ability to negotiate with pirates, which is a nice feature to have
    [*]Supremacy: Another DLC that brings a new faction, ""the Hissho"" with a very unique playstyle (more so than the Vaulters). Additionally included in this DLC are Behemoths, giant powerful ships that cost a lot to create and keep up. Some people don't like these behemoths, but there is an option to turn them off
[/list]

---Mostly worth it---
[list]
    [*]Penumbra: Adds ""the Umbral Choir"" faction, a faction with an extremely unique playstyle (even more so than the Hissho). Additionally included in this DLC is the ability to hack. This is, as far as I'm aware, the main reason why the DLC has mixed reviews. Hacking can feel like a chore and pretty uninteresting. That said, if you care enough to learn it, it can be a fun and powerful tool to turn the game in your favor.
    [*]Lost Symphony: Adds 7 songs to the soundtrack. All of these songs are good and are a nice addition to the soundtrack. Besides the songs, there is also 1 extra minor faction added with this DLC.
    [*]Untold Tales: Adds 4 new minor factions and 21 new quests. A DLC that creates some more variety to playtroughs and makes the world feel a little more fleshed out,
    [*]Harmonic Memories: Adds another 9 good songs to the soundtrack. Additionally adds 1 new hero.
    [*]Celestal Worlds: Adds a big questline, 2 new unique planets, 6 new weapon modules and 8 new empire improvements, overall just extra, but good, fluff content.
[/list]

---Uncertain---
[list]
    [*]Dark Matter: Adds a 12 new small quests that are interesting for lore, but don't have any significance in gameplay. Last time I checked, the DLC introduced bugs that hamper gameplay, so unless you see somewhere that all those bugs are fixed, this DLC is one you probably should ignore for now.
[/list]

---No. Just no---
[list]
    [*]awakening: People seem to unanimously agree that you're just paying to make the game worse. If you want to know more as to why, you can just check the reviews. All you need to know tho is that you should not buy this DLC and if you already did, disable it.

read below to find out why!

But the game also has so many qualities, and surely has the one more turn aspect. In the end I give my recommendation because it is a work of love, and can be the fundation for major content later.

But there are many flaws in there too.

The concepts are great but the content by itself, in my opinion, is wrong in so many areas it's [i]""critical damage to the experience ship""[/i]. But of course, it's also great enough to encourage clicking on ""one more turn"".

Let's start with some positives:

[i]- Amazing presentation! It's second only to Stellaris, and interface is truly a masterwork.
- Graphics are a huge work of love, from colonization scenes to planets to how interface reacts to everything. 
- Government, political parties, senates and laws is a huge concept, it's well inspired to do this.
- Heroes.
- Very nice writing and context on many areas, including minor factions.
- Population and population slots on planets are neatly presented.
- Game is moddable! so whatever bad point I mention below could be address by mods (or should have been, I am still looking for that W40K which is not there ;) )[/i]

The rest now...

[i]- The battle idea is inspiring, but it ends up being one of the worst battle scene to watch in a 4X. How could it end so? battles resolutions are bland, battle mechanics are a bit unclear, this part does not deliver. There are ships and 3D and things firing on each other until one explodes, but we don't feel very involved in this, as ships are distant, everything is still, it's as if the ships themselves are not involved. It's possible we lack an after-action report to figure things out. This is sad because the concept of a tactics card and the ways ships stats are made is very interesting. (with shortrange, midrange and longrange)

- Heroes have again this ""rainbow things on the skills they can access"", it removes some of their theme. The entire skill tree feels a bit wrong.

- Heroes have slower ships than even early fleets, meaning having an admiral slows the fleet to a crawl. This is odd.

- The story premise is interesting, but then is less, and choices and consequences are often not. I guess this is ok, but also I still am not attached to the concept of the Endless story.

- We lack important management tabs to help see which system has population space, what buildings exist on this system, all that may be somewhere but I did not even find where.

- The economy is completely broken. This is one of the worst points. It starts up well, some things are neat, but then balance goes out of the window. You just have resources to make everything and the only strategy will be ""how better"" you are in micromanaging the right things before others, often requiring a lot of human focus and input and insight to even ""see through"" your overflowing resources and constant need of micromanagement (and techs-giving-rainbow-effects-of-everything).

- Why can't we make ""team games""? So many games in the competition allow us to set up teams since the beginning of the game. It's great to play with friends. It's fun, it's inviting. Team games are much better than the bland thing of abusing it with an alliance. This is not ES1 but ES2, it should have been there.

- Technology quickly makes no sense at all and then has weak flavour despite some of the best descriptions and presentation.  It has no sense to make bigger ships because I learnt to colonize artic planets or to colonize deserts because I wanted to access an influence building. these were just examples to give a rough idea. I see where the game design comes from with these ideas, but this just doesn't work. It does not put the right flavour and focus in the game. Spreading colonization techs in so many areas was just wrong. This makes technology look unworthy of your interest ; you take the techs, but you lack attachment to it. This is just my opinion about it. The tree is extremely well presented, but the content feels unaddictive.

- Micromanagement gets quickly horrible in this game, from population that you have to micromanage and send elsewhere all the time, to production which gets too fast and that you have to change all the time, planets which pop large pirate fleets so fast you have to check it, 

- very minor point but some tracks are taken from Dungeons of the Endless (I noticed at least one being the same). While I love this soundtrack! ... it just feels odd to have games repeat the music of other games in the Endless licence.[/i]


So... despite all these flaws, while ES2 has some of the worst choices of contents, it still has one of the best presentations (second only to Stellaris imo), a very effective interface, and also the best way to present population on planets. It also has the best colonization graphics I have seen in a 4X space game.

It is really a work of love in its interface and graphics quality.
Planets are really well presented!

Also, the game is moddable.

To me, this means the existing content, of which I am not fond of, should actually be replaced by a nicely made mod.

And, it still has the ""one more turn"" experience. It will make people lose a lot of time I guess because of the overflowing resources, overextended micromanagement, but the one more turn is definitely there.

About mods: I don't see yet why there is no W40K mod, or total conversion mod which would be strong in theme. There is no ""standalone"" mod, there is no true total conversions (there is at least one ruleset total conversion, but that's far from a Fall from Heaven 2 on Civ4 for instance ;) ), I am disappointed not to see this so much time after release (it has been years!).

For all the rest... I'll still give my recommendation!

Also, the game regularly has good discounts, making it easy to recommend on sale for you to have a try.

But I hope making it a ""thumbs up"" does not remove the importance of all issues mentioned. 

All these issues are making vanilla content a bad experience to me, and I see maybe only one mod able to fix that. And I do not even go into discussing AI content.",1625643582,1625661091,True,4,0,0.54075545072555542,0,True,False,False

I feel the battles don't compare with the battle visuals in sins of a solar empire.

The music and voice acting is pretty good. This game is definitely good value for money. Can't wait to see what mods and dlcs are released in future

Edit (after playing for several months): The game still has a lot of bugs, but I am loving the added content, frequent patches, and the expansion. Very enjoyable, especially with friends.

Edit 2: I am playing supremacy expansion now. Lots of neat added content. But a lot of the older bugs are STILL in the game. for example, getting stuck on turns in multiplayer matches.

Edit3: Changing my review to NOT RECOMMENDED because I have had it with all these bugs

Edit4: After the penumbra expansion, I reinstalled the game after a long break and I am enjoying myself.

Edit5: Changing to NOT RECOMMENDED again. Game got a whole new slew of bugs that affect multiplayer lobbies. In summary, do NOT buy this game. It might have been good at one point in the past but in its current state there are just too many bugs.

It didn't click as much as I would have hoped. The game is clearly good, does a lot of things right, but at the same time, it has some really weird design choices and mechanics that may draw you in or make you go 'meh'

Presentation for 2017 (4/5) - There's no doubt this game excels at drawing you in. The graphics are very pretty for a strategy game, around the level of Master of Orion 2016. However there are some problems with how it is all displayed - there are a lot of numbers and planets get displayed as a bunch of stats with little charm. You put citizen icons around planet slots. You research and construct buildings which are still images and not see them inside the planet view. The graphics excel in combat (if only combat was interactive ... what's up with Endless Games screwing up the combat) though the little variety in weapons cause battles to look like carbon copies of each other.

The game's soundtrack is incredible - something you can listen in Spotify or a CD player as an active listener. It is some of the best game music I've heard and ranks up there with some of the best ambient CDs - it evokes a sense of wonder, feels futuristic and carries so much 'mood'.

Story/Dialogue (3.5/5) - Quite a lot of reading for a game of this type, storytelling is of high caliber and help personalize your gaming experience. Use of cutscenes associated with your picked race make story telling superior to Endless Legend.

Gameplay (3.5/5) - The design choices can be very experimental and hit and miss. The game is pretty unbalanced with some races vastly superior to others and a strange progression in technology. There is a lot of numbers to keep track of that feel a bit abstract (Civilization 6 has this problem also, but the more grounded setting reduces the problem IMO). The rushing through eras is a bit of a problem also. On the other hand, it has so many great ideas that I wished were applied to Master of Orion. The biggest problem is that combat is automated and ship design is surprisingly mediocre. If war feels so detached and empire building involves a bunch of detached numbers, the game, despite its high-caliber graphics and story-telling, feels quite clinical anyways.

The ground combat is the worst I have ever seen in a game of this type, ever. The classic AI gets ""bonuses"" is well at work here too. The ""quests"" are nonsensical. The story is...I don't even know. The diplomacy doesn't make much sense either. Hot as hell or cold as ice describes it best.

My updated review (~420 hrs, ~200 hrs post release, ~125 hrs using all DLC):
Endless Space 2 was my first venture into an Amplitude game.  I was somewhat active during the openDev phase, and probably 60% of my logged hours were spent during Early Access.  I've only recently been able to play the game in its finished form, with all DLC (except Dark Matter -- which I'm about to put in my cart.) 

I've seen reports of at least one game-breaking bug with everybody's favorite faction, the Riftborn.  When that faction was first released (in what I'm pretty sure was a free update...) I was intrigued by their unique gameplay mechanic, and the opening story board is pretty awesome, so I like to either be them or include them. (I'm a little worried, because the riftborn are in my game.  I'll be curious to see if the observed bug happens in my game, but then wonder whether I should exterminate them now.)  Will probably just jump back to an old save if I observe a glitched effect of the dilation field on some riftborn systems.

I won't discuss all the factions I've played, but I'll mention a few of the most interesting ones. In my current playthrough, I'm the militaristic birds that have a unique resource called keii, which you lose 10 of if you retreat from battle, and which you lose 1 of each turn per colony count over min., i think it starts kicking into a resource drain (part of their unique law) if you have more than the minimum to avoid over-colonization penalty.  But there are ways to work around.  I'm currently losing 8 per turn, because I have 10 systems, i think.  I have quite a few outposts that are ready to be converted (but to make them colonies, I'll have to spend keii about 40 (which will remove my favorability bonus from high keii (this is instead of the normal approval-based bonus/malus system) which will take between 3 and 10 turns of space battles. My first time as the Hissho has been pretty epic, (at first my fellow empires did not really launch fleets.  They've since been able to launch some formidable ones, but while in the early going the quest system allowed for maintaining high keii from turn 25 to turn 50, by accompanying it with constant hunt for pirates, or something to destroy.  Had to set so many traps, so my fleet costs me 1k+ dust a turn, on turn 75 of a fast game. From there I've been able to convert maybe one outpost, and have captured one more system, Sophons home system.  I'll mention the more natural way for the hissho to play is to subjugate or exterminate a conquered system, which each earn keii, but I figured with the difficulty in working around the limit on colonies (over-colonization penalty saps FDSI productivity, and keii each turn) 
 
...ok well, I'd say there's just so much to say about what sort of tradeoffs I've had to make with expansion and diplomacy in just this one playthrough. (Not all factions are as unique as this one, which basically highly punishes any peaceful diplomatic act and all but prohibits a passive approach to gameplay, unless you're interested in going pacifist and can somehow find keii by other means than battle -- in the case of a pacifist that means having a lot of allies and/or peaces declared, which as I mentioned, imposes a one-time 18-24 keii penalty for each one.) 

One effect of the complexity even in the base game (with options like cloaking, behemoth actions, and many more being added in DLC (and maybe part of accompanying free update too...idk) since release) is I've basically had to relearn the tech tree every time I play for a while, because life keeps requiring my attention and there's a lot to retain.  But this game, while definitely delivering a ""just-one-more-turn"" experience, is also kind of exhausting, at least on bigger maps.  

I think without the superb UI this game would be unplayable.  While there is some room for improvement in some ways that population management is done

I've read a few reviews that do not like the espionage system at all.  I also find it a bit off, but not as bad as some say.  It can be fun if you're into coordinating long-term war planning with supplementary actions like espionage and optimizing keii (you earn more when you win a battle and the odds are relatively even.)  

Original Review follows:
""I'm only two hours into playing and  I can already tell the GDs have created the manifold for an amazing game.  In just my first playthrough (still in its infancy) I can see that the Quests involve decisions that don't always provide an obvious choice and actually fulfilling that quest may sometimes require sacrificing a plan one had previously devised.  I'm currently stuck creating science-only improvements for 10 turns if I want to fulfill a quest (the reward for which is access to an amazing improvement.)  Simultaneously, my colony was successfully invaded, and I have no navy to respond (I tend to play these games with a heavy emphasis on tech & economy.)  Before the quest started I had queued up my first strong ships, but with the allure of the quest, I shifted back to improvements.  I think I, playing as Sophons, will be able to rebound with superior firepower in 20 turns, but by then I don't expect there to be anything left of the world the invaders conquered.  The invaders are Cravers, and I've heard they have a penchant for exploiting worlds for their resources and despoiling them.  Already been an interesting first experience in this universe.

Can't wait to see the future developments, new factions, revamped tech tree (most tech I've discovered thus far has been interesting narratively and creates compelling choices for research path.)  

I'm glad I'm getting exposed to the less comprehensive game now, [update: Although it currently has a game-breaking bug (or bugs) that make a complete playthrough impossible, it's provided very entertaining gameplay, and it's worth it to participate in the process of game creation at games2gether.com -- There's a contest active right now (the final one before game release) to suggest an achievement.]

Hope they'll add an intro movie to set the stage for what looks to be shaping up as an epic game.  I haven't researched much about what they'll be adding over the course of the next few months. 
[Update late 2016: I have since read up on future directions of development, and if implemented well and if optimization is achieved, this game will definitely be my favorite of its genre.]

Can't wait for multiplayer (which could, although unlikely, be unlocked  for the next update).  If you share enthusiasm for MP, I've started a Multiplayer user group, called Endless Space 2 User Multiplayer Group (or something like that.) 
its abbreviation is ES2 MP

In multiplayer you will have lots of desynchronization, meaning something has gone wrong, often it's just the fog of war not being the same for every player or something not too important.
This is fixed either by itself when you finish turns or you can save, quit and invite everyone again. It's a bit of a pain but not game-breaking.
The real issue comes randomly when every player end their turns but the AIs are in talks and the game just won't progress further.
This, sadly, cannot be fixed. We tried reloading older saves, redownloading our games, verifying the integrity of files, we had no mods on to begin with so it's not the issue either.

Between Stellaris and Civ VI I've played over 1k hours of these Grand Strategy games in the last year. For me Endless Space is a better game then Stellaris. While still having an incredible number of macro decisions that impact your empire as you build, it winds up being less tedious then Stellaris. You have a few less fleets. Your planets have a harder population cap. These things add up to a late game that is more manageable. The factions are less custom then Stellaris but in trade they are more unique and memorable. My biggest gripe about the game is after a few runs I started to explore the community for it and unfortunately the primary discord (or at least my experience there)) has been marred by 'dead game' negativity. On the other hand, there is a very positive friendly PvP discord but when you are coming off casual runs and realize their games are some 140 turns shorter then what you've managed its a bit... offputting when all I want to do is finish the last few DLC.

So, positive review at 136 hours. Just picked up the second DLC and going to start another deep run. Looking forward to it.

It's actually better to not play with them enabled. The Nakalim faction was broken to being pretty much unplayable on release, it wasn't fixed for over a month. They pushed the game off to a third party to fix all the bugs, said to expect a lot of updates. We got 2. The first one was medium to small size and didn't fix even half of the issues, which is okay if there were more to come. Instead some 2 or 3 months later the second update was released. It was about 5 or 6 bug fixes and they announced that was the final one. It's supremely disappointing if you liked the game and wanted to use the 2 latest major dlcs. Amplitude sadly has a long history of abandoning games before they're done, and releasing half baked dlcs. I don't know if that's them or the publisher, but it sure does suck. I worry about Humankind since their other games don't have a great track record in the long run.

It has great art.

Things going against it:
One bug that should never of been allowed. Infinite turn pending.... (Shouldn't have to manually save every turn just because you have no idea when the last autosave ran.)

The game play is uninspiring/grindy/boring.
-Play tall or go home.(Haven't figured out how a new colony can consume more food than all of your settled systems combined.)
-Change the turn limit from 300 to 600 just to find out production and research costs are doubled....

Alright 4x game but there are a lot of issues if decided to start a game in mega galaxy size and aim for total domination.

There isn't many options for auto-micromanagement (especially for training army), for that reasons time passes like crazy just for spending few turns in later on the game and youre likely to be doing same kind of purchase and train option repeatedly over and over each turn.
That is usually the end state for 4x games if auto-micromanagement isn't really well implemented.


[I CAN'T REMEMBER IF THERE WAS AI DIFFICULTY SETTING OR NOT]

It felt like there wasn't really a good spot in game difficulty balance also, I usually ended up either dominating them or getting dominated. All you can change is enemy ship strength as far as I can remember. You can slow down how slow each players acquires new technologies,,, at the cost of time in your real life. On fast settings, it didn't take too long till all players reach max tech levels after all there isn't many options in this game.


[HUGE ISSUE WITH INFLUENCE SYSTEM...AND AN EXPLOIT THAT YOU CAN DO]

There is also an option to peacefully conquer opponents by having high cultural influence but that is slightly broken. If your influence excels opponents by 75%, you can make a forced political tribute, but there was a problem in this. I captured one of the planets in opponents mega influence zone, so that single isolated planet that I own ending up getting bombarded by opponents influence and for ONLY BECAUSE OF THAT PLANET I ended up losing in political influence conflict DESPITE that my main planets and system around it having way higher cultural production. So I figured out I could exploit this by selling one of my unimportant planet surrounded by my culturally dominant planets to enemy players, then it lets me suck out their resources over and over periodically by forced tribute.


[MINOR CIVILIZATIONS WERE VERY UNIMPORTANT]

Also there is a bonus for managing minor civilization citizens and placing around them on your planets but citizen type management hardly works out well and rewarding.


[IS RESOURCE SYSTEM GOOD?]

Resource system felt terrible also, it was like either you have it or youre out. You cant really do much without it in later on the game. I wish there was a more options for resource production, like synthetic productions. I experimented by launching two game modes each in two different resource options, abundant and scarce. With abundant, almost everyone ended up having ultimate class ship, so it came down to enemy ship strength, if you set it too high then youll have a hard time. With scarce, if you have that resources that you need to build meta class ship, you win the game. There are tons of sub-resources you could only use it for limited purpose but they become utterly useless, and tier 1 class resource also in later in a game. I did not enjoy how this worked out.


[SO NO FUNS IN THIS GAME?]

On the pro side, each playable civilizations were VERY unique. It was a ton of fun to try out different factions each play through. They all have different CORE MECHANIC which means you must play differently on different species that you pick.
But in spite of that, it will usually come down to expanding by ship to ship combat. 


[CONCLUSION]

I think this game does a good job if you're beginner to 4x genre. Because of less options and less complicated way it lets you play comparing to other 4x. But for who people love this genre, I don't see why youd want to stay on this game.",1620878644,1620878644,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The only time when there are voices is in diplomacy and its horrible, they say their lines almost randomly like when you do something good they can go ""stop bullying us!"". Wtf how hard is it to add some voice lines, these days you can hire voice actors for a couple bucks, yea those cheap actors are not very good but so are this games actors so whats the issue

Battles. Ground battles are retarded, you can't attack a system without destroying buildings. You can draft not just the men but woman and children too! People can keep drafting until there is literally no population left which often results in no buildings left either. Cinematics are just that, cinematics. Not good cinematics either if we are taking about ground battle cinematics. You can't control your units or anything, you can just watch them fight. I'd very much rather if they put all that effort into fixing bugs or adding content because game needs these so fucking bad.

Space battles are also bad. Apparently in the future ships shoot only sideways so they will often engage in awkward staring contests with their enemies without trying to... you know... turn and fucking shoot eachother. AI either uses random battle tactics or AI is so extremely shit at using them it feels like they are using random tactics.

Diplomacy is shit. People weaker than you will randomly declare war just to have you destroy them. Trading for science or map or basically anything is extremely hard. AI is just too afraid to engage in anything related to diplomacy so your offer has to be ridicilously good for them to accept.
IT KEEPS DEMANDING MONEY. Wtf, I said no go away! Agressive AIs, which is like half of them will keep asking for money and get pissed if you refuse. Even when they are at your mercy they will keep demanding tribute.

Diplomatic pressure. If score difference between two factions is too high you can ask them to give stuff and if they refuse they will suffer severe penalties. Two big problems here. AI NEVER ACCEPTS. I tried keeping it small and simple. Hey Mr. AI please give me a few $$ so your people wont have to suffer. Nope. I don't think I have ever gotten them to accept a deal in my 200h playtime.
But how about when AI has bigger score than you? Score calculation is weird af. Even after I won the war and literally destroyed my opponents most precious planets (about 20 planets, all trade corps, homesystem, all their fleet) they had higher score than me... but why? Clearly Im the stronger one, I was ahead on science and military, I had ALL wonders built on my homesystem, I was rich af but they still had higher score. Alright so score calculation is fked, what about when AI makes a deal how do they do it? So far AI asked for nothing but money and they seem to ask for basic deals. Once you have a score difference if you wait a little after basic deal becomes available you can ask for an advanced one which is a lot more on the pressured side. AI never waited and simply asked for money and if I refused he damaged my influence gain. Exact same deal every time only the amount of  money changed.

RNG heavy world generation. I guess its more of a galaxy generation here but still its rng based. Sometimes you can spawn on a planet with a lot of resources that gives early game boosts aswell as helping you build stuff later on but sometimes you might get basically nothing. Sometimes you can find one of a kind tech that will allow you to build extremely useful things but sometimes you might just find some pirates that will kill your scouting ships. Sometimes you might spawn in a nice place with colonizable systems, resources, nodes, neutral factions near you and sometimes... nothing. Oh also there are factions who are exceptionally good vs certain other factions such as cravers and unfallen. Basically unfallen are very annoying because they can force you into peace but cravers cant ever have peace so they can just ignore this ability of unfallen. I find such hard counters to be not fun.

BUUUUUUUGS AAAH! This is one of the buggiest games out there for me and the problem is that these bugs hinder gameplay. Not fun bugs or bugs I can ignore. If my game bugs I have to restart and hope it starts working normally.
Some bugs I encounter are: Turn not ending. As you can understand this is a pretty big fucking deal. If I can't end my turn then I can't play. This happens often every few hours. Devs were informed about this issue many times over the years. Have they fixed it finally in 2021? Fuck no lol they dont give a shit!
Another bug is tooltips disappearing. Oh look a building, improvement or whatever. I wonder what it does *moves mouse over the said thing and sees nothing* Oh yes. *Restart* This bug causes tooltips to disappear. You cant see what they do and its pretty fucking hard to play when you dont know what anything does! This bug happens very often, more often than turn not ending unfortunately and once again devs know about it. It has been here for years. Have they fixed it? Again NO! They just keep releasing shit dlcs that people dont even like. Honestly just go buy something else, with devs like these I wouldn't recommend this game even while its on sale.

When developers are scared of supporting mods I end up thinking devs are scared of people who dont get paid for modding will end up doing a better job then them. For this game that thought is extra strong because devs keep fucking up! Balance? Nope! Fun? Nope! Wtf are they doing then?!? Lately new factions have been absolutely shitty because they are not fun and balanced. If people who like to play professionally develop their own balance mods and make it mandatory and casual people are DISABLING dlcs they BOUGHT with money then wtf are these devs doing? How can they make shit so bad that people would rather disable the dlcs they bought? I can't understand wtf is going on in their heads.

And if you try to fix their incompetence with mods they will disable your achievements. Wtf. If I wanted to cheat for achievements I can unlock them with a single click with achievement unlocker. Do you really think you can stop people from cheating? Did you forget about cheat engine? 

AAaand if you try to change mods after starting a game... too bad! You can't add mods to save files so you have to start over! Mod causing issues after 10 hours? Start over! You forgot to add/remove a mod? Start over! Why? Just why? I wish I just bought stellaris. I hate this. I wish I have never wasted my time on this game. This game just makes me mad but I keep giving it another chance because I paid for it, because they keep working on it I assume they are fixing shit but they arent pls send help.

Normally I allow comments on my reviews but Im 200% sure some fanboys will start screeching in the comments and Im just not feeling like an animal tamer right now so maybe later.",1620218116,1620220110,False,20,2,0.460909575223922729,0,True,False,False

Graphics are unusually cheerful for the genre. Don't mistake this for simplicity though. 

Races play very differently, and each comes with its own quest line where you learn more about their lore and choices you make have effects on game play. I strongly suggest starting to use ESG balance mod soon to make the choices more interesting and the races more balanced.

The UI looks polished and beautiful but is not always very user friendly. Some design choices are strange and make the game more abstract then need to be, e.g. you will only see in menus if you have improved and upgraded your colonies, fleets are always represented by a single transparent ship - I have no clue what was the thought behind this. Also battle mechanics are very intransparent and unnecessarily complex, especially since you can't control anything during battle directly. 

Despite these critics, it is definitively an enjoyable, fun strategy game. Best bought on sale together with the various DLC's (except the last 2 ones, which were developed by a different studio and are a mess).",1619307855,1619363680,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

A very detailed and well-made 4X TBS that was my first experience in the genre and a mighty good one at that! After watching Sseth's video I was so intrigued by what he had to say that I decided to buy the whole package immediately and never had any regrets for doing it for the full price.
Disclaimer: if you are unfamiliar with the genre (like I was), your first experience is either going to give you extreme headaches from enormous amount of information contained in the gameplay, or if you're more of gradual learner- just take from 20 to 40hrs respectively. That's just the way it is.
*)Despite the length of the review, I will only list the Basics and some very easy to understand concepts so you can form an light and somewhat unbiased opinion about the game. No one wants to read piles of descriptions and calculations about advanced gameplay unless it's a gaming YouTube channel or a specific guide /article. 
Now onto the objective (and sometimes- subjective):

1)General gameplay- is generally (!!!) the same for all 12 major factions of the game, with several strategical routes available, each one corresponding to the victory types that are currently in the game. Simplified: want to win economically or scientifically: farm dust (main in game value) or tech upgrades respectively; or if you're an avid follower of Teddy Roosevelt's famous saying- just whack all your opponents instead; etc... Besides the grinding system of FIDSI -(main components of the game's economy: Food, Industry, Dust, Science, Influence), the details of your path to victory, besides the route you wish to take are mostly dependent on the unique gameplay variations of each major faction and can be classified like this:
a)Minor stuff- like easy to learn ''grind'' perks for Sophons, United Empire, Horatio, Vaulters and Lumeris;
b)More complex stuff- like Hissho, Riftborn, Nakalim, and Cravers;
c)And really challenging stuff- like Unfallen, Umbral Choir and Vodyani.
*)Difficulties are subjective as are most of the opinions, and some people might disagree with my ranking, but it's mine for a reason.

Some side notes before the 2nd part:
General gameplay is divided into several sections, but all of it is essentially decision making of different kind. Construction- what to build; Heroes management- who to hire&customize; Politics- which determine the main course of your empire; Science- what to research; Military- whom to whack, etc... Despite the seemingly complex system, there are only three gameplay phases: the Galaxy map which gives you an overview of everything from planets to fleets and where you will be making almost all of your decisions; Combat Sim cutscenes (because everything regarding combat is done during map phase); and specific windows: Diplomacy (self explanatory), Politics, Tech and Military (""shipyard"" which upgrade your ship designs, and ""barracks"" - which offer different additional upgrades aside from tech ones). 

There is a LOT of lore&information in this game. Most of it is told through cinematics (two per faction, plus three Academy quest line endings), lengthy written ""briefings"" before each faction specific mission, and many, less lengthy for what it's worth, descriptions for neutral quests and almost every action and decision you're about to make during gameplay.

2)Onto the second most interesting subject- Major Factions themselves. They are all unique, with their own set of strengths&weaknesses, and general gameplay ""preferences"". I will not be telling anything about their gameplay because it will ruin your precious first time experience of reading through piles of texts so instead- I will be ""ranking"" in a specific way: Difficulty (of gameplay*), Quality (how interesting and engaging the gameplay is), Visuals&Aesthetics, Lore; also some short side notes below:
a)The Sophons- Easy; B+; A-; A.
Fairly vanilla faction with a straight way towards Science victory. 
b)The Cravers- Easy+; B-; A; A.
Militaristic faction. Very one dimensional gameplay. You will either like them, or not.
c)The Lumeris- Easy+; A-; B+; B+.
Hybrid faction. The Economy victory is the easiest, but can do military or science as well.
d)The Riftborn- Medium; A; A-; A.
Hybrid faction. The Science and Wonder victory are the easiest, but can do military too.
e)The Unfallen- Hard+; A; A; A.
The hardest faction in the game to play good. Hybrid with either Conquest or Wonder victory being the only solid choices, but can branch out (pun intended) towards science.
f)The Vodyani- Hard-; A; S; A.
Very tough to play properly Hybrid faction with the strongest late game. Due to faction specific mechanics can do all of the victory types. 
g)The United Empire- Easy; B+; A+; A-.
Very beginner friendly Hybrid faction. Basically- grind gameplay. Multiple victory types feasible most prominent being Conquest, Science or Wonder.
h)The Horatio- Easy; A-; A; A-.
Beginner friendly Hybrid faction. The only gameplay difficulty is proper splicing order. Easiest victory types are Science and Wonder.
DLC Factions:
i)The Vaulters- Easy+; A; A+; A+.
Beginner friendly Hybrid faction. Certain faction gameplay specifics make it nigh impossible to do anything except Science and Wonder.
j)The Hissho- Medium+; A; S; A+.
Despite what some people might say- not beginner friendly Hybrid faction. Anything except Wonder or military related is very hard.
k)The Umbral Choir- Hard; B+; A-; A+.
NOT beginner friendly faction. I do not like their gameplay nor have I played them alot, but Science is still the easiest option.
l)The Nakalim- Medium; A; B+; A+.
Not very easy hybrid faction. Faction specific trait makes it nigh impossible to win a Science victory but everything else (except Economic) is feasible.
*)Custom factions- will be your bread and butter after getting bored with the major ones. You can create anything you like in this game, including changing your starting hero to suit your needs. 
*)The are a ton of minor factions in this game, which act mostly as cattle to be conquered or diplomatically coerced to join your empire. Pirates act as a gameplay obstacle unless you can reason with them (Vaulters DLC).  The Academy faction (Awakening) is NOT a problem, despite what people say. You can tweak their difficulty before starting the game and they aren't really as obnoxious as folks tell.

Last side note: Graphics are bonkers. Everything looks as crisp and fresh as an AAA title. Voice acting is S tier for all the factions. Cinematics aren't particularly great, but all of them are very immersive and add to the quality of this game. The music  is FANTASTING. Almost all faction themes and ambient tracks sound really refreshing and add some needed immersion to the gameplay. Objectively best faction tracks are going to be: Unfallen (with clarinet, bass clarinet and harp solos), The Vaulters (with cello and viola solos), The Hissho (with winds and percussion), The Vodyani (solo alto/soprano) and United Empire (huge ass choir). The whole soundtrack by FlyByNo is available on the Internet and it's of great quality.

Overall, the game is great. It's not as balanced as you would expect it to be, but it has a lot of soul in it and I was kept very busy and interested for at least 400hrs. The sheer amount of gameplay mechanics including empire management, military management, planetary exploration/expansion, and I haven't even mentioned multiplayer which has some funny shenanigans too... Plus also, hey, there are still amphibious mommy milkers to look upon...                                                                                                                                              9/10.",1618135449,1619181404,True,63,1,0.810127973556518555,0,True,False,False

That being said, this game is overwhelmingly complicated. The combat is boring and simple (literally, you watch the combat after you make basic choices, unlike endless legends). After 11 hours of gameplay, I am left with a feeling of Meh... It is a busy work chore list that isn't that fun. I'd rather play something else.

First off, There seems to be 20 options for everything you do and endless combinations. This would be a good thing, but it gets to the point where it is too much and nothing really matters anymore. Want to settle a planet? Well Is it: 
Atoll, Forest, Ocean, Terran, Toxic, Boreal, Ice, Jungle, Mediterranean, Monsoon, Savannah, Steppes, Tundra, Arctic, Arid, Desert, Snow, Ash, Barren, Gas, or a Lava Planet, Gas Frozen, Gas Cold, Gas Temperate, Gas Hot, or Gas Burning? Each one is different and provides bonuses to different things. 
Size: Tiny, Small, Medium, Large, or Huge Planet?
   Size determines maximum population size of the colony.
Climate: Hot, Cold, or temperate?
Fertility: Fertile, neutral, or Sterile?
 These affects the resource generation for the planet an combines with techs and populations.
Does the planet have any resource deposts of:
Strategic resource deposits: Titanium, Hyperium, Adamantian, Antimatter, Orchalcix, or Quadrinix? 
These are very important for a good military. 
Does it have a Luxury Resource deposit of: Redsange, Hydromiel, Mercurite, Jadonyx, Voidstones, Endless Foundries, Dustciduous Trees, Proto-orchid, Dustwater, Bluecap Mold, Ionic Crystals, Proto-Spores Eden Incense, Gigalattice, Metaenactogen, Transvine, Lost Cities, Benthic Gems, Dark Glitter, Amanthoid, Virual Artifacts, Superspuds, Gossamer, or Drift Buds
These provide large buffs to your empire and are also important.
 
 What population type do you have? They also combo with certain planet types or other factors. ALL these combos are random generated and you have to look ate each of the types and decide which is the best one to get for your empire. Oh and each planet type you want is a different tech to research to colonize it. Different climates are boosted by other techs, Different resource deposits need differnet techs to use. 
Oh But wait, when you colonize a planet, you also are taking over the entire solar system, which will have multiple planets in it that you will colonize later. Do the other planets also work into your scheme? Does the system have one good planet, but the others are not great? Is that better than another system that has two decent planets? Do you have the tech for them. Oh and also dont forget to research your military, diplomacy, social, and economic techs too! That is just one choice to make when you have a new colony ship.. figure it out this turn. others are waiting for you if you are coop....
 There are few right or wrong answers, just a massive checklist to do that exponentially grows and your choice to pick which to do first. By the time you get one thing done, ten take its place. 

The Combat is boring. You outfit your ships with cool stuff (Which you also research of course and requires resource deposits for the good stuff as normal) then it gets really simple. 
Space battles, you choose short medium or long range on cards that also have bonuses tied to them. Want a specific bonus on a card? you are locking int whatever the battle plan on the card is. You must then make sure your ships are optimized for that card or you could be at a real disadvantage. OR you make your ships how you want to, and pick a battle card that compliments them, but you get whatever bonus happens to be on the card wheteher you like it or not. Then you start the battle and watch then fly in a curved line along the battle plan card and shooting each other until one side wins. It is over the end. Watching the battle I thought would be cool, but the trailers is as good as it gets. 
Ground battles are even worse. It is a numbers game with rock paper scissors. Everyone starts with Infantry. Then you research and get armor (Tanks) that have a bonus against Infantry, SO you shift your army to mostly armor. Then you research air troops (because you know, we forgot how to make an airplane when we made our space ships travelling through the galaxy) Air troops have a bonus against armor.but INfantry had a bonus against air. SO Rock paper scissors at the end. Infantry beats air, air beats armor, armor beats infantry. you dont pick this arrangement per fleet you have or battle though. It is lacked to EMPIRE WIDE, so if you load up heavy on one type, the enemies can counter you and you cant change it well without gutting your manpower. so end result is a balanced washed out force with a little of everything and a small leaning toward something. after that it is just numbers. I have x manpower, you have Y manpower. Each turn the two sides do RNG damage to each other and lose manpower. IF i have more manpower than you I will likely win. You gain manpower each turn like a resource in your empire, like money.

Anyway, there is much more to the game, but writing this review is as much fun as the game was....

I tried playing this again for various reasons. As much as this game gets up my snoot (more about that shortly). there are some really brilliant aspects to it that you may well enjoy provided  you are a masochist. What I like most is the United Empire intro vid. A contemporary and scathing cynical summary of the best that human culture has to offer.

And that is about as good as the game gets. Be warned, the game will cheat you blind to the extent that I am ashamed to say I have played this many hours and came back for seconds knowing full well that the best I can hope for is a draw on easy.

I just can't play this game anymore because of the blatant violation of trust the engine inflicts upon you. It is no fun to advance into a system with your target enemy, but then they swiftly whisk away before you can fire a shot, but then magically, when the AI floats in, your fleet is skewered and cannot move and is relentlessly engaged.


The 'coincidences' i suspected prior have become embellished and refined to the point of offense and so I cannot and will not change my assessment.

NOT RECOMMENDED.

Otherwise the game is brilliant and polished with stacks of diverse challenges but, the gameplay itself is tedious, annoying and generally unsatisfying. A terrible shame for such an otherwise beautiful production.



*reviewing latest release July 2020*
[so far, game reinforces weird fascism without bunny ears]

unfortunately, game not get better...

-------------
TL;DR
If you  want a bit of spacey eye candy, great, but a deep 4X this isn't.
Franchise game basically the same as Endless Space but with better graphics.

Game is slow

AI is stupid

Engine cheats

Tactically bland

Strategically limp

Insensitive Interface

Looks Pretty

---

Begin Rant:

I really do not like this game at all for various reasons:

It's a fluffed up re hash with stupid AI and very slow gameplay that crashes (on MAC, probably Windows too, definately ES had major memory leak issues). I do love the fact they are using MONO on the MAC to run their .NET assemblies. But who else gives a fart about that eh?


Technologies are basically the same as ES, nothing new in that stagnant pizza, and, once you remap from ES, the tech path is pretty much the same. Punch in the tech build and hit end turn repeatedly. Also anomaly discovery of random tech module, too random and in need of rebalancing, since it makes some tech research more or less irrelevant. No sense of urgency or surprise is offered making the process of discovery dull.

The event manager contrives events that I'm pretty sure are designed to annoy the **** out of you.

For example:

Build a colony ship and send to nice system to colonise.

Oh no! 6k pirate fleet awaits hidden en route and destroys your colony ship.

I am sure the designers are trying to develop some kind of context here but it fails as the events appear random and disconnected that become irrelevant and plain annoying as the game progresses. Post-content ad hoc parody.

A major dissuasion is the insensitive user interface.

So many times I have clicked fleet presuming it registered but for some reason theres a long delay before it actually picks up your click and so you will inadvertently send the wrong fleet somewhere. This happens all the time. Usually into destruction. It happens even when creating fleets, like cicking four ships but it only adds three and before you know it those three are in combat with a roving band of reavers and not strong enough to defeat it.

Secondly, I have not figured out a way to disable the auto routing of a fleet, as by default it will navigate the shortest path, yep you guessed it, through the system where the pirates just ko'd your colonists. Not a damn thing you can do about it. There is not even a 'move preview' so you just have to pray they will avoid the pirates. They don't.

An annoying bug is fleets moviing along hyperlinks that if they are in exactly the same position only one fleet is accessible. You can right click to show fleets, yep, there they are but no way can you select anything but the top-most. The only way to regain control of the other fleets is to move the top fleet elsewhere. 

Ship design is a joke, a few modules and slots all pretty much the same in 3 tiers, and it wont really matter much anyway as the space battles do not seem to reflect your design in any observable way. 


Space combat is tedious (though pretty). All I ever seem to be able to choose tactically is one of three cards, whilst the computer has a wide choice. Even on advanced you have very little control. Can't even plot the curves of your fleets or their staring points. All so contrived and you know it when your fleet outgunning opponent 3 to 1 gets a draw or worse, annihilated.

Planetary conquest, wtf... More facepalming tactical card selection for what reason exactly? Unknown. Highly unsatisfactory number crunching with pictures.


Leaders... Essentially you will get enough skill points to fill all their skill slots. There is no sense of critical decision making here. Customising their ships.. Who cares?

Planetary Management is also stale and entirely an ES transplant. Queue everything up according to spreadsheet optimised build and hit end turn repeatedly.  Early game minor differentiation but end game tedium, which seems like a signature of space 4X these days. 


Dont bother playing with 12 players or huge universes you will spend all your time looking at the hourglass.

In summary, while the game is visually a treat and offers some early game entertainment it fails to deliver the goods in the long run.",1497663318,1618228985,False,3,1,0.484324127435684204,0,True,False,False

This is a good game with a couple of pretty annoying problems.
Pros: Love the visuals, controls are intuitive, combat is understandable without spending hours reading through wikis (looking at you, Stellaris), and games don't last for a month at a time (still looking at you).
Cons: Tech tree is not very user-friendly. The search function does not work, meaning that finding the building or ability you're looking for is time consuming, especially as not everything is where you'd expect it to be. For example, new ship hulls are under Development, not Military; new planet type settlement abilities are scattered between Economy, Development, and Science, instead of being all in one place. It feels like the intent was to make it possible to pick out only the techs you need for each game, but it wound up just chaotic. I also feel like they leaned too far towards shortening game length - I have yet to get more than a couple chapters into any storyline. I tried turning down the game speed but that slowed down _everything_ including story progress.

- ES2's AI appears to be much worse. Even though it does what it's supposed to do, even me as a new player haven't had ANY problems with the highest possible difficulty settings. Too easy!
- the planet expansion is pretty much straight forward and brainless - research and build just everything
- overall, the whole eXplore part feels good, but it get's very repetetive very fast.
- the ship designing part, well, the equipment part to be exact, is clearly better than the one of Stellaris. Even if it's lacking weapon variety, there are enaugh different modules to justify several different versions of most ship classes
- the combat must be planned in advance, and is purely cinematic once started. That's not a bad thing though.
- the performance is much better. Since Stellaris is RTS and ES2 is turn based the actual gameplay is perfectly smooth, apart from the turn calculations of course.
 - the lack of different gameplay options makes the game become repetetive very quickly (after 40 hours already, played Stellaris for 800+ hours)
- Stellaris goes way deeper into detail in several topics, and also has a greater variety in, well, basically everything.

Would I recommend this game  - yes. Are there things I'd like tweaked - surely. Overall, it's an excellent followup. 

I really wish they'd put their mind to a Civilization type game and give tired, unappreciative of it's fans, snooty old Firaxis a run for it's money. I have no doubt Amplitude would knock it out of the park.

Back to the game:

It's a little daunting getting into the game thankfully the tutorial is quite good at prodding you to do things. 
The early expansion is fun as it is in most 4X games and there's lots of excitement trying to find another system you can colonize. 

There are a few things which bug me: The technology descriptions/names are so unintuitive - there's no Pottery or Gunpowder techs - it's all fancy scientific names which don't really give you an idea of what they do. A neat thing for them to do would be to have a plain simple description that could be given as a tool tip as to what the tech does. That way you could know immediately what you're getting (e.g. Metallic Plate genetics - hmm what does that mean - hover over - tool tip says - give you better armor for your ships to protect against lasers). It's a minor point but it does increase the learning curve.

Next is the diplomacy: The AI seems to have an immediate tendency to dislike you. Similar to Civ VI - it's tough to get them to like you. However, at least in ES2 you can get them to like you and they are loyal and not stab you in the back at the end of the game because that's ""fun"". For those of you who haven't played CIv VI - there is no point in being friends is they will almost always turn on you by the end of the game because that's ""fun"" according to tired old Firaxis. 

Finally is the difficulty: Even on easy, I find the game a challenge. I just wanted to play a peaceful build game in my first fiew playthroughs but the AI always attacks me with giant fleets forcing me to try to fight them back. Frustratingly, even though I'm on easy - they're tied or ahead of me in techs so I find myself getting beaten back. That's one thing Firaxis does a good job of is the level of play is well managed. On the easiest levels of the Civ games you almost can't lose which is the way it should be - that way you can really learn the game without the stress of worrying about the AI. 

So I've saida lot about things I'd like tweaked - why am I saying Yes/thumbs up? 

The above things (with the exception of the difficulty) do not ruin the experience - the rest of this fantastic game make up for the shortcomings: the very unique factions (very very different play experiences depending on the faction you use), it's fun building your ships, the political system is very cool too (depending on what party that wins in the elections affects what laws you can use which affect how your empire grows/prospers - for example if the military party wins the election you can pass laws that may make it cheaper to build ships or get more men to fight).

I highly recommend this game however 
- the learning curve is pretty high because it's a very deep game - always something to figure out
- the way the battles are determined is different - you watch a cinematic which shows you the battle - you don't actually control anything other than some variables you pick before it starts. It's not a big deal but may be for some
- it's a space Civ game which sometimes can be a little hard to get into if you prefer regular civ games - specifically challenging is the lack of land masses which then don't allow defensive positions in the same way so you end up having to have masses of ships on every colony to prevent losing a system. It's also harder to visualize your Civ as it's just a black space map with planets/stars scattered around
-

That being said, if your a space civ fan get it, if your a regular civ fan get it. It's much better than Civ VI and probably a little better than Stellaris. Amplitude is a great company which supports it's products so I expect lots of added content and features

Addendum: 2021

I've put a little more time into this game. 
It's still a thumbs up but it is fairly repetitive - all the games end up with you being attacked and forward settled - you fight them off and then get bored and eradicate all enemies. 

I suppose this is how Civilization games go too. The one thing I'll say about Civ games is it is possible to play a passive/peaceful game. In ES2 - can't be done. You will always end up in war no matter what you do. Is this a bad thing? Not bad but makes for a very predictable game.",1496294593,1617102370,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False
392110,77707532,76561198076883236,396,57,51589,54,21005,1707989532,"It's a bit of a mixed bag, with much more good than bad.

To start? Presentation is gorgeous. The lore and story are enthralling, the music is top notch, and although the game suffers tremendously from meaningless technobabble, the writing is, overall, very good. The core gameplay is top notch, 4X with a greater emphasis on galactic diplomacy. There's many fun and viable factions to choose from, and the Nakalim, so you won't run out of new playstyles to explore for a long time. Almost all of the DLC is very good, minus one, but they suffer from a major issue of having sometimes conflicting or poorly planned gameplay mechanics. Prime example is the Choir, from the Penumbra expansion. Hacking is their main mechanic, and it works beautifully on them. But every empire now has access to hacking. This isn't a problem in itself, the problem lies in how poorly risk and reward are structured for hacking for all other empires, and how little they actually interact with the system. Since the game wasn't designed from the ground up with hacking as an option for all empires, there's significantly diminished focus on making the hacking fun for any faction but the Choir. There's a similar phenomenon with Behemoths and the Hissho, who start with one, whereas everybody else has the option of making them later after a quest arbitrarily triggers in the early game, with the general applications of a Behemoth being much better for some factions than others -- but none ever feeling quite so essential or interesting as the faction they were made for.

However, these are ultimately just singular mechanics that are a bit awkward when put under a microscope. They basically never interfere with the gameplay significantly if you largely ignore them, especially hacking. The same can't be said of the Awakening DLC and Isyander.

The Awakening DLC is awful. Don't buy it. It's been ""fixed"" a few times, but no bandaid can fix the fact that it's fundamentally poorly designed. Winning his fleet, The Spear, in the early game is enough to win an entire system by itself, it's a small nuclear bomb for the price of 2000 influence. The fact that he expands so rapidly is a joke, and the numerous ways that the design of the The Academy as an NPC faction as well as the Nakalim's design clash against ES2's other systems are so apparent that they feel like they weren't thought out at all. 

Getting past the DLC, let's talk about actually playing the game. It's ""stable"", but it's often buggy. It's not unreasonable to expect some bugs from a game of this size and complexity, but it breaks in weird ways arbitrarily. I've had fleets randomly stop moving for entire games until I reloaded, ships I built just randomly disappearing and never being properly placed into my hangers, and of course the game just randomly loading forever. It's a real problem, especially in multiplayer where you desynchronize within .5 seconds of getting past the early game. It's in a much more stable state than it used to be though, and kudos for that. If you're not playing multiplayer, the game has a variety of difficulty settings for you to play against the computer.

Which leads me to the AI. Each faction is played differently by the AI, and some better than others. The unifying factor, however, is that they aren't actually playing the same game as you. I have seen, numerous times before, the AI do things that should not be possible whatsoever, things that seem to me to be mathematical impossibilities. It's most common the highest difficulties, but it happens on lower difficulties too. They cheat, and what's worse is that they cheat poorly and blatantly. This would be forgivable if they weren't, also, complete morons. You will be astonished by the level of 5th Dimensional Realpolitik the Sophon AI displays as they declare war on you, ignore you for 8 turns, and then offer you 50 Antimatter to end the war. Truly, a diplomatic savant if there ever was one. This means that the more time you spend alone with this game, the more annoyed you're gonna get by the AI, because eventually you'll just get really, really good at beating them without much of a challenge. My suggestion is to find a few friends and play with them, maybe with a few AIs in there to fill out space.

This game has custom factions. You know how in some Smash Bros. mods, you can turn on Turbo mode, which lets you cancel all of your moves into each other and combo forever? That's what custom factions are. They're completely broken, and if you play them against the vanilla factions you're going to pub stomp without thinking. There's a lot of fun to be had with them, however, if you set some house rules. All Custom Factions makes for a broken mess of an experience where you try to counter your opponent's stupid OP garbage with your own stupid OP garbage, and the level of creativity involved in this sort of arms race is actually really engaging. Putting the AI on a custom faction is a fun way to make the game harder, although it's basically just enabling double-cheating for the computer. They're good fun, as long as you recognize that they are *not* there to be used in typical gameplay.

Overall, this game is great. However, it's got cracks, and they're not subtle if you really examine the game. Regardless, I give it a really strong recommendation. I'm excited to see what comes from this franchise next, I love this game, and I really hope the next expansion isn't outsourced again.

Short version: totally great, buy it, buy the DLC when it's on sale.

Long version:  

I've been playing these since the original Master of Orion.  Yo, gimme my social security check already!

Endless Space 2 is the first game I can remember that is trying to stretch the cliche of these games in any meaningful way.  Not stretch it nearly far enough, but at least there is a hint of effort.

I.e., you are not limited to travel and exploration via star lanes; you can send probes into the void and sometimes you will find an unconnected star system or whatever.  There's not NEARLY enough of interest out there, but it just adds some mystery to the game.  The whole cliche of star lanes is absurd to me, there's literally no basis for it in physics and it has a completely negative effect on gameplay.  (A better game would have you in empty space on Earth and you'd build star lanes as you go, think of it as drilling wormholes, more like expanding in Civilization; imagine if in Civ all the roads were already built and you could only move around by following mysterious roads... smh).

Pros: 

best graphics / vibe / aesthetics in a Space 4x game ever

lively and interesting diplomacy model

my favorite ship design setup ever


Cons:

Despite its visual appeal, UI is often not ergonomic in accomplishing simple tasks

WAY too many quests; it's extremely distracting from the arc of the game and 90% of them you can't even compete in because the goal is on the other side of the galaxy or it would require a complete reset of your economy for rewards that are not remotely worth it

Typical problem of ""whack-a-mole"" combat, trying to corner an enemy fleet that is jumping around before you can get there, including passing you in the opposite direction on star lanes.  

Almost everything that detracts from this game being a masterpiece is easily fixable but the developers don't have any veteran gamers to help them over the hump with feedback, is my impression.

The obvious comparison is to Stellaris.  Stellaris is FAR drier, but has far deeper options in running your government.  (One example: you can decide whether robots you build are slaves or have citizens' rights).  Despite that, Stellaris games all feel like the same game to me, where you simply compensate for your race's weaknesses through industrial improvements.  

Endless Space 2 is quicker to play, mostly skims over the hardcore details of Stellaris, yet feels like it will yield more diverse games in terms of actual strategy.  That's all a big plus to me.  I just wish I could have the ear to help them fix some of the really bad interface/ergonomics issues to push it to the next level.",1614937312,1616502977,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It's hard to know where to start. I'll say the best thing is the artwork, which is really top notch. Every other aspect feels worse than similar games (Stellaris comes to mind).

They have managed to craft this setting that allows them to create a variety of differing games that appeals across audiences and yet also brings them all together. So even if you don't like Endless Space 2, there are other Endless titles in other genres you might like. It's a great idea.

Endless Space 2 especially is a wonderful experience. It must be said that it, as well as Endless Legend, may not be the most well-balanced strategy game series you've ever played. Civilisation is perfectly crafted so that every civilisation works and is balanced against the rest. Endless Space, instead, provides you with incredibly unique, sometimes bonkers, play styles for each faction so that you have a special and exciting experience with each game, rather than the slightly tweaked replays in Civilisation. This is great, and bad, at the same time. It means it's always exciting to figure out how the heck a new faction works, but it does mean there are balancing problems between the faction. I say this because I suspect this would be an issue for multiplayer. As a singleplayer experience, it's very liberating.

The music is eyewatering (or... earwatering? Ew). I would recommend the soundtrack to anyone that adores beautiful space operatic music with sweeping, often haunting, choirs. If you have played other Endless games, you'll even recognise the similarities between them. I love it so much.

Each faction has their own storyline too, which helps to create character. This is what lacks in Stellaris, and even Civilisation. When the Sophons excitedly (with a voice actor that sounds like a kids' tv show presenter) looks forward to 'blowing stuff up... uh, I mean, let's do science!' you get that sense of who they are, what they're about and how much fun it all is. The sense of humour over at Amplitude is wonderfully overt, yet the ideas, concepts and gameplay are not silly or goofy.

Don’t buy this game as it’s a complete waste of time.
ES2 offers a rich variety of game mechanics, a nice enough story and interesting factions. Don’t be fooled into learning any of them though as the game is one failed game mechanic ruining your play-through after the other.

From (1) the endless pending turn bug to (2) a bug where you can’t do any actions, can’t save and can’t progress turns either (ending your play-through right there after 90 turns).
To (3) a planet invasion mechanic that seems deep, but is completely linear and buggy. You can siege enemies planets down so that there are 0 troops left. Then you invade and the AI starts drafting from the population. Although your army should easily beat the drafted troops, exactly 1 or 2 tanks miraculously remain after every single turn. Until there is no more population.
If (4) you’re at war with empire X and empire Y is also at war with empire X, be prepared to constantly battle empire Y (because of the cold war mechanic). Obviously, as they go for the same targets, it’s actually you two being at war, because empire X doesn’t have a fleet left. And you’re stuck in this attrition nightmare.
And if (5) you try to go to “peace” with empire Y (because of this complete non-sense), be prepared to gift them all your money and resources …. This seems to be the bipolar mindset of the AI: They either agree to whatever or they want ALL your stuff for a treaty like: “Stop ringing my bell every time you come downstairs.”
Speaking of enigmatic diplomacy, (6) be prepared to be ordered to compensate an empire on the other side of the galaxy, that you’ve never interacted with before, “ALL your moneys.” After chuckling the first 10 times you will eventually click on the accept icon by accident and reload. Or (7) you don’t even get the option to compensate them and they start hating you regardless …

[b] Concluding: [/b] Don’t be like me. Don’t bother learning the game. Don’t get attached to this compilation of broken game mechanics. It’s a waste of time.",1615558882,1615558882,False,11,2,0.510784506797790527,0,True,False,False

There's a lot different systems (ship design, research, construction, laws and government, as well as race specific abilities ect)  that all come together nicely to create a complex game with many strategies. I dove in and learned by playing, then after I was kind of lost I looked up some guides to help explain what i should be focusing on. Don't be like me, unless you have a lot of experience with games like this do a little research on how to play before investing a lot of time, as it will make it much more enjoyable.

Races feel unique and lend themselves well to different strategies, from economic powerhouses, to slave driving warmongers, and even space vampire zealots who can command entire solar systems with massive ships unique to them. I love the ability to customize my ships to suit a variety of purposes, from weapons and armor to additional manpower to assault planets, extra engines for speed or support modules that give all kinds of benefits. There's only 4 types of weapons (6 if you include fighters and bombers), though each has multiple variations. I've found 1 of those 4 to be the best general choice, specifically the mid range laser. Its powerful enough, and versatile to counter your enemy with battle tactics. It took a long time, but I did eventually begin to wish there was more variety in the weapon modules available.

The two downsides to this game, first, pretty much any content you find online will likely be form the early access version of the game or previous patches, and is outdated. I found most of the information is still relevant but less optimal then before. This is a good thing as it leads to more variety in strategy, but when you first start out it can make learning the game a little tougher. Pretty minor though. The second, is that there is no progression between games. Essentially, each match you play is a campaign, and can take quite some time to finish. This is fine, and each race does have a unique story that's revealed throughout the game with optional quests, but once you have experienced each race, you pretty much know whats going to happen story wise, aside from a few minor random quests that get repetitive. This isn't a flaw in the game, as there's still plenty of content, I just found after a couple campaigns I wasn't even reading the quests anymore, id just look at the goal I had to achieve and the rewards if I achieved it.

A few months later I was bored of classic 4X strategy like Civ and returned to it, I put in the time to understand it more and it has really opened a door into a whole new universe. Then Endless Space 2 came out and it's so much better, its like driving a lamborghini as opposed to a VW beetle.

This is a crisp turn based sci-fi, 4X space odyssey that I find, among other things, to be peaceful as I can go at my own pace and take my time, I'm a slow thinker, I take my time, so it works for me. 
I think my 'happy place' at the moment is early morning gaming on the couch laptop in front of me, sipping some good coffee, listening to an Alastair Reynolds audio book on my headphones while getting immersed in a game of ES2. 

My current favourite set up is playing normal speed, 5 random opponents, no pirates, impossible difficulty, Disk-4 galaxy shape, colossal size and a custom built faction. I write my own little faction history too so that's a bit of fun. 

This is by far one of my favourite games now, it's so immersive with the updates and DLC's It's so much better, they've patched the annoying bugs as well (like that insidious eternal production queue). 

I'm looking forward to Endless Space 3 (whenever that happens) but for now I am pretty content with this. There's something great about creating a new game, spawning a new universe, a new galaxy, finding out if you've been lucky with the planet types and systems around you, finding out who your galactic neighbours are & how far away they are. 

I like to plan my games pretty well and I have been known to pump out a dozen explorer class ships for the first 30 turns, have a look around then take a screenshot & load a save from the beginning to play a perfect game, if such a thing exists. 

Something else that I have enjoyed with this game is customising a faction (you can take any faction race and edit it to suit your play style) I am currently playing with a customised United Empire faction geared towards science (I'm sick of those arrogant little Sophons) and it's great, I tweak it every now and then as well, like I said perfectionist. 

Once you know what your doing I recommend changing the settings so you wont have to deal with so many pop up screens, I no longer get pop up screens for planet anomalies, curiosities, resources e.t.c I prefer to examine the planet after I've probed all the nodes, I figure ignorance is bliss sometimes. 
It's also a good idea if your new to go to your settings and increase the amount of auto saves because there's nothing as annoying as having a massive fleet appear out of nowhere, invade a planet on your border system, destroy your fleet, kill a hero and siege your colony there... just load an auto save from a few turns back and prepare. 

I find the ascetics beautiful and sometimes I will even watch a fleet battle, that's also a great visual. Graphically I feel that there's still room for improvement and I'm looking forward to Endless Space 3, this is a vast improvement to Endless Space 1 tho so I cant complain too much. 

Don't be discouraged about the amount of detail in the game especially the technology tree when I first started I had no idea & it was all too much but after a few trial and error games its as easy and natural as breathing, I'm literally like 'oh I need to buy a hero soon so I better research 'Impactless Sites' for the G - Services Exchange', seriously though it does become second nature. 
For a new player your better off researching in this order to stay safe Xenobiology, Rare Earth Forms, Machine Bacteria, Off World Agribusiness & Planetary Landscaping, then it's pretty much up to you however I tend to get the ones I really want asap then I can relax a bit. Just my opinion tho.

This game takes a bit of an effort to get into but once your there its an interesting beautiful strategy on an operatic grand scale, it doesn't pretend to be something its not so if your going to get into a game set some time aside and let the game take you places that you never even realised existed.",1569144244,1615027499,True,2,0,0.501394689083099365,0,True,False,False

[b] What I Liked [/b]

This game made me feel like I was playing a space opera.  I've played a ton of these games, but this one felt dramatic to me.  From the look of the universe, to the combat, etc.  I really liked that feeling.  It's not as detail oriented as likes like Stellaris, but it doesn't need to be.

[b] What I Did Not Like [/b]

Not much, except that the learning curve could be a bit rough.

[b] Why I Stopped Playing [/b]

Another game caught my interest, but I still fully recommend this game.

[b] Disclaimer [/b]

I have been a gamer for over 30 years.  I tend to play mostly PC games.  I also bounce around between games A LOT.  I may purchase a $60 game and play it for 2 hours or spend $10 on a game and spend 50 hours on it.  Even if I played a game a short time, it does not mean it is bad.  It just means another game caught my attention.  I also complain about flaws in games a lot, even about the littlest of things.  Keep that in mind when reading my reviews.  If I do not have a complaint, then the game must be special!

Amazing music by FlybyNo (Arnaud Roy)

Deep enough to make me engaged, I liked making buildings/ships/science tree decisions, and also deciding how to spend move points with my fleets (you never have enough movement, so it's hard to choose where to go first)

Awesome UI lets you right click out of everything. You can close literally everything with right click. After playing this game I wish every other game had this sweet sweet feature. 

The game looks nice!

The factions feel very different to play, and the game is balanced enough for single player imho. I haven't experienced multi-player (I really wish I did), though I think it would be playable, but not perfectly balanced. 

Buuuuut...
1) This game is too slow, and I got bored and started over A LOT of times. I've only finished a game once, most other times I either regretted not playing well enough or felt overwhelmed with too many decisions, too little progress.

2) There's quite a lot of bugs, but I haven't encountered any major ones, so for me it was totally fine. Although people who don't read every single notification tend to have the game frozen after ending a turn, and the devs haven't fixed all of the ways this can happen, so it's still in the game. It's really really great that the game had A LOT of updates after release, but now it looks like they are finally moving on, so I think some of the bugs are here to stay. It really isn't a big deal for me.

3) AI's aren't that great, and Vodyani's AI is plain dumb (all the others are okay AFAIK)

I absolutely love this game, I think it's underrated. 

about DLC's:
The Vaulters is worth it.
The Awakening is definetely a skip.
Supremacy and Penumbra both add interesting factions while also adding game mechanics that ruin the game. 
Supremacy makes the game all about getting the OP ships instead of having a choice of various interesting paths to victory. 
Penumbra adds hacking, that doesn't make the game more interesting, but is superannoying. Playing as the new faction is fun, but playing as anything else in that DLC becomes a bit worse.

So imho the only major expansion that's definetely worth it and has no significant downsides is the first one, The Vaulters.
The minor DLCS's a nice, but only if you already like the game and want more or just want to support the devs",1614355470,1614355470,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Endless Space 2 was it for me; the game that let me finally really enjoy a strategy game long enough for it to get its hooks into me and now it's helped me get into the genre with other games, though I still keep coming back to this one. 

A lot of it is the user interface, it's clean and polished and uncomplicated looking; nowhere near as intimidating as the many others I've tried. The tutorial just kind of lets you go, keeping you on a lightly handled leash with tool-tips and such, but it did not take me long to just dive in.

Taking their phylosophy from Sun Tsu Art of War, you take on the role of one of many fractions as you seek to suppress the other races. Each races are colorful and inspired by things in the real world, with their own strategy to win this galatic warfare. 

Did you ever wanted to play as the Holy Roman Empire. Play as the United Empire, a faction where the will of the emperor is truth. Do you want a fleet of ships ready to invade in a day? The Emperor willls it. Do you want  entire systems colonize? The emperor wills it. Did anyone say that Rome wasn't built in a day. Well the Emperor says otherwise.

Would you rather go on the market and be jewish by controlling the entire market economy? Play the lumeres. A race of fish mafia pacifists who would rather buy out the opposition,  and work in their favor. After  all, it's only war monguering if you actually go to war, not when you buy a bunch of systems, sell it to the warlord cravers, and let them fight against your enemies. It is truly a peaceful faction, since it largely does not want any violence whatsoever as they take control of the economy like a wall street company. Is it any wonder why the jews were kicked out by chrsitian societies so many times? All I'm saying is that maybe Hitler had a point.

But honestly, all these factions palle in comparison to the most righteous faction. The one where I can relive the crusades over and over again. The Vodyanni are the religious factions where all will be offered to their God, the Endless. Their one Holy Goal is to unify all under one banner, the Endless. So they come in, educate the population of the true religion, baptized them into the arks, and make more beautiful vodyannis. Truly a very christian faction. They also have the greatest tendency towards war, which makes sense.

And theres more factions then the ones I described. Like how the riftborn are  demons from another dimensions. The Sophons are the Atheists who will eventually bring us into destruction by researching planet destruction. And the Horatios are bassically glorified incestual monarchist who have found a way to reproduce only within themselves. The game is great in taking history and setting it in the future.

If your question is ""Should I try one of the later Endless4X games, because they are at least as good, if not better, than every other game in the genre, including Stellaris and the Civ games?"" , Then my answer is yes. 

On the other hand, if your question is ""Should I buy Endless Space 2 over Endless Legend?"" then... well yes and no? The thing is, the two games are quite similar, apart from the obvious asthetics and setting differences. It comes down mostly to personal preference: Do you want to play a space 4X or a fantasy 4X? There are some differences between the two, ES2, being the newer game, wanted to improve on some shortcomings of EL, and while it succeeded on some fronts (everything that is related to combat), in my opinion it added unnecessary complexity on others (politics, the structure of the map, science, population). I think that this one looks better then EL, but again, not by much, and it mostly comes down to asthetics and art direction preference. My preference ultimately leans towards Endless Legend, but I'll be happy to play ES2 for many years to come whenever I wanna play in space..

So the TLDR is: Are the Endless games better 4X games than Civ and Stellaris? Yes. Is Endless Space 2 better than Endless Legend? Not necessarily.

The combat is worse in every way from the original, and pales in comparison to other 4X titles.

It's one of those games that's a mile wild and about an inch deep.  There is all kinds of mechanics at play, but it's not at all clear what those mechanics do right away, and as you start to dig into them, you find that they really don't go anywhere.  

This is the kind of game a programmer would play, if you worked at a gaming studio to kill free time while developing other games.  The kind of hidden gem that should exist only inside the studio, something that was never quite finished, never quite fleshed out, something the team played in the background as a team building exercise.  Perhaps as a web page application.

The game plays like a spreadsheet.  There is no actual combat, no real strategy, no depth.  It's just a bunch of numbers that all interact with each other through obscure and unknown mechanics that all culminates into a sum total at the end of the sheet.  The graphics are obligatory at best.  Any new mechanics you find (weapons, shields, engines, ships) only slightly increase your numbers, there is no point where actually seeing or having those things creates any sensation of awe, pride or excitement. 

The very, very, very few moments of any action whatsoever are played out in a scripted cut-scene that is bland, repetitive, and boring so you mostly just skip over it as fast as you possibly can anyways (but for some reason are mandatory).

I'm actually incredibly shocked this game was as reviewed as highly as it was.  Compared to Sword of the Stars 1 (Not 2) this game is just a pale, insubstantial shadow of the 4x genre that brings absolutely nothing to the table and takes advantage of almost none of the groundwork laid before it.

Mechanically, their 4x games stand out to me since their races and civs are so unique and different from each other. I also really enjoy the way the game is paced through questing. 
Sadly, the one weak spot for me is the combat and unit designs. For the most part, fielding big and expensive units doesn't feel different than weak beginner ones. Combat is played out automatically, and while there are some choices available to the player to alter the outcome, they don't create an exciting or tense atmosphere.  You pretty much know before the battle even starts how it's going to end. 

All in all, it's worth whatever price they are charging for it at this point. The vanilla game is great by itself, and if you like it, you can pick up the DLC to add some flavor.

Space combat is a MAJOR let down, where you design your ship, choose a captain from your heroes... and then either get an instant battle result, or just watch them drift in space in lines exchanging fire. yeah, you can choose which line they follow while trying to attempt to guess what line they will follow, but thats it. i miss getting to order my ships, choose the targets, and actually do things.

I'm someone coming from Stellaris, and while that might be an amazing game in its own right, it isn't anywhere near matching the feeling of life in Endless Space. The turn based game-play is fun, and the battles are a joy to watch. Now, while it may not match the scale of Stellaris, it make up for that with very unique visuals, and game-play,  for every faction. On the topic of factions, while most people don't seem to like custom factions because they can be very powerful, Amplitude studios has made it possible for the main ""story"" lines of each of the factions to still be playable, even if you change the fundamentals of that faction. I had a blast making a custom faction for every special ship skin ( Cravers Prime, Firekeeper Unfallen, Emerald Horatio, Red-Shift Riftborn ETC...) and trying to make them feel like completely unique, and balanced, factions I could use in my games. Now, while the core of this game is very good, the same could not be said for some of the content in some of the DLC. As much as I love the DLC, the Obligerator ( A special colossus ) and the Academy ( In Awakening) are a real pain. But instead of deactivating those specific DLC like some people recommend, I simply go to the advanced difficulty settings and put the Academy on easy, that way they can't really bother you. When I don't feel like dealing with the system-destroying Obligerator, I just turn off the world destroying weapons in the advanced settings. Anyway, the point is that they are simple solution besides deactivating the entire DLC which still give you an optimal performance, while being able to enjoy the otherwise very good DLC content. Overall, if I was able to give this game a more detailed rating, it would be an 8.7/10. This game gets so many elements so well done, that it easily overshadows its minor flaws. My recommendation would be get the base game only if you are on edge ( Unless its on sale) and after trying the base game for while get the DLC you want. If you are very excited about the game, don't be scared of buying all the DLC. Even the ones that content that is considered negative by the community can have its problems mostly rooted out with just a few setting changes. Anyway, that's my piece.

Perhaps I'm not smart enough to understand it but it seems overly chaotic to me and the fact I see no logic behind it makes me choose random ways of developing the tree instead of following a certain approach. The problems gets overwhelming as the games passes, with each turn I find myself more and more lost in what I'm actually trying to achieve. After a few hundred turns I no longer have any idea of what's happening, as all icons seem very much alike, the color coding does not provide enough support for the eyes and like I said before, certain results seem random enough that I find myself surprised at a new effect of a just-developed technology. Perhaps after spending another hundred hours with the titles, a player can memorize it all but I have never had to play that long to understand the technology or civic tree in a Civilization game so I'm rather baffled.
Anyway, for this reason I cannot recommend this game, although maybe some other people will find the technology system more intuitive than I did.",1611780771,1611780771,False,3,0,0.498121321201324463,0,True,False,False

Its good. It's great. Its bloody brilliant. 

The lore is some of the best I've seen, and spans between this, and the other Endless games. The factions have personality and cultures that rival sci-fi movies and shows. These reflect in their gameplay. Each race has unique gameplay features. Now if you played other 4x or strategy games, you might think ""oh, this race has +10 food production, but its other than that, its the same"" well, no. This is wild asymmetric gameplay. 
We are talking a race that lives on ships and can move their colonies as they wish, a race that doesn't use colony settlers and simply pays the free market to do the job, a machine race that colonises backwards starting with uninhabitable planets. There is a race that literally eats everything and need to keep building new homes while abandoning old ones. The expansions put in a wide-playing race that can warp from colony to colony, and even a race with a single, very powerful colony that is cloaked from the start of the game.
You may become a master with one race, and find yourself struggling with another.

You have elections, enact laws, declare wars, sign peace treaties. Of course you want to play through the game without getting genocided, or losing all your money. Maybe you want to bring the enemy population into your empire (or genocide them).
But while all this is going on, your get a faction lore quest. Unique to each race. And each chapter you progress in that gets you rewards like money or sciences that help you in the main goal of winning the game, while also giving you a nice story and developing the personality of each race.

The attention to detail is insane. The more you read into things the better. Took me a long time to notice that the laws where all named twice, one for an easy to remember short title, and then a very official name that you'd need to check the description to notice. I just recently found out if you liberate Auriga (the planet that Endless Legends game was set on) a certain race will call you up to thank you for it. That got a long ""D'awwww"" out of my girlfriend when it happened. Every hero has a backstory, planets have full detailed descriptions, unique planets with names have backstory on them. Everything gets a story.

The music is PHENOMENAL and i can't stress that enough. It is the only game music I've ever listened to outside of gaming. The artist name is Flybyno and he is god-tier. There are no words i can type to say how good it is, just listen. 

Now on to the negative things. The game has a bit of a steep learning curve, especially if you have never played a 4x strategy game. The last expansion race is a bit dull, especially following after 3 awesome expansions. (And sadly I think it might be the last as they are working on a new game.) 
There are some bugs that have not been addressed. Sometimes a turn wont end (stating ""pending""), unless you close every letter you received that turn. Easily done by right clicking them all rapidly, but still annoying when you have this bug. 
The time between turns gets longer around turn 150-200, especially on larger galaxy size with many AI. Never found it unplayable on my Ryzen 7 2700, or my girlfriend's ryzen 5 2600 either. I played this on a FX 8300 before, and it never broke the game.

Defiantly recommend this game for single player oriented people.
I also recommend co-op versus the AI - but what makes it fun is that you start off lost and alone, find your partner, have a little cold war while you both expand and throw your political weight around, and then finally sign a peace treaty, followed by an alliance. Alliances can win the game as a group, but the cost of victory is raised for each member. (Eg, Build 6 wonders instead of 3, conquer 75% of the galaxy instead of  the solo 50%, etc). 

I think that is everything. I can't believe it took me this long to write a review for this. I love this game.",1611723644,1611723644,True,1,0,0.510703384876251221,0,True,False,False

The same stupid things I hated in that game are replicated here. Removing factions, to make them minor races you can absorb. Absolute fucking stupidity that you can't eliminate outposts before they become colonies. A tech tree that is an abortion of the original. Utterly fucked up Heroes. No more can you pick a Hero that is only space skills focused or planetary. You have to piss half of your skill points into the wind cause they split skills. So half of your points are fucking worthless. About the only thing I like better then the first are the visuals of the space battles. Ground visuals are worthless and may as well have been left out. Watching static dolls disappear is so NOT enthralling. 

  Essentially, they replicated all the mistakes of MOO3. I am disappointed, and likely wont be getting another title from Sega-owned-Amplitude after this. And I wonder how much of this was because of Sega's hand in the pie. Despite my frustration I'll likely keep playing. Out of spite more then I'm enjoying it at this point.

Almost everything in this game feels very smooth and well-built. If you aren't used to 4X or grand strategy the UI is definitely a lot to take in at first, but within an hour or two you get into the swing of it and can really start to enjoy everything this game has to offer, The diverse playstyles of each race is a really nice touch that makes you actually think about how your chosen faction needs to be played and figuring out how to plan your expansion and colonial management is truly a wonderful experience. 
The one criticism I have for it regards the combat.

You need everything here! Literally!
You need food, to grow population, population contributes to the economy and gives oyu different bonuses based on the races you have in your systems, but the planets output by basic is pathietic, so you need to build improvements, to do that you need industry, more industy means more production. But to have industry you need research, to do research you need science, to improve science you need improvements, to support big improvements and a military you need dust, a sht ton of dust! To communicate you need influence, your literal borders are based on influence, to declare war, peace, alliance you need influence, a lot of it. The game is about micromanaging everything and trying to get the most out of everything you choose to do, every action you make is counterbalanced by the oppurtunity cost every action not taken so good luck with that.

[b]Wanna conquer?[/b] Go cravers and speedrun military, or take the United Empire and just convert every system by being close to them.
[b]Wanna show ultimate superiority?[/b] Go Horatio and show your beauty to everyone through a geopolitical dictatorship!
[b]Want horder money?[/b] Choose Lumeris and BIG TIDDY FISH MOMMY! buy everything (THE WHOLE FCKING GALAXY) and win accidentally.
[b]Wanna build science?[/b] Go Sophons or Vaulters(if you bought vaulters) and just hide until you win a science victory.
[b]Do you want to do nothing?[/b] Choose the Unfallen, they are scottish so it makes sense they aren't do too much, so if you want to be a vegetable all game, just play them.
[b]Want to be a proud warrior and a bird?[/b] Choose the Hisho(buy them lol) and be the samurai weeabo chicken you ment to be! btw behemoth's and the obliterator is strong af.
[b]Umbral Choir?[/b] Did not play that expansion, but you can make cravers fcking pacifist by hacking them which sounds fun.

Currently, and for a long history, it has been riddled with bugs preventing save files from completing. See ""Endless Space 2 pending"" bug reports; they are numerous and have had no serious potential fixes; save files that go for too long will eventually succumb. The only solution I have seen is to play the game in singleplayer for a couple turns, restart the multiplayer session, hope the AI that takes over for the rest of the group makes adequate decisions, and then further hope the issue does not return. In my experience, we tried for hours to recover a file that was utterly doomed to face the same softlock in 0-2 turns no matter what.

Playing this game cooperatively is a giant mess. This game, and Endless Space 1, do not allow for teams, and having an honor system for teams allows you to steamroll the AI. The AI rarely works together to counter human cooperative players.

I like the other games in the Endless series, but this game is the least polished multiplayer experience yet. It seriously needs a quality disclaimer, or to be taken off of the store for lack of accountability from the developers. There are good qualities to this game, but they are buried under blatant problems that need to be resolved. Our group of 3 could not get through a single game without multiple crashes, buggy mechanics, developer text placeholders, softlocked loading screens, and much-too-frequent softlocked turns.

The setting, the distinct mechanics of the different civs, the little story bits (not the random events which are kind of generic) for each civ ""quest"", all really just sell the universe to me. I only played Endless Space 1 once or twice before jumping into this, so it's hard to compare them, but it is a bit easier to parse than Endless Legend and while the city / system management is apples to oranges, I find the system management interesting and offering options while not being as messy as EL (and still way more interesting than Civ 5 or 6). 

The battles are probably a divisive thing - it's basically fleet vs. fleet, stat checks, although you can watch it play out if you like (once in a while it's nice to see ships go pew pew if you are warring). Whether you win or lose a battle comes from ship design, fleet management, and tactics cards which you pick 1 of at the start of the battle (these can have massive impacts on outcomes). But, since you're often dealing with multiple fleets across many systems across the span of a game, losing one fleet is not always that big a deal.

The expansions are generally good to me, although they seem to have poor reviews, I do think they perhaps feel expensive for what they add (one more unique civ and usually something gamewide for all civs / players). The Penumbra being the most unique in the game by quite a bit, a shadowy ""hacker"" race that doesn't colonize planets the way the others do. The ones added in Awakening and Supremacy aren't nearly as distinct but they are still interesting enough to play a bit differently than the other ""basic"" civs like Sophons and Empire. Supremacy adds probably the best ""tall"" civ for the game, although it's still a space 4X so you need some systems.",1610441369,1610441369,True,39,1,0.798891961574554443,0,True,False,False

But the problems don't stop there. Most of the iconography is meaningless. Meaningful controls are hidden three layers deep.

On the supposedly power-balanced setting, the pirates in the next system over from where one starts are spawning ships that are four to five times more powerful than a player can hope to produce.

While I can say that the base game has improved significantly, the DLC leaves a ton to be desired.  Much of what I would talk about would be covered in SsethTzeentach's video, as he demonstrates very effectively why the DLCs are problematic, especially the last DLC.

That said, I must reiterate some criticisms: the combat in this game is very basic and occurs automatically.  You simply get one big-stonking fleet up against another big-stonking fleet, and if yours is bigger or has more counters to the other fleet, then yours wins.  There is no micro in this game, so if you are hoping for something like Starcraft or Total War, you are getting neither.  To put it in perspective: Stellaris and Crusader Kings have more micro potential than this game.

The planetary and government management, however, are more enjoyable, and I love how planets have so many different anomalies to make planets really feel unique.  I also like how the races all play differently, except for a few who feel really vanilla (Sophons, United Empire, and Lumeris).  Custom races are sadly too easy to make OP and so games vs AI will be too easy and custom races will likely be banned in multiplayer.

Probably my biggest criticism in this game, however, is the late game slog.  Either you have system destroying weapons turned on or you turn them off and then the late game really slows down to a crawl as planetary assaults take way too long and it is way too easy to turtle.  The simplicity of combat also gives very little opportunity for comebacks.  Also, another rather insurmountable problem, is if you do not spawn with all of the important strategic resources, you will probably just lose.  Strategic resource fleets will dominate basic fleets, so if one player spawns with all the late game resources and another doesn't, it's going to be a very one-sided game.  Unlike games like Stellaris, where these rare resources can now be purchased from neutral 3rd parties, you can only buy strategic resources from the general market if another player actively sells those resources to the market....  While this is more realistic, discounting the fact that it completely ignores the existence or even possibility of a civilian economy working independently of the galaxy's governments, it leaves the game with the problem where game balance for multiplayer is out the window.

All of this said, despite the problems, I keep coming back to this game.  The base game is a good one.  The DLCs are not worth it thought, but maybe if you get them on a DLC it will be alright.  The last DLC will actively make your game worse though, so keep that one in mind.",1475903448,1609949473,True,0,0,0.597748994827270508,6,True,False,True

The DLC Content is largely unbalanced and even worse bring in a myriad of game breaking bugs you can easily look up yourself when googling the matter. Such as constant desyncs in MP. Game crashes.

For example; a hero gets a level up. You get a pop-up screen to deal with it, and take an action. Then you close your hero screen but the pop-up to deal with it has only been minimized on the right - waiting in your queue of many pop-ups to deal with it again - even though you've already done so.

Enemies negotiation AI are really irritating - its like a random dice getting thrown every turn for some of them if they are mad/threatening/make peace/make treaty/cancel treaty.

Oh a trade route gets cut off late game? Get ready to click on 18 pop-ups about what trade routes are cut off.

Some enemy in another system got lucky and had a system that could easily accomodate much higher population? Get ready to lose your entire system with no recourse as soon as their influence overlaps yours system. I mean I *guess* you could go to war because they are growing but I just find this immature decision on the designers part.

OH and don't even get me started on the 'hacking' system - most annoying 4X feature I've ever played - I cancelled a game that was 150+ turns in just to disable the DLC that came in once I realized just how irritating it is.  At least you can turn it off though! There's a plus for you - completely ironic that the first plus I mention is you can turn off a game feature, huh?

The tech tree is a slaughter house in my opinion most especially the way behemoth class ship improvements are scattered all throughout - also other ship improvements are honestly scattered in odd places as well but there are so many behemoth ones it honestly just begged for its own tree or something.

On the plus size it looks nice, and mostly plays smoothly. Late game it can get a little slow processing turns.

The game play turn-pattern and queing of your build for each plantery system is nicely implemented.

Some of the expansions seem iffy but overall the events/quest element is really well done!

Since it's almost all positive the negatives would be very limited ship customization/weaponry compared to others, and the live combat part has really terrible controls/camera. Since you don't have direct control once in combat, this doesn't actually impact your game, but it's something very simple that should be an easy fix and is extremely impacting on visualizing combat. Just fix the camera/camera controls?

That said, I do like that you can't directly control combat simply because it changes the dynamic of turn based strategy too much. It's hard for the game itself to balance when some people are very good or very bad at real time action. It does provide strategies to set before the battle which is a cool way to do it I think. In other games I sometimes feel like I can use real time combat as a crutch for weaker turn based play. I like that that's not the case here. I feel like enough control of the outcome is provided that outcomes of combat always make sense, which isn't always the case in these types games when auto-resolving.

Essentially, if you are in the market for a space-themed 4X strategy, Endless Space 2 is one of two good options, with the other being a little title called Stellaris.  Let's go over some key points to see if you want to buy ES2 or Stellaris.

1) Stellaris is designed to make you buy a handful of DLCs to supplement it.  Whereas, I would argue, ES2 is as good if not better if you just pick up the base game.  So in terms of money and downloads, ES2 might be a slightly better deal.

2)  ES2 features multiple win conditions, whereas the only way to win in Stellaris (that I am aware of) is to straight up conquer the galaxy.  Which is actually a little weird in light of some other points we'll touch on, like this next one:

3)  Stellaris is much more oriented around letting you craft your own custom race with all its own biological, cultural, and governmental characteristics; whereas ES2 features a strong but limited stable of tailor-made alien races that were hand-crafted by the devs to occupy distinct parts of the design space.  You can play as a custom species in ES2, but even then your options are sorely limited, and doing so is virtually guaranteed to play hell with the balancing.  Not that it's not fun, but if you intend to get into multiplayer and also wish to craft custom nations, you should probably go with Stellaris, simply put.

4)  ES2 is turn-based in the same sense as Endless Legend and many of the Civ games.  Stellaris is real-time.

Those are the main contrasting points for these two games.  Since this is a review of Endless Space 2, I'll drill down a little more on it.

Combat in ES2 is more hands-off than you might expect from a turn-based 4x.  You assemble your fleet, throw it at the enemy fleet, choose a strategy card (sort of like picking a play from a playbook in Sportsball) and then the game figures out who wins the battle.  You can watch the fight play out like a little cut-scene, or just skip it and see the outcome.  Personally, I kind of like this decision, but I TOTALLY understand that some people would gripe about it.  In Endless Legend, you could take control of battles and move your little chess pieces around individually, but most of the time I just used the ""auto"" function anyway.  Battles can take a long time if you do them turn-by-turn, and this kind of game already takes a lot of time to fiddle with everything in your empire every turn.  So a quicker, leaner function for handling battles actually does make sense in my opinion.  BUT, if you're looking forward to deep, granular tactical combat, do not get this title.

I think that's about all you really need to know to make up your mind.  To clarify what I was talking about earlier, I think it's weird that Stellaris gives you all this flexibility to design your own species with its own cultural values and government structure--including giving you pacifistic and ""xenophile"" types of options--but then it turns out it's basically a high-strategy war game.  It would almost make a bit more sense if Stellaris was the title with the over-designed empires and ES2 had the tools to build a more organic custom faction.

If I had to boil down the compare-and-constrast of Stelly and ES2, I might put it this way:  Stellaris is a bit like a PC running Windows, where ES2 is like a Mac.  The Mac is designed to be prettier, easier to learn, and the software kit is built with the assumption that the designers basically know what you want to do with it, so they skip all the fiddly bits and make it as easy as possible to work with.  The PC is used by a lot more people, and the designers made basically no assumptions about what you wanted to do with it, so they kind of just threw all the features they could think of into the mix whether it really applies to the user experience or not.

Both are super good games, and if you want to try both of them, knock yourself out.  In my opinion, neither title really captures the Masters of Orion II niche decisively.  MoO2 was a masterpiece - deep but elegant.  Satisfying, but not unwieldy.  I know we can't just play Masters of Orion II forever, I'm just saying don't expect ES2 or Stellaris to match it totally.

I've never been good at 4X games, but they're games I enjoy quite alot, so I have a strong love-hate relationship with them, if you want to enjoy Stellaris, but can't handle the complexity of it or it's diplomacy system, but want a good alternative, then ES2 is a very good option.

I put off playing ES2 because of my terrible experiences with Stellaris being grossly overcomplicated for my simple mind - Where going AFK for 5 minutes to make a coffee lead to a political uprising and re-structured my empire into a republic I couldn't control - not here, you are always in control - however the political systems does govern your play style in certain ways, such an enforcing ideologies for a period of time - Unless you're an Autocracy, your power is absolute, just to name a few.

This game is rather daunting and overwhelming at first, but the tutorial does a fantastic job of teaching you what you need to play, after about 90 turns in the tutorial I was basically ready, and the game seems alot easier to play than it looks - the difficulty will come down to beating your opponents rather than managing your own political problems unlike Stellaris to a degree with standard settings - but you can custom tailor your experience for a more casual style or nightmare if you wish.

There are many factions with many different ways to play, each faction has a preferred style of play, however you're not relegated to that specific style, want to be a peaceful Craver? you can - but your people will get angry.

You can win via Science, Monuments, Territory, Annihilation, Commerce or simply by Score - all of which you can toggle, you can have an all out war with only Supremacy, or the battle of the Galactic Market with only Economy.. Or Both! Blast away your competition!

Combat is also rather simple and easy to handle - make sure your bar and number is bigger than theirs and choose a battle tactic that gives you the biggest advantage and you'll be fine, obviously equipping your fleet properly is important, it's not exactly complicated, build with a balance in mind and you'll be fine.

The Research tree is also rather complicated at first, but it's incredibly simple when you go through it, each tree unlocks specific things to benefit you in specific ways, and you're not locked to a specific one, so you can turtle and research commerce and xenobiology, or prepare for war and get your blitzkrieg ready to go early game while starving your people, or strike a balance, your choice.

The Diplomacy System is also pretty simple as well, you contact, and you make offers and ask for things, some factions will be harder to negotiate with, while others are very happy to give you things for the prosperity of the galaxy and peace. Or you can just go to war and get rid of them entirely.",1609031407,1609031789,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

This one simply doesn't allow for my play style...which is to experience EVERYTHING and build my systems up over the course of hundreds and hundreds (if not thousands) of turns. Many of the games I like take me a good month or more of play before I go through and wipe everything out or make use of minor civs to do a lot of my dirty work. A GOOD turn based or rts game allows you to manipulate civs through diplomacy, allows you to truly be xenophobic, and allows you to build defensively if you want. This game offers none of it....

 Instead, this game forces you into a speed-build and speed-colonize pace with an AI that is so bi-polar that it changes from angry to friendly every 3-10 turns. One minute they are attacking WITHOUT declaration of war....and spamming hordes of fleets by turn 80..before you even have 3 good systems built. 

 The game is seriously over-cluttered with constant actions and popups that you rarely get a look at the galaxy overview to really see what is going on. It kills the feel of the game as building an empire and forces it into PvP-style turn based style of play where speed building is the key. I like a game that takes time to enjoy.... and so far I have attempted 4 custom games with the biggest galaxy and a small amount of AI civs (4)...and by turn 50 I am already getting swarmed by 40-50 enemy ships to my mere dozen. I often quit out by turn 100 as everything I have built has been wiped by bi-polar AI that seems to be unable to stay in one mood.

Games like the Civ games (through Civ4), Galactic Civs III, and even RTS games like Sins of a Solar Empire can last for weeks if I want it to.

Another huge difference is Endless Space has so much interesting and well written lore from story told through many quests you encounter, of which some are customized to your chosen race.

Is it proto-Stellaris? No. Actually I'd say it's more accessible and fun than Stellaris, of course I don't have all the scam P2W DLC...whereas I signed my soul to that shit on Stellaris.

Actually it's way more accessible than most strat games...but there's something about it that still feels off. A lag in the click speed and connection maybe? No knowledge of techtree? Possibly.

Lots of interesting factions. Going with a human faction default, you have some of the standard tweaks: this one is more science, this one is focused on trade. But some factions have very different play styles, altering basic rules of the game and allowing for a lot of replay and experimentation. Ship building is simple enough that you can usually rely on auto-upgrades, but still allows for a variety of customization in the mid-to-late game, for those of us who like to play with highly specialized ships and diverse fleets.

There's also quest-based stories, a universal story with some branching paths, and faction based ones. I usually find these distracting from my own internal narrative, but they're usually infrequent enough touch points to avoid overwhelming, and it's easier to ignore the faction quests without missing out on the rewards.

This usually occurs late in the game (think turn 100+ and up) and you will get stuck endlessly waiting for next turn to start. 

Pretty ironic considering the name of this game heh.

While a quick save and reload usually clears this up, it will keep happening again as the AI gets stuck in diplomacy and ground combat (between AIs). Also this workaround caused another issue for my game where the next turn's autosave will be stuck in a loop (diagnostic log shows this as error: [AI] Failed to save AI. AI is currently releasing and has remaining saves to do. [AI0]). Manual saving will be stuck too but you won't realize it until you try to save so disabling the autosave basically means GG.

To summarize:
Late game ending turn => chance of stuck waiting for next turn.
Save/load game to workaround it => chance of save function failing and getting stuck again.
Force close game and reload => redo your previous turn (hope it wasn't a busy turn)

Bonus: This ""bug"" happens to my current match every 1-5 turns (i played with 10 opponent AIs rip me)

Other nice tidbits to further drain your fun and enthusiasm to keep playing:
=> Game generates errors in the game's log over and over as your turn is ""stuck"" so if you are patient and tried to wait it out i hope you like 200+MB log files in your Endless Space 2 temporary files folders! (rip my SSD hard disk)
=> AI diplomacy is whacked: Enjoy getting spammed with alliance requests from multiple AIs EVERY turn. And oh the music that plays when that notification pops up out of the blue is LOUD and might give you a heart attack.
=> Many balance issues that i won't go into here.

Your planets build stuff, you send out explorer ships along lanes (why do stars have lanes between them?), you colonize new planets if they are compatible. There are some alternate play styles (hacking... hacking?) and there is government/laws to choose. Also essentially this is Civilization, in space.

Pros: nice graphics. 

Cons: where to start. AI players have annoying voices.  Late game, the game bogs down between turns, as in the UI gets choppy, and I have a new fairly top of the line PC. If you start in a bad system, might as well quit. Tech tree is big but also really annoyingly hard to navigate. The music kindof sucks. Fleet battles are boring to watch in 3d as you can't do anything, so might as well skip the animation, and the tactics don't really make a difference, only numerical advantages do. The auto ship designer sucks, you need to do it by hand for any meaningful results. 

Bottom line: at first it's appealing but in the details, it lacks polish and depth. I'm not even a Stellaris fan (though I enjoyed it), but it's a better space Civilization game.",1607053374,1607053374,False,0,0,0.449826985597610474,0,True,False,False

If you didn't answer both questions with a yes then this game may not appeal to you. However, this is a very fun campaign to play. I encourage you to give it a try if the genre interests you.
Multiplayer:
It has great multiplayer functionality. You can create private or public multiplayer games. You can form alliances that win as a team if you so choose.
Flavor:
Each of the factions is very different. This helps draw you into the world and provides great replay ability.
Space Battles:
Fair warning, you don't take direct command in the space battles. Your job in to build up your economy and science, then use those to design and field your fleets. You can maneuver you fleets, but once the battle starts, the game plays a cut scene. I do enjoy watching these cut scenes.

It has Strategy.. hah! It actually has a Strategy game, but that game is highly dependent on a select few technologies being acquired in a specific time frame, and you'll likely need to play a dozen or so games to find the right ones and when they need to be acquired.  Unlike the Best in class games like Civ or Moo, you can't just wing it, or get the technologies out of their right time.  

And while you can construct ships (more or less) the upgrade paths are strictly dependent. The ship construction interface is clunky, and its not clear what are upgrades or side-grades without doing a mouse over on each independent item.  And the dps counter lies.. I found by trial and error that a 50 dps ship could kill a 300 dps ship, with a worse to hit ratio; I know you'll say but but, every pirate Rookie is a master in disguise.  And so maybe they are.

The diplomacy is one dimensional, there is no real effect of influence, and no mechanism for affecting a bloodless coup.  You'd think when a countries borders completely envelop another nation's system that would have some effect.

If you're bored and want 10 or so hours of ""hey its not Civ or Moo"", before finding yourself in the same lock step canyon for the 4th or 5th time in a row, it can be interesting and different.  But better, no, its not even close.

This game has a lot of potential, minus a few minor issues.  That said it comes to a point where it becomes virtually unplayable due to an unaddressed bug which prevents you from ending the turn.  I do not play with any mods.   I have played about 9-10 games sofar, and this bug has occurred in all of my games bar none.  It sometimes gets to a point where every 2-3 turns cannot be ended.  The ""solution"" is to reload and end the turn but having to do so all the time just puts me off.

I certainly would not have thumbs down this game had it been new as it would mean you would expect them to fix this bug soon.  But this game has been out for years, and is thus supposed to be a refined product.  Further to this having done my research it seems that many others are facing this issue.  The fact that this game has been out for years and this issue is not fixed means a future fix is much less likely.

I have worked in the games industry as a programmer and can say that some bugs are harder to fix than others.  However I can state beyond a doubt to anyone reading this post that bugs that happen very often (thus that are easy to reproduce) are much easier to fix than those that do not.  And since they happen in all my games and that of many others that I have read online (for years apparently), this just displays poor support for a product that is supposed to be refined.

EDIT: I have found a workaround to this bug, hence the hours played since this review.  Re-closing all the dialogues on the right solves it.  

Unfortunately I still cannot recommend this game, at least for single play.  I am now playing on the next highest difficulty and the AI is about the worst I have seen in a strategy game.  Despite having overwhelmingly more resources than the player on higher difficulty settings, it wont do basic things like defending its systems (cities).  Unless the AI declare war on you early game (where they come in with pre-emptive stacks), they pose very little threat.  What this translates into is that mid to late game, you build an ""army"" fleet and simply walk into their systems (cities), take them over one by one often without the slightest resistence.  Other times they will fight back but with scattered fleets that are typically inferior to yours even though you have not updated yours in a while. Again this on super high difficulty settings.

The TLDR of this AI issue is that it makes the game virtually pointless and non challenging.  If you KNOW that you can simply take over the AI's systems at any time, particularly beyond early game, there is little point in even playing.  I have looked for AI mods but have fallen short, so I am playing what I believe will be my final games on this before wrapping it up for good.

The forums are full of people complaining about the AI with the typical response of ""just play online"" which is something that I don't want to do.  If you see yourself as willing to do so, by all means get this game.  But be prepared for some heavy RNG when it comes to starting locations - they can be pure bliss or just so disadvantageous that you will never have a fighting chance.  Thats my only other complaint about the game other than the AI and the obvious bug to which I had to personally find a workaround.  

TLDR; get this game only if you are willing to play online and are prepared for some heavy RNG when it comes to starting locations.  Remember to close the dialogues on the the right when the end turn freezes.",1604662065,1606561397,False,66,1,0.811651408672332764,9,True,False,False

I love this game.  

The music is amazing especially with the extra two music dlc. 
 
My favourite way of playing is to create a custom terran empire race. 
12 Ai, spiral galaxy,  and dominion only win condition.

I love massive space fights between armadas and just watching them like a movie.
Better than a movie in some respects because of the amount of time and resources invested in each ship.

I will make a video on Endless Space 2 with gameplay and final battles.

It has its flaws,  interface issues, z fighting after 600 turns.  It all tends to fall to pieces.   A bit like a soufle.

I hope they make an ES3 with updated graphics.  

Here are some suggestions.

Replays!
An observer mode for Esport tournaments.

Ability to watch other races fighting as an option.

An AI adviser to take over the whole thing and player steps in when they feel like it.
(Full automation mode) 

Ability to capture and then upgrade enemy ship designs.

Playable pirates faction and make pirates more under the radar and less annoying. 
So they dont just get hunted down and killed.  Think star wars.  Why would empires tolerate them.

Bug fixes:
Fix the fighting z buffer flicker thing after 600 turns.

Whereas, I love Endless Legend, it was a lot of fun to learn, and still a lot of fun to play.

I'm not huge into the idea of behemoths, in Endless Legend you eventually had gotten Guardians and finally... the gawdamn Urkans. At least with those, you know what you're up against... in Endless Space 2 (Space games overall) you don't see that difference of power clearly visually, rather you have to pull up a menu and compare basic numbers and values to get a sense of that. That's a personal complaint more than an actual critique... because with unit and hero customization in Endless Legend, that game still has this aspect as well.

I don't particularly like the hacking ability, it feels like a feature that has been tacked on and thrown on the side. The academy introduces more frustration than anything else, I do enjoy the coop competitive part of it, but it's intrusive in a really bad way for me.

I will not post the original review in its entirety but I will go over the original issues I had and whether or not they have been fixed, new issues etc.

In the initial release, it felt as if the AI specifically targeted you by settling new colonies near you (even to their detriment) and attempting to squeeze you in. This appears to have been fixed. Some races are naturally expansionists and some more about having only a few systems. Some races like to put colonies far away from each other, putting a lot of space between systems, some like to keep their colonies all huddled together. It feels more natural. While not perfect, in a long term game, it felt 'logical' that some races would be more territorial and expand faster while others would not. Some still expanded towards me but it never felt 'cheap' or as if they were only settling there to mess up my own expanse.

The governments and policies that I originally complained about I don't think have been changed, but they are subtly better. When the computer was aggressively expanding towards you, often you would spend your influence (purple) to try and stave them off or spend more resources towards ships and not the influence improvement. Without that hyper aggression, influence can be better spent towards policies. The starter policies are still weak and don't offer much but the party policies are much more useful typically. Also in my original assessment, I unfairly said that some races shouldn't have policies like Horatio. If anything the government system could use some sprucing up so to speak. It feels very 'fire and forget' with little impact on a turn-by-turn basis. A good system that I judged too harshly.

I complained that certain technologies felt weak or were noob traps. This is less so the case. The military tree feels much more fleshed out with more than just weapon dps upgrades. The Siege technology is a must for early game aggression and for any attempt to take established systems. The behemoth technologies are refreshing. They feel like rabbit holes you can sink a lot of resources into for unique ships that can do a multitude of things without feeling like you're falling behind; and everyone should consider them, even passive players. This encourages even passive players to design ships. I wish there were more ships like this: utilitarian instead of combat oriented so that passive science victory players still have to choose between system improvements and possible ships like how militaristic races do.

AI and diplomacy still feels heavy handed. Even in what I would consider a fair trade, the computer is not interested. Even giving gifts doesn't seem to persuade computers to be more lenient or friendly. This has led me to simply give up on diplomacy and start military production because I know what to expect. It's like that guy who never trades in Monopoly.. a whole element of the game isn't being used. I don't expect ridiculous trades but the AI should at least be offering me some.. even if they aren't fair perhaps I could haggle.

The game still encourages rapid expansion no matter the race. Where you expand is a different story but this early game stake-your-claim gameplay feels slow. You need hammers and population to produce colonizers. And you are always going to be behind unless you are following this strategy. Playing 'tall' is not really an option. The Unfallen have luckily been improved and their vines work faster so they atleast have a chance.

Lastly, many systems are just plain garbage. Everyone knows 4 or 5 planet systems are power houses. Surely there are ways smaller systems could be made valuable. Perhaps smaller systems get access to unique improvements or even ship production? As it stands right now, lava planets are extremely powerful and possibly need nerfs and small systems need something to make them more valuable past the early-midgame.

Otherwise the game feels much more streamlined. The combat is still 'meh' but the game play is more in designing ships and fleets that work better along with the tactics cards you play. I'm thankful that everyone can fly outside of the flight paths from the beginning even at a penalty.

The game is a recommend now. I'm happy I came back to it. I know some dislike the latest expansion but I don't 'hate' it. I dislike there being an additional AI essentially in every game. Worse yet, it expands and can really screw you over if you are nearby. And no, you can't fight back. I wish there was an option to reduce the aggressive expansion of that group but it more of an annoyance really.

i'll completely ignore the fact that the combat system is very basic. i personally don't mind this fact, but if you are searching for an indepth tactical/strategic experience... well... bad news. you technically have a tactics card + ship loadouts you can configure, but this is mostly for basic optimization/changing a few options rather than an intense, layered combat experience.

bugs - game gets stuck in a perma ""loading next turn"" aka pending bug. you need to save + reload to do this. i'm not so petty to let this bother me if it happens a few times per game, that's fine, but i have had a 70 turn game and counted literally 15+ times i had to save + reload. i just gave up on that save because it kept happening. protip + quick save with CTRL + F5 and then quick load. sadly, my specs aren't exactly great so waiting 20-30 seconds for a game to load on top of the usual turn computation time can really ruin the game. imagine if this happened with your friends in multiplayer where someone is probably already waiting longer than everyone else. remaking the lobby to reload can really kill the mood tbh. esp if you have zoomer friends.

bug2 - sometimes information just doesn't display. you will look at a building and THANKFULLY a big wordy paragraph of flavor text appears, BUT NOT WHAT THE BUILDING ACTUALLY DOES. if you are trying to learn the game and dont know what an anomaly/building/anything does, you might just need to re-open the entire game (save + load doesnt work) but if you're new, how would you know if you have this bug? yeah, pretty idiotic - worst part is the flavor text and image loads, just not if it gives +//- industry/science/whatever. it even shows up for anomalies for the planets, huge details to just have randomly missing man. if you aren't experienced enough to even know that something is missing, it's even worse! seems downright malicious to new players or if you're trying a different empire to have this randomly happen when you play the game.

but yea, it's fun to build things, i like the more basic combat system compared to Endless Legend, there's some good music. best song is called ""Cygnus"" if you want to look it up on youtube. i've had a lot of good time outside of these issues but if i ask myself ""would you have bought the game knowing these bugs are just going to exist?"" ehhhh probably not. i was on the fence about writing a review until i got 15+ TURN PENDING bugs in one game and had to quit. i think it's important to warn you. oh yea, the game looks really pretty if that matters to you.

The game overall is good, but as you may have read, or will read by scrolling through these reviews, it suffers gamebreaking bugs which the devs won't fix as it is litteraly part of the game.

By that I mean:
If you chose a faction to play and end up against ""LEAPER (AI)"" and fight your way until the finish line it may happen that you CANNOT invade nor destroy its home system. This ""bug"" happens because LEAPER is on a quest regarding its home world and you just cant do shit about it, you will not be able to finish him, and therefore won't be able to dominate the galaxy at 100%, this dissapointed me after a game against 12 AI, 1300 turns, three complete day of gameplay, just to be stopped by what they call content and what i call a bug.

There's glitches, such as unfinishable turns, you can counter that by saving and loading the game and end your turn again, until it happens again, it is rare enough though, i'll tolerate it.

There's a lot of more small bugs, sometime your alliance wont invade a system, and you cant do it for them because they are ""Guarding it"" therefore you must call a truce, pray they call their ship off, declare war again (wasting your influence by the same way"" and then at your turn, guard the same system and sap the ennemy defense by waiting numerous turns, wasting time.

[spoiler]To spend another couple of hundreds of hours barely noticing it.[/spoiler]

Gameplay-wise, it's pretty much the same as the other turn-based 4X space strategies: The playable races are predefined, as it is in most similar games. Space combat without direct control. But while this game brings absolutely nothing new to the genre, it's better than its today's (2020) competitors (not counting Stellaris) in terms of visuals and performance:

1. Ship models and space battles are truly eye-candies. Sure, it's not a novel feature (seen it Imperium Galactica II, 1999), but at the moment these are the most beautiful space battles I've seen in these games, and I probably saw them all.

2. Performance. This game runs fine on the end-game part of the biggest map with maximum empires. Sure, turn calculations became noticeably longer, but not long enough to be an issue. Some games fail this benchmark, like, unfortunately, the recent Master of Orion and earlier versions of Stellaris.

Compared to Stellaris, it's simpler: less micromanagement, and the biggest map is much smaller in terms of systems and empires. Also, as in most similar games, you're limited to the (well made) predefined empires, which is kinda shallow after creating the empire from the scratch in Stellaris, with a lot of meaningful customizations, and then continue your own idea in the game, with dozens(!) of other small and large empires. Also, ES2 is more of a fantasy vibe to it, while Stellaris is more about science and space exploration, especially with mods adding some exotic celestials such as microquasars, or the actual Milky Way galaxy. 

But I'll definitely recommend it.

But after all this time, perhaps the worst part of this game is that every time the devs deploy a new patch, my saves corrupt and I can't finish a game. This is especially annoying after spending hours on an epic scale game. It was particularly dissapointing after the refreshing responsibility they took after the last tragic misunderstanding when they rushed the last patch too fast. 

I especially liked this most recent iteration, with the pieces added to mitigate the empire creep crippling. But I didn't get it a win state because of the save corruption. Give the devs one or two more patches before really committing, it'll be near perfect hopefully by then. The most recent iteration in late game are hard to resolve, particularly when the species are starting to meet on tech parity.

I hate leaving a bad review when I can't suggest an alternative. I just expect more from the genre.

This game is almost entirely about developing technology to harvest resources to develop technology to harvest resources. There's a promise of space battles and conquest, but bankruptcy is more likely than battle readiness, and if you run out of the ""dust"" resource, they'll take ships away from you while in battle.  I've had this game for about 10 days with over 100 hours, and am just as oblivious to how to succeed as I was in the first game. You're almost always under some kind of threat, yet do not have the manufacturing or financial capabilities to build ships that can actually win battles until about 50 turns. The learning curve of this is horrible, as is the game play. There's a certain degree of strategy in choosing what research and resources to pursue, but even this small level of strategy is thwarted by unforseen events that mess up what you're working on. It's hard to explain without actually playing it, but civil unrest, or events in your kingdom can have handicaps or bonuses given to your resource collecting ability, so it's near impossible to mantain a plan for long. One turn you may be collecting certain resources by the thousands and within a couple turns you can be in negative numbers and having ships removed from your fleet. Even on beginner settings and with tutorials, it's near impossible to defend your worlds. The ""help"" function only helps with the interface, and is little help to having an enjoyable or successful game. If you're patient enough to actually play long enough to develop fleets for defense or conquest, you'll most likely run out of dust and lose ships mid-battle, not from the enemy, but from the repo-man. Colonizing worlds takes forever to get them up to be able to defend themselves or build ships, and in trying to do so, you'll likely be unable to provide manpower or resources to mantain a fleet or army. If you enjoy games that prevent any success on any level, this is the game for you. It takes forever for your empire to even scrape by, You don't really get to make decisions, they're largely made for you. I got this on a 75% off sale and feel ripped off... I can't fathom paying full price for this. It reminds me a lot of ""civilization"" It likely will take 20 turns to address a problem you're having now. You can't even have battles unless your diplomatic status allows for it, your citizens have to be supportive of war (even if you're under attack) and both you and your enemy are orbiting the same planet at the same time, yet it seems enemies can attack and worlds gone before you even know they're coming. Playing this game is a celebration of futility. It makes no sense whatsoever how this is as well received as it is... The game literally changes the rules as you play it by altering your resource gathering abilities, occasionally they'll change your form of government as well, so there's really no point to have a strategy. There's really no point to changing strategies as it'll take many many turns to have an effect. I'll stick to Age of Empires 2  thank you very much.",1603917873,1603917873,False,0,0,0.433070838451385498,0,True,False,False

It's also very accessible and comes with comprehensive tutorials. The faction variety is nice, and thanks to the custom faction option you can recreate your favorite sci-fi universes quite well with no mods needed. I wish there was a little more visual variety to choose from for roleplaying purposes, like a few visual variants on the spaceships for example. 

One thing I wanted to discuss in greater detail is the battles, which are a big part of the game and also one of its most appealing features. Each side in a battle chooses a strategy beforehand, without knowing the enemy's deployment. Then the battle is played out in real time in a very visually pleasing way. And if you've played your strategic cards right, designed your ships well and lead them with good heroes, it will be very rewarding to watch enemy fleets get taken apart by your elite forces. However, the system is strange in that you can end up with part of your forces facing nothing on the opposite side and mostly do nothing the whole battle. Obviously in a real battle, unengaged elements would do their best to get into the fight, which unfortunately doesn't happen here. Of course there are ways to work around this and concentrate your own deployment to minimize that risk.

The last thing that needs to get mentioned is a big health warning about all major DLC later than Vaulters. Supremacy and its introduction of Behemoths was a big disappointment, and I have not tried any later DLC after that and reading the critical reviews.

So, if you wanna be a beta tester of this amazing piece of art - join the team! 
And do not forget to register on G2G - developer`s web site - there will to be a lot of things to discuss. 
Actually, at this moment, ES2 is still more about discussing, than just playing.

I would recommend this game only to those players, who are ready to take in their hearts the memorable sensations of an advanced beta tester.
The sensations that never left me for more than 1000 hours of playing the Endless Space 2, also known as ""Endless Pending"" in the certain circles of the Endless worshipers.
I must to admit - Endless Space 2 have an amazing design, almost perfect GUI and immersive lore.
One of the most attractive feature is about ten well-drawn, original races with its own unique game mechanic.You will have to learn from scratch to play for each of them.

On the other side, ES2 has tangible lack of the ingame descriptions. Some of them are quite opaque, ambivalent or even wrong.
Thus to understand how it actually works You will have to spend a lot of time on forums, mostly on G2G.
And sometimes you will not be able to find an answer, because the game is still in development phase - calling this a Release is just a marketing move.

Well, in general, I like ES2 so much, that I am even willing to endure and forgive all those bugs and issues, which somehow manage to exist and survive through a bunch of patches.
After 2 years from the first release we still have a glitchy and unstable engine, unexplained issues with OS and other common programms on the wide-spread PC configurations.
Regarding game mechanics for example: we have quite a big advantages from the population bonuses in the game and a miserable illogical pop-managment system. Fortunately, this may be solved with the help of mods (e.g. ""populace control"").
So be advised - logic is not a favorite item among the designers of this game. And in the code they do not like to dig, but artists and writers they are excellent for shure!

And there are still mods without which I just don’t play this game.
And I am ok with it.

Edit (2020): 3yrs from release and 3000+ hrs of gameplay on recommended PC configuration. Infamous Final Patch has fixed some bugs and ADDED SOME NEW ONES even worse. Persistent memory leaks (up to 12GB) are still present - no longer sessions with less memory. Crashes - once in a while. Same misleading errors in the tooltips. I am just tired from all of this - I have changed my review from positive to negative.

1) Bugs (self explanatory for example trade routes showing they are blockaded when they aren't) 
2) Missing features,
- Proper population control like killing off population or selling them or something
- Scrap button replaced after researching the marketplace tech 
- Along with others I either cant think of or haven't experienced yet
3) Lots of lag and lag spikes (might just be me but I have a pretty good pc)
4) Annoying features like 
- Hacking
- Academy
- Laws cost a TON
5) Unexplained mechanics/ok tutorial. The tutorial taught me quite a bit but certain things confused me when I actually got into the game. For example I had no idea that invasions and fleets orbiting a system were separate. One of my systems was invaded and the invasion went on for multiple turns with absolutely no explanation as to why.
6) Vague explanations of quests (can usually figure them out but they should still be explained further)

On the positive side the game has amazing artwork along with great music. The game also has really useful options like being able to lock your cursor to the game.

Darth Paul is some weird crap that replaces your list of built improvements with a thumbnail of a Horatio named Darth Paul.  Doesn't affect gameplay too much but keep on eye on your expenses because if you end up building too much too fast and going into the red on dust, you won't be able to fix the problem by selling off improvements.

It's very fast-paced, and plays as something like a deathmatch with some light micromanagement. You ""can"" change a lot of different aspects of your empire... but doing so is pointless under most circumstances. The quest system is intended to add focus, but the rate at which the game springs these quests on you makes it feel like a mad dash to complete tasks that are, once again, pointless under most circumstances. The AI isn't ""overly aggressive"" per se but it's overly pushy. It forces diplomatic interactions too frequently. Like the game designers need you to know and care the moment one of your opponents changes their disposition to you ever so slighty, just in case you weren't paying attention to that.

The galaxy map is divided into unconnected constellations, but the technology to cross between them occurs so early in the tree that it seems pointless for that transition to exist at all. I understand that the designers wanted to create a situation where each constellation was relatively easy to defend from the inside and relatively difficult to attack from the outside, but in practice it hardly matters.

Everything I'm saying about the game is from the perspective of the ""old version"", because of the game-breaking problems that exist in the current version.

Well, Amplitude hired this studio to ""fix"" the game in a series of ""fixing ES2"" patches. Instead it just so thoroughly gimped it that the game is utterly falling apart now.

Edit After 40hrs playtime: It may actually be a great game but it can be a bit buggy on the latest patch, I'd suggest going back to a slightly earlier version under the steam options. Currently running 1.5.31 S5 Gold, which I've had no bugs in and it loaded my saved game fine.
------------------------------

It's a good game, not a great game but a very solid one, especially if you pick it up on sale for a big discount.

Picked up the starter pack & Vaulters DLC for 75% off and feel I've already had my money's worth after 10hrs and I'm guessing I'll get at least 60-120hrs out of it, not even playing multi-player.

It's a beautiful game even on my old hardware (GTX870) which runs flawlessly on Beautiful (yes that is an in-game graphics setting) and the music is great. The overworld/strategy side of things is great along with the tech tree and ship load-outs etc. I have found myself just waiting on resources at several points so far through several turns with not a lot else to do, but that may be me or the random map generation. The battles are meh, just so you are aware it's not an RTS game like one of the Total War games so you're basically sitting through a somewhat boring movie. It's nice to watch the first couple of times but that's about it. 

The tutorial is random at best after picking whatever the middle option was for the tutorial settings and really does fail in many areas, but if you watch a few YouTube videos and fumble around in the dark you'll get the hang of it (saying that, I'm pretty sure that's how I ended up with two kids, so it may not be sound advice).

A solid 7/10 so far and a definite buy if you're looking for a relaxing, beautiful, strategy space game with great music and you can pick it up on a discount. Oh and it has fish mommy.. what more could you want.",1602871474,1603374629,True,2,0,0.542902946472167969,0,True,False,False

Not to be too comprehensive but some common Bugs:
The Pending bug is very real even with the most recent patch. (You click end turn and the game gets stuck pending the turn phases- essentially you can't end your turn or do anything)
System upgrade tool-tips will not show their effects. This happens every game.
The game can crash on save.

And then there are design choices.

Pirates have no spawning algorithm. The first time pirates spawned on a system I was waiting to settle on I thought I wasn't paying attention. A couple games later I was guarding an empty system with probes out, was perfectly safe, and when turn 10 hit, the system I was guarding- in wait for a settler ship- is suddenly pirate controlled and has full manpower (meaning many, many turns until it's even contestable)

The combat in this game is unintuitive and absurdly complex. I read through ten pages of forum banter regarding how mechanics work, if lasers are better than beams. If beams/lasers are better than missiles / kinetic. If hull is better than shields, etc. After reading paragraphs of people parsing data / doing simulations I came to the conclusion that I don't want to get excel out every time I think about taking on a fight. I know the 4x genre and especially the sci-fi genre can be very detail oriented, but this game takes it to a level that just isn't fun for me.

The research system is *fine* but its feels weird how certain upgrades are bundled together. For example, planetary upgrades are grouped up with non-related sciences instead of being bundled with each other. You could definitely argue this adds a ""value-meta-game"" where things are more complex because they aren't as straightforward, but it really just made picking out researches really awkward a lot of the time.


With that said, there are a lot of fun systems in the game. I personally love the hacking DLC and I think the political system is very compelling. Every action you take influences the political compass of your empire and that compass can very depending on the races within your population.

But, with all that said, I don't think this game is worth 40 bucks, and even on a sale price of 10 dollars I'd be hesitant.",1603371566,1603371899,False,4,0,0.505940794944763184,0,True,False,False

Although I'll list some complaints, I think the number of hours I've played without even starting to get bored yet speaks volumes.

The Good:
- The game is gorgeous.  Especially the space battles, but also the planets and even the UI
- Variety in play styles for each faction makes for varied experience
- I find the level of management perfect.  I feel I have control over everything I want without having to micromanage
- Allies stay allied unless you do something serious to offend them
- There's so much to do that I rarely feel it's just a slog to the end
- The lore is interesting without going overboard (for the most part)
- Love the music (which can vary with faction)
- The expansions make significant changes to the game (which can be good and bad)
- Politics and laws are interesting and have some significant effects

The Bad:
- Some concepts are not well explained, even with the tutorial on. Some game concepts need to be learned through trial and error.  Not just the winning strategy, but the actual mechanics & effects.  Espionage is a good example of this.  I'm still not sure I completely understand the system
- While faction variety can be good, it also can be a negative in that with certain factions you are clearly pointed towards a particular type of victory.  Having said this, there's still wiggle room and you can usually choose other victory conditions to go for if you are willing to accept the extra challenge
- Can't turn off individual topics in the tutorial, so it's all or nothing
- Some minor bugs persist even after diligent patching. E.g. when saving a game, you can't click the Save button after naming the save until you click outside the text box and then back in the text box
- The expansions make significant changes to the game (which can be good and bad)
- I'm slightly disappointed at the dumbing down of combat compared to ES1.  There is no interactive element to combat at all (but they are still beautiful mini-movies to watch - I turn off the UI to hide the health displays and increase the suspense)

The Ugly:
- The weird semi-simultaneous turn system that all Endless games use. The AI sort of moves at the same time as the player -- which in reality means when you start your turn there's a slight delay and then they move with lightning speed.  If you are trying to race an enemy to a location, this means at the start of a turn you find yourself frantically cancelling notifications in an attempt to reach the Execute Moves button.  It's an inexplicable and unnecessary mechanic that I find very frustrating. 
- Possibly related to this, when you reload a save the AI can take sudden actions. E.g. you're done playing for the night. All your moves and builds are complete.  There's nothing going on, and you save the game.  Next day when you reload, even though you are still at the same point when you left and haven't hit the End Turn button, suddenly before you can take any action the AI is contacting you with demands or even declarations of war.
- Aside from factions remaining consistent on the war-peace-allied front, trading via diplomacy is never fair.  The AI never, ever accepts a trade of equal value, even when you are allied.

Despite these annoyances, I keep playing.  The expansions are definitely worth it as well, with most adding more than just eye candy.",1603364471,1603364471,True,20,0,0.705274045467376709,0,True,False,False

ES2 on the other hand steam line everything and its has closure. The UI and the visual is one of the best looking and very intuitive.

Most can feel mechanical and less about a story or immersion.  Not very exciting.
With Endless Space 2 it feels more like a story, or space opera where your decisions don't only need to be the best bonus.  With separate racial story lines and the ability to choose different paths for your empire it has more depth than ""crush everything"".  you can choose variable ideological paths to win (diplomacy, alliances, assimilation).  Also the art is well done and the music is amazing which helps with immersion.

my only gripes are: 
Combat is the fastest route to winning no matter the race.
Diplomacy is underused and not clear how to use effectively.  The pressure system does nothing.  i want a diplomatic way to win where you get all races on board (c'mon, you used the name Sheredyn, just admit you love B5.  Dont take his name in vain).
Not really an official guide anywhere, just tons of steam discussions and reddits.
more ending sequences per race per victory condition would be even better to explain the reasoning an empire would go for that path.

The game does have a learning curve.  This isnt the game you pick up with your friends and learn in a night.  Its more like that friend that brings over the suitcase of warhammer stuff while the rest of you want to play catan.

Be patient, wait.  The last thing you want to do is find out you can't load your game after a patch or have your game bog down or bug out 100 turns in.  All of these are being reported on the forums.  They held their last patch until release instead of letting the beta testers vet it first, and so of course it was a mess when they sprang it on the public, forcing us to test their code on OUR dime.  It's an appalling lack of respect for gamers.

Update 2020: They just issued their ""final patch,"" and included the following text in their post:

""The purpose of these patches was to resolve several bugs and issues reported by the community, and while we are confident that many of the worst problems have now been tackled, we also acknowledge that we were not able to address everything brought up by the community.""

Great civilizations. Awesome galaxies. Hardly any mechanical/technical problems with the game.(I have only crashed only a handful of times, and it was because I overtaxed the game). Setting up a game is very easy, and each game option might and definitely can dramatically change the game experience. The game always has something for you to do based on what route you take (as opposed to Civilization V, where there are no novel circumstances. It is just the same old same old). The civilizations are deeply unique from each other, and the government menu is extremely detailed (for example: choosing the type of government, population control, ideologies, governors, political parties, political leaders, political corruption, etc.) The technology screen is very clean and well thought out. One example (without being exhaustive with everything) all technologies have a political swing (if you research all the weapon technologies, your military ideology will increase). Combat in this game is interesting to say the least. Each ship class can be modified extensively with models that you gain from technological research and resources gathered from systems. When a space fight is engaged, you have a choice whether to retreat or plan your strategy (retreating loses half of your health for the fleet, and retreating below full health equals death). There are many different strategies you can choose when entering a battle, but it is best to capitalize off what your ships are primed for. An example would be if your ships are more optimized for long range combat, then choose the strategy that puts the majority of the fleets in the back line. You may still lose, but the point is using your ships in the most effect way possible. On the other hand, land combat is kind of lack luster. If you were to compare the amount of effort the development team put in to the space fights compared to the land fights, it would become painfully apparent about what I mean when I say ""lack luster"". It is just kind of bland, with minimal graphics, and almost entirely no control. Now do not get me wrong, in the same way you can plan your strategy before a space battle, you can do the same for land. The choice of strategy is greatly drowned out when you realize the choice ""Draft"" and ""Blitzgrieg"" will basically secure your either defense or conquering of the system. Overall, I would give this game a 9/10, with the missing 1/10 for the land battles. If you are a fan of Star Wars: Empire at War and Civilization, this game is absolutely perfect for you.

I love strategy I love upgrades I love modules and customizing ships but I dont know....I dont like the lack of control in battles.

As far as I can tell, the game itself is pretty much just 80% Endless Legend + 20% Stellaris, with a lot of the weaker stuff from both cleaned up. Like Amplitude has clearly given up on trying to make good combat after how poorly it was done for EL, so ES2 is just autoresolve, but you can choose your battle strategy. I think that's a pretty good example of how the devs are fully aware of their strengths and weaknesses, and Endless Space 2 shows off a ton of Amplitude's strengths, while avoiding a lot of their weaknesses.",1602773630,1602773630,True,1,0,0.507462680339813232,0,True,False,False

The short: A solid entrant. Discovering the game play and a good way to start is half the fun. Trying the in game factions is the other. Each faction feels unique with specific lore and a ""quest"" storyline that follows you through the game progression. Graphics are mediocre at best and the battles which should at least be pretty to watch are fairly ugly affairs riddled with bad camera angles. Controls become familiar quickly and are solid. Be aware that quite a bit of content is behind expansion paywalls, and of questionable quality. Ultimately, friendly to new players to the genre, deep enough for an experienced player to derive some value. 6/10 

The long: 
Feel mixed. It was a reasonable way to waste my game time but it is a game with some obvious flaws among otherwise solid play. Controls, sounds, art and lore are all strong points, with the game having lore to learn, actually quite pleasant music (make sure to buy the music expansion if your going to sink time into it), and each faction has their own ""theme"". In game quests have their own description and accompanying picture. 

Playing the multiplayer with friends tends to be a brutal affair, since games can take days to play out in full, so everyone goes for the quick punch as it were... then leaves if it doesnt work. Waiting on slow players really is a slog and there is no online community you can reliably play with if you dont have friends available.  Desync was a constant problem for me. Ultimately these flaws make playing multiplayer with anything but your most interested friends impossible. Therefore i will focus on AI games.      

Multiplayer aside, graphics and gameplay are where the game kind of fails to hit the mark. You spend most of your time browsing and looking at worlds or watching battles. Worlds and space is acceptable, with worlds changing appearance to reflect their nature and terraforming, but finer details are missing - if your civilization is crammed into every nook and cranny on a world you wont see it, or satellites above, or space traffic. They are just colourful marbles. 
Every faction leader always looks the same and cant be customized. Colours come in primary or if you spend dosh, you can pick up a couple custom skins to be ugly in your own way. 
Finally worst of all, especially because of the nature of combat in the game, battles are ugly affairs. Ground battles are just ugly blobs on a grid like some kind of 3d chess. They caused the game to crash occasionally. Space battles are better, but still ugly as sin. Ships are blocky and dated, weapons fire is just for show without physics rendering or detail. The camera ""automatically"" follows the action, which just means it jumps around randomly at ugly angles without any rhyme or reason. Free camera allows you to poorly angle around and still not see anything. ""Tactical camera"" just gives you the same top down 3d chess view as ground battles and is just as ugly.  Your already not participating in battle, it should be enjoyable to watch. There is a ""skip"" watching slider you will be using frequently,  but skipping a battle can give you different results (thankfully usually in your favour), which just raises questions about how it actually comes to the results. All in all, even taking into consideration the age of the game, the graphics could have used alot more polish. 

   This segways into the other big gripe, the gameplay and pacing. Early on when your managing a couple planets and a small fleet, maybe a hero or two, everything is smooth and quick. The game start exploration and expansion is a ball, as your tearing it around trying to find the best worlds and hidden gems, then rushing to beat others to the punch on quests and conquering. Luck usually has a decent part in how things go, with slower starting factions really hoping to be across the map from Cravers and to land on some Red Sang. You wont be winning every time, especially at the highest difficulty.  AI opponents are reliable in their behaviour at this point, acting like they should for how aggressive they are portrayed, etc. 

 As the game progresses, issues start to appear. You get bogged down with build orders. The AI managers have incompetent build priorities and cannot be relied on. Research starts to be irrelevant -  everyone tends to have a tech level mirroring how expansive their empire is, and research priorities are made based on what resources you were able to grab. The tech trees are more or less all the same for each faction, with a few faction specific specialties thrown in you WILL be researching. Your mid game choices hardly matter, as one can complete old research choices in a fraction of the time and simply start down another research path. By late game, turns take up to 2-3 minutes to end, as the system processes the actions of every other faction, with larger games taking up to 5 or 6 minutes. My PC is top of the line for 2019 and this delay still happens. It frequently crashes or freezes, forcing you to reload. Heroes, initially cool and ""unique"", just become irritating. Having your hero level up once every 10 turns, or because you won a huge space battle is okay. Having 14 Heroes all leveling up tasked with managing colonies is a huge waste of time.    

AI factions are unfortunately, illogical and stupid -  Ive had AI offer me an alliance for tons of my tech and resources, then turn around and give me resources to ally, then declare war on a few turns later unprovoked. ""Aggressive"" AI will always declare war on you regardless of how powerful you are relative to them. Ive had Cravers at war with every other faction getting their teeth kicked in turn down an alliance with me I offered with resources. Ive had factions on good terms who ive fought on behalf of and fostered a good diplomatic alliance turn on me because they were worried I might declare war on them. Basically if your weak, expect to be going to war. If your strong, everyone will ignore you or send you incessant alliance requests turn after turn, begging for your help then betraying you if you are no longer needed. Best pray you dont need to be diplomatic at all. 

Finally, the game has several ""paywall"" expansions. For the price, the content is fairly meagre, usually a faction and some new mechanic. The expansions are poorly balanced and feel distinctly like they have been bolted on with minimal effort. Usually the new features (like behemoths, or portable homeworlds) is powerful or the other extreme  and completely irrelevant. The aforementioned behemoths dont even fit into a battlefield properly, with their weapons visually clipping from random points inside the ship and the battle cam unable to figure out where the exterior of the behemoth begins or ends.   

 All in all, you can get lost sinking time into this, but its flaws are many, and dont expect them to be fixed.",1602745741,1602745741,True,10,0,0.599497675895690918,0,True,False,False

The total gamme effects are too simple, limited and boring to be as complicated as it is (especially the UI!!!).

To be fair, I have yet to figure out how to actually conduct diplomacy in the game. Even when you have the game set the terms for any given proposal (ostensibly setting the terms up for acceptance) the AI rejects the proposal.

Every. Single. Time.

I have yet to be able to get a diplomatic trade to go through using the suggest terms options in 160ish hours. Also the whole blackmail thing is just stupid. The AI figures out a way to force you to do something (like remove all your ships from their territories, magically) and you, for some reason, have NO OPTIONS in how to respond.

I've previously played Endless Legend which I didn't enjoy because of the slow pace. Endless Space 2 plays a lot faster and you never really have to waste your time waiting for animations to finish.

ES2 mainly derives its charm from how different the races play. Not only do all of them have interesting and most of them unique mechanics, they also have individual questlines with special rewards. Quests offer a sense of direction throughout the game, but ES2 suffers from the same syndrome every other 4X suffers from - the endgame is a chore, once the lines are drawn in the sand it's just busywork to get to the victory screen.
However, ES2 is relatively light on micromanagement and warfare is less annoying than in most other 4X.

Overall verdict: ES2 is what Stellaris could have been if it was actually fun to play. Big recommendation.",1602244986,1602244986,True,28,0,0.691352248191833496,0,True,False,False

1. The game would freeze constantly from the interface. Adding forcegl stopped that, but why isn't that the default option? I only found it after hunting through the forms.
2. The game breaks 100% of the time for me on the victory screen. The only reason I know this is the case is because I got steam achievements.

Finally there are many, many annoying interface issues that have no reason to persist over multiple ""endless"" titles. Examples
1. You can only sticky on quest at a time, even though you may have 5+ in progress.
2. No option to see your FIDS from the main control screen.
3. When transferring colonists to another colony you can't see the cap population for the target colony :\
4. Many, many places in the UI could provide contextual information that are just missing it. For example, when you hover over a technology you can see what planets it allows you to colonize. This would be a great place to display ""systems you control, have X planets of this type. And systems you don't control, but have explored have Y planets of this type.""
5. No way to automate exploration + probing curosities.

AI is terrible. Just terrible.

Heroes continue down the awful path of being either governers or captains. It makes no sense to split the difference between the two. What should be happening is that you have a skill tree where any pick gives you an advantage as a governer and as a captain.

Two of the DLCs are just awful. Hacking is the worst mechanic I've ever seen in an endless space game, and the academy crap from the last DLC is actually worse.

Many, many missed opportunities to do something really interesting. For example when invading during land combat you get three options the entire game. When defending you basically get two. It's incredibly boring. ?Internal politics within a faction have the same problem. When an election comes up you basically only have one option the entire game, until much later when some techs unlock two more options. Really there should be a dozen+ options so that the way you can navigate internal politics is more interesting.

Politics with the AI on anything but normal is just garbage. You basically cannot make peace with anyone unless you have a massive imbalance of power because the AI is way over-confident from its FIDS boosts. The AI also retreats way too often, even to the point of nearly destroying its ships.",1601228616,1601228616,False,2,0,0.542902946472167969,0,True,False,False

Forget Awakening, the base game is in the worst state it has ever been. While the most easily reproduced bug is ""Darth Paul"" which prevents the editing of system improvements past Level 2, the game-breaking bug is the infinite pending. With Darth Paul, you can at least finish a game, albeit somewhat gimped. Infinite pending currently has ZERO work-around. Saving and reloading used to work but no longer. You can even go back several turns prior via the autosave function just to have the same pending bug on the same turn. This makes games impossible to complete and makes the time spent leading up feel completely wasted.

My theory is the A-team is off working on HUMANKIND leaving the... not-so-talented back to screw up a good thing. That ""final patch"" was not needed and has done more harm than good. They would've been better served fixing that god awful DLC that they outsourced. 

Don't buy this. Even on sale. It's broken. When they fix it, this review will disappear. If they don't, I wouldn't recommend buying HUMANKIND either. I was as pumped for that as I was for ES2. But after this fiasco, my faith in AMPLITUDE has all but dwindled.

The people who like this game MUST have something wrong with their brains. Wires crossed where they shouldn't be or something, because I can't make heads or tails of how this game is supposed to be enjoyable, comprehensible, intuitive, or any of the things that a game should be.

1. Literally all of the mechanics are completely unintuitive as if by purposeful design. Its as if the developers went to great and extensive pains to make a game that only the most [censored expletive] and mentally backwards individuals could comprehend
2. Even the tutorial utterly fails to educate you properly on how all of the game's systems work. You are essentially tossed a life ring that has a hole in it and expected to somehow not drown
3. The diplomatic system is completely nebulous, ill-explained, and seems to be impossible to navigate with any degree of accuracy. I am never educated (even by the tutorial) on how to not only engage in diplomacy, but on how to know what things impact relations in what way and why that is so. I am left stumbling in the dark with no light, essentially swinging my arms wildly in the faint hope of hitting something that won't immediately retaliate
4. The economic system seems to have been designed by a low-functioning [censored expletive] who has no idea how economics (macro or micro) work. SC2 has an intuitive economic system, Stellaris has an intuitive economic system, yet ES2 doesn't. After my first 8 hours in Stellaris, I knew the basics of how the economy worked and could tell you why I had a surplus in this or that, this despite not knowing the finer points of management. After 8 hours in ES2 I am just as clueless as to how this nightmarishly dysfunctional/nonsensical economic system works as I was the moment I hit ""Start New Game"". When I'm in a depression, I have zero idea why, and when profits are soaring, I still have no idea why.
5. ""Influence"" doesn't work in an intuitive or sensible way. Influence should be something that accumulates slowly and is spent in small amounts and rarely, just like IRL. Instead its just another resource that you can bankrupt yourself of in a few months extremely easily and is spent like money: in large amounts and often.
6. The political system is atrociously boring. Factions sway in power far too quickly. Actual political shifts tend to occur slowly over years if not decades, in ES2 they happen overnight. What little of the system seems to have a meaningful effect on the game is a chore just to comprehend let alone manage, and as for faction management, its nonexistent. You can't crack down politically on an undesirable faction, censor them, suppress them etc. They are just allowed to do essentially whatever they please and there isn't fuck all you are allowed to do to fight back politically.
7. Pacts are completely unexplained. Neither commercial nor research pacts tell you ANYWHERE exactly what they do and how they benefit (or don't) you. As far as I am aware I might well be throwing influence away to help someone else at great cost to myself.
8. The turn system is unspeakably unwieldy. Turns? Seriously? Ever heard of time lapse?
9. Pirates are mini-empires in their own right. If you haven't been militarizing since game start and completely neglecting your economy the pirates will screw you over, hard. Every other game like this I've played pirates are what they should be: an annoyance, a speed bump. In this game they are the developer's personal goons who are here to make your experience as tormentous and unfun as possible.
10. The AI has no difficulty settings, and thus will easily outpace and overwhelm a new player, lessening enjoyment
11. There are no borders, no cohesive territory that you can easily identify as ""yours"" on the Galaxy map. Similarily, you can't tell which empire is which on the galaxy map because they all look the same from that view.
12. The Academy is not only pointless, but violates the lore of the game. So I can get all of these alien heroes coming to my empire, but somehow this doesn't result in me making contact with the empire they came from? I'm sorry what?
13. Everything takes too long. Everything. Moving ships, building things, colonizing, it all takes too long. Too slow=too boring
14. No replayability. Once you've played all of the factions that it. No need to play anymore. You know all of the lore, have seen everything, and have no reason to pick the game up again, since 80% of the game is just the fixed lore of this specific galaxy and no more.

Having said all of that, which is all completely true, there are three things this game is pretty good at: visuals, lore, and the soundtrack. I love the lore, and many of the factions are interesting, but there are other space 4x games that give a much, much wider variety of factions and even allow you to create custom factions/species, whereas ES2 just gives you a few and expects you to be happy with that. The soundtrack is pretty baller though. Love it, made the game actively less frustrating a few times.

Thinking of buying this game? Don't. Save yourself the money and emotional/mental labor: buy Stellaris and download the ""ES2 Soundtrack"" mod. I promise you'll get infinitely more enjoyment AND replayability than you will with this [censored expletive]-tier trash.",1600057937,1600057937,False,0,2,0.436507940292358398,2,True,False,False

I still play Moo2 occasionally (thank you Dosbox) and when I first dropped into ES2 in my search for a rebirth I was immediately blown away simply by how beautiful it is.  Looks like one of those racing cars or fighter jets that is just the definition of ""sleek"".

Gameplay is generally per other turn based 4X, but it's just done so WELL.
UI is intuitive enough and the whole game can be played with just a mouse, which for me just added to the ease of immersion as I'm locked on the screen the whole time instead of hunting around the keyboard.
Soundtrack has a grand opera feel to it and works well with the visuals and gameplay.

Different races play completely differently and have some of their own specific technology advances to go with those that are common for all races.
Can also create your own custom race if that's your thing.

Diplomacy does play a functional role - whether you're getting peaceful races taking over your planets with culture (#civilisation) or 3 races allying to send your blitzkrieg plans all to hell.  Then there's the usual fun of forming a counter alliance, resuming the blitzkrieg and then of course turning on your ally at the end.

Only have two things that detract slightly from the experience.
(minor) As you get deeper into the game end of turn processing takes longer and longer, but this also plays out with start of turn activities taking longer and longer to kick in.  Post turn 150 or so you can be merrily clicking away organising the galaxy and a combat screen will launch, or a diplomacy, or several of them at once.  And because most of the popups are the same size with the same buttons on them it's not uncommon to think you're about to ok a ground attack but instead you ok the unwanted alliance request that pops up just as you go click.  I get around this by just saving most turns during the hectic times.
(frustrating) Ship combat is very cool and straight forward, but there are times where your battleships equipped with lasers and armour will get pwnd by smaller ships with ballistics and armour (as an example).  Because you can see the configuration of both fleets you have a pretty good idea what outcome to expect, and some of the unexpected outcomes can be very frustrating (as in ""how tf did that wipe my entire fleet??!!).  Workaround is to have cash available so you can insta buy a mix of ship configs in a fleet, or just have a blitzkrieg load of ships to keep throwing in.

Overall this is just a gorgeous and immersive 4x experience.  Find a race that suits your style, then try mastering a race that has you scratching your head.

Pros:
-A strong just-one-more-turn feeling that inevitably leads to hours of gameplay at a time.
-Much more streamlined than Civ. Instead of moving dozens of military units individually, I can simply send my fleet against the enemy fleet.
-The nonlinear technology tree provides truly interesting decisions about what to research next, with many game-changing options available at once.
-Each civilization has a unique feel, with mechanics tied to the story for that civilization.

Cons:
-Many of the quests and explorations are repeated in each game, so it's rare to encounter anything actually new. Often I find myself simply ignoring quests because they're not that powerful anyway.
-As in Civ, the endgame is less exciting than the early game because once I've built everything there is to build and victory is inevitable, I still have to spend many turns waiting for production.
-Ship upgrades are not especially deep. The main decision is whether to use energy or projectile weapons and defenses, and there's usually a clear best choice to counter the enemy.",1599777954,1599777954,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I got Endless Space one, and after that, i had no intention of ever trying this one, because it was a shallow, boring take on a genre that had the same idea done a dozen times better decades ago. But i saw the Sseth review, and was thinking to myself, hey, this looks much better.

Hoo boy was i wrong. Should have tried the base game without buying the dlc for starters.

I love space 4x, i have been looking for other games like these since Master of Orion and Galciv. Stellaris came close to offering what i wanted, with actual interesting choices for your civilization, but that game becomes a drag mid-game. But this one, this made me question if i had perhaps lost the ability to have fun with this genre at all. 

1) This is the same empire building/resource management as any other 4x. There is nothing wrong with that, But all the little bells and whistles tried to make it look like its something more, that it has actual politics, more interesting exploration mechanics, something. But no, once you get trough the fluff, all you can get are more numbers, resources+people+improvements+tech=more of the same, or more ships. Internal politics is not politics at all, it is just some minor bonuses to the resources, so are your laws.
2) The above would be fine, if the empire building and resource management was made exciting, or at least streamlined. It is not, its a drag and boring as heck. The many bells and whistles added? They don`t add, the take from the fun, because you start finding them annoying after stopping your game for the fourth or fifth time with a message or decision about some bonus you don`t give a damn about, because it is miniscule compared to your overall production, and it has no real other tangible effect on the gameplay.
3) Tactical combat is nonexistent, which could be fine, if the nice graphics did not make it look like you actually have a say in how a battle goes, or the rest of the game was fun enough to make up for it. It is nice to watch, a few times, then you will stop bothering.
4) The extra features like heroes and hacking are meh, their implementation turns something that should be an interesting feature, and a new take on 4x spying into a chore and another annoyance.

In summary, the empire management is the same old we have seen a thousand times, and they somehow managed to suck all the joy out of it too. The war aspect is meh, diplomacy is the bare minimum, internal politics is nonexistent, the extra choices you are presented with are  near meaningless, the game mechanics do not reflect what the fluff promises, and what new innovation is there for the genre, makes the game worst, not better.
I suppose it is shiny. But i cannot even say that the polish is all good, because the nice visuals are paired with music that is almost as annoying as the constant popups of quests and notifications. Seriously, the best thing about this game is the off switch for many a ""feature"".

This game occupies a spot somewhere between the simple but fun ""get out there and gun them down"" 4x of the original Master of Orion, and the more empire building/management type of 4x like Galciv/Stellaris, where it lacks the fun of the former, and lacks the substance of the latter.",1599543342,1599585670,False,2,0,0.518080651760101318,0,True,False,False

Following Penumbra DLC was a low quality cash grab and the latest Awakening DLC is just a piece of hot BS, which broke the game so hard, I have to turn the DLC off to actually play the game. Today I opened steam and read the news from the devs, that the game is finally fixed, and the patches are basically over. This is laughable at this point, major flaws are still unfixed since beta, and the whole Awakening is basically untouched and still unplayable. It could be tolerated in the days of active development, but now the development is officially over, and those issues are left for modders to fix. I expected that, but it is still painful to watch, how they killed and burried such a great game. Even Civ 6 is still getting new patches and new content, and it is 1 year older. ES2 had such potential, and the devs obviously stopped caring about it only a year after full release. It is still great, but it could be so much better.

Stupid stupid stupid damn pirates and their unkillable out posts - so big trouble in early game, when it's not a big problem to kill their ships, but all they can do is block outpost (which will keep upgrading and spawning new ships), full scale invasion operation, which takes special techs, ships and time is necessary to fully get rid of it, that's so annoying.

Ships are slow and never get that much faster, having proper heroes is necessary to actually move fleets around at reasonable speed. Lack of speed improvement feels quite boring.

AI cheats like hell (like having three times the population in the early game, when it's no way possible), but is still bad for some reason in late game (has twice the score, but cannot produce literally no meaningful fleet during very long war).

Overall, for me the first game is way better, this one has tons of things going, but is slow and very frustrating at some points.

I came into the Endless 'Verse (yes they are all related, even the ""fantasy"" one ;) coming from Dungeon of the Endless, which I've enjoyed and put a good amount of time in, but it wasn't too amazing. Still, it piqued me enough to check this one out when it was on sale.
I enjoyed civ, mainly 5 w/ Vox Populi mod, and this blows it out of the park.
It's got tons of mechanics which may be a bit daunting at first, but I grasped them fairly quickly coming from related games. 

Every faction feels quite different, and the interactions with minor civs and being able to assimilate them by diplomacy or force adds flavors you never see in Civ. Plus, you can form an actual ALLIANCE, and thus actually win as a team; or use your team as a springboard and leave them once you've sucked enough out of them, I've done that at least once when a game was going on too long :3. The fact every species has it's own little benefits, unlocking more as you collect more in your empire really creates a cool feel. There's even a custom faction system, a bit much for my taste but you can splice the various traits together using a point based system.

A note on dlc: I have all except the latest dlc (the Nephalim one), i.e. the ones you get from the delux edition + the free stuff for connecitng your G2G account (it's not really a hassle, and it's very worth it).

A lot people complain about Penumbra and the Umbral Choir, I think they and the hacking mechanic are pretty neat, they're just very opaque; I had to read a little external guides to really understand the hacking, and even then learn value of each hack by playing
 (protip: don't both with sleepers or even most the programs if you're not the Umbrals, just use it to steal from pirates/diplomacy with minors/scramble comms for invasion/just about any of the hacks on a home system). I overall think it is is a positive and makes the game better, but it is the first ""mixed review"" of the dlc.

The initial learning curve is quite steep, but no where near as complex as Paradox games. If I had one complaint it would be the UI - it is a bit clunky feeling, which complicates some of the learning process. Don't get me wrong, the game does its best to try and point you in the right direction (for example, telling you what tech you need to unlock a certain option and taking you to it with Ctrl+Click). But it just fails miserably on other spots (like what is system development? the tooltips are completely useless here).

I absolutely love the sound design though, and I don't think this gets enough attention. Every click and ping on the UI has a decidedly ""futuristic"" feel to it, not sure how else to describe it. It stood out to me as opposed to other UI sounds like Paradox games with odd clunks and bangs for their SFX. To some this will literally mean nothing, but to other audiophiles out there you will appreciate this greatly.

It takes away from the grand scale of the game when you're only against 6 other factions.

It's really developed a lot over the past few updates, though I have passed over some of the DLC's as I've heard they cause problems.  It has lots of replayability because the different factions each feel distinct, rather than the typical symmetric ones that are easier for the programmers to balance.  The factions aren't just an afterthought, where you've got some insignificant bonuses and weaknesses; they really play quite differently.  It has outstanding depth of play, but almost feels casual because everything is absurdly well tool tipped, rather than expecting you to look up everything in a semi-external manual.  Combat is a nice balance halfway between fully TBT, or RTS which can get tedious in a grand 4x campaign, and fully automated like in GalCiv.  The art is great, and there does feel like there's an overarching story that motivates you to pursue victory conditions other than ""murder every other faction.""

I know the above sentence doesn't quite make sense but bear with me, I will explain.  Firstly, let me say I love this game and personally think it's better than Civ4 and above, maybe even Civ 2!  Blasphemy I know, but this game blends the turn based strategy and micromanaging economy aspects of Civilisation but then adds in Role playing and deep story/lore too (a la Alpha Centauri).  But, it can be very daunting for anyone who isn't familiar to it.

For starters, you play as a space faring faction/civilisation and you have to manage your production, economy and military very similar to Civilisation.  Buildings will give you bonuses, improve defences or there are even wonders and faction wonders too.  You will need to colonise planets in a system by setting up outposts on a planet and also researching the ability to colonise new harsher planet types.  different planets give you different base stats to your people working them, and even race specific penalties or boosts.  For instance you might have a specific race that has a bonus on fertile planets, or you might have some bonuses on hot or cold planets.  You will have your starting race, but you will also have other races in your civilisation, each with their own bonuses/benefits etc.  Managing the amounts of these people and where they are is important.  With all that said, the economy can be quite daunting with trading or resources/luxury items and even a stock market and all the previous aspects to think about.  My advice is to look for some good guides or just play a game and see how it goes.

Unlike civilisation exploration is a little more straight forward, being that you navigate stars via corridors/lanes (think slipstreams or warp gates) and you discover systems and travel within constellations until you find a way to travel outside of these limits.  You have units in fleets that can fight enemies and even cold war like enemies if you or they stray too close.  You can customise your units and part of the strategy is about countering what the enemy will or can throw at you whilst also lobbing stuff back they can't counter.

What sets this game apart is the fact your factions can drastically change your play style.  For instance, you might play as the Hissho, who are war like and 'buy/build' things using a currency you get by fighting.  Or on the opposite end of the spectrum you might play as the Unfallen, who are peaceful tree-like race that just want to 'peacefully' extend their roots to other systems, even other factions systems who get a bonus to their economy so it's a win win right?  Underpinning this is a rich story about the galaxies history and this mysterious dust currency as well as backgrounds for all factions and minor factions.  I love this aspect of the game.  To build upon this you have 'story' which involves quests and your specific faction will also have story quests that can give you rewards or hamper you randomly.

I like this game but to be honest I play solo and geek out to the beautiful artwork and story elements to the game.  I know it's not for everyone, but if you fall into that niche of liking turn based strategy, role playing and story then this game is worth a shot.",1597540033,1597540033,True,77,1,0.823883652687072754,0,True,False,False

1- AI is really dumb, its like playing against a 5 year old kid.
2- Micro management of planet populations, the more planets you get the worse it becomes.
3- Hacking mechanics added with a DLC, it's just annoying, apparently in space age ships travel 100 times faster than you concluding a hacking op, not to mention there does not seem to be any way to defend yourself against it, which in the end leads you to just ignore it altogether and just try to live with it.
4- Trying to conquer 1 planet can take up a huge amount of turns if the system has a draft improvement built, which then leads to the AI just spending 1 population each turn to drum up soldiers. so that's pretty annoying.   
5- Diplomacy, what it comes down to is if you are weak the AI will extort you and if you are stronger they are your best friends and gift you stuff just to balance a meter that was built into the game mechanics no matter if one is enemy or friend. So if you give money to your alliance members to help them out they in turn will give it to your enemies just to balance their own relations regardless if they need it for themselves or not. Talk about stupid.
6- During war your alliance member can decide to make peace without your approval leaving you in a state of WTF.

and the list goes on....
The game mechanics really make this otherwise beautiful game not fun, so much so I became sleepy trying to micro manage planet populations each turn. You would expect otherwise and I thought so too when I bought this game but this one has no replay value for me. I was so bored I did not even finish my first run.

1. Better graphics
2. Better soundtrack
3. 12 very distinctive races (with all DLC's).
4. UI that is masterpiece on its own.

Don't get me wrong, it's not simple game by all means. It's challenging and AI is competetive on higher difficulties. What sets this game apart from Stellaris or Civilization or other strategy games are 12 built in races with option to make your own. I havent even used custom race creation, because I didn't master all of stock ones.

In many strategy games differences are very small between races, not so in Endless Space 2. Each race has its own uniqe game machanic unavailbile to othes. Each of them has different ship configuration slots. Each race of Endless Space 2 it's new game experience on its own. Of course some basic game rules are common between all races, but when you start game as different race than previous play you are forced to learn new game mechanics and how to use their strenghts to win game. You cannot just apply similiar strategy than in other races, it wont work.

In almost every strategy game you send settlers/colonizers to found new cities/colonies in ES 2 you have race that exists on huge Ark ships (availble only for them) and they can move them between systems. This makes their whole civilization mobile.

Another race doesn't even need colony ships, they just buy colonies for dust (main currency in game).

I don't want to spoiler more, but if you like turn based strategy games that are deep and rewarding with at least 12 next gameplays unique so much that you would think you bought 12 games not one. Then Endless Space 2 is for you, you wont regret it.",1597065447,1597065447,True,7,1,0.587058067321777344,0,True,False,False

I did quite a bit of research to find a modern, immersive 4x game and ES2 came up as the most interesting choice.  Oh, I should mention that it also had to be Mac compatible, which did limit the field considerably.  But ES2 checked the Mac box.

I'll admit I ignored the NUMEROUS threads on Steam, Reddit, etc, describing the buggy nature of ES2.  Surely those were anomalous issues affecting the few, right?  So I bit the bullet, put down my nickels, (all 800 of them) and sat back for an enjoyable, immersive experience.

Nope, not happening.  Straight away I ran into the Mono install issue.  Relatively easy to resolve but foreboding; perhaps those anomalies aren't such.  I genuinely can't remember the last time I had to 'fiddle' to get a game to run.  Early 2000's, maybe.  Just lucky, perhaps, but I do expect cleaner installations from 'professional' publishers.  Call me picky.

But I did get the game running.  The game does look great; clearly a priority was placed on visual polish.  Gameplay is also relatively brisk for a 4x.  There is depth to the game where you want it but thankfully the player is not required to constantly push and pull stats in order to progress.  The battles are simply scripted from starting parameters with no actual input from the player during the battle.   The battles are flashy but the grand cinematics tire quickly, (I'd happily forego the battle scenes and have the disk space back).  The AI is fickle, rudimentary and ultimately predictable.  The UI is creative but rather obtuse, so expect quite a bit of time stumbling in the dark while you figure things out.  All told, I'd comfortably give the game a 6/10, which should merit a positive recommendation, just.

And then, inexplicably, ES2 quit working.  Black screen on launch, spinning cursor but nothing more.  Ultimately hard to recommend a game that doesn't actually run.  Fingers crossed for a more robust ES3.",1596591435,1596591435,False,4,1,0.491642087697982788,0,True,False,False

+ Every faction has unique features that make them all play very differently.
+ Pretty well balanced given the impressive variety of mechanics.
+ The UI is phenomenal, it's an absolute joy to play with. It's probably one of the best in the history of gaming.
- Some mechanics are not explained well, the game would really benefit from an ingame encyclopedia.
- The combat has just a bit more depth than autoresolve, it's really not much to write home about. You can watch a flashy battle sequence, though, for what little that's worth.

Art: 9/10
The art is all solid. The 3D looks nice enough, the 2D looks excellent, and the UI design is pretty immaculate.

Sound: 8/10
FX and UI sound fine. The soundtrack features some really nice tracks, but overall it's a bit unremarkable, and I wish there were more. The VO is nice; Emperor Z has a voice like bourbony chocolate and Mr. Reaper is fuckin hilarious.

Story: 6.5/10
It's a 4X sandbox game. We're here for emergent gameplay, not narrative. That said, a few of the quests have some nice twists, and there's a couple nice lore-building events, but a lot of it is forgettable fluff you'll stop bothering to read eventually.

Sneak, Hack, Atrophy, Convert or Absorb your opponent instead of Zergrush - though kekeke is still a possibility.

I didn't mind the exploration side for the most part, you'll need to do that to uncover resources that are consumed by various development projects.

It's tactical, turn based, and not too steep of a learning curve while still having lots of interesting options. For instance, at the end of one of my campaigns, I had a quest to get a hero to the other side of the map. I had to traverse a bunch of enemy territory, and the fastest I could get a hero ship was 15 units /turn. Not bad, but I found if I diverted 1/4 of my total resources into warp drives and fit them to a single star destroyer sized monster ship I could get it to a solid 32 units of move. This is of course, without any real shields or weapons, but with full tech upgrades. I spent an insane amount of money, completely draining my empire's coffers, to have a single super fast ship built in one turn, and then sent it zipping across the stars. I coupled that with a hero who's special ability was that he could join a unit anywhere on the map, and voila. Surprise impossible endgame quest beaten by spending all of my money, 500+ antimatter (out of a max of 999), and an ungodly amount of other stuff. Neat. And after, I was left with my rocketship/star destroyer. Which I promptly refit with real guns and used to great effect as a horrifyingly effective guerrilla warfare unit. 

 The game actually pays attention to your decisions, and the opponents respond sanely (mostly) to your actions, so diplomacy has some meaning as well. The only thing I don't like about the diplomacy is that if you let an empire pressure you too much, you end up with a bad choice of two options. So don't let any empires build up diplomatic pressure. You can stave it off by sending them tribute pre-emptively, or influencing the political pressure with things like blockades. Or hacking their computer systems. Or just denouncing them, because screw those robot guys. On the flip side, if you exert enough political pressure on them, you can force them to make terrible decisions. I liked to hit them with that right before declaring war. 

Another neat feature is alliances. They change your win condition, but allow you to actually win as part of a faction. I made a pact with the weird tree guys, then the cute ferangi, and we had a weird mix where I was the military, the ferangi girl was the money, and the tree guys were the diplomats. It worked, Admittedly, I was putting out more of every stat then my two partners, but it worked better than most 4X4 games with alliances and whatnot. Eventually the two factions that kept declaring war on our empire/alliance ended up creating one for themselves. A player was eliminated, and then it was two large alliances at war with two independent factions doing their own thing.  Lots of fun, and the alliance guys seemed to track what I was doing, even going so far to provide a little defense for me when I went on the offense. 

All this happened in one game. I'm sure it might get old eventually, but I can already see several ways I want to replay the game, and many of the races are so different it might be a different game for them anyways! One of the guys I was trying to wipe out had ark ships instead of homeworlds, and kept escaping into the space between stars. My wooden friend didn't have influence bubbles, but instead created wooden vines between systems, even through mine! And once he did, I started to get little wood people that I could ritual sacrifice for colony happiness. Thanks, tree friends!

Anyways, there are fewer sides than Civ, but they are much better fleshed out. The mechanics are great, and the customization isn't overwhelming. It's not as deep as Stellaris (or most games from that dev), but it's pretty darn good for what it is. I'm writing this review at 4 in the morning because I got sucked into ""One more turn"" at 10 pm. Whoops.

Pros:
Amazing soundtrack
UI and going in and out of systems feels good and the mystery of probing a planet for benefits/negatives is great. 
Interesting planetary combinations
Great early feeling of discovery and exploration

Cons:
Just as Endless Space 1, I felt combat was really unfulfilling. Decisions are really Auto Chess and you dont even want to watch the battle because of the controls on the camera are terrible and the interaction is boring at best after 2 or 3 times watching. 
Ship customization due to poor military/hull options in tech tree feel unexciting and not worth the choices made. 
Once you reach mid to late game and start taking over other enemy systems the tug of war balance for Dust and Manpower just gets frustrating and a chore. Im literally hitting turns feeling like Ive made low impact to reach a goal and it just drags out SO terribly that I dont want to finish it. The glory even of having a huge 8 vs 8 ship battle is really unsatisfying.  
Ground combat was completely frustrating and another auto chess that didnt matter to watch. 

Ive played Endless Space 1 a lot and this really just feels like an expansion. I think a pro/con is you always have something to build/manage/do but also it can get out of hand and annoying and so clunky you dont even want to finish your play-through. 

I think this stems for me from the poor combat options and gameplay surrounding combat. The tech tree had 50% interesting impactful things and 50% poor unexciting options. I love MOO2 and a lot of other 4x games because you feel like you have an impact on your ship creation or battles. The tech trees also made you feel excited when you discovered something new. This does not unfortunately.  
I think because they added more to this game than Endless Space 1 the replayability for me went down not up as crazy as that sounds. 

Either way glad I bought it on Summer Sale and would suggest that to others because after 20 hours of 3 playthroughs this is how Im left feeling about the game.

Like i can sell any of my ships and then buy them back on the market at a small difference to instantly send them to any system?? DO YOU REALIZE HOW MANY TIMES I SCREWED OVER MY OPPONENTS WITH THIS?? Also i can buy really powerful hunter ships very early in game at...300 dust?? A crappy little ""knife"" ship costs about the same! 

Also i just don't get how these AI views the value of items at the trade screen...some items seemingly have their value set to about zero even though they have many utility and the AI don't possess them in large quantity...

And LORD it is hard to get a scientific victory...which i suppose isn't all bad since the science system really need to be neutered anyway (Immediately getting tiered-up equipment as you advance in science was BS), now you gotta develop your science based on your needs and style, so some dumb-dumbs always gets their planets invaded by MY glorious ARMY OF TANKS cuz they didn't want to invest in airplanes! But it is now so hard to actually get more science that...ANY OTHER VICTORY can easily be completed by accident while you wait for everything to develop...

Music was good but not as good as Endless Legends, in this game the music just plays in the background, staying out of your way, unlike in Endless Legends where the BGM were very much in the foreground.

The writing and the quests/events had been improved from other titles. Still despite this, most of the Playable factions still felt quite boring to me...all except for Horatio, that one was funny. Kinda feels like most of the factions are just reskinned elements of other titles without unique identities to themselves. Might as well just featured more races from other games, i personally would want to see the Broken Lords IN SPACE.

Didn't like that Dust was neutered though...i mean, me personally can still find many utilities to Dust, but everything's so expensive now, i remember back then being able to build an entire colony in one turn cuz i had an absurd quantity of Dust, now...my Dust per Turn can only fuel one or two construction...that sucks man...well, at least you can still teleport ships with them! (SO BROKEN!!!)

Oh yeah, guess what's the best way to invade a system? You get a bunch of personnel transport ships with NO WEAPON and group them together, and a bunch of scout ships with weapons but don't group them into a fleet, then they move together to a system then invade it...an enemy carrier comes to eat you, but since your transports have no weapon, they automatically attack one of the scouts, you retreat, and keep invading until it is yours or until reinforcement arrives...it is actually that broken! 

Anyway, there are still many other exploits and stuff in the game you do not necessarily have to look up any guides to discover and cheese the game, but overall the game is still good.

(Very good but complex space 4X game)

============

Review:

Man, this game is so big on many levels.

I have played Endless Space 1 and Endless Legend before, but this has so much
new content to learn that I was totally swamped at first.

All the politics, laws, trading and empire development takes a while to learn.

So yeah, there is a learning curve. I had to play a couple of games before I got the hang of it.
If you're the impatient type, you should skip this game.

But if you like 4X games and have no problem taking your time to learn and explore the game, then I highly recommend this game.

============

It looks very good even today and has great and atmospheric music.

I especially love the custom race editor of the game - while you will still have a premade race as a core (like tech trees and stuff), it allows you to heavily tinker your.. sub-race? faction? whatever you call it.

After playing this game more and trying out custom races, I can say that the money system in the game sucks.

Even if you make a custom race focused on economic income, you can't buy much.
Because the inflation is so strong in this game. The more money you make, the less valuable it will be. (Maybe realistic but not fun..)

It's like ""hey, let's make a money race that can buyout everything"" .. well, you can't do it,
at least on smaller galaxies which I prefer they are useless.

And well the AI is pretty bad too. That's normal these days, but seriously..
a tiny enemy race with one system left still threatens you and makes demands to you, when clearly they have no chance to win.

Also, these inferior enemies will often ask for a truce and want a bunch of technology from you, even when it is clear they are the losing side.. shouldn't it be the other way around?

It's still a very good game, but the more you play it, the more you will see its flaws.

This is the first 4X space game to actually challenge the superiority of Master of Orion 2. For me, anyway.

============

Summary:

The Good 👍
+ Awesome custom race editor
+ Best looking game of the genre so far
+ Atmospheric music
+ First game to actually challenge MoO for me

The Bad 👎

POST RELEASE UPDATE:

It pains me to bad mouth this game, if you read my initial post you will understand. It has a lot going for it and it is still cheaper than the Civ games, but SEGA put their fingerprints all over this. It felt very rushed, the fighters and bombers for some reason haven't been put in yet, broken tool tips/names (displays like ""@%nocost&-!""), the AI is lack luster and inconsistent, win conditions are pretty uneven, and a few other things that bother me.

The game has a lot going for it and it is gorgeous. I highly enjoy the custom race option and you can tell they have learned a lot from previous games but it all of a sudden feels like yet another AAA title that was released too soon because deadlines and money are the only thing SEGA cares about. I'm happy this series is hurting Civ's bottom line because they are money hungry at firaxxis as well, but I am on the fence about this game. I like the historical aspect of Civ but the endless games have so much more going for them. 

I will leave this as a thumbs up but with a really big warning. It's cheaper and better than civ imo, but is not without its faults. This is not polished and beware if they start charging soon for DLC without the main game being fixed.


INITIAL EA POST:

I'll start this off by admitting I'm kind of a fanboy when it comes to the Endless games. I've liked them all and while they each had their shortcommings in my opinion, they were great and most importantly, different from other games. ES2 is off to a good start and I can't wait to see where they go with it. I know the store page says it but remember THIS IS ALPHA, don't buy this right now if you are looking for a full functioning game. Its a handful of races, some galaxy creation settings, and the core game with only a few win types. Get into this now only if you want to help flush out bugs and support this team while they finish the product. That being said, it is still a gorgeous game as is and you can still have some really fun games even in barebones form. If you are a return player from ES1, you'll notice the Cravers and Sophons are back along with 2 new races that are interesting to play with. Overall its a good looking start and it doesn't seem like we have too much to worry about from the partnership with SEGA, feels like a good step forward from EL and ES1.",1476131417,1593875118,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Amplitude would have been better off fixing the bugs in ES1, and improving the UI (for functionality, not distracting bling - start by adding decent scaling for 1440p and higher res monitors).

The UI in ES2 is a lot prettier than the UI in ES1 but is inferior in every other way - it's like their whole approach to UI is ""how can we make this pretty and animated and sparkly?"" rather than ""how can we make this useful to make all the micro-management less tedious?"".  It's like it was made by a schizophrenic with ADHD on acid. Note the word ""made"" there - I am very deliberately not using the word ""designed"".

The technology/research screen in ES2, for example, is awful.  So much bling, so unusable & unreadable. The galaxy map is OK but the system map is horrible - sure, it displays the planets nicely in their orbits but extracting meaning and data from the screen is far more difficult than it was in ES1. and the list displays, like fleets and systems, take up about a quarter of the screen instead of being full-screen and show less than 10 entries at a time....and if your mouse point is slightly outside of the scroll region for the list, you end up zooming the main galaxy map in and out instead of scrolling the list.

In fact, that's a generic flaw with ES2 - it has better scaling for resolution but completely wastes that improvement and somehow manages to end up worse, and everything feels cramped and filled with distracting bling rather than utility. Getting an overview of the state of the galaxy or your empire or your fleets is much more difficult than it needs to be, and much more difficult than it was in ES1. ES1's UI was far from perfect, and certainly had its problems, but there was a nice, simple elegance to it.

I've had ES2 for a few years now, and hardly played it at all - 53 hours total so far.  I still play ES1, over 1500 hours (several hundred hours of that were after I bought ES2. many of the rest made a long illness less boring, playing a game of ES1 was/is like playing a game of ""patience"" for me).",1593836895,1593836895,False,0,1,0.445220410823822021,0,True,False,False

Nearly everything feels like a tedious chore, which is ironic since you don't actually do much of anything. You'll find your typical tech tree, which unlocks a variety of constructions and projects to improve production. You'll colonize worlds, which can take anywhere from 20 to 90 turns to complete. Adding to the tedium, you can only colonize one world at a time. In a game that only lasts a few hundred turns, that's a pretty extreme arbitrary limitation. 
But that isn't the only thing that takes forever, as even fully upgraded ships take many turns to go from one destination to another. The solution to that would be to build more ships, but not only does each ship have a maintenance cost that eats into your monthly revenue, but a population cost as well. 

In the end, I can't recommend this game. There are too many arbitrary design decisions that limit gameplay.

Boy was I wrong. From the very first minute I was bombarded with excessive amount of information and some random pointers offered by the advisor, but the tutorial itself is so damn unintuitive that after 30 minutes I was basically in the starting point, knowing nothing, since game didn't mention a word about absolute basic stuff like economy, research or expansion. I had no idea what to do next, where to click, so ultimately it ended up in me clicking random things on screen.

Although I'm aware that this game is worth learning etc. and it has a lot of content and offeres a different kind of experience in comparison to Stellaris, I undoubtedly see it's extremely unfriendly towards new players. Hell, it's complicated even for 4X veterans due to UI and information complexity. Ironically, I will spend more time watching video tutorials than playing game itself.

There are going to be things that some players don't dig, and definitely some things that other games do better, but in my opinion, this game gets the balance right.  If nothing else, it's a triumph in UI design.  Almost everything is easy to find, and information is clear and easy to access, which is actually a problem with these games.  The faction design is great (the lore is top-notch, tying into other ""Endless"" titles and really building a compelling galactic ""community""), and is actually well balanced even while it engenders some asymmetrical situations.  Most players will probably find that they trip up on the combat, which is almost totally automated on a tactical level.  Fleet placement and composition, ship design, and tactical ""cards"" combine to make combat an exercise in higher level strategic planning.  You can choose to watch the visually satisfying combat encounters, or you can skip it and just see what the outcome is right away.  I tend to pick and choose, depending on how key the battle is.  I don't know about other DLC but I have the Supremacy one, and I'm also not sure how much of it is due to the DLC, but if I'm not mistaken, the diplomacy has been enhanced and improved, and I approve of the changes.

If you start to go in the black... you may have to dissolve your diplomatic entanglements... but there are many free ""actions"" you can take that are contextual, such as someone flying through your territory allowing you to demand that they get off your lawn, so to speak.  I could go on, but all I can really say in the end is that I highly recommend this game.  If you played Endless Space, this game is more and better.

Even if you're familiar with the Endless setting be prepared to lose a few games because you're overwhelmed. Since it's launch it's gone through numerous updates. For those of you who are familiar with endless space 1 know that the space battles have been simplified. A few may find this frustrating but I found it a welcome change. The setting is very unique and the factions are all distinct. Some more than others, but, I'd be surprised if you couldn't find at least one faction to fall in love with. Aside from Horatio of course, because, how can you love such a beautiful faction full of beautiful people.

Overall this is one of the better 4x games I've played in a long time. It's competitors for space 4x games are numerous but this game has strong narrative theming, very unique factions, a somewhat more interesting range of AI's than some. The economies are complex, you're likely to end up with systems you've fully upgraded and a few you've specialized. The government system is well flushed out and despite the tedium of checking it at first for surprises, after several games you'll appreciate that it acts as a reflection of your factions over all activities. The game suffers somewhat on the easier difficulties. I play it on Serious or Endless to avoid easy score victories through an alliance against the cravers. 

The game can drag on at the end as I wasn't successful enough at navigating the path to victories outside of Alliances very often. In one instance, the wonder victory, the more I tried for it the more games I lost. But the experience as a whole was very satisfying. If you play with a time limit the best path to victory is always to join an Alliance. If you play without a time limit the science and economic victories conditions are there to determine a winner by what feels like default. There are factions more suited to the science or economic factions and cranking up the time limit seems to make this less of a possibility and more of an eventuality for that faction to dominate. This is more likely a limitation on my part but could mean that if you really like a faction you may be constrained somewhat in the end game to the intended victory type. 

The DLC was all pretty good, but, the new mechanics may be difficult. The tutorial for Pneumbra at launch was of no help to me and I basically took a break from the game because I couldn't learn the new game mechanics I'd been looking forward to.

So I gave the second version a try now. And even after a few minutes I felt like ""I have seen this before. Exactly this."" Well, no one said it was going something completely different, but come one. This is the very same game. It has way better graphics but they are not really relevant for this type of game. You don't have action parts where it matters that your ships look cool (and the ships in ES2 don't look cool). You get lost in menues over menues, shitloads of skills and materials and stuff to do. Politics have become more important, but the political systems remain the same unlikely ones from the predecessor (you can play your usual space opera Emperor/Dictator). The tutorial ran me into a dead end, when I was asked to quick learn some new skill but I was lacking the necessary payment (well, I just started the game, how would I have earned anything already). Bummer. Fleets and ships are displayed as grid graphics only while managing them, which is disappointing. Commands are all or nothing: go exploring space means, the ship zips through the galaxy like nothing, trying to stop it becomes quite a task because it's always already on it's way in between systems. Well, I guess all these flaws are my fault, because I haven't learned the controls for the game yet. But it already feels very tyring and not very exciting. The original game had the right balance of micro-management, events and strategic planning. This game makes you feel like you will have to invest tremendous amounts of time to even get a game going halfway properly. And that you will loose dearly when you rush anything or think you can create a few ciolonies within a handful of hours. I think this is two shoes too big for me. It's a bit like delving into EVE Online without any help or guidance. Everytime you find out how something silly works, you understand better how vast and overwhelming the game mechanis are. I am a casual gamer, I can't play for hours in a row or every other day. So I guess I bought the wrong game here. But I fully support the Endless series.

I am new to this type of game.....19 hours only on it and feel like just starting out, got a thousand other things to do in life
so play this when I can....only got this in last couple months in a sale....if i remember right.

When I was finishing my first game.......windows came up with ""Program not responding""........DO NOT CANCEL YOUR GAME OR CLOSE ENDLESSSPACE.EXE. Just wait.....as luckily I did...I waited then the end game screen came up....as i did not realise it was just finalising things....or that I had finished the game....newbee I guess.

Stick with it.........even after the first hour playing I could not play anymore as my brain just waved the white flag.
Steep learning curve indeed......but stick with it......watch tutorials on youtube or vemeo or twitch.
Come back and try again......its not every ones cuppa but for me it is a really great game to go through.
You gotta learn how it does things.....took ages to find out after you build a ship to get it from your shipyard into orbiting my system to send out!!!!!

So stick with it.....and found out you can play with AI and NO internet connection, so thats good.

Endless space 2 is loaded with lore of a fantastic galaxy. every play-through I end up reading something new that intrigues me, or just makes me laugh.  

The civilizations available to play in ES2 play quite differently from each other, much more than in civ 5 where each civ only differs by an ability, a building, and a unit.  The fact that human players and AI can not just work together, but win together, makes for exciting strategies and game play you would never see in Civ 5.  The Vaulters with their portals (which are open to them AND their allies) are a great example of this.  

Diplomacy feels much more reasonable in ES2 when compared to Civ 5 as well (Unless you have the misfortune of being neighbors with the Cravers).  I have been saved countless times by my AI allies when interlopers find their way past my front line fleets.  In Civ 5 i would be surprised if the AI units ever figured out how to navigate past lakes or ocean to even get into my land to help or destroy me.  If you treat your AI allies well in ES2 often they well return the favor. In Civ they just demand you give them your marble because youre ""friends"" in name only.
Quests in ES2 open the game to lore and gameplay possibilities often unique to each empire.  It accomplishes with grace what Civ's Beyond Earth installment tried and failed to do.  The quests for the most part are optional, and if you dont care about missing an opportunity for a small bonus reward you don't have to bother with them and can focus on galactic domination if you so desire.  
I feel like i could write an entire essay about why I like Endless space 2 but I am now bored of typing and want to get back to culling the disgusting vine spread of the Unfallen from the center of my galaxy with the help of my beautiful best friend and ally, Horatio.

Here are the fundamental problems with this game, in no particular order.

1) The technology tree/web. It is very difficult to navigate and target what technologies you want in this. Civilization has a very simple technology tree that is easy to navigate. Endless Legend has a much more complicated technology tier system that is still very easy to navigate because the tiers are split up. The Endless Space technology tree is a dartboard and finding the technologies that you want and the progress that you want to make is much harder than it needs to be.  There are also way too many technologies, for seemingly no reason, and keeping track of it and deciding what you want to research is just not fun.

2) Dust is hard to come by, unless you sell a ton of luxury and strategic resources to the market.  Then you just have tons of dust.  Actually building an economy in your empire seems a trivial source of income in comparison, especially with most of the improvements costing enormous amounts of upkeep and dust generating improvements few and far between. The entire economic system is ridiculous to be honest, especially trading. Performing even simple trade deals cost enormous amounts of influence and it really makes the entire system clunky as hell.

3) Exploration is weird and stupid. There is very little good or interesting things to find compared to a game like Stellaris.  Ships have probes, and regenerate them every few turns.  Systems often have 5-6 anomalies. I want to explore the galaxy, not leave my scout ship in the system for 10+ turns to explore all the anomalies.  In the game that I played my starting area had tons of copies of a handful of luxury resources, and those luxuries seem to be concentrated in clusters in the galaxy. This means you have tons of certain resources and none of the others. Don't like the resource that you got stuck with in your starting area? Tough luck, because trading in this game is awful.

4) Overcolonization negatives are prohibitive. I can't colonize nearly as much as I want, and I can't build a sprawling space empire. How am I supposed to take over the galaxy when I start getting enormous unhappiness bonuses with additional colonies?  There is no obvious and easy way to overcome this penalty, and while there are supposedly ways to do so it's just disheartening.

5) Diplomacy is awful.  I got a message from a neighboring AI giving me 2 terrible options - do I want to pay them thousands of gold and thousands of research to reduce the pressure, or do you want to take a -30% FIDS malus on your entire empire.  What I want to do is DECLARE WAR, and shove a railgun up their asses but I don't have this option. I have to accept a penalty, and THEN declare war. Even after declaring war, the penalty still applies to me.  

6) Laws suck. Most of the laws that you can apply to your senate come with massive costs or penalties, to the point that you don't want to use any of them. In a game like Civilization, the government policies are all good and you have to choose carefully which ones you want to use at any given time.

7) Watching the combat unfold had so much potential, even if I have no control over it. Ultimately it turned out boring and lame. Compared to space combat in Stellaris, Sword of the Stars, or Gratuitous Space Battles, it just feels wrong. I would even prefer a quick little simplified combat animation like in Civilization, rather than this weird, long drawn out battle that you have zero control over and where the participants behave like zombies with zero intelligence or free will.

8) In general the game interface is just confusing and weird. It's not very intuitive, and figuring out how to do what you want is often a battle all on its own.  It is super easy to lose track of things, and the struggle just grinds down the fun levels.

In summary this game is incredibly frustrating because it is just on the cusp of being a fun game, and with some balancing changes and UI tweaks I think it could have been there. I briefly browsed the workshop to find a few mods to fix some of the more egregious balancing issues, but at the end of the day there are just too many fundamental problems to invest the time to try to fix it with mods.",1589866267,1589866267,False,124,20,0.653846323490142822,0,True,False,False

+ The politics within this game give you a sense that you are making overall decisions that guide your people's development.

+ Your homeworld distinct political factions (scientists, military, commerce, etc.) that influence how people vote in forming the government, which determines what laws are available (i.e., bonuses for development).

+ As you explore, you encounter minor civilizations that you can influence. The greater your standing with such minor civilizations, the more benefits that they will give you, plus you have the option to assimilate them into your culture.

+ By interacting with minor civilizations, their people will emigrate to your systems, forming their own distinct political factions that diversifies your culture, and your people's overall reaction to ongoing events.

+ There is great variety in the tech research, which isn't so much a ""tree"" as it is a pie that has been divided into four sections, with each section subdivided into general and specialized techs.

+ In addition to forming fleets of starships, there are also planetary invasion mechanics using infantry, tanks, and fighter jets. This adds a nuance to invasions because you cannot simply steamroll planets with your fleet of starships.

+ Using tech, you unlock tactics that form a selection that is generally available. When entering battle, you choose what tactics your fleet will apply, which has a nuanced effect upon their maneouvers.

+ Your choice of combat tactic, in combination with how your ships are outfitted, is pitted against your enemy's choice of tactic in combination with how their ships are outfitted. This is more than brute force because multi-function fleets (e.g., capital ships with support from specialized escorts) will out-compete vanilla ships.

+ The arrangement of star systems is interesting because they are arranged like the constellations that you would find in astrological signs. Except that, where astrological signs have imaginary lines that are drawn between systems, this game uses the connecting lines as star lanes upon which ships travel. Tech research unlocks more options, such as warp travel and wormholes.

Good:
-Graphics improved over ES1, nice voiced and animated empire leaders. 
-UI is done well. 
-Overall, good basic ground work.

Bad:
-Overall, different systems and features don't work well together. More tweaking and adjusting needed.

-Late game kills the engine. Cannot handle large galaxies. 
-Unable to attack outposts!!! You have to wait until they are full colonies!

Would be nice if there was a way to make the AI more aggressive and try to play to win (on their own) so that there can be some betrayals in alliances.

It should be that the only winner in alliance is the top scorer in the win objective so you still lose even if youre allied with someone that carried you (because at that point you dont really ""win"")

I also noticed that even in endless the AI doesnt push their advantage and just let you do stuff.

The early game was meant to be for exploration i guess but it would be nice if there are some tension in the early (not rng pirates) 

Also influence cost on certain actions should scale dependent on the total influence floating around in the game. I know it suppose to be used in laws and buying systems but it could be more interesting than that since you have all this political system you want that to have some impact (give privateers a use, no one uses them because of big stick policy) (no incentive to sabotage your alliance since the AI can carry you to victory)

The DLC new races are nice and its nice to see unique and fun things but maybe some of the dlc shouldve focused on what you've built and improve it things like the politics the and maybe you can do some things like forced peace so that it doesnt snowball where big military = gg, because the game gets too stream lined to supremacy (since conquest is too slow)

although these are just based on a little experience with the game so there might be good reasons on why they are this way

It does feel like some ideas could use further depth or development (Politics feels a bit tacked-on, like a nick from Stellaris, and not altogether suiting to ES2's style, but it's .... fine, I guess). 

Expansion-wise, they're a somewhat mixed bag. They certainly can't hold a candle to Endless Legend's DLCs .... with the exception of Inferno and Symbiosis, which were created by an out-of-house studio, NGD Studios, and largely bad additions. It's unfortunate that Amplitude decided to hire the same studio for a final expansion to Endless Space 2: Awakening. You can see the mixed reviews, which reflect a total lack of design care and polish compared to previous DLC, which, although a bit sparse on content and new mechanics, are at least polished and improve the game as a whole. Supremacy's capital ships are great, Penumbra's hacking mechanic is fun (though, maybe we could've gotten spies and espionage first?).

It has very good graphics, well thought-out technologies and weapons, along with a nice quality to it. However, I am a Paradox player, and I'm sorry to say that Paradox games are just superior. This is of course, what I think. I don't enjoy turn-based systems, I don't like the diplomacy system, I don't like the combat, nor do I particularly enjoy the politics system. Everything is just so arcade-y, it isn't complex enough.

 The diplomacy system in this game is a sham, completely pointless. While the game attempts to add flavor to it, what it comes down to is that you are either at war with someone or you aren't. Alliances don't really change anything, at least as far as I have seen, but there really isn't any motivation at all to ally with people because of how it all works. Basically, diplomacy in ES2 depends on one variable, are you powerful? If you're weak, the AI will conquer you, but if you're strong the AI won't conquer you. That is the extent to which diplomacy functions in this game. 

Combat doesn't exist because I don't think it actually qualifies as combat. Here's what you do, you have your fleet, you attack an enemy fleet, and you pick a card that determines what formation your ships will go into when you attack. When the battle starts you watch a cutscene of your ships attacking the enemy ships, which is pretty cool to watch, but unfortunately I'm playing a video game, not watching a movie, and I would very much like to be PLAYING the damn game. Want to invade a planet? It's the same exact thing but instead of a cool 3d cinematic it's this holographic top-down view of an arbitrary amount of troops firing blobs of pixels at one another, only to have a certain amount of them turn grey (which means they're dead). 

On the plus side of all this, the graphics are really good.

Either way, here is a short summary of the good and bad;

Good:
1. This game is deep, and I mean deep, after a couple of years playing this game I still learn new things and discover new items and technologies. This is a good thing but for starting players it might be overwelming. I had alot of trouble getting started. My advice; let it happen and don't be afraid to not understand it all.
2. Like I said, the feeling of this game is what made me fell in love. It's such a calm feeling with wonderful art and a sense that you are truly exploring the galaxy. Combine this with a wonderful soundtrack.
3. Gameplay never feels too fast or too slow and always smooth. It all goes well together.
4. shipbuilding is balanced and without getting too technically still gives you all the customization you want. 

Bad:
1: Diplomacy is very wanky. It's difficult to keep alliance members happy if you are low in score and communication doesn't work between races. It's not entirely broken but every race feels more like an AI that tries to keep up with something it doesn't understand.
2: Expansions Supramacy & Penumbra , don't buy them, not even on sale.
3: Race balacing; on harder difficulties certain races just don't stand their ground. Especially the Unfallen and Vordyani don't hold their ground and get wiped out rather quickly. Yes there are exeptions but those are far and few in between. Even playing your own race you are forced to take certain crucial perks which allow you to expand quickly in the start. 
4: Little micromanagement. Having 20+ star systems each with 3-5 planets feels a bit too much. You lose that connection to a single planet or hero and are most of the time looking at a map with numbers instead.

Overall a great game worth every penny I paid for it! I won with one race (the vaulters) so 8 more races to go!",1585819825,1585819825,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

That's because Stellaris is absurdly difficult to get into, and silly with it, too -- the user interface is the ugly look of necessity, there are endless problems, from the niggling to the soul-crushing. It's not a fair comparison, or even a helpful one, as both titles are about as unlike each other as you can get in a space-based 4X. Endless Space 2 is harmonious all the way around, with the right mix of strategy, design, gameplay, and satisfaction. Start a game, play it though in an evening, have fun, win/lose/draw.  The DLC is generally worth every penny IMHO, too, not something that many games can claim.  ES2 is just fun, with no serious flaws, approaching perfection, but still not quite achieving it.

Generally, people who play ES2 want more of something or another, and that's where the problem lies.

Absurdly, it is difficult to chastise ES2 for lacking one feature or too shallow an other -- for example, let us say more complex diplomacy is what people think they want. Without realizing it, I want a feature that expanding upon would probably render ES2 more feature-laden and deep, but less harmonious, with less fluidity of game play. When I play ES2, I discover things I think I want, but I know that in the end they would probably ruin what most players intuitively respect, and that's a purity of experience which excels in every area, minimizes distractions and micromanagement, and maximizes fun. Every major race is different enough to make the game fresh, and most every space battle is riveting. It chucks out the everything-and-the-kitchen-sink ethos to focus on what is important.... having fun, and winning.



To wit:

Endless Space 2 is easy to slide up in, and the user interface/design elements are pure sexy time.  Hot fleet-on-fleet action!

""Endless space 2"" is a 4X game which focuses on very polished graphics but sadly neglects all other game aspects for said gfx, especially strategy (imho). Biggest disappointment for me were a few old unfixed, gameplay/gamefun killing bugs like the (rare bug) unability to do any form of diplomacy (Diplomatic message: ""This empire and their alliance are currently considering another contract"") or (100% repeat chance) of Vodyani Ark-Ships which couldn't be put into the build-queue when the blueprint contained a ""Meditation Module"". Those bugs were reported in Oct 2018 and Sept 2019 on the official games2gether bug forum, bugs still exist as of today in my game files. Since the company released 4 more expansion packs in the meantime and obviously didn't fix some serious older bugs, this gives me a strong ""Don't invest more €"" impression. 
The game offers (imho) only a simplyfied strategy gameplay, buildings and the science-tree balance was allright, the ship-designing process is of average simplicity regarding shipparts and generally lacks elements like fuel capacity/detection and cloaking-equipment. Another little but good strategy element are Systemlevel-Developement bonuses which offers a variety of choices, but the unchangeable Systemlevel-developement bonus of conquered solar systems are in most cases a nuisance for serious empire builders and often require rebuilding the colony from scratch. 
Compared to ""Master of Orion 2"" the space combat is sadly *far less* strategic and usually very borring to watch. 
When expanding and founding new outposts the AI usually makes sub-optimal choices regarding the preset food-suppling system, long distance and/or suicide supply runs through enemy territory are quite common and therefore usually mostly require manual tuning by the player. Not needed supply ship cant be interacted with or redirected and stay in orbit at a target system until the end of the game or until destroyed by enemy ships. The placing of UI dialog buttons rarely feels a little bit inconsistant regarding a positive or negative meaning for the player.  The functionality and usability of the trade screen could have been done definitly better and feels unnessesary complicated to use/interact with. Display of estimated time of arrival (ETA) for spaceships isnt available for planing fleet movementsin advance, ETA is only shown when the fleet is on its way.

The ONLY bad thing about it is that if you fall behind in score during the first 1/2 game, its very hard to be competitive again unless you do something unexpected like surprise attacks to bring the other player down.

AI is sufficiently good but after you devote many hours you will be able to beat it in the highest difficulty. That's because not all AI factions can become brutal warmongers.

Each faction not only has strengths and weaknesses, but also plays drastically different, so the management part will have different requirements based on what race you choose. So if you are starting with this game, check some youtube for your favorite race, and learn this race very good. After that you can try another race. That is because the races are balanced in my opinion, so play a race because you like it and not because its hard. (of course dont start with the hard races until you know the basics that apply to all races).

This game requires a lot of time to learn and has many options that you will only be able to manage after you have learned the game good enough.

Multiplayer: Is very good but not many players to play if you dont have friends that play this game. That is because the smallest map in the highest speed will take upwards of 5 hours to complete, and that is if you rush it and know how to manage everything fast.

I bought Endless Space a couple of years ago but never got really into it. Now with ES2 things went a little different. Here is a summary of pros and cons.

Pros:

- The amount of content. I must admit that I got almost all DLC except the last one. But even with only the core game there is a lot a of content.

- Graphics: The graphics are great for that kind of game. Not groundbreaking but still great.

- Great user interface. With this kind of game it sometimes feel like ""excel in space"" with all those stats, logos and tabs everywhere. However I thought that everything (and there are a lot of thins) is weel placed and after a little time spent with the game, everything is easy to follow and find.

- The complexity: there is a lot to do in that game to manage your empire. Which for a fan of the genre is perfect. I may very well lose hours if not days or months into this one :-)

Cons:

- Learning curve: I've played the tutorial and felt sometimes that I poped out of it, then later on the ""guide"" pops in and explains me someting more. I thought the tutorial was a bit weird. This is not a problem for me but could be a turn off for many. This game is complex. And the tutorial doesn't always take you by the hand.

- Graphics: listed in the pros, I still need to mention that if you are looking for crazy graphics they are not there. They are great but don't play this game for the graphics.


In conclusion: Extraordinary 4x. Definitely not for everyone

I like this game a lot and have only been scratching the surface. There are many factions all different (with more in the DLCs). Exploration, warfare, a complex science tree, events and strange lore (which kept me interrested), colony and ressource management, heroes, politics (there are elections), diplomatics...

If you like that kind of game by it now.

While I enjoyed it moderately, besides being a niche title, it also didn't ""click"" with me as well as the second one did.

To start off: The second one is really an improvement in every way. Better graphics, better UI, better gameplay etc.
But what surprised me was that the soundtrack was kilometers away from the original game. Seriously, it's that amazing. In the first one, it was really agressive on the synths (and in some aspects even annoying); while the second one makes a perfect combination of synths, voice, space effects and ambiental/instrumental parts. 

On the day that I purchased the second one, I actually even played it for so long and so focused on it that I ended up playing until dawn and ended up dreaming about it (no kidding). It's that addicting and the soundtrack really helps you relax. Besides being amazing, it complements the gameplay perfectly.

So yeah, I'd recommend this title. It's a niche type and I wouldn't recommend it for the gameplay if you're not into these type of game (me neither, but I play it on easy and I like the art style and OST); but instead for the immersion and peace of mind that it gives.

And finally, the best track and the one that ""clicked"" with me the most was ""Flawless Theory"". Seriously, it's the best one I've heard on an Endless title (and I own all of them, actually). FlyByNo is an amazing, underrated artist, and he's on the pantheon of the Gods of making good OSTs alongside Stephen Rippy & Kevin Mcmullan and the guys that made the one for Kingdom Come Deliverance",1585571906,1585571906,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

That can't be right. Are you telling me 90% of players can't even win a game against AI?

Fine whatever.
I say, this game gave one of the best first impression I experienced from space-oriented games, the very first moment you colonize a planet, you see the animated CGs of planet surface showing 'never before seen' species of life and its ecosystem which gave you much thrill and excitement. Like, hmm, it's big galaxy out there. Some factions are especially interesting and deserves a movie of its own, like Riftborn for example. The lore of the unique planets are intriguing and igniting your curiosity. The gameplay focus broadly on the matter of things without having you do manual stuff like controlling fleets, or assign build orders (which can becomes tedious as you have more to manage the longer you play), is a good example other games can learn from.

But just like any other game, it also has its own bs. These stuff doesn't have replay value at all, for me at least. Just one game and it becomes too repetitive and boring since you have read all these stuff already. And in late game there's this ""coopetitive academy quests"" which team you up with other empires doing stupid things like Find this planet, Orbit this planet for X turns, I mean, aren't we supposed to just get to the point and finish up our opponents? You can't really ignore these nonsensical shiits either, since it gives ridiculous advantages. The academy thingy is probably the worst that could happens to this game. The ship designs too is a problem. Original designs are way too weak and ineffective, if you redesign these ships, it could be 2-3 times stronger and literally blazing through enemy fleets. AI seems to always retreat when they predicted a defeat from engagement, but retreating cost 60% of its HP, so if you have one strong fleet, you can easily defeat hundred if not thousand of their ships without even a scratch. The AIs NEVER offer any good trade terms, you could be sieging enemy capital and all their bases are about to fall and they would offer something like ""Hey bro, will you accept peace in exchange for 12 dust waters?""... 12 DUST WATERS? Is that how much your homeland worth? And they don't do this just once, but almost every turns, like ""If not 12 dust waters, how about 2 titaniums, bro?""... Come on, maybe give me an excommunicate option so they stop pestering me with these bs. But that's not the most ridiculous yet, even when they're going to be obliterated you will see peace offer like ""We want peace, but only if you give X Y Z technologies."" They must be on a drug of some sort. Certain factions also love demanding shiits from you, ""GIMME 3000 DUST NAW"" and after you refused it for a while they will go like ""You didn't attack us, we have thought of you wrong. (State changed from Hostile -> Wary)"" and these could go on forever until you beat them out of existence. 

But yeah, you can still get some good experiences, I think it deserves a try.
I forgot to mention the little search box in tech tree page is kind of useful, I like that.

Pros:
Some really unique race ideas that are still balanced (at least somewhat) as well as more generic races for people who prefer to play normally

The AI is setup to think and act based on what type of philosophy their race uses giving them a personality factor that is often missing.  This unfortunately is somewhat of a con too which I'll get into later

System/Planet design where your choices have impact while still keeping the things to track to a minimum so you aren't staring blankly at some over complicated mess for hours on end.  4 main production types, 6 types of minerals (2 for each tier), and an assortment of trade goods that can be used/sold to boost the 4 main production types or provide some extra special effects.

Ship editor that once again allows you to make relevant design decisions while not bogging you down too much.  You have base designs intended for offense, support, exploration, etc and pick your armor types, weapon types, and support modules.

Plenty of win conditions to aim for depending on your play style

Really good soundtrack w/ themes that fit both the space theme idea as well as the theme of the races.

Cons:
The AI is stupid which in turn leads to most of the other cons.

Combat is more or less non-existant.  Whichever said is weaker retreats and loses half hp, if they are already less than 60%hp or have no escape route they are instantly destroyed.  It sounds simple, but the AI is bad at it and will sacrifice fleets left and right because they don't blob their army enough.

Combat part 2 is ground combat and yup the AI is bad at that too.  You can send your soldiers to their death (AIs preferred method) and slowly chip away at defenses, sit around in orbit bombarding defenses for 20+ turns only for a truce to end the war before you capture anything (AI likes this too), or build a support fleet w/ bombardment upgrades to cripple defenses in 4-5 turns (players choice).  Since they can't drive your main fleet out of their system due to above issues, there is little the AI can do to counter your bombardment fleet from taking planet after planet from them.  The only thing that saves the AI is the empire size mechanics (happiness penalty for overexpanding) makes it highly impractical for you to take their entire empire at once.

Science is well, needed as anybody would expect.  As you will notice when you take over the AIs planets, they generally have only the basic science facilities and thus low tech level which leads to weaker ships and in turn more retreats/lost ships and planets that they failed to defend.

AI personalities can get rather... extreme.  The humans are being portrayed as greedy expansionists and will pretty much always hate you for no reason then try to extort money and get madder when you refuse to be extorted.  This applies to several of the other more violent races as well.  The more passive races are much easier to get along w/ but have mood swings and can rotate between loving you and fearing you in the same turn even w/ no direct interaction with them.

Alliances exist which is always a good thing unless they are once again, dumb.  Win conditions are modified based on your alliance size and they won't really pull their weight unless you join up w/ an aggressive type w/ the goal of universal conquest.  The trader race can actually pull its weight for economy win, but that is due to the system upgrade design allowing anybody who properly builds their trade network to get rich.  Science race doesn't produce enough science, and the normal/passive races have no real focus and I wonder if they even are trying to win.

Overall it is a well designed game but somewhat easy due to the AI's poor choices.  You can ramp up the difficulty but that just gives them boosts to their various incomes allowing them to have a good head start but that is about it.  If you can survive the early game the AI's poor choices (especially science) will come back to haunt them later and let you overtake them.",1585104073,1585107009,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Different races are plagued by bugs where your quest might get stuck randomly.  This has been happening for a long time and never got fixed.

The addition of more expansions had no thought on balance.  Just rack on more stuff to do in a turn and call it a day.

A company like Amplitude can't get used to letting its modders fix their games.  Don't encourage these clueless people.  Just play it on a free weekend and if you like it, find an alternative place to download the game for ""free"".  No one plays online anyway.

Backsliding since the first game:
A lot of races are now DLC (15 bucks each) that were available in the original.
Huge performance requirement increase with little to no graphical improvements
Always-on DRM, has to connect to a server for a single player match.
Frequent, unpredictable crashes that become worse the longer a match goes on.
Developers seem a bit snootier than before with their marketing tactics

Good game but not better than the first Endless Space - better off playing that instead. 7/10

Put some more time into the game a year later and while some mechanics have changed the core flaws are still here. Game runs poorly even on an i7 / GTX 1060 with low settings, Recurring crashes, and it still feels like I bought half a game with the amount of content locked behind DLC.

Rather then cookie cutter style. If you like the idea of playing each match differently then you'll have to play another race each time. The game pushes you to play a certain race to their strengths or you WILL fall behind. I just didn't like that idea too much, and it takes time understand that for each race. I would recommend you pick one and stick with it until you understand them. If your new, I really recommend Empire as they're the most Cookie Cutter so to speak...
They do get boring pretty fast, but just use them to understand other mechanics of the game because they're faction is easy to understand. Other factions strengths are much MUCH harder to understand, so learning the mechanics will be VERY hard.


So... 200 hours later... Sigh.
This game goes threw lots of ""Re-balances""
These, actually completely un-balance the game... It is underwhelming and overwhelming and leaves something to be desired.
It makes me feel the DLC is a waste of money... The Races are OP and then they are Nerfed to the ground... Or to the point where the races are veryvery micro intensive and not casual friendly at all. If you want to get into playing a certain race, mainly the DLC ones, you have to play hours and start over and hours again to understand them so you can stand a chance on serious or endless. and if you play anything lower it's just not fun.
 more like a galaxy building simulator this game that.
Hissho mainly are just.... confusing. You have to build Tall now, you have to really focus and grind down. You can push out 28CP fleets PER TURN. however this requires lots of planing and multiple things to be working. You have to play the same way over and over with them, there is only one way to play and leave them boring to play.
I had hopes for this game I really did and keep coming back sad knowing I wasted hours playing this and feeling like I wasted my money. I have so much more to say but I don't want to say anything more, just try the game yourself and see if you like it.

Pros: 
-Very clean UX
-Looks Gorgeous

Cons:
How you interact with the games interface. 
Many things are hidden and don't have consistent behavior such as quests, where you are required to travel to a system to accomplish something but they only give you the location on certain notifications. 
When you have a fleet selected but you move the screen  you cant click on the image and be recentered on the units [b]like in every other strategy game ever[/b].
When you want to transfer population it only gives you list of systems but fails to show you which systems have a pop shortage basically making that mechanic unusable after a few systems. 
Theses are to name just a few. But there were tons of other small user interactions that sucked, like only getting data on something when you hover over it but you can't click on it and have the data stay in a screen for you to read. You can only hover over 99% of thing. It was very jarring since every strategy game i have every played allows you to click on a unit or item of interest that has stats and see what those are those are in a mini screen like starcraft2 or Sins of a solar empire. Its like they don't want you to think too much about anything or compare anything too closely. 
Now if it was just the above I would totally still recommend the game but its not.
Now for my two biggest complaints.
[b]YOU HAVE A LIMIT ON HOW MANY PLANETS YOU CAN CONTROL[/b].
Who thought that was a good idea? I am playing a game in space that is on a galactic scale but I can only control [b][u]10 planets out of 100's[/u][/b] This has got to be the most unstatisfying   game mechanic in any 4x game i have ever played.  Its closes to being as bad as the last endless space, where you had to have a certain type of influence to go to war, if you didn't have that you were stuck in limbo even if their influence was killing your faction. Which leads me to the next stupid thing. 
[b]You can instantly lose planets through influence[/b]. [u]What a terrible idea[/u].
Influence and borders make perfect sense. But to make it so without any military vessels your planets just flips is dumb and overly simplistic and a coop out. Especially since it happened while I had a large fleet in the system. I could get behind it if it allowed the invader not to have to fight a ground war since the population would just surrender but to not even have any control or way to fight it?! Devs what were you thinking? I want to conquer the galaxy not get too big and have no way to counteract those repercussions through research or military and then once my approval drops my influence drops and my systems start dropping like flies. That is a terrible mechanic. 

The game was really fun until I got to this point. Its breaks the experience so bad  I don't think I can play it anymore just like the first one.

I guess the lesson, is I shouldn't have expected this to be any different than the first one.

If anyone knows how to get rid of planet limits per empire through a mod it might actually make the game fun enough to try again.

Until that point I would avoid this like the coronovirus.

Edit: So with some googling I found a way to change the penalty in one of the games xml files and it worked to lower the penalty. I will try this out and maybe I'll revise my review.",1582520478,1582590984,False,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

Primarily this is designed for multiplayer not single player.  I played through one campaign completely but won't be doing another. So not bad enough to abandon but no brilliant about turn to rescue the game play as things developed.

The AI is ... adequate, although more artificial than intelligent; diplomacy is weak and restricted (some diplomatic reactions seem to have no bearing on how much the empire likes/hates you and some negotiations flagged as acceptable are never going to be accepted for ...reasons?).  Ground combat, the only way to capture enemy systems, is a painful drawn out experience (Attacker and Defenders fight using their total empire army strength in a battle of attrition over several turns, troop losses impact other battles the other side of the map; troops only replenish at an unbelievably slow rate prohibiting more invasions until they are replenished).  

Random quests pop up periodically that are more irritation than excitement and have no bearing on where you are or what you are doing.

There are an awful lot of delay mechanisms to pad the game out and stop you doing anything too fast.

The UI is a bit strange in places and the tutorial misses a lot.  Once you get the hang of it, it's OK but a bit clunky and inconsistent across some screes and it is not as intuitive as you would expect, even if you've played a number of these types of games. Having developed  tanks for ground combat it took ages to find out why they were not appearing - eventually via Google as there wasn't anything in game I could find - you have to delve several levels down an obscure menu branch to set the composition of your empires forces to actually utilise them whereupon they magically appear. None of this build them and transport them rubbish you get in other games.

There are far better products out there , many of which are (much) older. The original Endless space was more fun for me..",1582563239,1582563239,False,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

The greatest thing about the Endless Space 2 is the music. It is just so ridiculously amazing and atmospheric that even though the rest of the game is good, the soundtrack takes the lead.

After this comes the world - lore, history and story consistency. Amplitude has built a solid foundation in the Endless universe, and continues its storytelling in the Endless Space 2. 

Related to this is the faction diversity, which along with the world differentiate the Endless series from other games. Races in this game are not a random permutation of the same thing, like it often is in 4X games, or strategies in general. With a few exceptions, each faction plays dramatically different than the others.

El juego base ofrece 8 civilizaciones, 4 de ellas básicas (los humanos, Horatio, Sophons, Lumeris) dos intermedias para jugadores experimentados (Unfallen, Zeta) y dos avanzadas (Cravers, Vodyani), lo suficientemente diferentes y desafiantes para romper una posible (aunque improbable) monotonía. Cada partida es única, en una galaxia generada por semilla en la que varios oponentes controlan diferentes sistemas estelares y, como es costumbre en este género, compiten entre sí para alcanzar diferentes tipos de victoria.

El jugador debe administrar ciertos detalles de su imperio interplanetario, desde el partido político dominante (que orientará la civilización a una serie de beneficios y un estilo de juego particular) hasta los ciudadanos que votan por estos partidos, cada raza con sus preferencias políticas y de hábitat particulares. Aunque es un juego por turnos, se siente la expectativa del despliegue de las votaciones, así como de la creación de nuevas estructuras o eventos aleatorios en la galaxia, gracias a una dirección de arte muy pulida y limpia. La interfaz es muy agradable de usar (aunque muy rara vez algunos clicks no se registran bien y es necesario hacerlos un par de veces más) y la música es adecuada, aunque quitarla y reemplazarla por melodías de elección personal queda a discreción de cada quien, especialmente si se juegan partidas muy largas.

Endless Space ofrece, como su nombra lo indica, un sinfín de posibilidades y estilos de juegos, y le da bastante libertad a los usuarios de crear sus propias civilizaciones y modos de juego. Además de que el juego vanilla tiene muchas variables y perillas para calibrar, es bastante mod-friendly y cuenta con una comunidad activa y entusiasta creando contenido de manera constante. 

En menos de una semana me capturó y registré, casi sin darme cuenta, poco menos de 80 horas de juego. No tuve la oportunidad de probar el modo multijugador, aunque debo intuir que de hacerlo multiplicaría bastante esa cifra.

The instruction and information notes are really helpful. 
Also pretty addictive gameplay too.

The auto space battle camera feature is a bit turn off, felt a bit disoriented about where the ships are. But at least they have other camera views, the 3D models of the ships are fine but battle effect especially when ship was blown could be a bit better, it makes the ships felt like plastic when it is blown
The ground battle visual effect is also quite bad compared to the rest part of the game.

If you expect any form of interaction between you, the player, and your fleets other than where they go, then this game might not be for you.

The mechanics are extremely similar with a few non-controlling factors. This is a turn-based strategy, science fiction 4X game, that is simple and it did somethings wonderfully and still has some things that needs work on. Let's get started: 
PROS
Presentation: It is refined and a beautiful cinematic game, each object, planet, minion, leaders, all of it. Sounds, Colors, and a lot of hard work went into the game  Done with high fantasy result looks and feels. Gorgeous
Simple: The Tutorial and mechanics to the game are easy to pick up. There is a learning curve, but its support makes the game extremely easy to follow and understand. My 10-year-old is in awe.
Controls: It has smooth controls and wonderful fantasy faction’s representation. Each faction has its pluses and minuses and truly can be fun to try.
Aesthetics: The ships are wonderful to view and easy to move around the system. If you like micro managing your empires resources, customizing ship weaponry, and civilization tasks. It has it all...but (See Cons 2-4)
Multiple forms: Very easy multi player set up and outcomes. You can play alone, with friends or enemies.
CONS
Paths: This is Endless Legend, but with streamlined functions that hurt its overall concept. It's diplomacy, system and the fact that it really becomes a race of tech and building more than strategy. You still micro manage, but it becomes more about correct selecting than actual strategy. Matching the correct buildings to the planet's strengths become a factor.  
Combat: The Battle system is beautiful to watch, but that is all you do. Is watch. You make pre-selective choices and watch the results. It is like Birth of the Federations battle system were u make a choice, and then watch. This is crippling to those who like to be part of the battle action. Make choices in battles to change outcomes. It is a cinema. In multiplayer this cinema function will not be used since I doubt in massive multi-player games they select seeing them. 
Diplomacy: Still an issue in these type games though graphically fine. How do you make Diplomacy a game in itself instead of ""You're in my way"" war? It becomes more about just building up and defeating a faction then actual diplomacy tactics. This function of the game will need the most upgrading to down the line. 
Ships- (Pro and Con) Your not actually crafting, or mutating your ships, simply improving on specific classes that get exploited in specific designs. 
Politics: Political affiliations are lost in game. A function to me that had no real end game purpose. You must monitor this because ignoring it could lead to rebellion and an internal mess, but a function of the AI deterring you. Again, may turn off players or it may not. 
Ground Battles: The lack of definition makes the ground battles look under developed. They come off cheap in appearance as a fast outcome. All the effort in the space battles but the ground battles are underwhelming. This should be more defined to the races, have better effects, graphics and feel to make it two solid combat systems-space and ground, instead of one. The execution is fine for number percentage outcomes, but it distances the player not drawn him in. Shame they never improved this. 
Final Thoughts: Hopefully they continue to build and add to it, but after all the dlc content. Endless Space will give you a lot for the price.  It is a game off obstacles than strategy. Those who love Endless Legend, will love Endless Space, but may feel that functions they got used to in Endless Legend, do not offer anything further. It is a stunning gorgeous game. It will keep you invested, but at the end. You may feel not fully satisfied. I strongly advice you look at the computer specs to playing this, low end machines may have difficulties with the high-quality  of Endless Space 2. See the VIDEO above discussions to preview the game play prior to buying. Endless Space 2 , along with the DLC content is truly a massive grand game that does a lot right. The template is there for them to continue to escalate. Final GRADE 4.1 stars out of 5.",1509471734,1580236613,True,223,15,0.782645881175994873,16,True,False,False

Though some information windows need to be animated for the coolness & immersion factor.
But I have a HUGE problem with this game.  I don't feel immersed into the game because of so much reading.
If I wanted to read this much, I would just actually pick up a book and read that book instead of doing it in a game.
Come on..!!  We are now in 2020, there is no reason for anyone to read large amounts of texts in a game in 2020 gaming,
when in fact we have such a huge selection of technology in this day in age with text to speech and large amounts of voice packs available companies can just use that to get some sort of immersion into the game.
Yes I know the game was created in 2017, but there is something that's called ""Updates"" that can update the game.
So there is no excuse.
Again, much of the game is beautiful visually, but there is no immersion in this game.
I spent a few hours in the game, and already got bored. Though there were a few things that was interesting.
But overall, boredom kicked in as I felt drained by so much reading as a new player.
I didn't feel immersed, my brain hurts from so much reading, so I got bored.

visually the game looks cool, though some areas need more visual work and also visual immersion.
I still recommend the game for those who love exploration and space type games.",1580222018,1580222018,True,0,0,0.471045613288879395,0,True,False,False

If you're like me then you've been contemplating which of these intriguing looking galaxy sandbox games to get. Well it's actually pretty easy, get them both.
The beauty of Endless Space is, that it's kind of like Stellaris but at the sime time different enough from it to offer a new and unique experience. 
In Endless Space you have amazing UI, granted it looks like it was crafted from Win 10's store in how minimalistic it looks, but it navigates superbly. You can easily access systems and planets with just the mousewheel, it's so simple yet so complete at giving you all the information at first glance that you need, whilst in Stellaris it requires a little bit more UI digging.

Anyway, back to the point, how are the games different from each other whilst also feeling similar at the same time? 
Well, Stellaris is for when you go full on ham in a sandbox setting, wanna play a capitalistic gekko trading empire? 
You can in Stellaris but not in ES2.
ES2 you have have sort of pre-fixed races / factions, but they all come with amazing quests and storytelling.
Every race plays differently, so you will have to tackle completely different ways of Empire development. Though I'd say depending on the Race you play, it is obvious from the start which win condition would be the best suited for your campaign.
Battles are nicely animated in 3D so you can watch epic space battles unfold and see your ship upgrades in action.

One last thing to keep in mind, this is turn based, like CiV / Total War. Whilst Stellaris plays in real time. I definitely recommend this to Stellaris fans, if you're burned out from that game but still want a 4x game in space which offers a similar level of depth.
However, there seems to be no manual combat from what I've observed, so dont get your hopes up for a Total War + Stellaris epic proportions of grand strategy.

However the combat is really just a ""sit back and watch"" experience. That aside I normally dislike turn based games but I can say I really have enjoyed my first few hours of gameplay. 

Also as a bonus there are a TON of DLC's for this game to keep you busy and they usually become really cheap on a sale. picked up the whlole game + DLC's for about $15 NZD, great value.

Exploration isn't interesting at all : you never encounter surprising phenomenon and the events are all the same one game after another.

Combat is boring as hell : it is a simple card game, and i'm not telling that because of the actual card system, but because this is what combat actually is. It's all about playing the right ship with the right equipment to beat the enemy. When you encounter a new enemy, switch equipment. It's all about choosing the right counter against your opponent. Feels like playing Yu-Gi-Oh.

The UI is absolutely stunning, no arguing about that, but it is confusing. For example, the research screen is a pain in the ass to understand as a new player, you have no idea what you should research because there is no clear categorization. You'll find food technologies in the ""empire development"" section alongside new ship hulls or diplomacy tech. Wouldn't it be more logical to find those food tech in the Economy part of the tree?

There is no feeling of vastness or epicness. The galaxy feels cramped and artificial. 

It is probably a good strategy game but it definitely isn't a good 4X. You don't feel like you're leading a galactic empire, you feel like you're sitting at a table in front of a board game, moving pieces in turn.

tl;dr : shouldn't be labeled as a 4X, this is a pure strategy game. Probably a good one but I hate strategy games and I really regret buying this one.",1579516751,1579516943,False,2,0,0.506881058216094971,0,True,False,False

It continues the lore from the previous games in the Endless series, taking off many years (possibly centuries) after the events on Auriga in Endless Legend. This game is steeped in deep lore, interesting story-telling and unique factions. 

Unlike many other 4X games, but much like previous Endless games, each faction plays almost entirely differently. From the 'Dust' (money)-obsessed Lumeris, who can literally buy entire uncolonised star systems then trade them for their gain to the world-devouring Cravers - who get bonus yields from every planet they inhabit and use slave labour to improve this even further... at the expense of slowly destroying the systems they inhabit leading them to go to war to find new systems to gobble up.  This is just two of the interesting factions that provide unique gameplay unseen in any other 4X franchise. This is not even to mention the Gene-splicing Horatio, the influence-hording Empire, the science-obsessed Sophons, the pacifistic mobile trees of the Unfallen and the machine-lifeforms the Riftborn and many other factions available through DLC, each with unique, interesting mechanics.  If this weren't enough - you can even make your own custom factions (created via a point-buy system, where positive traits cost and negative traits provide extra points to spend elsewhere). The amount of content in this game is massive!

It isn't just the different race play-styles that make this game great. There is a serious amount of depth to the game's population management, law management, trade confederations, system-level improvements etc. that give the game a vast amount of stuff to dig into for those into heavier games, while still not being too difficult to scratch the surface of for novices to 4X games. 

The multiple mechanics in this game can make for a bit of a steep learning curve, for sure - especially to those unfamiliar with the 4X genre. However, the varied factions allow people with different play-styles to each get into the game in their own way, and the in-game tutorials will make good suggestions to novices so they can learn to play the game. There are also 7 difficulty levels and multiple ways to edit the map scripting to keep the game replayable for people of all levels of experience. 

Overall, I would say that this game is a must-play for those who are already interested in the 4X genre, and is definitely worth at least an attempt to play by those looking for something different - especially if you can do so during the many 'free-trial weekends' that Amplitude provide for their games every so often to let people put their toes in the waters before committing to a purchase.",1579437124,1579437124,True,3,0,0.545454561710357666,1,True,False,False

I've put almost a hundred hours into the game, and started multiple games, but I haven't been able to finish a single game yet becasue the game hangs or crashes randomly when advancing to the next turn.  You can reload a recent saved game, and it always crashes at the same turn, desite making different decisions in-game.  Some games it crashes early, some it crashes right before you are set to win the game - it's seemingly random.

Pros: Clean, intuitive UI makes lots of eye candy easy to interpret. Beautiful soundtrack. Choice-and-consequence quests make your empire's path varied depending on the situation at hand. Nice art and atmosphere. AI can play really well with certain faction bonuses, like Cravers. Heroes are a fun way to augment your empire through fleet leaders or system leaders. Factions feel more different and unique in play style compared to your typical 4x like GalCiv or the MoO series. Curiosities make systems feel diverse and unique.

Cons: The tutorial was really helpful at times and so unhelpful at others. I didn't even know how to use probes to their full extent from start because that wasn't something it ever brought up (iirc). I ended up going to Google for help when I felt lost on a certain unexplained topic. Space and ground combat (invasion) can get tedious.

[list]
[*]The game is absolutely stunningly beautiful.

[*]All factions are very different to each other, and relatively balanced (of course some factions are going to be stronger than others, especially when mechanics surrounding them are so different, but it's satisfactory enough).

[*]Also, I would like to defend the DLC policy, which I've seen compared to Paradox's. Paradox makes it so that the DLCs have many different features for different people so that even if I'm not interested in one feature, I desperately need another one and thus am tempted to buy it. Also the games are made barren on purpose, so that there's something more to sell. Here the base game gives you a good enough time, that you don't really have the need to buy them to enjoy it. The problem with Paradox is that you need the DLCs for the game to be enjoyable, the problem here is that you can't have them. I haven't personally bought them, but the general opinion I've met with is that Supremacy changes the game into ""who can get Behemoths first"" contest, and Penumbra's hacking is annoying.

[/list]
On the other hand the game has some major problems. It's especially stupid, since many of those problems were already solved in other 4Xs:
[list]
[*]Bugs
Other people have mentioned them already. It's not that bad, I haven't yet encountered any game-breaking one, but they are numerous and annoying.

[*]AI
I expected nothing and I'm still disappointed. Declares wars that it has no chance of winning, it's almost impossible to get a satisfactory trade deal out of them. Also, diplo deals cost influence, which is better spent on pretty powerful act bonuses. One time, when I was wooping Cravers' asses, they would spam me a peace offer that meant me giving up all my resources every turn. Spams you with bullshit, for example when you get into a war with an empire, every other will tell you that it's looking forward to sneak attack you.

[*]RNG
Your starting position is to be or not to be in this game. If you have three or more colonizable planets in your home system as the Vodyani you can stop playing the game right now, because you've already won.

[*]Performance
I do play on a lower end computer, but I can't say I've had an issue with any other video game (even Stellaris ran relatively smoothly), except maybe for Total War. But it's just so slow! The AI has already moved, what are you processing exactly?

[*]Simultaneous turns
In Civ V the problem with simultaneous turns changing the turn-based game into a ""who dismisses all the popups first"" contest was mitigated by all players that are being at war having separate turns. There was still some bullshit regarding whoever gets to ruins first and surprise attacks, but hey at least they've done something about it. Here, whether your fleet will catch your enemy's fleet is decided by how quick your fingers are and if AI is going to spam you about how much it loves/hates/doesn't care about you.

[*]UI
I find it weird that I seem to be the only guy talking about this, but the UI is fucking atrocious. You can say it was designed by an artist, in a sense that isn't functional at all. Everything is too big for the screen. For example, the ship list is way too huge, especially in later games when you have 40+ ships in a fleet. But that's because the ships are presented as giant icons showing their beautiful artwork (where it's hard to tell different ship types apart at first glance and you rather read their names), instead of simply listing ""you have 20*Patrol, 5*Patrol3 and 1 Hero"" and hiding more detailed list showing which ships are damaged in a convenient button. You can't sort your fleets, to i.e. easily change type composition. Even something as simple as adding new ships to old ones is achieved by 4 clicks. Also, the animations take so long to fucking finish. For instance I want to quickly open up (way too big) science menu to quickly research techs that by this point I remeber by heart. I open it and have enough time to hover cursor over the zoomed out tech... and then it automatically zooms in. I could drone on and on, but those issues are in almost every menu.

[*]Ultimately however, all of those issues would be minor annoyances if it wasn't for the fundamental game design issue: the drag. 
You've won by turn 60. You can expand your sytems further, try to wage war, but what's the point? Every turn you're just going to perform mindless tasks, like reorganizing your fleets, building queues in your systems etc. But it's just so boring. In my one Riftborn play I even stopped researching technology and producing anything on systems so I could focus on getting a quick (yeah, ""quick"") conquest victory. I still only made it to turn 107, before trying out a new game. It's longest I've endured. So yeah, it may say that I've played 60 hours of this game, but I played only 30, and the other half I've waited. And the payoff never came.

The races are very different from each other, and you have to play them accordingly.  They do a nice job of forcing you trade-off between the advantages of different strategies.  

For example, some games make expansion everything, and is the be all and end all of 4X games, over effectively at the end of the expansion period.  In endless Space 2 expansion is powerfully important, but it is well balanced.  The penalty for over-expansion is simple (happiness penalty) which can be overcome but it is a simple and effective tool.

It is a hard game to learn well.  Unlike a game like Civilization, your tech choices at each point are overwhelming and going through which ones are needed is tough.  Some of the mechanics are not well explained.

The quests add a very nice spice to the game as well as the individualized ones for the different races.  One issue is that the academy quest is VERY powerful, fortunately there is an option to play without it; I've played both ways.

One race (Cravers) is very interesting in that they start out powerful by stripping resources from planets - but if they don't win early, they are in trouble.  Unfortunately if you tart next to them you are usually in trouble. 

Finally, battle graphics are very nice.

As in many 4X games, a key to wining on higher levels is micromanagement.  Building fleets with just the right support capabilities (as opposed to churning out the strongest ships) will make you stronger.  Moving populations to just the correct planet also is valuable.  This can be tedious.

Endless Space 2 is incredibly pretty and has an amazing Soundtrack. The actual gameplay however, is sadly a little too shallow for anybody that plays 4X regurarly. There are not many choices or tactical decisions to be made. Fights are won on the production layer, and not actually by any meaningful decision making on your part. The races are varied, but ultimately do their ""one"" thing and nothing else, meaning that you've basically seen all that is to see by playing them once.

The game is worth it if you approach it casually, or if you generally prefer playing at a relaxed pace, without having to invest much time. Or if the main thing you like in Space-4X is watching numbers grow and expanding your empire. If you actually want depth and high gameplay variation, I would recommend trying Stellaris instead.",1577758690,1577758690,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

-Has a lot of sales (Not really about the game but it's true.)

Of course, as you play more and more, you find certain patterns and techniques which make it easier or outright just 'do this enough and you win', but up until then- and even during, it's still a fun trip on the way there.

The diversity of factions and races is impressive, and they're always adding more- the cost of DLC isn't wallet-breaking, either, which is nice; I might even invest into them in the near future.
Each faction has its own special attributes which differ their playstyles- but you are still able to play your own way to a certain degree, and it's just fun.

I haven't had much trouble performance-wise; especially once I actually got a good computer, aha. Just pay attention to the hardware requirements and you'll be fine there.

Anyway, yes, I would recommend this game!
Bonus if you can get it while it's discounted, of course.

Deceptive in that at first glance it seems like a good game. SHOULD be a good game. I'm sure the overall score for this is positive. To be fair, I do not play multiplayer, and thus much of my railing is at the AI which not every player experiences. YMMV

Races are super unique and interesting, planetary anomalies are interesting the first couple times you run into them.

Research tree seems appropriate and balanced, I suppose.

The AI is just so so bad.

FFA game on Easy, me vs 5 computers, hand picked races that weren't as aggressive or powerful.

I played Horatio, so my race's main goal is expansion and growth. By turn 2 my second colony is gunning for a primo spot 3 planets south of home base. AI nabs it so I grab the planet one closer in.

I prioritize improvements with another colonizer ship further down the queue.

Same AI, Allatta, declares war, takes my colony, then truces and deuces after catching me with my virtual pants down. But now I'm pissed. the little corner of this galaxy I should have to my self is ALREADY being nibbled at. We stalemate while I completely overhaul fleet 3 times over before finally pushing Allatte out of my corner, but now I'm pissed. Dyl, the system in contention, my second system, gets taken and re-taken 6 or so times. My score is now lagging far behind because I'm spending all my resources throwing aluminum cans at a brick wall,
My one remaining explorer encounters Doria, the other Lumeris race on this map, all the way on the other side of the map, and for some reason instantly has a hard-on for me. This is maybe turns 45-60 but for at least 15 turns does she try something with diplomacy, whether it be asking for a truce after she attacked me and then lost 45 ships in the span of 2 turns, or the good old bureacratic imbroglio, etc. 

Diplomacy is fundamentally broken, and it ruins this game. I should say the AI Diplomacy game, maybe I just don't exploit it correctly, but I hate it, it's not intuitive at all, and really doesn't matter much since most races are programmed to act certain ways based on their relative strength (score) to yours. Both your interactions and standing matter of course, but the standing always seemed the stronger influence, even were I to trade large sums.

So about 100 turns pass before I finally have my full corner of the map going full steam, meanwhile countering Allatta's ally to the northeast of me, while Allatta herself still remains a thorn to my south.

My fleets are dominant but my foes have long since researched all the defensive improvements and let me tell you digging out an entrenched enemy from a system in this game is a CHORE. You will have a conveyor belt of fleets rotating back to your zone then to the system while your manpower gets drained at shocking rates, only to see your troops get slaughtered time and time again as the system ""Drafts"" another population away and keeps on chugging. 

But yester eve, my fine long-reading gentlemen, I ran afoul of the most awful act in gaming I've ever seen. You see at a certain point in this game I became rather unpopular with my people, due to vast overcolonization. Remember all that growth I wanted at the beginning? Now I was finding it, both in colonizing every last corner of the map only to prevent other would-be Portugal's trying to swipe up more of this region's South America. Little buggers from across the map would come in and jack a system completely away from their home system, literally surrounded on all sided by my systems, and expect to stay there? Not today.

After rooting out these roaches my vendetta against Allatta was almost complete. My score had finally crested hers and her fleets, I knew, must be fearful and tattered. My hatred had far outlast my people's. Some of my colonies had begun to rebel, the fools forgetting the trials and stunted progress of those early turns. Fools.

Finally, I begin to build an alliance with the Sophons. As the next strongest race, far enough away from me yet able to pester Allata. I decide to exact the last of my vengeance by taking 2 of Allata's systems. One for having been the largest nuisance from day 1, the second for it's store of Adamantium, which my empire desperately required.

Allatta, seeing the hammer of justice coming swiftly down on her, begs truce, with some favorable donations. DENIED.

The two systems persist, and Allatta comes bearing a new fleet, weapons and defenses altered to counter mine, wipe out my fleets and hold me off for another 20 or so turns. Once I get my carriers in place, however, the first of these systems of my desire comes into view. 
She begs truce. 
DENIED
I counter truce to include the two systems that I require.
DENIED
All at once it seems, I join in alliance with the Sophons, my carrier joins the fleet ready to kick ass, and I finally take the first of my needed systems, 
Then, suddenly:
I click the dialog for choices of what to do with my new-found system,
Immediately after it pops up, another alert takes it's place. 
Apparently I've accepted a truce with Allatta. WHAT?
The next screen confirms the betrayal. The Sophons, my allies, have somehow forced my hand. Not only did I accept a truce (!!!!!) on my behalf WITHOUT MY PERMISSION, THEY GAVE ALLATTA HER SYSTEM BACK,
YOU KNOW, THE ONE I HAD SPENT 190 TURNS TRYING TO ACQUIRE????????
WHY, SOPHONS
WHY DID YOU ACCEPT THIS TRUCE!!!
IS THIS LEVEL OF BACKSTABBING A FUCKING FEATURE
seriously I was flabbergasted, and I knew I was done playing this game FOREVER.
I just declared war on everyone and clicked through another turn or two but I'm literally uninstalling and probly never touching this developer again.
also it was Christmas day
I know I'm just bad but good grief whatever ridiculous circumstances caused the AI to act this way, it's like they don't actually expect anyone to finish a single game.

Still difficult to get into. It's strange, as I love the 4X genre and this game is beautifully made. Great graphics and UI, pretty deep gameplay (at least in theory) and races that are very different. However, it gets boring fast, at least for me. 

I think the tech tree has something to do with it, I just kept randomly clicking techs. There's maybe too much choice there in the beginning and not enough to distinguish yourself later, as you mostly research everything. The same for the buildings, I just made everything everywhere (with a few exceptions). The combat looks nice, but I found myself skipping over watching it very fast. Quests are mostly not very interesting and I found myself skipping over the text as well. Where in Stellaris I did read it. So then, what's left? Not enough to keep my attention. 

Besides several pluses I already mentioned, I did enjoy the ground combat aspect, although it tends to drag on too long if you don't prepare well for it. But it makes it hard to conquer a planet, giving you time to send in more ships, giving you some strategic choices.

To round up... it's strange, but this game is definitely not for me. I wish there was a maybe button, but alas...",1577300366,1577300425,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Battles are quite stupid, there is not much control in there, besides selecting ""tactic"" that doesn't seem to do any difference. 
Ship designer is a bit overwhelming due to number of modules available, at the end I just ended up using auto design and rolling with it. 

No story in single player whatsever. Each race you play, you will get exactly same quests.

Hopefully I'm not alone in the love for watching beautiful dog fights.

As for the game, certain actions can be tedious but that's the nature of this kind of game (building up each planet late game gets tedious--a template to apply to all new planets or to acquired planets (from war, diplomacy, etc) would be helpful to reduce some of the clicking.

The map/navigation system, the philosophy of development, and combat is very boring. These may seem like minor contrivances but they make a tremendous impact on the game. All 4 of the Xs in 4X, the paths from which we derive joy in this genre, are rendered lifeless and boring.

Exploration can be exciting, your first game or two. It amounts mostly to clicking on hyperlanes and then ticking some turns by until the ships reach their destination. When they arrive the planets are presented in fairly cinematic fashion but after the first few times, this is boring. Expansion is slow and doesn't feel all that rewarding, just increasing your resource income and adding another place to build ships. The ideas on outpost growth are interesting but in practice are quite boring. 

Exploitation is really where it starts going down hill. 'Buildings' are handled on a system wide basis and offer bonuses to all planets across the board or based on planet characteristics. Sounds cool but it isn't. It's boring af. You are just filling your build queues with the same buildings over and over, if you get extra bonuses you're happy but, if not, you are still building them. When you finish them, they just disappear into the void. There is no visual difference between a highly developed system and a brand new one. Finally, extermination. As many have said, combat is boring. You have no control and the ""cards"" offer more or less meaningless differences. Ground combat is not well handled either, it's a war of attrition over multiple turns. In particular, pirates and their bases are silly. If you don't focus manpower and fleet strength in the first ~30 turnsyou will find yourself with a pirate stronghold right next to the home syte, which your entire (fledgling but still an) empire cannot beat on the ground. I hate it but cant bear to turn pirates completely ""off"".

Your actions either have no tangible impact, or that impact is so banal that you have to ask yourself, ""why continue?"". A planet conquered is just another production queue that keeps bugging you every few turns as your ""fleets"" (actually just a single indistinct ship models) boost further down a straight off white line from one indistinguishable cluster of planets to another. You arn't making meaningful choices when sending out colony ship beyond, ""do I have the tech to colonize this planet-type?"". Etc

Any of these things individually or even collectively in a better game would be ok but something about this game is just BORING. It has fairly interesting races, great art, unique setting (amongst space 4x) but yeah, I would not recommend this. I love Endless Legend so I don't knock the studio. I mostly play Civ, paradox grand strategy, CIV BE, etc so 4x is my jam but this doesn't butter the bread. I will keep trying tho, and i'm sure I will quit runs that are going just fine because ultimately its boring.

It's a great game with fantastic depth and complexity that still manages to remain accessible via its wonderfully crafted user interface. However, the bulk of the game's challenge comes from keeping on top of everything your empire is doing and this can leave you with the taste that the game is more work than fun.

By illustration, every turn you need to be asking yourself ""which laws do I have active? Are they still benefitting me? Are there others I could be using? Should I redesign some of my ships to adapt to recent developments? Do I need to modernise my fleets or construct new ones? Where are my heroes assigned and do they still need to be there? Are the populations on my planets optimised to give the best yields vs approval? What yields do I care about to make those optimisations? Should I adjust the build order in this system? Should I move some population from this system to another? Should I be boosting one of my population's effects/growth rates with resources? What research am I going to be queuing next? Is that research REALLY a priority or can it wait? If I do this research then how soon can I start to benefit from it? What am I doing with my surplus of X resource? Should I sell it to the market? If I bought some resources from the market then how could I use them to improve my position now? Where am I colonising next? What kind of treaties should I be discussing with my neighbours? Have I sent a scout round my neighbour's empire recently to check what they're up to? Have I contacted the minor faction races to continue adjusting my reputation with them? Should I be assimilating one of them at this point?""

You're constantly barraged by decisions like these that you [i]need[/i] to be keeping on top of in order to run your empire anything close to effectively. As an individual game progresses and your empire expands then you'll also gain more heroes, new technologies will open up more options, the galaxy's political situation will shift and you'll inevitably find your grasp of all the nuances of your empire slipping away as you desperately try and keep an eye on everything. I often find my late game positions becoming a case of ""I hope I reach a victory condition before the AI realises it can take advantage of my floundering state, and I pray the optimisations I made earlier in the game are enough to ensure I'm not outpaced by an AI empire doing another victory condition"" because, frankly, I'm utterly swamped in things to consider and optimise at that point.

It's worth stating that I do love the game, the factions are unique and interesting to play (very different to the largely beige cast of nations in the Civ series), the lore behind the quests is wonderful, the UI is insanely well thought out (easily some of the best interface design I've ever seen) and the overall feel of the game is excellent. However, actually playing the game is exhausting, so much so that I often find I can only play in 10 turn stints before I'm frazzled from the endless management decisions you're making every single turn.

By comparison to Endless Legend, I think EL is a little better overall but they're vastly similar games even down to the kinds of buildings you can construct and similarities between the races - if you liked EL then it's probably only worth getting ES2 if you want a space theme instead of fantasy. By comparison to the Civ series of games then ES2 is vastly more challenging as there's just so much more to consider on a turn-by-turn basis. For example, in Civ you can get away with queuing up a relatively vague research order without too much of a plan and it likely won't punish you for a lack of foresight, but your empire in ES2 will flounder a lot against the AI even on relatively easy difficulties if you get sidetracked with research into tech that you're not planning to make use of once you've researched it, which is easily done with so many interesting and powerful techs on the tech web. ES2 is pacier than the Civ series as well with games being 250 turns on standard speed (compared to Civ's 500), which means you get to the juicy mid and end games a lot sooner. This pacing explains why research choices are so meaningful because you're going to be hitting powerful mid game techs much faster so going back to spend 8 turns picking up a crucial combat tech you need for a sudden war can really put you behind as a lot can happen in those 8 turns you're waiting.

Overall, absolutely brilliant game and a real front-runner for challenging 4x gameplay that doesn't compromise itself to enable the theme it's trying to convey (I always felt Stellaris made itself easy to play in order to sell the theme of running an empire to the player). Be prepared to work for your entertainment with it though, it's not an easy meal.",1568395214,1576448832,True,4,0,0.52507472038269043,0,True,False,False

Not only the DLC was released with quite a lot of BUGs, but also added some new bugs.
The team attention is only to fix nakalim's bugs atm, not caring much about other factions.

The bugs are not game breaking but they ruin my experience of playing the game, like Sophons, Lumeris and Riftborn laws from quest reward not appearing anymore or the mining probes stacking their lifetime...

5 out of my 7 play through had a BUG that ruins it for me. I will change my review when I can play the faction I like without encountering any bugs

Edit: 1 month after the release they only fixed Nakalim and academy related issues and not even all of them. 
The game still unplayable.


Edit 2: The game is good, the company is bad. Never buy their product on release date, rather wait for sale. they release games with plenty of bugs and fix them after months, (or don't fix them at all.)  EL is the best choice from their games, it has a community patch that solve most of the issues of the game. EL2 still waiting to be fixed after 3 months.

Every faction plays uniquely, the presentation is bar-setting, and the quest system adds an excellent element of both narrative and strategy that pushes the game from being ""just"" a rock-solid space 4X to the kind of setting that you want to see made into an expanded universe a la Star Wars.

My only gripe is that the game does a poor job of explaining the role of your military and how battles work. Fleet battles and planetary conquest are segregated - even if you completely eliminate an enemy's navy, it doesn't mean you can just take planets without resistance, since the ground battle is it's own ballgame. It's nowhere near a deal-breaker - any YouTube tutorial will sort you right out. 

On a complexity scale, it plays much more like a hex tile 4X such as Civ than it does a grand strategy games like Stellaris or EU4. It's sparse nodes instead of continuous tiles, but it's turn based, systems are improved much like cities are in Civ, and so on and so forth. That said, if you'd actually prefer a straight up ""Civ-clone"", you'll get way closer with Endless Legend, a different Amplitude game.

You play in a galactic map (that you can configure to your liking), explore and develop your tech until you eventually bump into other civilizations and have to start managing your relationship with them, securing your borders, hubs, commercial paths, etc. 
If you loved the first game, but struggled with some aspects, as the overly aggressive AI, Endless Space 2 is your clear choice, as it offers a far more polished, evolved and rewarding experience.

It is not that the game looks different from others but the genuine feeling while playing it is what makes this game great for me. Additionally the entire Endless Universe from Auriga to Space has such a beautifully told story and makes it really easy to dive into the Universe. tl;dr Great game from a great studio, give it a chance it wont dissappoint!

* The faction you play doesn't feel unique, with only a couple of minor mechanical changes which make you better at some things (a better archer), but not like you have unique abilities (no ranged units at all, instead being replaced with fast moving melee units).
* In general they don't provide a strong narrative and culture for you to base your understanding of your race and hence interactions off of, usually requiring one to use emergent events (and usually there are rarely enough events for you to get a strong feeling of this).
* Factions start with all of their unique abilities and access to their unique mechanics.
* Factions have no reactive customization to the game they are in.

Endless space solves these problems. Every faction in Endless Space feels like and is a unique faction. Most of them *completely replace* core mechanics of the game with their own. One faction doesn't have population growth mechanics (They have to produce them like they would buildings). One faction doesn't have food, they instead have to abduct people. These are not even the most interesting mechanics of those two factions, but we can see now how both of these factions are effecting/replacing the same mechanic (how you get population) in completely different ways.

But they also have important narrative adventures (in addition to the ones found throughout the galaxy) that provide benefits to their faction that is unique to their faction. This allows their faction to gain benefits over time and react to the configuration of the other factions in the game. These well written adventures also provide a powerful insight into the factions politics and culture, and feed into their unique themes.

All of this coupled with a beautiful UI, and strong implementations of common core 4x mechanics: research web makes research decisions feel very important, the politics system touches every decision you make while rarely being restrictive or punishing, a ship design system that allows various builds depending on your strategic situation, populations that feel meaningful while not being too complex, and so on.

The only notable detriments are the combat system, there is no tactical combat, it's always a quick combat mechanic (even if you watch it resolve) but the strategic cards still make it feel somewhat tactical. But not everyone will like the combat system. The other detriment are the expansions, they often add new mechanics rather than just new factions (the new factions manipulating the new mechanics) over time this has caused the new mechanics to outshine the original ones, and the old factions feel divorced from them (and of course new factions are usually too powerful at first). It's starting to be a problem for me, and overall the support of the studio is sporadic at best.",1574973877,1574973877,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Overall, I didn't find it to have much to keep me coming back. It can best be described as a dumbed-down version of Stellaris or Masters of Orion.

There is a bit of a campaign in the game, which serves mostly as a long tutorial. Once you start a game against the AI, this is where the game should shine. I often felt like it just fell flat. The technology tree is identical regardless of your race selection. This is a huge shame. The only real difference is in what the ships look like on the map and in battles. Every game seems to revolve around rushing to certain technologies in order to build up nearly identical ships so you can fight the enemies and take over. There is little difference between the races for replayability.

One of the DLCs, or maybe it's an expansion, adds a hacking mechanic to the game. I hated everything about it. I never really understood how to use it or what the benefit was. I also never really saw a major game advantage in using it unless I needed to sabotage the production or research of a specific enemy. The entire system felt like micromanagement at its worst.

There are some pirates dotted about the galaxy that provide an annoyance. You can hire them (and so can your enemies) to go out and kill themselves against another player. Either they were too powerful (very early in the game) or too weak (any time during the mid and late game). They always seemed more of a nuisance than a true threat or strategic opportunity.

Combat is lacking. There is a sort of binary decision between using energy or kinetic weapons. If you have all energy weapons, you won't do well against enemies with energy defense. The reverse is also true. The combat screens are flashy but otherwise unremarkable. There is little in the way of tactics to the fights, you just line up and follow weird 2d paths and hope you out range the opponent or stay in range if you use close-up weaponry. The ground battles are even less interesting. Here, you just send troops down to a planet and either you have more troops or you lose. The tactics are even more limited than in space combat.

The ultimate weapons in the game, Behemoths, can be turned into defensive shields around individual systems, super weapons to launch from long distances, or military assault ships that have a lot of hit points and do a lot of damage. They are not really very interesting. If you have more or better ships, you usually win. Again, tactics aren't that important. Proceeding to take over the rest of the galaxy is mind-numbing and boring.

In the end, I didn't find all that much of interest. Some of the race-specific abilities are kind of fun (like one race that can warp instantly between any of their bases.) Overall, though, Endless Space 2 has an end and it arrives way too early.",1574883253,1574883253,False,26,1,0.679632782936096191,5,True,False,False

For those that are familiar with the franchise, you'll find everything you've come to expect from the previous titles. To those that are new, things you'd expect are excellent story telling that makes each faction, minor faction feel unique. Fleet customization, deep tech trees, and a whole host of upgrades/improvements means every game will feel different.

The game itself is your basic 4X game, eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, and eXterminate. You'll start the game with a gorgeous introduction of your faction, setting the tone for the rest of the story. Every faction has their own quest line, in addition to the ones that affect all the players. So, while you might be pursuing your faction's quest, there might be a game wide quest where everyone is competing for another goal. This sometimes can help, or hurt your progress.

You start in a single solar system, and explore and expand out from there. You'll need to manage your faction's FIDSI output, which stands for Food, Industry, Dust, Science, and Influence. There are a lots of planet types and sizes which will dictate your strategy depending on what you have access to. You might have several nice looking planets available to you, but because you lack the technology to colonize it, you simply cannot.

Of course, you are not alone in the universe and you'll not only find the major factions along your travels, but minor factions as well. These minor factions all have their own lore, as well as bonuses. Maybe you'll conquer them for their planet, perhaps keep them within your sphere of influence, or assimilate them into your faction. This will play into your strategy and sometimes your faction's quests as well.

The major factions will be working on their own quests, but inevitably they are either an ally or an enemy to you. Whether you are out to conquer the universe, or to create universal harmony, the variety of factions will treat you accordingly. New players will find this to be more cumbersome than empire building, because the diplomacy isn't as straight forward as in many other similar games in the genre. Diplomatic pressure, various states of peace and war, are daunting at first but as familiarity with the factions and the system grows it becomes a powerful tool.

When diplomacy fails, then it comes to your military to resolve the matter. Your fleets and army can come in many shapes and sizes, and the battles can be a wonderful spectacle. Both space and land battles play out the same way, after choosing a tactic, the battles themselves play out via cinematic. This is more than just a rock, paper, scissors choice which can tip the scales of a closely matched battle. Land battles work very similar, though your composition is more akin to rock, paper,  scissors of Infantry, Armor, Aircraft each having a bonus to another type. This sounds simplistic, but you can adjust the ratios to suit your needs, as well as buff them, not to mention in the beginning of the game, everyone starts with rock.

Overall recommendation is that I recommend Endless Space 2.

This game plus mass effect andromeda would be the best space game ever made. I often find this game gives me the itch to finish terraforming worlds in mass effect.

I would absolutely recommend it, but there are 2 huge reason I don't:

1: Endless Space 2 is in desperate need of a good bug bashing. There are quite a few very obvious and very easy-to-run into bugs with the game. I've run into the game breaking bug  a few times where you'll end the turn and the turn # will count up, but the game doesn't process anything that's supposed to happen (thankfully you can quit and reload your save to fix it, but its still happens). There's also an easy to replicate bug where transport ships carrying pops get stuck, never go away, and screw with accessing a planet's shipyard. My current game isn't giving me the proper # of resources owned. Almost all of these are old bugs too!

2: they've kind of taken a Paradox approach to DLC; no big expansions. lots of pricey little add ons. The problem with the DLCs are most of them aren't good. Some even come across as incomplete messes; content intended to be part of the original product, but cut for time and added later as paid DLC. Other DLCs even introduce new bugs. If you want that full Endless Space 2 experience, buying everything doubles the price of the base game and doesn't feel worth it.

I chalk both these issues up to Sega acquiring Amplitude Studios in 2016. Amplitude was putting out fairly competent product until Sega bought them out.

I'll instantly change this review to a recommend if they ever get around to fixing the major bugs.

It's very focused, with the limited tech tree and races doing specific things, which is a great break from other games of the style which give you literally ""all the races"" and an infinitely expanding tech tree so that the universe would feel like white noise.

It's also the most focused Endless series game. For one thing, it looks a lot nicer than the other Endless strategy games. The quests seem more focused and well written, and unlike the first Endless Space, it feels like you're dealing with actual planets rather than Fantasy 4X cities with planet skins. And the art for the planets is beautiful. I can't help myself screencapping each one.

Its game game features are wonderful, the graphics are amazing, the story is engaging....and it physically hurts me to give this a negative review, BUT it has some serious flaws.

Sometimes it refuses to load saved games, giving a new death spin wheel that only ends with yet another forced program closure. Buying this game  is the equivalent of getting a BMW car that just sits in your driveway because the wheels are missing. Still needs some major fixes to its stability and execution.

Many mechanics are surprisingly intricate and create an engaging experience, which also means that things can become a bit convoluted and intransparent at times. The faction design and varied gameplay is an absolute highlight, and Amplitude's games are far superior to Civ games in this regard. It also has the best 4x UI I have seen so far. Its audiovisual presentation is very distinct and of exceptional quality. Its a step back from Endless Legend when it comes to victory conditions: I don't really care which empire can produce 32587957435 million tons of gold first or has the highests score at the end of 200 turns. The Academy quest line provides a soft climax to a game, though, and could easily have been expanded upon.


[b]Presentation[/b]: 12/15 - Very Good

[u]Audio[/u] 10/15: Athmospheric and calming, but lacks any voice acting for the most part and the sound effects in the battle viewer are... glitchy?

[u]Visual[/u] 13/15: Absolutely stunning design and art. The battle viewer is just too much for my PC, unfortunately, and the camera handling in there is actively fighting against the player.
[u]UI/UX[/u] 12/15: Probably the best UI of any 4x game I have ever played. Smooth transitions between different scales of empire management, one click to return to the map. No backwards submenus everywhere, like in Paradox games. Sometimes its a bit gimmicky and inefficient with its space and not always completely transparent with its mechanics (how many Arks can the Vodyani build?). Its a very complex game with lots of moving parts and yet its and Amplitude went out of their way to create a UI that can actually handle all  that complexity - with the exception of the tech wheel, which is unnecessarily difficult to navigate and a total frustration for new players.

[u]Writing[/u] 12/15: Finally a strategy game that's not written by untalented amateur hacks who think that edgy = thoughtful and silly = humour. There's always more than one angle to each faction (aside from the Sophons, screw these guys). My only complaint is that there isn't more of it and the faction quests are not as central to the game as in Endless Legend.


[b]Gameplay[/b]: 10/15 - Good, but sometimes a bit too intransparent and convoluted.

[u]Empire Management[/u] 12/15: Highly abstracted for the sake of usability and performance. You develop entire systems and not planets. This works surprisingly well and is flexible for this ambitious game: Every single faction is meaningfully different from the others, with few minor exceptions. Unfortunately, its difficult to keep track of the numbers and conditional boni for specific planet types. My favourite part is actually the politics, which, although rudimentary in its effect, emerges organically from gameplay and not predetermined empire traits, as for example in Stellaris.

[u]Combat and Warfare[/u] 8/15: There is an awful lot of power creep in all Endless games, and I don't really like it. Its less egregious than in Legend, though. For combat, you set up your ships for automated combat, which is regulated by action cards that give different boni and tell your ships whether to close the engagement or stay away from the enemy. Its really good, at least on paper. A bit too convoluted, again, with the numbers. And the angle at which ships engage matters an awful lot, which can completely break some battles and can not be influenced consciously by the player. Amplitude aimed for greatness with this system, but barely avoided desaster. There is ground combat and its very rudimentary, which is a good thing. Its integrated into your regular movement of ships and ground forces use the same manpower pool as your fleets. Its more abstract than having to move around actual invasion armies, but this is a boon to the flow of play, and the AI, which isn't particularly bright, so please don't overburden it.

[u]Diplomacy[/u] 11/15: Surprisingly intricate and far-reaching, without breaking the game's balance. Diplomatic Pressure is meaningful, but not overbearing. You can trade techs, but not so much that it makes research obsollete. Its a good, well-rounded system that helps enabling those varied gameplay styles. 

[u]Side Quests[/u] 9/15: Some minor distractions will ensure a change of pace from time to time. No more, nor less. They are always the same in every game, for the most part. The cooperative quests are a little highlight of Endless Space's design and I wish there were more cooperative elements in 4x/GS games.",1573266543,1573266892,True,1,0,0.491279065608978271,0,True,False,False

Most of the planning is fairly simple and amounts to deciding what to research when.
Diplomacy is there though it's fairly shallow in a single player game. Still, the game controlled races do seem to react differently from each other. Playing the various races in the base game offers different playstyles, and two of them are substantially different from the others. They also offer unique questlines that can be interesting.

Zero tactical combat - aside from some of the battle formations, the only real say you have in determining the outcome of a battle is the type and number of ships you assembled. All you can do once a battle begins is choose the formation and whether you want to watch or not. Late game fleet battles can be fun to witness even though the auto-camera leaves a lot to be desired, and the free-camera's a little finicky.

Problem as experinced by me and many many other testimonials on the www: At some point you cant finish turn anymore. If you load an Autosave it will lock up at the exact same turn as before.

Some of the only problems I can think of are that it can be a little confusing at times. I remember when I first started to get good at managing my systems and empire, I sucked at winning battles. I kinda just ended up teaching myself how to win. I might just be dumb and missed something but it all worked out. Overall, its a very addicting and fun game, but I feel like you would already know if you would like this game.",1572303794,1572303794,True,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

[Early Access review | may change after full release]

First of, I don't say it's not a good game.
It is a good game, but it lacks the soul of it's predecessor.

Endless space had it's own way of aproach to 4X game and it's wonderfuly simple yet thought out design.

Endless space 2 is trying to make things more simple.
You no longer can adjust taxes to get out of hard times.
In combat you choose only one of three options for aproach and there is no reason to watch the fight real-time, since you can't change anything mid-battle.
Customizing ships is no longer by filling up tonnage, but instead you have hard points that can be filled with weapons or some other module.
And few other things I forgot.

Then they also try to use some of the features from Endless Legend, like the science eras and quests. For me racial quests shouldn't be part of the 4X games, but I don't have nothing against event-like quests.

They also added some features that are completely new for endless.
Like political parties and multiple species on a planet. So far I can't say wether I think those changes are good or not.
But one thing is interesting, and that's laws. You can use political parties to pass laws that affect your faction, like for example that other races can't increase population on planets under your control. (I played religious fanatics and this is the only law I remember)

I'm not saying it's a bad game.
I was completely taken by the original Endless Space and to see them change the thing that I liked about it means that I just can't recomend it.
But maybe it's the game for you, so look at some other reviews and decide for yourself, if you want to try it.",1476030255,1572301196,True,0,0,0.511661291122436523,0,True,False,False

Endless Space took what I knew of 4X gaming, namely Civilization V to Space and to the next level. I love all things space so they got me hooked already. But they also made something that is not often seen in nowadays gaming industry: Care less for balance but more for diversity. These tendencies were subtle in Endless Space and then reinforced for Endless Legend, another Amplitude jewel.

I followed the development of Endless Space 2 as soon as it was known to happen and waited in anticipation for Early Access. When it finally hit, I was mindblown. While the starting races were rather boring per se (Sophons, nothing really special about them and Cravers not a huge fan), I saw what they were aiming for: More diversity and more functionality.
Shortly after, they released the Vodyani, still my all time favourite race. And they kept on expanding, each race with their own unique aspect. That is what I love about Amplitude games in general and ES2 in particular. Every race feels distinctively unique in the way they play. Not only can you play in many different ways as a race, but each type of gameplay is different from race to race. If e.g. you go for an economic victory with the Vodyani, you play very differently from when you do the same with the Lumeris.

This type of diversity brings  huge amount of replayability, added with the possibility to create your own custom races.

ES2 has a lot of different mechanics, synergizing well together to create an awesome experience for the player. Some mechanics are explained better than others but since it is a strategy game, observation and experience are important factors in the gameplay as well.

Finally, ES2 is accompanied by one of the best soundtracks I have listened to so far. If only they had a playlist feature like e.g. Stellaris.

I would recommend this game to everybody who loves diversity, strategy, good music, space and of course taking over the galaxy in a holy crusade.

>I like that it's built with community feedback
>The interface is unique and adds to the visual beauty of the game

>I does have some interesting ideas with resources and the market.
>The music is beautiful
>The writing is good, campy at times and borrows from other Scifi tropes which is amusing, plenty of lore. 

Now the problems and they are legion but i'm going to point to the biggies
>Pacing is SOOOOOOO slow, too slow and the first game and Endless Legends suffer from the same issue, it just takes too long to feel like you have accomplished anything. The game feels VERY throttled to slow expansion down. 
>Too many game systems that are fairly shallow. Ship design, Laws, space battles, population, diplomacy all and more aspects of the game where you have choices but none that feel really meaningful. 
>The game is HEAVILY balanced to keep the player on rails, i have never played this and felt like i was REALLY in control I always feel like I'm just reacting to the system. 
>The AI is not great, the diplomacy is shallow and uninteresting, combat on the galactic map is not strategic trade feels VERY limited. 
> there are other issues but if your still reading....you get it. 
> ""Unique races"" should be good!!! uh huh... but they exist as a means to experience the game differently which is ok, until you realize that that is just another oppressive game system, the different races are simply different rails along the way designed with huge rigidity to keep the player from veering too far off the path. Honestly this game feels more like a class-based RPG than a 4x game.  
              
There are a LOT of games that love this game and that's great but i prefer a 4x game that allows me to build a civilization and compete with other civilizations in meaningful ways and allows me to be somewhat creative, the systems in this game DON'T encourage that player creativity because the developers are more interested in presenting the player an experience and it just feels like all i am doing, as the player, is following along. 

If you want a pretty game where you don't have to think too hard but still have a TON to learn and a mountain of text to read (good grief so much text to read)  and make a bunch of shallow decisions go for it. If you want a game that encourages strategic thought and relies on your creativity to accomplish your own goals...may be best to look elsewhere.

I've always loved space themed strategy games, and the Original Endless Space was the first I played in a long time since Galactic Civilisation 2 that really got me hooked. Myself and my partner used to play the original for week on end, slowly trying to wrestle galactic control from one another, and honest, I'm looking forward to this from the sequel.
Honestly, I really am enjoying what there is so far from this game. And I am really looking forward to all the future updates we know about and see what that adds to the game as a whole. The feature of combat on the planet surface, though limited in what occurs, offers more of a outcome than the original which always seemed a bit random. Admittedly I was hoping for something akin to Endless Legend in being able to command your invading ground forces, but considering the main focus of this game is about fleet battles in the depths of space, it was asking for a little too much. It really has taken the bare bones of the first game and added to it, the detail of the ships, and functionality of the weapons they employ, not to mention incorporating the resources from Endless Legend, really is a great leap for this game. It will make gaining certain solar systems more important for their resources now. I personally am really looking forward to seeing what the final product will become. I know there are a number of issues currently with the game, but that is what Early Access is for, and you just have to accept this and take them with a pinch of salt. And understand the pace of the game is not for everyone, but that's just one of those things.

Endless Space 2... Now this is a game that I adore, but I'll try to be as objective as possible in this review... Note that I've played every Endless game. The DLC and updates adds a decent amount of features to beef this 4x game up alot! So here are the Pros, Cons and Misc!

Pros:
-Lovely Interface
-Nice graphics
-Wonderful Lore
-Quite a bit to do in all phases of the game (From Early to late game)
-Diverse Race mechanics
-Each race has their own story in-game
-Clear and clean mechanics that work
-Excellent Soundtrack
-Beautiful artwork
-Decent cinematics and animations in space combat, planet cracking and planet presentation
-Moddable!!!!

Cons:
-Bugs.
-Ground battles are repetitive.
-Not the best AI in a 4X game.
-Some features are a little underwhelming in some DLC.

Misc:
-The Sophonity, where science and a reckless disregard for survival go hand in hand!
-Lots of hidden humour in the game if you like reading I found myself laughing quite a bit
-Lets build a planet, and blow it up! With science!
-Lots of good quotes

Final notes:
I personally enjoyed this game alot, I have played for quite a bit! I lost count of how many games I played... Would I recommend this game to anyone... Yes, yes I definitely would, without a question, but with a little warning. Be weary of bugs... There are a few of them still lurking about, and this is still valid today.

Firstly the story quests seem more numerous and engaging. I feel like their is more for me to do in the game now and the A.I seems to have improved. I spawned next to another empire in game and they challanged me with another colony over a bountiful system. They then bloackaded my supply ships to the colony and i lost it. I do not remember the A.i doing that a few years back. I have also been attacked of the bat and its NICE to actually be attacked. 

I still would prefer to have actual control over my ships, however as i get older and slower combat becomes less important. I see a few more diplomatic options, more minor races and hero's. 

I have heard their are issues with the bigger DLC regarding bugs, so i'm not yet investing in them. However im more than happy to once reviews persuade me the bugs are fixed and the base game seems bug free.",1557687494,1571320172,True,1,0,0.528985500335693359,0,True,False,False

The general gameplay loop remains fun for probably 75% of the game, although as is often the case with this style of game, it gets a little repetitive towards the end when you're marching to victory. Few games in the genre have really cracked this - Stellaris with it's ""end game crisis"" probably got closest, but it's something I'd like to see improved. 

On the positive side, the ship designing is fun and feels like you're able to make a difference in the early game - later on, I found just focussing on economy meant I could outbuild my opponents making the actual ship design fairly irrelevant, but earlier when fleets are smaller the mixture of this plus tactics makes it feel like they make a difference.

The general thematic nature of the game is impressive too - many 4X games sacrifice race character in the name of balance, here however each race feels geniunely different to play as, which in single player at least is really interesting!

A few negatives - the general feedback on how some game mechanics work is poor, meaning your first game (and potentially only game, given a single game takes a while and many of us have a backlog to work through!) is probably going to be rife with mistakes - I would recommend reading some getting started guides online if you don't expect to play through more than once, as some mechanics are really confusing or poorly explained (I'm looking at you manpower). 

The other biggest negative is diplomacy - the AI makes some fairly odd decisions, especially in alliances, that detract from the fun factor a bit. During repeated successful wars, my allies would accept truce's for no apparent reason given we were comfortably winning, and neither of them had a character to suggest they were prone to peace - I'd vote if one person is invading a planet, you probably don't want to accept peace!

These issues aside, I thoroughly enjoyed my playthrough, and would recommend if this was on sale and you enjoy the Stellaris/civ/masters of Orion style games, to pick this up!",1571195248,1571265935,True,2,0,0,0,True,False,False

Endless Space 2, what to say... It got Segaficated.

Pros: 
The Look
The Sound

Cons:
Lost pretty much everything that makes a 4X game 4X....
SEGA style DLC´s (cutcontent?)

I absolutly love Endless Space 1, it brought me back to 4X after years, the second game... well I bought this game back then in Beta, Horatiopatch to be exact, played the beta a lot send feedback, chatted with devs and had great hope this could be better then lets say Stellaris. But sadly it went the other way, it looks beautiful, the soundtrack.... Omg the soundtrack is Amazing. The mechanics... not so much, this is pure eyecandy and while it looks like there are lots of mechanics and stuff to pay attention, its just not.

During the end of betaphase it became more clear what this game would be, it became easier. Im not talking about the difficulty settings dont get me wrong, sure AI is more agressive on hard then on normal but you´re managing the same way on every setting, public order was hard to maintain in early beta, too hard for many it seems. Politics got nerfed to the point where you dont care at all. The only point where u wanna look at politics is at Turn 1 to set up your laws and in endgame if you wanna change that early laws to endgame setup. Diplomacy works the same way every match, and once you know how to please the AI you gonna get loved by everyone all the time.

The factions... uuuuh yeah most are known from Game 1, sadly not all made it into game 2 (or got cut out and sold per DLC)
In generall the factions are again, pure eyecandy. Sure they all got the look, the sounds but lost their soul. The difference between Sophons and the empire? Well the questline. Otherwise Sophons are faster in research and Empire can buy out techs with influence. At the end both research the same techs the same time, settle the same planets the same time and are done with research same time. This goes for all factions eccept Vodjani wich differ a bit in the way they conquer and settle planets. Politics are the same for all factions aswell, sure some start in a democracy and love Sciencepartys some live in a Autocracy and love mititarist partys, after all everyone can become the same (and in endgame all use the same setup). A hivemind or good ol` autocracy with political options and elections is just weird if you ask me.

The Tech""wheel"" is also ... weird, sure a techtree is oldschool and not cool enough so we got a Wheel with less restrictions.
Sounds cool firstplace, sucks in game. This will make you research the same things, at the same time every game. In Game 1 you had to decide if you wanna go for military devs, getting to usefull stuff may take you a few dozend turns, same for planets and the rest. Here without this restrictions... there is no longtime desicion needed. the only restriction is you need to research 2 or more techs from Stage 1 to get to the next stage. With only 2-4-6-8 Techs per stage (from 1-4) ... well as i said you end up doing the same no matter wich faction you play.

In Game 1 (not released under SEGAs whip) there was one DLC, one DLC like back in the good ol days, it adds mechanics to ALL,and adds one new faction thats it. In G2 you feel the SEGA drive, Faction dlc´s all over. Even Game 1 factions get sold per DLC. God I`m so sick of SEGA DLC´s no matter wich game they all feel like cutcontent.

I would love to upvote this, simply cause ES 1 was such a good game. But this just feels different, it feels like its made for players who play 1 maybe 2 matches and never touch this again. Made for the ""masses"". It feels like a SEGA strat game (take Total war here, fewer and fewer mechanics per release more and more features get cut out, just to make the first few hours in a campain more interessting for new players, ignoring the guys who buy this games for the 14th time and having hundreds of hours playtime.)

So I give this a downvote, too much Sega not enough 4X, still this might be a good game for you if ur not too much into managing if you DONT want to spend hours upon hours setting up your Empire, and just want a fun, fast and somewhat arcady gameplay.
I would reccomand this game if you never played 4X (spacestrategy) before, if you´re looking for a actual Strategygame, a Spacesim, you shouldnt mind this.

So, buy if you never played 4X or if you just wanna play a few matches and never play it again.
Avoid if you are a passionate Strategy gamer.

BTW i reccomand Playing Stellaris with Endless soundtrack. The Music is awesome!",1495538355,1571178246,False,0,0,0.493179649114608765,0,True,False,False

-good faction variety with about half of them having substantially different game mechanics

-great interface

-your empire is highly customisable by using different laws and empire development paths

-ship design is nice and slick, the combat takes a bit of getting used to but once you figure it out you can fit your ships to suit what combat options are available to you

-interesting economic options, trading for resources, trade companies, buying ships when your back is to the wall, a stock market for resources

-plenty of options when you start a new game about how the galaxy is, what is in it, random events, minor civs, quests etc. etc.

[b] The Bad[/b]

-encountered a few bugs, especially playing as Vodyani and Riftborn

-system invasions aren't much fun, they can often be tedious until you learn to basically have fleets specialised for invasions following your main fleets around

-I almost never get to the last level of the tech tree, the game is either won or lost long before that happens

-the voices often don't suit the faction, the Sophons sound some dudebros from Liverpool and the Riftborn sounds like some slutty THOT from Essex or something

-faction quest has been hugely bugged for the Sophons for me, I've not been able to complete it for many games

-allies target my systems with their doomsday weapons, even while in an alliance together wtf

EDIT: CHANGING MY REVIEW TO NEGATIVE FOR TWO REASON

-the game keeps getting really really bad DLC, and those DLC either don't receive balance patches or they get ridiculous balance changes made to them

Of course it's clear how to create one -- but to make one!  Than to make a ship go where you want it to?  It's garbage.  Yeah, I right click in direction.  It's just lame programming you aren't shown anything to see if it's actually taken the command. So, how to do your objectives is totally junked due to poor poor ship direction and it's disappointing.

I also find that freedom isn't really there to build my empire.  Tried with different difficulties and win options.  Went to many turns so that I can build things.  Trading is not good either.

1. The discovery of the galaxy gives a sense of wonder, with many different planet types impacting your early game choices a lot - and the discovery of anomalies makes and keeps the planets interesting even after you visit them first. 

2. The very different races do give a lot of flavor, because they do have a different feel. I like the differences in the tech tree in particular. It also makes me want to win in different ways with each race. 

3. I love the minor races and the fact that you can add them to your empire, or with careful management (and some stupid decisions though), even let them become your majority race.

4. Quests! Some quests feel a bit odd or buggy, but most of them are addicting to do, in particular the discovery of your own race's plot.

5. The ressource progression, making different ressources more and less valuable at certain times of the game. Also, the best use of ""luxury"" ressources I have seen in a 4X game in that you want some of them desperately, and don't care about others (but your enemies do). 

What else is there?

6. The heroes are nice, and their skill progression is great, but I wish they were more than just combat / ressource buffs. Some more impact from their backstories, specific quests, and interaction between heroes would be great. 

7. The ship design is easy and fun, but the space battles (visuals apart, but I don't care so much about the visuals of space battles) aren't a particular highlight. The game could use more depth there. 

8. The planet management / upgrades feel...okay... Somehow that aspect of the game could be improved.

9. The diplomacy is alright, it lets you negotiate many different things, though it is not particularly easy to understand how it works.

for example you could've just had different planets have different stats and you colonise where you think you can manage the 4x statistics? that's how other games have done it: you can colonise the important location because it's worth it for the drain on the empire in order to say, have access to a specific resource, or have a FOB to repair and refuel, have access to a minerally rich world that can't grow its own food that you must then import so its vulnerable to a blockade etc.

randomness can really be a problem, the strength of your early game is dependent almost entirely on the planets that spawn next to you, and the factions that spawn randomly next to you. for a single player game it might be ok to restart but corralling people for a multi game and then restarting over and over is zero fun for all parties. there are minor factions within the game (like with endless legend) and they're incorporated into the society much better than in EL, but the quest you get to help them is randomly picked and some are very easy to do, others are impossible, so there's a frustration there too (although more often than not it's not a deal breaker and you can still assimilate them)

there are a lot of good ideas on display and some of the mechanics and teams are interesting but they're often eclipsed by a game that can make everything take (and feel) 10x longer than it needs to and almost exclusively rewards micro-management. for example, ground warfare (the only way to capture enemy systems) is unaided by your ships. you can't use them to wipe out an enemy army in one turn or bomb the planet into oblivion, you have to engage in a protracted ground war and it can really drag on.  this is especially frustrating when you're seeing your massive powerful fleet hanging impotent in space as your troops bleed out in the dirt. also there are small details missing, such as weapon technologies being used to upgrade ships but not ground forces. imagine if your cutting-edge rocket tech applied to your armoured units as well as your spaceships? seems a natural upgrade to me!

there are aspects to this game that feel like they've chosen style over substance and this can be a real hindrance for a spreadsheet game. there were some drawn-out games were i didn't find myself saying ""just one more turn!"" i found myself saying ""please, just let this end"" and there are some savegames i have to which i will never return because the thought of slogging through the micro-management is so wearying. to be clear this is less of an issue when you're familiar with the game and can run more on auto-pilot but it's still something to be aware of

there were times i was having fun playing multiplayer with some friends but hour after hour ticked past and each step in the fight felt like the battle of stalingrad, where every inch of ground was paid for with thousands of lives. eventually none of us were having fun, just waiting for the battle to be over and growing increasingly frustrated. again, would've been nice if my advanced weapon and armour tech translated into my ground troops being more lethal in combat. this wouldn't be as frustrating if other games hadn't fixed these same problems years ago... civilisation, master of orion, heroes of might and magic, even endless legend, all of them had a more satisfying and less arduous way of making war on your enemies. again i'm largely referring to the ground war, the space fights don't disappoint in the same way

i initially recommended against buying this game but having come back to it i have to say that it has some moments where it really shines. i wish i didn't need to buy the dlc to get all the teams and all the additional game mechanics that come with the dlc (ie the ability to do more with pirates than just fight them, and engage in diplomacy or trade with them! what a great idea that i wish were in the base game!) and overall although this game has some bugs, and some hindrances, if you like 4X games and take the time to get to know the systems then it can definitely be worth your time

i just wish they'd steal more from games that came up with some cleverer fixes to some of these problems.

NOTE: if you're compelled to buy this game i feel that i have to mention: you can buy a lot of things from the marketplace in the game. the game never told me that and i found it by accident. i played like 5 or so games without knowing that i could hire heroes from the marketplace as soon as i had the money spare. also ships, luxury resources, strategic resources etc. this is a VERY big deal because many quests are only finishable with heroes at the helm of ships or systems and WOW this would have saved me some headaches if i'd known it sooner. not to mention the ability to dump your spare resources on the market and use that money to buy warships when you get pinched by some combative dunderheads",1568573148,1568836195,True,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Let's take a look at some of the flaws with the game first. 
-Firstly, the AI is, well, not the greatest. The AI is very inconsistent and respond harshly to things they aren't incredibly important. For instance, if the AI in alliances will be offended if even one of their ships get destroyed in a war. Overall, the AI isn't great but it's not a game breaker, for me at least. I've never had to blame something going wrong 100% on the AI (except for the diplomacy).
-Another problem with the AI is their ""death by a thousand cuts"" tactics. I've seen a few reviews here saying the AI barely amasses any fleets. In my experience, they build tons of cheap ships and send them in volleys to your systems. It is entirely possible this is just based on the empire the AI controls. 
-Another aspect of this ""death by a thousand cuts"" tactic is their colonization. I'm convinced that some AIs spend the first 100 turns spreading themselves out across their ""part"" of the Galaxy. Without fail, every time the Riftborn are in my game, they have 50 planets by turn 70 or something. Not even joking, this has happened several times. 
-Diplomacy is pretty broken ngl. While I feel the diplomacy is slightly above Endless Legend's, it is still not great. Trading is incredibly unfair and being at peace/getting agreements can be like pulling teeth, or one turn they'll decide you're a swell guy. Or, on the flip side, they'll decide you're an untrustworthy warmongerer who needs to be destroyed. Overall, the diplomacy feels very clumsy. 
-Unfortunately, combat isn't exactly a highlight of the game. Updates and dlcs have made war and combat more dynamic and fun, but the actual fighting is more or less a card game.
-I personally haven't experienced too many bugs, but it seems like an issue for many other people, so I thought I'd include this.
Overall, Endless Space 2 needs a lot of ironing out. The saddest part is a lot of these could be part of some free update or large patch. I really hope Amplitude fixes these issues up, I'd love to see Endless Space 2 be the best game it can be.
For me, it is hard to articulate everything I love about the game. Basically the entire game aside from what's listed above is great.
-This game offers a feeling and style unmatched by any 4x game available. The art is amazing, but that's not the only part of the style. Every faction feels incredibly unique, different to play, and a perfect balance of niche and generalized. you're bound to love playing at *least* one faction. 
-Your actions have a lot of weight. Even what you research and choose to build has some impact, those two impacting the political parties. I feel like the politics and laws are a great game. A lot of the laws range from small boosts to game changing decisions. There are also galaxy wide events and quests. Everything contributes to you feeling like you're part of a living, breathing galaxy. 
-On a technical level, there's a lot of customization for everything. You can change everything about a galaxy and change your ships and military to your play style or how you see fit. There mechanics aren't the hardest thing to learn, but mastering the mechanics can be an art form. 
I thoroughly enjoy the Endless series and think Amplitude has serious passion in what they make. I've never got the feeling that much of anything was rushed or a cash grab. I do recommend buying the game on sale for the game and all the dlc. Endless Space 2 goes on sale a lot and usually cuts off a huge amount from the price tag.

The initial release was, in my opinion, an out of season april fools' joke (harharhar it was released in may). Never mind the sheer number of glitches and possible crashes which happend quite regularly but the tiny immersion breaking stuff like missing or incomplete missions.

The reason is anyone's guess but i imagine it was the merger between amplitude studios and sega. 

Over the course of the last 2 years the developers have ironed out a lot of stuff while adding dlcs, which in my opinion are downright robbery considering the meager amount of content they offer. While i like the game now with every additional content in its bare bones form is unintersting and i advise against buying it at full cost. 

Additional warning: some of the races scale REALLY badly with galaxy size, so keep that in mind should you play either the umbral choir (the espionage doesn't do it for me), the treants (because micromanaging your fleets is annoying on bigger maps). 

In general i still wonder it they had any beta testers at all. Some of the Races (not trying to be racist here, but there are several humanesque factions) have special abilities that pretty much break the game. It stands to reason that this game is by far the most unblanced game i have ever played because at a certain point (which is quite early on) the horatio (mandatory genetic manipulation specialists which euthanize indigenous population to enhance their own) outproduce the other factions really fast. 

My point being: this game is badly scaled even now.

One last thing. Either sega has poeple downvoting legitimate reviews or (and which i think is way more likely) a bunch of blinded doey eyed morons who don't have a shred of (self-) reflection who are content with mediocre products. I however am not.

Played quite a bit of Stellaris so have held off buying, but it is quite a different game - and I like both.

I love the fact that each faction plays differently and (only played 70 hours so far so this could change) seems to be balanced (not played MP). Looking forward to playing the other factions.

Took me quite a while to get into - the UI is superbly delicious, but the documentation is woeful - the tutorial is more of a UI orientation (which is not necessary as it is so intuitive) I often had no real clue what was going on and what the underlying mechanisms are - I watched a host of Youtube videos to fill the knowledge chasm.

I own Endless Legend which suffers the same thing - I gave up on that after a couple of hours, but persevered with this and have enjoyed - makes me want to go back and give EL another try.",1568275449,1568275858,True,2,0,0.500570118427276611,0,True,False,False

[i]Overview[/i]
----------------
Endless Space 2 is perhaps the best 4X strategy game of all-time; with its attention to detail, great graphics, interesting factions, ship customization, economics/trade, technology branches, and stellar gameplay, it's no wonder why it beats out Stellaris any day of the week.

[i]Gameplay[/i]
----------------
[i]Endless Space 2[/i]'s base version offers a decent amount of factions and quite a bit more with the season pass. All civilizations are vastly unique with their own intriguing story-lines displayed by great intro videos showing each civilization's beginning plus their motives and intentions of prospering in the galaxy. Each civilization has unique ship hulls; however the game allows the player to customize their ships with new technologies the player researches which includes armour, weaponry, travel techs and much more.

Watching a space battle live is exciting and visually stunning; particularly after the player directs the tactics of how their ships will maneuver and play. Planetary land invasions are equally interesting because the player must direct how their troops will attack - for instance, the player can direct carpet-bombing prior to landing their troops there, or orchestrate special operations tactics. the battles themselves are not nearly as pretty to watch because the battle is watched via a hologram, but is still cool nonetheless. Zooming in on solar systems will allow you to take a close look at each planet. The amount of detail displayed is stunning and makes the planet look ""alive"".

Of course, the government of the player's civilization could play a massive role in conducting warfare. A Republic type government may prove difficult to enact a formal declaration of war. Unlike the Republic, warfare-hungry governments can be damaging to the happiness of the people within the civilization in the different solar systems - taxation and other laws enacted by the government could either have a positive and negative impact on the system's people. For instance, a law the may increase production, may have a negative effect on the planet or solar system's environment causing any possible ecologist party in any one of the civilization's systems to not likely vote and campaign against the incumbent. 

Ship movement throughout the galaxy is great due to the variety of solar systems, nebulas, asteroid belts, and more. Ships fleets can be developed to create a stronger force to fight against space pirates and enemy players alike. Fleets may also act as a deterrent by placing them in ""defense"" mode over a certain system allowing no enemies to pass. Technology research is key in order to increase fleet movement speeds.

[i]Technology & Trading[/i]
----------------
Speaking of technology, there is a vast array of technological advancements to be made within one's civilization. Players must carefully select the technologies required to settle on the huge quantity of different planets. Each planet has its own ecosystem that may require technology in order to make it habitable. 

In addition, technology will also allow the player to develop new ship hulls for military and civilian/colonist ships alike. Weaponry technology is also important, not only for ships but for manpower landing on the ground and clearing the planet from hostile forces. 

Lastly, technology will allow the player to exploit resources on planets along with their respective anomalies. These special resources could be used to construct new weaponry technologies that were researched. They can also be used for trading proving them to be vital in the trading.

[i]Verdict[/i]
----------------
Overall, [i]Endless Space 2[/i] has provided me with countless hours of exploring the vast galaxy the game has to offer. For additional information, please contact me privately.

392110,50928288,76561198071761805,0,14,1916,0,1880,1665426882,"If you start the game offline and then connect to the internet the game will absolutely fall apart: you won't be able to click to any menu, won't save, won't reload, won't return to the main screen, map will corrput. All because again you are a product, but not even for free, for $40 you have the privilage to have your data stolen from you.

The game baits you with feelsgood music and artsy look, only to disappoint you with the gameplay, all to keep you from refunding for just long enough so you are ineligible. You understood the grossly underexplained game systems, you played as every faction-that's it, you have nothing more to experience. AI is braindead and a pushover even on the highest difficulty ( and you can forget about AI being smarter with higher levels, oh nooo, that's beyond the capabilities of human species!).

Gameplay is bloated with multiple systems to create an illusion of choice and complexity, where in reality there is always only one and the same choice, and the rest are memes and smoke&mirrors. There is no ""careful choice of specializing your systems"" with luxury upgrades, you upgrade with what you spawned around, and if it's not the Industry improving one, you're shit out of luck. Industry is the absolute answer to everything, and translates into all other yields (FIDSI) extremely fast. Food is a joke-population in every system can grow only once per turn, and food threshold for that (a surplus of 300 per turn) is trivial to achieve, with just 2 first Food improvements. Influence is an even bigger joke because the amount of Influence needed to spend on Minor Empires (""city-states"") so you can unlock their assimilation quest is a spare change. Law upkeep is a non-issue with just ONE Influence building, you build that, and you can run the most expensive Laws 24/7 and still swim in Influence with which you can do nothing, because past earlygame declaration of war cost is trivial, and nothing else in diplomacy is worthwhile. Dust (money) is a joke because of the rate at which  inflation rises in the game as players produce more Dust per turn. This resource literally cannibalizes itself while Industry does not, AT ALL. And while Endless Legend has significant and pretty early discounts to buyout costs which allowed Dust to compete very well with Industry, someone in Endless Space 2 decided that haha no, having 2 possible routes in economy is too primitive, so it's time to introduce a feature (inflation) in such way that absolutely invalidates one of those routes. Yes, only 1 path is way less primitive, right?

Minor factions will disappear at slowest a dozen of turns after someone notices them, so since turn 50 you are left only with major players, thus the only diplomacy left is War, or Not Yet War. There is no creating ""satellite states"" with minor factions, only full assimilation (annexation) into your empire. And that minor faction's bonus is FOREVER yours, even if you lose that system later, even if you yourself decide to raze it later, even if you have 0 map awareness and someone surprises you with an invasion. There is no contention, no back-and-forth, only who noticed them first.

Behemoths were supposed to add another layer of strategy to the game, but there are only 2 non-memey ways of using them: stacking as many as you can on your best system and stuffing them with modules that boost the whole FIDSI output of your system by 25% PER BEHEMOTH; the other use is specializing them into a nuke luancher, which, thanks to Amplitude's genius, you can fire even at your declared allies without the necessity to change the diplomatic relation with them.

Since every type of population gives very strong bonuses once you collect at least 20 of them (for example +15% to total Industry output of EVERY system that has at least one unit of that population; or Science; or Food; or Influence; or Manpower; or Dust), the strategy is always the same in this aspect: breed every foreign population and spread them to every system. So every turn, as populations grow, you're gonna have to open the system window of EVERY system, check which other system is missing this new population, send them there through spaceport, REMEMBER that there is a ongoing ship with THAT kind of population to THAT system, proceed to your next system, and do the same. Oh, and those ships with populations aren't listed anywhere. Also you there are no filters that would allow you to quickly indentify population ""X"" on a system, you have to sift through microscopic population icons, many of which will start looking very similarly to each other even after an hour of play or so. But devs never played their own game, so how would they know that the most efficient strategy is absolutely fun-nullifying because UI absolutely doesn't support it.

Every DLC introduces a faction even more broken than the previous one, purely to bait people into purchasing this. Apparently people were very adamant about citicizing Hissho on their shady games2gether platform so the latest patch nerfed them into the ground. Amplitude listens to what the players have to say but absolutely lacks any own insight on what needs fixing, not to mention in what way-it looks like someone who is absolutely unqualified for a position tries to please the loudest or most persistent complainers.

Endless Legend was their last good game. I bought ES2 Digital Deluxe Edition because I was absolutely enamoured by the gameplay of both Endless Legend and Endless Space (and what I initially saw in ES2 in early access) and I am extremely bitter about the result of the development of this game. It's also clear that they basically gave up on trying their best with this game and totally lost their heart to it somewhere along the way. 2 years of full release, god knows how long in early access and UI still breaks: tooltips can just stop displaying gameplay info, so godspeed if you haven't memorized everything yet; while drag&dropping ships between fleets, ships can get ""glued"" to your cursor and you need to reload a save to get rid od that; you can lose your ability to click on ANY fleets for unknown reason-fleet ""buttons"" will just become greyed out and you won't be able to select them until you do...something; your list of all systems can just decide to go on strike and stop displaying anything more than 10 of your systems; sometimes you will lose the ability to send your fleets anywhere, because when you click on a destination of any fleet, what will happen instead will be map centering on some random point, without moving the fleet. And you can click all you want, not a single fleet will move until you reload a save, the map will just refocus to some random point over and over.

Just go play some other 4X, even endless space 1. Heck, even Civ is more complex than this art bait, and civ is widely known as the normie among 4X games.",1559134985,1566865803,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I have stopped an started this game several times and have come to realize that while the music, graphics, and interface are all great, the game play is just not a very well done game.  Endless Space 2 is turn based strategy game where you start out in a solar system with a very space ships.  You then begin to colonize other systems and planets, build more ships, build improvements on planets, and increase your technology through research. It is very similar to Civilization is space, and part of what I like about the game is that similarity.  Again like Civilization you win through conquest, diplomacy, tech or economic superiority.

However unlike its much better predecessor, the execution is of Endless Space game is flawed. No matter what style of play, the course of the game stays very much the same and achieving any victory is just a pain agonizing.  Every time I play I explore a several systems, colonize several or a few, beat off the pirates, and then once my civilization and all the others run out of room to expand the game pretty much grinds to a halt.  Battles are lengthy and slow, often taking numerous rounds of attack to win and once won, numerous round of defending against counter attacks.  Planetary invasions are also much the same.  There are no tactics to battles just throw the ships against each other select one of three battle plans and the computer crunches an outcome.   But it is the slow repetitivness of combat that is so annoying.  After endless turns  watching your fleet move to the system for invasion it then takes several more to complete the battle.  Heaven forbid you have to bring in more ships to finish the job as it goes on forever.  Them you have to conquering the system through planetary invasions which also includes you guessed it dozens of turns of battle to eliminate the defending forces.  It can take a few hours to conquer just one enemy system and conquering a rival power is something I have never been able to achieve or more accurately put had not had the patience to spend weeks of grinding to attempt to do.

There are also annoying pointless side quests that constantly appear like traveling to the other side to the galaxy through countless enemy held systems and explore the most anomalies in a system.  The distance you have to travel not too mention the number of enemy fleets you may have to battle (which take forever) to get there all the while another species usually completes the quest in about 10 turns where it might take your 50-100 makes the quest impossible.  In the end I just keep clicking them away as well as the updates that I failed yet again.

And I don't get what I should use support ships for any more.

Obliterators, the mega weapons introduced with an add-on, now take too long to charge. The game is usually over before I can make the first shot. They have become useless.

Those were my opening words for the review I did a long time ago for the original Endless Space. A game that I did not recommend and that was largely due to the lack of polish, variety and visual feedback that the game provided. Did the developers improve anything for ES2? They certainly did!

As a fair side-by-side comparison I once again went through with the Horatio. A great faction for easing yourself into the game since the basic idea behind them is to simply colonise and expand like crazy and that is something that the Horatio do especially well. I won't go into the specifics of my 30+ hour game, but suffice to say that, as before, I was double crossed by an ally on one side and continually harassed by the other. What started out as a friendly trade agreement turning into a blood bath because the Lumeris wanted to take away the Academy which I already controlled. Given that I had not invested at all in my military tree what followed was a scramble of research followed by mass production and a thorough cleaning of house to remove the Lumeris ships that were repeatedly attacking my colonies. It ended with both factions begging for mercy the moment they saw two giant Hero commanded fleets heading for their homeworld's while suffering defeat after defeat as they threw warships at me which were promptly swatted like flies. I only wish the Horario had cube-shared ships because it would have been like reenacting the Borg invasion at Wolf-359 - resistance was futile. 

How did it all end? Well, the Lumeris had their original homeworld blown up by my rather expensive carrier doing a very good impersonation of the Deathstar then I occupied what remained of their home solar system. No doubt the survivors would long remember not to bully innocent neighbors each time they look in the sky and see the smouldering ruins of their motherland. As for the Vodyani, well they quickly abandoned their homeworld the moment my largest fleet jumped into orbit and asked them to leave... at gunpoint. Horatio 1, Universe 0.

One of the biggest improvements to ES2 over the original is the sheer volume of stuff which is happening. Every turn you have dozens of things you can check on from production queues and population to political events and quests. Towards the late-game things start to thin out but in all honesty by that time you have so many planets and fleets which need attention it would actually become overwhelming if they kept the random events coming as fast as they do in the early game. There is rarely a turn where you don't have anything which can be looked at more closely. The game does do some of the micro-management of systems itself and this can be helpful at times but I did find it was changing planet specialisations when I didn't want it to. Visual feedback on the planets is still lacking like in the original though, I miss seeing your progress as each planet grows because in Endless Legend you see the cities/empires expand and grow more complex. That is something ES2 desperately needs.

All in all though, you always feel like there is something different to toy with. You're not just limited to optimising build queues since you can also check on what is happening with the politics of systems which can cause unhappiness and rebellion, the relations with other empires always deserves a closer look and the vast research tree (which is daunting at first) begins to make more sense when you decide on how you want to win the game based upon the circumstances your empire find itself in.

All in all, I'd highly recommend Endless Space 2 over the original. It's gorgeous to look at, varied in it's gameplay with the only real areas it is lacking are the audio/music and slightly lacking the visual feedback for your choices. Hopefully the developers will eventually make a game with the galactic gameplay of ES2 with the planetary gameplay of Endless Legend since that would be something truly special.",1565035940,1565036120,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

But it isn't.

Gameplay offers little new over Endless Space 1, and the path of every game with every faction seems predetermined: you start, you expand for 30 turns, you meet some other empires, you fail to keep up with them in score for 30 turns despite everything you do, then they declare war because you're ""weaker"".

Rinse and repeat for all empires.

There's no strategy, no tactics, there is only the one true optimal path: if you divert from it then you lose because you got crushed, and if you stick to it, well, you lose because you find yourself in a linear war of attrition of spamming ships where victory only buys you the experience of doing the exact same thing with whatever empire is the other side of the one you just crushed.

Cons
-Takes a while to really understand the mechanics (basic gameplay comes quickly, but the tutorial can last ~200 turns if you try to learn everything)

The main gameplay loop, like the best 4x, is terrifyingly addictive. The systems run surprisingly deep; I am still discovering major game mechanics 70 hous in. The combat, in particular, which I had originally written off as style over substance, is so complex I feel like I still only barely have a handle on it. Factions are so strongly differentiated from each other that it can feel like you're playing an entirely different game when trying them out.

That's also kind of the problem; you have to rely on youtube (where other, more dedicated, nerds dig through XML files) to get a handle on even the basic stuff. There's no explanation and there's a really surprising number of bugs. Maybe the most bugs I've ever seen in a AAA product. Some mechanics seem like they simply got abandoned, and overall it just seems like there was a rush to finish.

The artistic direction and creativity is fantastic (like 11/10 material), even if it's very much a standard 4X title. I've never seen such faction asymmetry in any other competitive game, and while it does seem to lead to balance issues, asymmetry is so good and done so well.

The developers need to give master classes to other games in UI design. I've never seen such a good UI in a game, and that's especially necessary in a 4X strategy title with loads of information. It's a little overwhelming at first, but it flows well and has such a great minimalist presentation.

I can see where people might say it's not replayable, hence why you'll see so many more reviews with 40-100 hours instead of the thousands upon thousands found in reviews for Civilization titles and other games like Stellaris.

My only serious criticism of the game is that the tutorial, while fairly thorough, isn't the most well-written tutorial ever. I've now had to do it twice (in addition to instructional YouTube videos) to fully learn the mechanics, and still feel like there are holes in my learning. They do a good job of explaining the Endless Space 2 mechanics, but not a great job describing 4X -- and this might totally overwhelm players new to the genre. I've seen others recommend this as an entry level game, and while it is a little on the easier side, I don't know how someone totally unfamiliar with 4X would absorb everything in fewer than three games; the only way I've latched on is by relating everything to mechanics from Civilization games, which have a much lower barrier of entry.

All around I'm extremely pleased with this game and hope to play it through many times with all the different factions. The branching storylines of each race seem to be the bread and butter of its replayability, but I'll see how it goes; thus far I've only done the United Empire (humans) and am excited to try the other teams.

- I love the idea of co-operative quests in this game! It adds an interesting axis of interaction, where you can race economically for rewards! Great idea.
- As a rule of thumb, I believe that in engine building games there should be either i) anti-snowballing mechanisms or ii) a quick end to the game once one player is firmly ahead. This has neither.
- Diplomacy is still too mush of a black box for my taste, I strongly prefer more ""gamified"" or structured approaches. I suspect they kept it this way because their primary focus is on the multiplayer side of things.
- I love the battle system. The battles still provide interesting, strategic and epic experience while being not as time consuming as in other games.
- Strategic resources that limit the very powerful units is a good idea. It is also a potential driver of conquest and expansion.
- That said, non-conquest victory conditions feel very uninspired and boring.

This game has a bunch of very interesting ideas that I believe will be useful in a future game that finally nails it. But for the time being Dungeons of the Endless is still my favorite Amplitude game.

I have been a fan of 4x games since Civilization was released.  Mostly, I find the genre disappointing.  I have high standards, I suppose.  Most notably, the AI has never improved despite the advanced in computer technology.  AI diplomacy is often schizophrenic.  AI evolution has in most cases moved towards simpler game design.  In lieu of smarter opponents, you get opponents with ridiculous bonuses.
I am always astounded that these games always miss a critical feature in the UI, and that no one catches this or bothers to fix it in a patch... or expansion?

I thoroughly enjoyed Endless Legend.  I thought it fixed maost of the problems with 4x series.  Endless Legend also featured tactical combat.  The AI in tactical combat was weak.

So it is with great anticipation I took to Endless Space 2.  Most of the imrpovements from Endless Legend have carried over, but I don't feel the game is quite as good.  The game has an elegant simplicity to it, which allows you to play without a lot of the annoyance of micromanagement.  However, this simplicity is a facade covering a deep, rich mechanics system. Choices with heroes are meaningful and have lasting impact.  

Combat.
There is no tactical combat.  You move a fleet around and engage the enemy fleets.  You get to apply a single buff of your choosing to the combat.  While I think having tactical combat is probably too much when so many ships are involved (and I applaud the choice), it would have been nice to be able to apply a little more diplomacy.  Ground combat involves sending your ship's crews to the surface to fight.  You can specialize ships to carry more crew and get advantages in ground combat. There are few ships hulls (5 in fact).  The real variety comes form modules you can get from tech or exploring.  I wish there were more depth here.

Overexpansion.
The overexpansion mechanic is mostly generous.  This apparently was a major sticking point for many fans, and so the limits were relaxed.  But the original problem remains.  If you exceed the limit too far (such as by conquering too aggressively), your entire economy will tank due to unhappiness and likely be impossible to recover.

Variety.
All the civilizations play differently.  This goes beyond having two or so specific bonuses, or a unique unit or two.  This is largely achieved by having multiple resources -- food, production, gold (""dust""), science, and diplomacy.  It allows for tweaks that don't break the game.  This adds replay value.

Quests. 
There is a questing system to keep you from getting bored.  It gives you task to help shape your civilization.  PRO: there are race specific chains, a lot of variety in minor quests, and some galaxy wide events. The event ""story does not dominate the game"".  CON: I would have liked more variety in galactic events.  I also don't like the quest  where half the races lose ability to recruit heroes.  IMO, that's dumb.

Expansions
Vaulters.  This new race (from Endless Legend) retains their teleporting ability and penchant for science.  As an expansion race, I feel they were intentionally given a slight edge.  Teleporting mid game is OP.

Behemoths. Endless developers seem to have a kink for extremely large units.  Fotios all but broke Endless Legend.  These are very large stand-alone ships that serve as economic or military giants.  This is poorly done.

Horatio.  Another race, I did not play them.


Cons
* the graphics for ""fog of unexplored"" is barely discernable from galactic background.  There are no graphic tweaks to change this.  What's worse, seeing where you haven't explored can be critical.
* UI gripes.  There is no tool for managing moving populations between planets.  There is no tool to visualize this.  Whoever guards a star system is the one who gets to invade.  But you can't take this lock from your allies or even request it.  This is of critical importance when facing pirates.  Your ally will guard them, but not invade.  You can't see the upgrades installed on a system; a conquered system may have things you can't build.  
* Depth of the game is also it's frustrating downfall.  Some mechanics aren't documented.  (One tech gives you wormholes for faster travel; it's not mentioned in the tech, because it was combined with another during development.)  Other mechanics are vaguely described in broken English.  Typical problems with translations: you can disband your fleet (which means to put them in space dock).  Disbanding them for gold is another button.  ""Move a ship to a system"" means to move it there.  Possibly also disband it into spacedock.  At least we have the internet to help us.",1563805771,1563805771,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

As I have gotten older I try to avoid them because they take up to much of my time, but every year or so I will pick up a 4x game when I have some free time.

Endless Space was that pick. On its surface, ES does all the right things. Unique factions, a tech tree that offers you different paths to victory exploration, ship customization, etc. However, it seems as if all these options were put in place by a developer that knows what it takes to make a 4x game but not what makes a 4x game fun.

Ship customization was interesting at first but is quite limited. Perhaps fighting against real people is where this format shines but against the AI, even on a higher setting, just making a well-balanced ship with the biggest guns usually wins every time.

While 4x games are never known for great AI, ES's  AI is downright frustrating, there seems to be no rhyme or reason for their actions. Their ability to duck into war and out of war with you anytime is simply an oversight on the developers' part.

Also building a civilization is just so... boring. There is no excitement as you watch your civ grow because there is no visual candy as you colonize the stars, just numbers. Exploration, outside the first few turns gets stale very quickly. For all the faults that the Civ series has, they made exploration and growing your empire fun. ES I think does a better job at implementing certain aspects of exploring, dealing with pirates and so on than Civ, but it's just not enjoyable despite being a superior system.

Endless Space is not a bad game, but as in all my reviews the score of each game boils down to one question, is it fun? And the answer for ES in no not really. Great music through. 4/10",1533942221,1563758894,False,2,0,0.530449628829956055,0,True,False,False

There are a lot of reviews out there with a lot of details so read those if you want a more detailed breakdown. From my point view, the direct competitor to this game is Stellaris. I don't think any of those two games is ""better"" than the other, they have different strengths.
ES2 looks prettier than Stellaris. Stellaris has deeper game systems (I hope you like numbers... lots of them). In Stellaris it is way easier to have an immense empire while in ES2 you will have to monitor closely those overcolonization penalties. In ES2 combat is way easier to understand and to organize. Economy is easier to balance in Stellaris thanks to the Governors, but in ES2 is simpler to understand where is your money going.

Bottom line, ES2 is a prettier, friendlier and maybe simpler version of Stellaris, and to be honest I really love it. Also, in ES2 you can build an Obliterator which allows you to fling sector-destroying intergalactic nukes and I think it's difficult to say No to a game that gives you that <3.

It takes a bit of effort to learn how it all works, but it's worth it. There are multiple systems interacting with each other, and generally each system is not too complex, but the fact that there are so many of them makes the game quite complex as a whole. You've got the population mechanics tying into the politics system. You've got planetary exploration and colonisation. You've got the Hero system where you have your named characters that can be in charge of fleets or govern your planetary systems, providing various benefits. And there's the events and quests that pop up that makes you choose between generally two different options that can sometimes have a fairly big impact on your campaign moving forwards.

I really enjoy the combat system, where you need to design your ships and put them together into fleets to counter your enemies based on the information you have about them. Whenever a battle starts, you'll need to choose a tactic to use, which will take many things into account, such as the optimum range of your and your enemies weapons, as well as the type of weapon. If you take your time to look into the fleets and exactly what the tactics do, you can turn a potentially losing battle into victory, or a costly victory into a flawless one. Sometimes the seemingly best tactic can put you at a greater risk than necessary, so it pays to actually look into it properly. The game provides various information screens to help you with this.

The diplomacy system is also really interesting. You start off in a ""cold war"" against all factions, and need to exert pressure on them to make sure they don't take advantage of you. Pressure can be anything from just having a stronger empire to acting confidently in your interactions with them.

The research tree can be a bit overwhelming at first glance, but the game helps you by providing a few suggestions on what to research next, which you can of course ignore if you prefer. There's also a search feature to help you find a tech that gives you what you're looking for. I'm always feeling like I'm making real choices on what to prioritise, and some techs can unlock entirely new game systems, such as the marketplace where you can either buy and sell according to your own needs, or attempt to make a play to earn some extra currency. Prices fluctuate based on the real supply and demand of the players, as well as various events to simulate the supply and demand among other sectors that aren't represented in the game.

Each faction starts with one primary race, as well as a minority, and throughout the course of the game you will gain additional ones as you conquer or assimilate systems, as well as through random events. Each race provides certain benefits (both individually and on your empire as a whole once you reach a certain number of them), and prefer certain climates. They also lean towards certain political ideologies, so you may sometimes want to provide the conditions for one race to grow while another is stunted, to help ensure your preferred party stays in power. The game provides you with ways to do this with or without violence, depending on how you want to run things. You can also attempt some gerrymandering by simply moving people around.

The factions themselves are extremely varied, sometimes completely bypassing certain game systems and possibly replacing them with others. In addition to the gameplay differences, they also each have a unique main questline to explore their story. Some factions are easier to play than others, and the game helpfully gives you this information when starting a new campaign, so you don't need to worry about picking a really difficult one to start out with unless you want to. Because each faction is so varied, there aren't all that many of them. Still, I feel like this is a good tradeoff, as it actually ensures that each one is worth playing in order to experience the game fully.

On top of all of that there are a good amount of races to choose without being overwhelming. Some races play with different mechanics than others (i.e. not settling on systems permanently).

Fast-forward a few weeks and if you're like me you will have sunk easily a couple hundred hours into the game and picked-up all of the DLC.

The game is immersive from its storyline to its faction-specific quests.  If you're looking for something different, try playing a new game making different decisions along the way.  Each faction provides a varied play style.  The Empire is by far the easiest faction to pick up and run with.

Besides having unique factions, the atmosphere is also very good. the Endless universe has a lot of lore for those who care about that kind of thing and each individual technology or building has some short description or ""flavor text"" to go along with it. Also, the Music by FlyByNo rocks.

Awsome soundtrack that helps you go through even through the most boring session of a campaign, even though there won't be many.

Sci-fi setting... check

Fun... check!

Well, this game is a real masterpiece. It's highly addictive, with unique playstyle for every faction. RNG works well here, every playtrough is different. 
AI? Clever bastards, that's for sure. They strike where you're vulnerable, they smile even when stabbing you with dagger in the dark. Oh yeah, even allies! (if your ally fires obliterator missile, be sure that your system is shielded) Diplomacy is well done and trust me, you'll use it a lot. Of course, you can be space genocide maniac, but don't be surprised if this bites you in your rectum. Like I've said, your opponents can be very tough adversaries.
Quests are fun, they spice up the playtrough in a right way and if you complete them, you can get sweet advantages. Did I mentioned exploration? Heroes? Possibility to modify ships as you want? Lore and story, unique for every race/faction, even for the minor ones? The list can go on for a while, that's for sure...
Negatives? Well, surely the Obliterator. Ain't sure if it's bug or feature, but your allies, who really like you, tend to fire on your home system this exterminatus thingie with cold hearted determination. You can do nothing about it, just make sure your system is protected by shield and Citadel. Some factions were broken, then boosted and shortly after nerfed, so be prepared to have hard time with them (poor Vodyani, for example).

Every faction (race) you play basically plays differently to the others, it's not just parameter adjustments, but the gameplay is completely different.

Some don't have colony ships and rely on buying planets, and another one has a single re-usable colony ship. You get the idea. Every faction needs to be played a different way. 
Additionally every race has its own quest-line, which you are free to follow or ignore at your peril. And there are a number of galaxy wide co-operative and competitive quests between all the factions. The galaxy is also populated by a number of minor factions which can do both, control independent systems and become citizens of your empire, again, each one with specific effects on your planets. 
And speaking of planets, there are all sorts, hot, cold, lava, gas, sterile, fertile, etc. And obviously some races have affinities for some of these planetary types, so you can even micromanage your empire's population.

Cons

The DLC's I would love to have would improve on the current mechanics, say make politics more important. Heroes more influential. Maybe add some district mechanic for the late game to counter the micromanagement trap of late game.

The last game I played in this genre before I got Stellaris and Endless Space 2 (simultaneously) was Ascendancy a “little” while ago. Having said that my review might be a bit of an implied comparison between the 3 games. Also, to mention: I finished Endless Space 2 once, playing the Vodyani faction and I tried the Vaulters faction for a bit.

What I like:

-Distinct races with sometimes more or less radically different traits and approaches to how to play the game, which could be fleshed out much more….
-Great graphics (for my taste at least): I like the abstract and “graphic design” like UI and most of the ship designs too.
-Special events, trying to loosen up a somewhat repetitive element of pure scientific, exploration and conquer game mechanic during mid game.
-Space Battle. You give some basic formation/tactical orders according to how you fitted your fleet, e.g. long range and then the battle plays out by itself. However, I would prefer to be able to assign each ship in the fleet a certain tactical role, which could be improved over time via research.
-Research tree in 4 quadrants based on disciplines like military, economy, etc. You have the whole research tree and outcome in front of you. Meaning you can plan if you know where you want/need to go to. 
-Background story and lore: There is lot of effort in lore building, in form of specific ships, music, comics, story etc. Some of it is quite unique. I do hope this will be built upon in form of other games or sequels.

What I wish could be better:
-Even more race specific: There are some unique research elements to the races, but it could be more. Also, when you settle a planetary system all elements are the same but could be even more racially specific which would may be increase the replay value. Also, the graphics could be more differentiated since they are mostly 2-D (and little bit less effort than complete 3D graphics).
-Replay value: Even though the races are different, and some have rather distinct game mechanics, after finishing with the Vodyani, I don’t see a real reason to try other factions. Why should I try now Vaulters (shortcut in travel), The United Empire (Industry), Sophos (research), Lumeris (trade), Horatio (food) which feel a bit like a different flavor of the same? May be the Unfallen or Cravers are different enough.
-Faction interaction consistency: I see the Vodyani as an “evil” faction. They don’t care much about everybody else, other than being a form of resource. However, I won the game in collaboration with other factions. Here, I’m not sure whether a lot of factions would collaborate with a “spiritual Borg” like race which assimilates/absorbs others. Instead it would be logical that the other factions form an alliance against me. This obviously would lead to a much more asymmetrical game play and makes game design way more complicated. 
-Research: At times it’s hard to find what to research next if you want to reach a specific ability e.g. bigger fleet, faster travel. The search tool helps though.
-Midgame: At a certain moment I just pressed on research whatever, fly wherever, press end turn, repeat. I think there needs to be more going on in the midgame.

Summary:  There are probably other 4x strategy games which are more fine tunable/hardcore but if you are looking for an experience which is complex enough, yet easy enough to get into paired with some great atmosphere due to unique factions then you should give it a try.

It combines the excitement of manage your own empire and the power of decision on an entire race, planet, galaxy, etc.

The possibilities are endless, just like the empire that you are able to manage across the game, the freedom that it's given to you brings quite amazing experiences, I've never seen any single game that allow you to change neither the political opinion of your people nor the government of your empire.

Because of the game system (turns system) you're not allowed to play real time fights, that's a pity, because In my opinion It is the only thing that the game needs to be the best game of strategy that I've ever played. About this, I'd like to say that It would be great for the game to implement more ship designs.

Pluses:
Much interesting mechanics.
Really different races.
Destruction of planets and stars.
Terraforming.
Quests.
System of heroes really nice and intresting balanced.
Good communication from developers: games2gather has many dev blogs, discussion and, sometimes, voting for next dlc.
Minuses:
Not original. If u played alot 4x strategies u will see well knowe parts and mehanics.
Only autobattle. So player can't influent for results of battles. Mainly players' economics and selected evolution path deside who will win even in battles. 
Reason to bye:
Game is not complexive, not much micromanagment - if u not familiar with 4x it's good game to start with.
Good replayability. Many diffirent races with real diffirent play style.
Reason no to bye:
U expirienced 4x player and  looking for real comlexive game.
If u wante tactict game without economic.",1561841160,1561841160,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I rarely have my breath taken away by games these days, but Endless Space 2 has done this many times over. The artwork, the creativity behind the world and lore are just mesmerizing and all the factions you get to play feel unique and immersive thanks to their respective story quests and special traits/units.

The combat system may not be the most enticing part regardless of its strategic approach, but the political, terraforming and overall exploration of the galaxy more than makes up for that.

I would have included this in my main paragraph, but I do have to bring up one of the most outstanding part of the game for me: the music. If you can, just go and listen to some of the tracks, I'm sure it will put you in the mood of what this game encompasses.",1561839986,1561839986,True,15,0,0.622977852821350098,0,True,False,False
