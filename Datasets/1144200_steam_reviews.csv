Not recommended if you're looking for more frantic, carefree FPS action since this game will chew you up and spit you out if you're not careful.

Presentation:  Gritty, unsettling, fairly realistic (if not often dreary) atmosphere provides an excellent backdrop to each mission.  Story telling is rather passive and there aren't any central characters or anything which to ground the story, so it ends up being little more than a footnote.

Graphics:  Beautiful lighting and weapon models along with some pretty cool animations for your SWAT squad.  Individual character models are only so-so with some stiff and somewhat buggy animation on suspects (especially civilians and hostages).  The game is intensely immersive, however, and it's easy to look past any imperfections because of the rich environmental detail that really pulls you in.  Prepare to be unnerved.

Sound:  Soundtrack adds to the strangely unsettling atmosphere and evokes a sense of someone's sanity slowly unraveling while also heightening moments of tense action.  Firearms are loud and intimidating, as they would be in real life, and ambient sound effects add to the already incredible atmosphere.  Immersive is an understatement.

Gameplay:  Slow and methodical, with a heavy emphasis on clearing rooms and detaining suspects.  Squad AI, overall, is very competent and can be relied on to carry out commands effectively with minimal loss of life (for your team, that is).  On the negative side, seeking out every last bit of evidence to achieve high mission scores become really laborious and tedious; would be helpful if squad AI did a better of of carrying out the ""Search and Secure"" command after clearing the map of hostiles in order to cut down on the amount of wandering around the player has to do.  Would also be nice if during pre-mission briefing, the map could be used to set player-defined waypoints that would appear in-game to help the player more efficiently move around the level.  But these are minor complaints; overall the game is great fun and highly satisfying.

Replay Value:  Virtually unlimited if playing multiplayer.  If sticking with single-player, it's much more limited.  You can unlock some items with which to customize your character by replaying missions to achieve high scores.  There's also an ever-growing library of custom-made maps that can be downloaded from various modding resources.  Otherwise, once you've beaten the campaign, there's not much incentive for another play-through outside of the your own interest in squad-based tactical gameplay.",1708922279,1708922279,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

-Content 4/10 ""decent selection of guns and gadgets but the most guns fell identical""

-Campaign 0/10 ""there is none""

-Enemy AI or civilian  4/10 ""i wanted to give this a higher score but some times he ai will just sand there after hard breaching a room and look around when your yelling for compliance . there is a lot of clunky and immersion breaking things that happen with the ai . also with maps that you would expect alot of civilians there are only a couple.

-Team Ai 6/10 some times works well but can be finicky and buggy

-Multiplayer 4/10 "" with duo there are no ai and there is no option to fix that . like inviting a player and have them pick what element they are on . not a problem with great players or more friends

-performance 3/10 with a 3080, ryzen 5 5600x, ddr 4  32g  3200hz some maps dip below 40 fps (hospital) med to high settings

there are so many issues with the visuals from slightly dark rooms being pitch black but when you get close or use a zoomed scope you can see in the hole room just fine . then leaning your armor will sometimes detach from you body . 

TLDR ""4/10 game "" i looked like they where going in the right detection but dont buy this it isnt worth your money they are already talking about dlc and they are missing so meany things that they promised ""watch a youtube vid on this its actually sad"". there are so many other good games to play dont waste time or money on this hot garbage.",1708880648,1708880648,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I cannot play for more than 1 hour without an issue of some sort with the game client. 
There's no online game lobby manager and the only way to link with players is to use a private lobby. There are also a lot of issues with the online public lobbies, for instance there's this guy that hosts a public lobby and runs a recording of some weird preaching and never actually plays the game. And since the game uses some random behind the scene dice roll to find you a public lobby, you can end up in that lobby multiple times without a way to control anything. 
Add random client crashes and issues and that makes for a very poor online gaming experience. Based on that alone I can't recommend.

Patience is a virtue to an extent in the gaming world nowadays, much as I'm not a fan of the constant string of Early Access stuff. Every game that enters that dreaded stage always has a few cards stacked against it, and no game has had the same problem as Ready or Not. Much like Ground Branch, the tactical shooter market is filled with a variety of long haul development games that are still not finished after half a decade of work. And one that's aping more the ever loved SWAT series has more expectations stacked against it. I didn't think VOID had it in them, to be bluntly honest. What made SWAT work was not simply being a funny police shooter, but being a game willing to show casual horror. 

SWAT 4's remembered more for the Fairfax Residence and the Tenements than it was gameplay. You don't remember having to annoyingly shuffle your AI around and deal with bullet spongey enemies as you do the game showing you a graveyard of dead cultist kids and hearing the searing flinch of your team upon reporting it. That took balls in 2005, and I didn't expect VOID to do that. Especially given how generic the old 2020-2021 era RoN builds were.

And then they rolled out Neon Tomb. 

I'm already dealing with heavily armed terrorists and now I get to hear every cell phone in the club going off. 

Ready or Not is a game that knew where to pull its punches, although I still have some relative concerns as to where it's going to go now that we've crossed 1.0. Keeping the gameplay relatively simple was one, improving the movement and AI from SWAT 4 was another. And thankfully dialing the enemy AI back from the earlier 2023~ betas was the best move, so I can complete Relapse without having an aneurysm. It's a game that rewards both some level of careful planning alongside allowing you to go cavalier if you need to. And has rebounded into having some of the slickest level design and pacing I've seen in any game in a few years, let alone a tactical shooter with more AR's than a gun influencer's Instagram reel. It has it's issues for sure, the enemy is still quite good at hearing you and you'll get rewarded for being loud with a sawn off to the skull, and the overall plot is clunky. But I'm not going to forget Voll Health House. And that's more important long term than generic tactical movement mechanics.

This game had so much potential, but the 1.0 release has been SO bad, which is honestly made worse by the fact that it was in Early Access for, what, 2 or 3 years? And we didn't get any updates for well over 6 months. When 1.0 came around, we were inundated with bugs, poor optimisation, cracked AI, and a bunch of new mechanics that were so poorly implemented, they're still broken now. The game looked, ran and played better when it was in Early Access.

It's been two months since the initial release, and honestly there's been fuck all progress in making this game half-way enjoyable. Oh, and you have to reinstall the entire game every time they release a ""hotfix"" (Yea, that's what they're calling these 5gb+ updates, they're ""hotfixes"", not patches. Even though a hotfix implies a level of speed that is not present within Void.)

Stay well away until they A, stop releasing patches that force you to reinstall the entire game, and B, make some actual substantial progress in rectifying the games blatant issues with AI scaling, optimisation, and bug fixing. These issues should have been fixed LONG before 1.0, they were present during Early Access, and now they're [b]worse[/b].

When you shoot an enemy, the weapon they were holding can end up anywhere, including in the floor, not on it, in it. Good fun though. The downside is that civilians give you a lot of lip when you order them to put their hands up, one even pulls out a phone and snaps pictures of you (You can bet I've dreamed about shooting that one with a shotgun).

Edit: AI ""helpers"" AAARRRGH! Nuisance at best! When you try to just arrest suspects, they gun them down like there's no tomorrow. When you just go in to do whatever, they'll happily stand there and let you get shot by the suspect. Also, one of the AI shot me yesterday, I was behind a wall hiding from a suspect shooting and the AI straight up shot me.

Update February 25, 2024: At this point, Do Not Recommend, The suspects shoot THROUGH vehicles, and I don't mean windows, I mean through trucks and trailers. Granted, bullets will go through, but, they're also accurate through items with no line of sight. If this is the game play devs want, give me a 120mm mortar or a M249 so I can just wipe out the entire map.  We're not going for realism at this point. 

The AI have gotten dumber, if possible too. Even if there is a lot of room to walk around you, they have a path and they do NOT deviate from it, ever. Creating tactically incorrect situations. They REALLY want to walk in front of you, even if you're hugging a corner providing cover they want to walk in front of you.

At this point, I'm just clearing levels with no regard for arrests, it's flat out Murder Sim at this point, cause AI will stand and shout at suspects as they full auto kill you, NOT realistic.",1671329975,1708858810,False,0,0,0.491880804300308228,0,True,False,True

It wasn't so during all the developpement (didn't feel that way at least, especially concerning the AI aiming).
- AI aiming is ****, complete garbage for this year. You almost always get shot at first before realizing why. Through bushes (it hits you, you don't know where it comes from, you die and have to restart), through crates (it hits you, you don't know where it comes from, you die, and have to restart), through walls (yes... it doesn't hit you normally but makes all your sight blurry so you can't do anything appart from trying to understand where it comes from while running back)
- Rambos refusing to go down even if they don't have armor and you are at your third jhp center mass on them (oh they keep shooting at you in the meanwhile, no probs)
- John Wicks one hit you as soon as you open the door (even if you saw them with the camera wand, you opened the door with explosives, you flashed them. You can't see anything with the smoke and your friendly AI doesn't react but they still know exactly where to shoot)
- you can't surprise anyone as all AI expects you weapon in hand (even at home yes, no rest for the brave...)
- light is all at your disadvantage as you can't see **** when you go from light to darkness or vice versa (when you have NVs on) but AI do not have any problem seeing you anywhere
- I spent a full mag trying to headshot a ""baddie"", one shot every 1 sec aiming the center of the head with a scope (40m away approx.). 2 team members were doing the same. We didn't hit him, he hit me several times firing full auto...
- armor doesn't mean anything, you get plastered almost as fast with the heavy armor on, you don't even feel the difference when you try to move with a light armor (supposed to make you more agile)
- your friendly AI is supposed to have a progression skill. You rarely see it happen as you lose all your team KIA or (more often) they leave you on the next missions as they are all demoralized considering you get one mission right every 4 or 5 of your tries (and their morale goes to the abyss).
It just feels random at some point, and most of all, everything, Everything is at your disadvantage.
Finally, you are supposed to be able to finish a mission with less than lethal ways. You never do that... Or you can try days for just one mission (applies for more than half the missions). They just don't care! They see you: they kill you the next 2 seconds (if closer than 10m).

It seems to me that a lot is not really explained...regarding your loadout, your armour and what works or does'nt.  I like that too, cuz you will figure it out.   On a couple missions I changed out my loadout for me and my team and done it RIGHT the second time around......very rewarding.  
What I don't like about this game is the frequency that it crashes, or never even starts correctly.  My PC is way above recommended spec for this with an i9 and a GTX2080 but I keep finding myself looking for another new solution to the crashes every couple days.  I see a LOT of chat about it on the net, here in Steam, Reddit and beyond.  In that regard this game feels very unfinished.  I saw a warning pop-up today saying it may take minutes to compile a modded map while stuck loading................it was an official map!!  I've not tried a mod of any sort and everywhere I'm reading mods must be deleted from your .pak folders.

After the last update, game is randomly crashing.


=========================

-- Update 2023-12-24 --

EN:
Oh my god, what have you done with this phenomenal police action simulator? This new version of the game is a total mistake.
1./ Less realistic enemy behavior, who flawlessly know where you are, even if you're sneaking at night and can barely see them through night vision goggles, and they just came around the corner, far from you.

2./ Enemies, dressed in t-shirts, are so bullet-resistant that you need to unload a whole series into them. They are as bulletproof as I am in my full armor with inserts. Even if you shoot them in the upper torso/head. The game is very random here: sometimes the same enemy, on the same map, is down with two bullets, and sometimes I've unloaded a series into them, and they just stagger and start to raise their weapon again.

3./ Infinite ammo of enemies: sometimes one shoots at you like crazy and has an endless magazine as if they had a weapon from '80s action movies (although sometimes they do shoot a few times and you can see they are reloading).

4./ Rating (evaluation system) after the mission. Sometimes I rushed in, did everything haphazardly and got an 'S' rating, and sometimes I did everything right but during the mission, the enemy shot a civilian, and I got a negative rating for violence on a civilian (wtf?). The worst part is that the game is buggy and sometimes allows you to finish the mission (vote up), the tablet shows all points in green, and I receive a 'failed' for not saving all civilians. Developers, something seems to be in need of fixing here.

5./ Bots in the team do not respond correctly to commands. For example, I'm under fire and ask for help 'cover me', and he replies that nothing like that is happening to me that would require his help. Or I say 'search & secure' and just a few days ago, they could spread out across the map and search for things like weapons or suspects to handcuff. At this moment, in response to my command, the bot confirms but does nothing.

More missions? Yes. More complex behavior of bots in single-player? Yes, but I can't say anything more positive about this new version and about the multiplayer game, where other players are weaker in this game than bots, and additionally, they shoot each other.
All weapons are the same (although there are many), and pistols are useless you fire the whole magazine at an enemy, and they still stand, as if I were shooting blanks.

I previously wrote, ""Developers, just give us back the earlier version of the game,"" but now it probably wouldn't do any good.

This new game is not worth any price, except for being given away for free.
Even Fortnite (yuck!) is better now.


PL:
O mój boże, co wyście zrobili z tym rewelacyjnym symulatorem akcji policyjnej?
Ta nowa wersja gry to jakaś totalna pomyłka.
1./ Mniej realistyczne zachowania przeciwników, którzy bezbłędnie wiedzą gdzie jesteś, nawet jeśli skradasz się w nocy i ledwie ich widzisz przez gogle z noktowizorem, a oni akurat dopiero co wyszli zza rogu, daleko od ciebie.

2./ Wrogowie, którzy ubrani są w t-shirt, są na tyle odporni na pociski, że trzeba władować w takiego całą serię. Są tak samo kuloodporni jak ja w swoim pełnym pancerzu z wkładkami. Nawet jeśli strzelisz im w górną część tułowia/ głowę. Gra jest tu bardzo losowa: czasem ten sam przeciwnik, na tej samej planszy jest na dwa pociski, a czasem wpakowałem mu serię, a on tylko zachwiał się i zaczął podnosić na mnie broń ponownie.

3./ Nieskończona amunicja wrogów: czasem taki strzela do ciebie jak opętany i ma nieskończony magazynek jakby miał broń z filmów akcji z lat '80-tych (chociaż czasem faktycznie strzeli parę razy i widać, że przeładowuje).

4./ Rating (system oceniania) po misji. Czasem wpadałem, robiłem wszystko byle jak i miałem ocenę 'S', a czasem zrobiłem wszystko co trzeba ale w trakcie misji wróg zastrzelił cywila, ocenę ujemną za przemoc na cywilu dostałem ja (wtf?). Najgorsze jest to, że gra jest zbugowana i pozwala czasem na zakończenie misji (vote up), tablet pokazuje wszystkie punkty na zielono, a ja otrzymuję 'failed' za nieuratowanie wszystkich cywili. Deweloperzy, coś tu jest chyba do naprawy.

5./ Boty w zespole nie reagują prawidłowo na polecenia. Np. jestem pod ostrzałem i proszę o pomoc 'cover me', a on odpowiada mi, że nic takiego się ze mną nie dzieje, żeby musiał mi pomagać. Albo mówię 'seach & secure' i jeszcze parę dni temu, potrafili rozejść się po planszy i powyszukiwać np. broń czy podejrzanych do założenia kajdanek. W tym momencie na moje polecenie bot odpowiada, że potwierdza ale nic nie robi.


Więcej misji? Tak. Bardziej rozbudowane zachowanie botów na single player? Tak, ale nie mogę powiedzieć nic więcej dobrego o tej nowej wersji jak i o grze multiplayer, gdzie inni gracze są słabsi w tę grę od botów, a na dodatek strzelają do siebie nawzajem.
Wszystkie bronie są takie same (chociaż jest ich dużo), a pistolety bezużyteczne wystrzelasz cały magazynek w przeciwnika, a on nadal stoi, jakbym strzelał ślepakami.

Wcześniej pisałem, że ""Deweloperzy, po prostu oddajcie nam wcześniejszą wersję gry"" ale teraz to chyba już nic by to nie dało.

Ta nowa gra nie jest warta żadnej ceny, z wyjątkiem bycia rozdawaną za darmo.
Nawet Fortnite (tfu!) jest teraz lepszy.

=========================


-- The very first version of the game. --

EN:
For sure, the game is challenging: suspects can be literally everywhere and shoot, for example, from a mansion into the building when they see you through a window.

The only downside is the area with meth-filled junkie houses, where our squad has to find two specific meth packages (they are in random places). It's nonsense, and most people leave the game at that point, not waiting for the end.

Nonsense because it's investigative officers who should be searching for such little packages, not an entry team.
Nonsense because even if we were to secure the drugs, in the area we're storming, houses are full of this substance, so what difference does it make which ones we secure?
----------------------------------------------------------------

PL:
Na pewno gra jest wymagająca: podejrzani potrafią być dosłownie wszędzie i strzelić np. z dworu, do środka budynku, kiedy zobaczą Cię przez okno.

Jedyny minus to obszar z pełnymi metamfetaminy domami ćpunów, kiedy nasz oddział musi odnaleźć dwa konkretne pakunki mety (są w losowych miejscach). To jakaś bzdura i większość ludzi wychodzi wtedy z rozgrywki, nie czekając na zakończenie.

Bzdura bo od szukania takich paczuszek są oficerowi śledczy, a nie grupa wejściowa.
Bzdura bo nawet jeśli to my mielibyśmy zabezpieczyć narkotyki, to szturmowanej przez nas okolicy, domy są pełne tej substancji, więc co za różnica, które z nich zabezpieczymy?",1701069487,1708787553,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

I bought this game somewhere around the end of 2021. Mere months before Adam update.
 	I was stunned by this early access version, even when it had huge problems. After the Adam update, I had huge hopes for 1.0. release. Played it both alone and with friends.  Development briefings made the expected 1.0. release look awesome. Thats why the reality is even more painful.
     
[h1] THE GOOD THINGS: [/h1]

Ready or Not is a beautiful game. Both graphically and on audio side. Weapon animations, models and sounds are just top notch.  Main police beautiful and AI companions got a little overhaul, which made them more reliable. Level selection is big, with 18 levels to play through. Weapons and character customization in quite varied. PC exclusive development can be felt with some advanced movement options. Most of the gameplay mechanics are more advanced than what 90% of this tactical genre offers. Unfortunately, that’s everything.


     
[h1] THE BAD THINGS: [/h1]
     There are lot of them. Here are a few things that I have to warn you about.

       [b] PERFORMACE IS BAD. [/b]
One time you’re running through hallway with stable 90 frames per second on highest graphics and next time you turn the corner you’re in a gunfight with suspect that runs on 15 FPS. Devs said that they would fix it shortly after release, but as far as I know, they only added one option to graphics settings that will help with frames just a little bit. For some strange reason, DLSS on ultra performance does almost nothing with frames for me. I’m talking about like 5-6 frames difference between DLSS and Classic.

       [b] SUSPECT AI [/b]

They messed it up. That’s another thing that they didn’t even touch since ADAM update.  Suspects do not have a single problem with one hitting you the millisecond that you enter some room.
	Other thing is the awareness of suspects. Every time that I put mirror gun under the door suspects just stopped in place and hypnotized the door. Suspects do not even react to getting shot. Animations are the same on every hit. There is no difference between you hitting them in torso, or hitting them in limbs either in animations, or reactions. 
	Aggressiveness of AI is brutal. You want to tell me that some random junkie with handgun doesn’t have problem with being yelled at by 5 officers with full auto weapons? Then proceeds to open fire at us, sometimes even rushing me and my whole squad the second we spawn on the map.
And then of course wallhacks. Just being shot through walls, doors, staircases. You will feel it on hospital map, where suspect will hit you through staircases, or solid walls.

	[b] SCENARIOS AND THEIR DESIGN [/b]

I can’t talk about this without comparing 23 megabytes to Fairfax residence. Both levels do have very similar situation. One suspect, armed, hidden in his safe space with hostage. What’s the difference you ask? Fairfax residence plays as its written. You raid one house in the middle of the nowhere, arrest one civilian, in this case mother of Lawrence Fairfax and then you and your squad proceed into the garage, where you’ll find that Lawrence build a whole underground complex to rape his victims in. His spawn in this complex is completely random, sometimes he’s hidden immediately behind door into his complex, sometimes he’s hidden behind curtains, sometimes he’s hidden with his victim on the very end of a tunnel.
 There is only one suspect that can potentially kill you, yet by the design alone, this whole level has better design and feels more real than most of the Ready or Not scenarios. The adrenaline rush and that anxiety that you feel in Fairfax Residence cannot be compared to anything in RoN
	Now for the 23 megabytes. Intel says that there’s only him and one hostage, then there’s a picture of few suspicious men, but description says that those are civilians. Can somebody in the name of God then tell me, WHY ARE THERE 12 OTHER GANG MEMBERS WITH FULLY AUTOMATIC WEAPONS? Nowhere in the trailer or in the intel was said something about whole gang just chilling in this apartment complex. 

                [b] THIS TEAM IS CAPABLE OF CREATING GREAT SCENARIOS [/b]

The only map that I can say that I enjoyed was Hide and Seek, and it’s not just from the gameplay side. I feel that Hide and Seek was the only mission that developers finished completely. From a huge amount of soft point objectives to ENVIROMENTAL STORY TELLING and smart hostile placement. After previous 17 missions of just clicking mouse on hostiles and points of interest, I was positively surprised when [spoiler] after you search most of the containers looking for weapon supplies, one will contain missing people, it’s one of the soft point objectives. You will report this human trafficking to TOC and at the same time, completely different division will contact you, creating an argument, where you want to extract these people while the different division wants you to lock them back in the container, so they can then take the container with them. You will agree and lock them up, with your character ending the whole conversation on well talk about this after operation. [/spoiler]
At one point I even expected a cutscene to play after this mission, where we would see situation escalate. But I was just hit with credits. It’s the one and only mission, that has this amount of polish in it. If every mission and situation was like this, if could ignore most of the problems that I have with this game.

            [b] REPETITION. [/b]

It’s always arrest this guy, kill these people, secure civilians, press interact button on this point of interest. In SWAT 4, you had these, then levels that required you to disarm explosives under time limit, active shooter mode, where hostile NPCs move from room to room shooting every civilian on sight, decreasing score after every dead civilian, then instant action mode, that threw you into some of these scenarios with completely different objective locations, traps, enemy spawns, and restrictions every single time. It created infinite replay value that was even more extended with modes such as Back to Los Angeles, First Responders and Elite force. In Ready or Not, I will finish level and that’s it. Spawns are almost the same every time.

      [b] EQUIPMENT PROBLEMS AND WEAPON DELETION [/b]

I do not understand, why heavy armour with steel plates still gets perfectly penetrated with Glock. In Early Access I did not have a single problem with it. It made for some funny scenarios where I just put on the heaviest armour and shotgun and annihilated every single suspect in that mission. SMGs and handguns are just unusable on some of the missions, with suspects taking more than 10 bullets in their torso, sometimes even head and still walking. Other thing that I immediately saw was that some weapons that I played with in early access are just not in this game anymore. Mirror gun is just useless without Fullscreen mode because picture in picture mode lowers resolution so much, that it’s impossible to see what’s on the other side. Again, game from 2004 did not have this problem. Flashbangs are 50/50. Sometimes it will hit enemy standing 5 meters from it, sometimes it hits enemy right in the head and does nothing.


[h1] VERDICT: [/h1]

Right now, I do not recommend RoN in this state. I’m confused why all those that gave this release positive reviews never mention these problems. Do I have some extremely old version or am I just the only one with these problems? Do I recommend this game right now? No and I think that I will not recommend it for a long time. With devs focusing more on DLCs than patches. This game has a lot of potential, but from devlogs that are released on steam, it looks like that the main focus now is to monetize this game with DLCs as much as possible and actually patching this game being more of an afterthought.",1703340800,1708777190,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

2) AI. In the previous version, AI had some minor issues like wallbanging and insane fire rate, but these were manageable and the game was challenging. In the latest update the AI was simply destroyed. Reaction time is way too slow and AI is much less aggressive. There is no difficulty anymore, you can easily solo maps and play this like Call of Duty.
3) Content. Much of the content that was promised during early access was not delivered. Some features were even removed like the ability for suspects to hide in closets or under beds.

Gun play is good and graphics are very good (for most I have to play on low and things look very bad on low) The AI leaves a lot to be desired. Strange movement, unrealistic and unfun accuracy from the enemies, and enemies refuse to give up even when its suicidal. Swat 4 really nailed this, enemies gave up when you had the drop on them and resisting would result in their death. In Ready or Not they never really do that, and choose to shoot you even when it would lead to their immediate death. This makes sense for terrorists and such but for the gas station robbers to fight that takes away from the fun.

The weapon library is also very bland, would like to see more than just ARs for rifles, possibly bring back some of the older guns that were cut.

Now, the bad out of the way first: the tutorial is extremely buggy and not really reflective of the gameplay at all. The squad command sometimes refuses to work properly in the tutorial. However, in actual gameplay, I think the squad command system failed me only once and was quickly fixed. 

Now that is out of the way, I can talk about the good - the game somehow manages to make gameplay both methodical and stressful at the same time. This sounds like a contradiction but this game manages to do it which is beautiful. You have to be methodical especially later on because there are doors that are booby-trapped and if you open them while close to live traps, it's a game over for you. Gunfights are also stressful because the enemy can actually quite easily kill you if you're not careful. The enemy AI is quite tough and good, but generally reasonable and if you're not a complete doofus you can generally make it out alive. I'm not an expert on police stuff but this seems to be a fairly realistic depiction of CQB. There are also quite a number of weapons to choose from although you generally want rifles (I like the AK myself) or semi auto shotguns.

Ridiculously terrible optimization, even with HIGH-END specs and LOW settings the game struggles to run smoothly.  Many bugs and issues including really inconsistent and unreliable AI behaviors for both SWAT and suspect AI, which is the core part of the game.  Suspects will at random lock onto you through walls and start shooting through objects that the player cannot.  While earlier level suspects have believable levels of accuracy and reaction times, as the game progresses the suspects start to have Tier 1 Operator, 3-gun competition 10 times consecutive World Champion levels of accuracy and reaction times which should NOT be the main gameplay balancing factor and is quite frankly a lazy way to balance gameplay.  Suspects vary from gang bangers, meth heads and cultists all the way to hardened ex-military militia and actual terrorists but they all act the exact same way.

Downtime between missions is terrible in singleplayer, there should be no countdown to start the mission in singleplayer mode. The player is not spawned in front of the desk and there is no way to instantly retry a mission unless you are in practice mode.  There is no way to check which missions you have S ranked unless you walk all the way to the lockers wait for the customization menu to load and click some more and see which tattoo options you have unlocked.

Ready or Not was MEANT to be great spiritual successor to the SWAT series with a lot of potential that was MEANT to be a fun tactical shooter to play both alone and with friends, but it just isn't in its current state.

Please for the love of TOC fix the game before working on PAID DLC.  New guns and maps mean absolutely nothing and are completely useless to us when the game itself doesn't even run smoothly on low settings for some players, you are turning your back on and betraying your long time supporters to prioritize development time for PAID DLC. If we really wanted new guns and maps we would just download the free mods.",1708686138,1708687618,False,9,1,0.634859383106231689,0,True,False,False

In 1.0, the game has drastically changed a lot, for the good and for the bad.

Performance is a big deal now for the bad; in early access i could run this game smooth, unless there was a bad optimized level, like Brisa Cove. Now i get constant fps drops in certain areas in every level. Is not my pc.

SWAT AI: Amazing. They're really cautious, professional, dilligent and efficient... WHEN THEY WANT TO. Sometimes it has happened to me that i gave an order to them and they decided to open doors just because, or even ""soloing"" areas getting themselves injured or killed. Or even open doors while i'm using the mirror. I just hope this kind of issues are part of a list of bugs/problems that the VOID team are actually aware of and so, in the short future they all will be fixed.

Suspects AI: Broken. Simple as that. They can shoot through walls sometimes, NEVER surrender even when all SWAT members are shooting at them, or just take any chance to risk their chances to fck you up while having to die in the process. It's clear that this is NOT intended, or it shouldn't be at least. In my point of view, these kind of things will be balanced in the future... Not only because a lot of people are noticing and having constant problems with the sus-AI, but because i don't think this right now, is the vision the VOID team have for their game; not a SWAT tactic game, but a plain combat shooter.

I understand for one hand that they had to release the 1-0 in the date they planned, but on the other hand, it would appear we're having the same usual problems we gamers have nowdays with ""big"" games releasing sooner than planned. Or just releasing something clearly NOT finished.

Even so, i would not make this a negative review, because that's not my intention. Instead, i'll make it clear what i wrote is part of a constructive point of view from a game i really like, and perhaps, will love in the future.

- I have not followed this game apart from seeing occasional big updates and videos from creators pre 2024, this includes revisions to contents or dev logs (only checking after)
- I have not previous played any tactical fps games that required 5+ minutes of planning or at least trigger discipline to be competent 
- I have 'passed' all main vanilla levels using lethal and non lethal using ~70% of the given arsenal and A+ or S ranked half of them

(As of Feb 22) 1.0 of Ready or Not is a 75/100 due to mainly suspect AI (e.g. Valley of the dolls)

Major Compliments:
- Really impressive single player teammate AI behaviour*
- Atmospheric music, environmental detail as well as story telling

*still occasionally hiccups in threat assessing big windows over doors after clearing a room (e.g. Valley of the Dolls front entrance)
Necessary Changes:
- Different Suspect AI, untrained desperate drug withdrawn teens full auto and wall bang as expected but mentally sound and trained private security (probably) don't
- Suspect spotting distance or behaviour (although mixed on how to change), suspects' AI ignore or take into account too competently aspects such as bright lighting that blinds or tinted windows when spotting SWAT before engaging

Not for the faint of heart, it's a slow paced, realistic, police, tactical FPS.

The game definitely benefits from playing with an IRL team, but it can do NPC teammates for anyone (myself) who doesn't want to or for whatever reason can't play with others.

I got it running on my steam deck and played offline, the settings where a mix of High/Med/Low on a bunch if different things, and the trickiest part was fully mapping out the controls. Not sure if I managed to even map everything, but I'm pretty sure I got around 90% of what's available tied down with a combination of the TouchPads and back buttons.

The developers were/are absolutely uncompromising in their vision to bring a brutal and painfully realistic vision of the bloody business that takes place within the world of police tactical operations.

Unfortunately, V 1.0 was rushed out the door far too quickly:

Friendly AI obeys commands erratically when it comes to stacking or executing simultaneous orders resulting in them getting killed. Performance is all over the place. While it's not hard to run the game - especially with FSR - there are certain areas in every match where performance will tank regardless of hardware.

However the largest issue is the suspect AI. In a game where you shouldn't have to kill every suspect, the Ready Or Not AI really makes it hard to resist. Every enemy whether a lowly gangster or military trained opponent all have instant reflexes. For most maps you beat this by playing slow, flashing rooms, etc. However, some deaths are unavoidable as an enemy will sprint out of the room firing perfectly accurate shots killing 2 of your teammates and you in the crossfire. All this could be forgiven if they couldn't XRay headshot you through walls. Take a look at youtube to see examples of AI tracking teammates they never made contact with and killing them. Or, your friendly AI all shooting through walls when you've made contact, resulting in them killing the perp. People recommend mods, but mods only dull the reactions of the enemies or change their morale. This doesn't fix the fundamental issue of being able to see and track through walls.

Another issue with 1.0 is the lack of map modes. Before this update many maps had different ways you could play them. These included bomb defuse, active shooter, or raid. Now each map only has one mode each.

That said the game is fun. I'm closing in on 100 hours and have mostly enjoyed my time - although most of it was before v 1.0. I'm hoping VOID will patch these issues after the holidays. If so, I will definitely change my review to a recommend.

tdlr: 1.0 brought some good stuff but a lot of bad as well. VOID has some bug fixing and serious patch work to get the game's ai, performance, and replay ability ready before I can recommend it.

Edit: 2/6/24 Hotfix 3
Hotfix 3 just came out and it seems to have helped with the AI issues. They don't seem to wallbang unfairly anymore. Performance seems more consistent - at least on Carrier of the Vines. Unfortunately, ally ai still fails to execute commands properly and it will get you killed if you play by yourself. For example, if you want them to enter the room the same time as you, half the time they won't perform the command properly and stay stuck at the entry way. Once VOID fixes or reduces that I'll be changing my review to a thumbs up.

Edit: 2/21/24 Hotfix4
Improved performance in some places but the ally AI still disobeys orders. When you tell them  to enter with you they either enter by themselves or not at all, etc.",1703847878,1708577252,False,3,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Many years ago there was a similar game, SWAT, that hooked my young teenage brain. The first two games were tactical top down style , but SWAT 3, was a fps tactical shooter. Incredibly intense, varied missions, and very often there were surprises as to where the suspects were etc. It set a precedent that I never got to top as far as ""realistic shooter"" goes.

Fast forward probably 20 years, and this finally topped it. Suspects don't just empty mags, sometimes they run and hide, sometimes they give up, there's a LOT of trigger discipline if you want to get high scores.  Shooting suspects isn't fun, they scream in agony if injured, and you lose points for not capturing them alive. Some missions (Elephant example) due to time constraints, forces you to ""run and gun"" the way through the mission, and others, force you to check under every, freaking, door for bombs or hidden suspects. The missions have some randomised suspect placement, and they move from room to room, so even though a room has been already cleared, there's a chance someone might have snuck in from somewhere. I've had a blast replaying missions over and over, especially the harder ones, forcing me to adjust equipment for the squad and myself.

Flash bangs, gas, shields, armour types, night vision, etc. etc. There are so many load out combinations it would take some maths to determine how varied the team can be. It changes a lot, to choose a ballistic mask vs a gas mask vs night vision could change the outcome of the mission. There are plenty of guns to choose from. Assault rifles, SMGs and shotguns for main, pistols for secondary, and a ton of specialised equipment like tasers and launchers. There are even pepper ball guns (ideal when trying for an S). All of the guns mentioned here are available IMMEDIATELY, no grinding necessary to unlock a taser or gas mask. No micro transactions. The unlocks are granted after successfully completing missions with a high enough score, and they are nice, but not ""game changing"".

I'm 4 missions away from beating the game in practice mode. It has been 13 hours but a lot of that has been replaying missions either because I enjoyed them or because I wanted a better score. So I guess you could say it's not a very large game, it's quickly played through. Personally I find that because of the amount of detail in each map, the variety of situations and outcomes on the same mission, and the very real challenge of scoring an S will probably keep me playing for hundreds of hours. (like i did with SWAT 3 as a kid ...)

TL/DR: I used to love swat 3, this game reminds me of that, but much better. Why so rough with civilians sometimes? In the elephant mission my character smashed a kid against the floor. He didn't have guns, I wanted to be cool. I WANTED TO BE COOL!!!!",1708572269,1708572269,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It's so good, but at the moment the suspect AI is absolutely busted. In Early Access, the suspects were challenging and janky, but they weren't that broken. Since the full release however, they are absolutely insane. Constantly shooting me though walls and objects and their reaction time is inhuman. It's just not fun to bang my head against a wall on one mission because I can't finish it. I am all for challenging games. Heck I love the Dark Souls series, but at least in Dark Souls you could cheese some boss fights to your advantage. In this game you can't. They have an insane amount and armor, but I feel like that I am wearing no armor at all. I hope there is some kind of change to their behavior or reaction time, or at the least I hope they include a difficulty slider. I am willing to change my review to positive once this has been adjusted. For now, just don't get this unless you want a very unfair and frustrating time.

Edit: The AI can be toned down with mods which is what I decided to do. Still leaving this as negative since this needs to be addressed by the devs. This shouldn't be something the community needs to fix.

Edit 2: The game has had a few enemy AI tweaks. I'd say it's still not perfect but it's in a much better state. If you are slow and careful, missions can be completed fairly easily. I would recommend this game now. Changing my review to positive.",1702614021,1708571318,True,0,0,0.503182411193847656,3,True,False,False

One time a flashbanged and pepper sprayed 1 low level enemy and he just would not surrender, also i shot the same enemy 3 times whilst he was blind, deaf, burning eyes, ringing ears severely bleeding and almost dead AND HE STILL WOULD NOT SURRENDER, if i had a free trial on this game i certainly would have NEVER paid £45 for it not even £15 because its simply boring, it feels like im playing a run and gun shooter and not a tactical swat simulator, the whole point of being in the police is to defuse the situation without killing anyone or at most killing as a last resort but at the monent i feel like im killing everyone because the AI is relentless and they will shoot without a second thought hitting every shot. also why do they not flinch? im getting shot at by them and my charcater cannot stay still yet the AI is almost dead and has pinpoint accuracy. RIDICULOUS i would look for alternatives untill the devs fix the game i would rather play roblox than this mess. Also i'm not surprised that game play footage isn't included in trailers because the devs would probably get embarrassed by their own creation. the trailer looks promising until you realise it is nothing like the raw game play. obviously the devs could release gameplay footage but even still they could re-programm the AI just for the trailer to false advertise so it would still not be the real deal. If you feel like being lied to and ripped off then sure, buy this game, but if you want to keep the money in your wallet i would suggest getting a better game like tarkov, i say LIKE tarkov because tarkov isn't actually very good its just better than this cess pit of a game. Another small complaint is the micro-stutter, -J E S U S - it is bad, but not only does micro-stutter ruin the game play experience but it actually decreases the longevity of your system (slowly kills your graphics card). im sure that there is probably some silly tutorial on how to fix it but this is something the devs need to fix not the player, most of us want to game not code, if i wanted to code if would work at a Mumbai scam office. This game also lacks content; because the games gunplay is so bad perhaps a campaign could make this game worth playing but instead we all play the same missions over and over just to get a rating at the end, NO PROGRESSION, NO STORY, NO ENJOYMENT. This game has great potential but its just boring, the maps are not what anyone expected, teammate AI hardly say anything of relevance, screen FX are over the top and annoying. Overall if i could improve 3 things of the 100,000 things that need to be improved, i would want improvements on: the shooting/gunplay/screen effects when being shot at, add a campaign/story (maybe similar story type to the HITMAN series), and finally have better, smaller, more engaging maps.

Developed by VOID Interactive, this game has been eagerly anticipated by fans of tactical shooters, drawing comparisons to classic titles like the SWAT series. As a tactical first-person shooter, Ready or Not challenges players to navigate high-stakes scenarios with precision and strategy. Let's delve into every aspect of this highly anticipated title.

Gameplay Mechanics and Realism:
At the heart of Ready or Not lies its commitment to realism. From the moment players step into the shoes of elite law enforcement operatives, they're faced with the gravity of their decisions. Every mission demands careful planning, coordination with teammates, and split-second tactical choices. The game excels in its attention to detail, with realistic ballistics, weapon handling, and AI behavior.

Each mission is a dynamic puzzle, with multiple entry points, unpredictable enemy placements, and civilians who react realistically to the chaos unfolding around them. Players must balance their use of force, employing non-lethal methods whenever possible to minimize civilian casualties and maintain the integrity of their mission objectives.

The planning phase is where Ready or Not truly shines. Players have the freedom to meticulously plan their approach, analyzing blueprints, coordinating breach points, and assigning specific roles to each team member. This level of tactical depth adds a layer of immersion rarely seen in the genre, rewarding careful planning and teamwork.

Graphics and Immersion:
Visually, Ready or Not impresses with its attention to detail and atmospheric lighting. From dilapidated urban environments to sprawling suburban homes, each location feels lived-in and authentic. The game's sound design further enhances immersion, with realistic weapon sounds, ambient noises, and dynamic voice acting adding to the tension of each encounter.

However, the game's graphics optimization could use some improvement, as performance issues are prevalent on lower-end hardware. Additionally, character animations can feel stiff at times, detracting slightly from the otherwise immersive experience.

Single-Player Campaign and Multiplayer:
Ready or Not offers a robust single-player campaign, with a series of missions that progressively increase in difficulty and complexity. Each mission is replayable, with randomized enemy placements and dynamic objectives, ensuring that no two playthroughs are alike.

The multiplayer component of Ready or Not is where the game truly shines. Whether it's cooperatively tackling missions with friends or facing off against other players in intense PvP encounters, the game's multiplayer offers endless replayability. The addition of mod support further extends the game's lifespan, allowing the community to create custom maps, missions, and gameplay modes.

Community and Support:
The developers at VOID Interactive have shown a strong commitment to engaging with the community, regularly providing updates, addressing player feedback, and implementing requested features. The game's dedicated modding community has also contributed to its longevity, with a steady stream of user-generated content keeping the experience fresh and exciting.

Conclusion:
Ready or Not delivers on its promise of tactical realism, offering a deeply immersive experience that will satisfy fans of the genre. With its attention to detail, strategic depth, and commitment to realism, it sets a new standard for tactical shooters. While it may not be without its flaws, the sheer depth and complexity of its gameplay make it a must-play for any fan of tactical shooters. Ready or Not is more than just a game; it's an experience that will keep players coming back for more long after the credits roll.",1708495640,1708495640,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The shooting mechanics are some of the best in the genre. Each weapon feels weighty and bullets land with incredible power. The audio design from the police radio banter to the firefights is extremely satisfying. Visually the game is impressive, and challenges you to follow ROE and protocol vs going in to every room guns blazing (though that is often required in my experience).

The devs are active and have been releasing massive content and bug fix patches frequently for years and have no plans of stopping. The inclusion of community content give unlimited replayability to an already impressive title.

Even in solo play, you have full control over 4 squadmates, whom you can customise the loadouts of to fit each scenario and command with an intuitive ui, though personally this does not compare to the tactical requirements of human teammates.

pros
-Best gun play in any shooter.
-Ai are amazing and playing the same mission 100 times will never be the same experience
-Bugs are minimul and graphics are great.

CONS
-If enemy AI get withing 2 ft of you, you are dead they can stab and shoot you 100 times but your character for some reason throws the gun up when they get close seizing your chance to shoot and when you melee them its like you hit them with a pillow... meanwhile I am being stabbed in the head by a crack wh0re.

""Optimization? What the fuck is that?"" - VOID probably
 
- Well, the performance is AWFUL. The game runs as good as a paraplegic man. On relapse for example, the map runs at 40 FPS for me, which is good, BUT, at some points on the map, like the corridor with sprinklers or the pediatric lobby, it can get to 5 FPS. Same applies at the new school map, where it runs at 30 FPS and in the library it can dip to 8. Almost all maps suffers from this issue.

- THe suspect AI... Well, I've got nothing new to say. The reaction times are absurd, they track (and shoot) you through the walls, does not respond to flashes and stingers. It's just unplayable at this point. If you gotta mod your game for it to simply be playable, something is terribly wrong with it.

- And to close off, VOID Interactive is RADIO SILENT. First and only hotfix at the time of this review was made at December 18. It's January 11, we have no annoucements, no acknowlegment, nothing. They released a poor hotfix and dipped out, no idea when the next will come out.

Not recommended.

Edit 1: It's ya boy, Barely Functioning Human Being here.  Today January 18 we've got a new hotfix. It fixes issues with death animations not activating and expands some language options?

""But where is the fixes for the core problems? The FPS drops and the AI?""

Haha, no. L bozo cry more. - VOID probably (again)

Edit 2: Hello there, played the patch released on 02/20/2024, the game is somewhat more stable now. The AI still feels REALLY snappy, but they can't hit the broad side of a barn now.

Beginning with the positives, Ready or Not's story-building is top-notch. The use of 911 calls, briefings, and other in-game things make the missions interesting and immersive to play through. Customization is also good, with the 1.0 update bringing many new weapons and cosmetic changes to your SWAT operative. You can larp as much as you want with a ballistic helmet and armor, or act as a first-responder armed with a polo and stab-vest. On the technical side, the graphics are very nice, with the general atmosphere easily conveying the theme of the map. The gun-play feels incredible, with weapons feeling like they hit hard or soft, depending on the caliber.

Now I primarily wanted to write this review to talk about the supposed ""AI improvements"". To some degree, the AI has been improved, particularly regarding the SWAT AI. That is to say your officers can easily clear and search rooms on their own. There's no need to go back to rooms and search for evidence, since your teammates will often times grab it for you. Moreover, you're able to mold your team in various ways, whether that be on stacking or clearing out a whole section of a map.

THE ISSUE, comes with the suspect AI, which seemed to have reverted back to their pre-August update version. To summarize, the suspect AI prior to the August update was somewhat, ""aimbotty"". This made a lot of missions, particularly CQC missions, incredibly annoying to finish. The AI would quickly neutralize your whole team. This AI seems to have returned with the 1.0 update. Maps such as the Post Office or the Hotel have become almost impossible due to the accuracy of the suspects. It doesn't even make sense, either. You're going up against thugs and gang members, not Tier 1 special forces teams. The 1.0 update may have made the AI even worse, because now they're usually shoot through walls and cover. The constant pre-firing and wall-banging will easily kill you or your teammates.

Now the AI wouldn't necessary be an issue most of the times. If you're lucky, you could probably clear out any map after a few tries. It's become an issue because of Commander Mode. 

In Commander Mode, you can't quickly restart missions. When your AI teammates eventually get gunned down by the John Wicks of RoN, you'll be constantly rehiring officers, unable to unlock their traits because their either always incapacitated, in therapy or dead.

I love this game, I really do. But the AI change, or rather the AI ""revert"", has made me so annoyed that I just can't fully recommend the game anymore. Is Ready or Not fun with friends?  Absolutely. But as a single player experience, you can't enjoy it when you're alt-f4'ing over and over again because the AI are shooting through your cover. Unless the AI is improved in the next hotfix, wait it out.

UPDATE: AI is ""fixed"". I'm not longer experiencing the shot through the wall situations.",1703212664,1708459253,True,0,0,0.548872172832489014,0,True,False,False

The game makes you feel very in the moment and connected to the events. Having completed the game once I'm now replaying it trying to S-rank each level and solo pacify every hostile with my team holding at spawn, which is not an easy task. I constantly find myself finding new ways of playing and new things you can do that I didn't realise, like commanding enemies or civs to your location instead of putting yourself in harms way to cuff someone.
At the moment of writing this, the 1.0 update did make the game a lot more laggy in some aspects. There are some rooms or areas that might start stuttering, which the devs will hopefully have fixed rather soon.

All in all it's a game I would recommend if you enjoy tactical games like the older Rainbow Six and S.W.A.T. 4. If I had to rate it I'd give it an 8/10.

I downloaded Ready or Not and now I can play SWAT 4 again but make use of my RTX4070!

Except that isn’t quite fair: the developers have obviously played SWAT 4 because there are lots of familiar aspects to the UI. When I played this a few months ago it was a clunky homage to SWAT 4 but there has obviously been an update recently. The AI is now very good - your squad will sort out handcuffing suspects and reporting to TOC so you don’t have to click on everyone yourself. They also make sensible decisions if they hear gunfire they investigate rather than carrying on staring at a wall while their friends get killed 3’ away. 

The mission system works really nicely now. I like the squad stress system - it means you actually care about getting your team killed and wounded, rather than being disposable NPCs in each set piece mission. The missions themselves are really well constructed as they allow you lots of tactical freedom but still manage to build up tension as you discover what the lovely wealthy mansion has behind the boiler room in the basement. 

I’m not a hardcore FPS person so can’t get carried away about the details there - it works immersively and as realistically as you would want from this game (Arma 3’s death before you hear the muzzle blast would get boring quickly here).

Guns are not instant off buttons, unless of course, it's a shotgun to the head. Some suspects have body armor same as the player(s), have any of you ever gotten hit in game, have the screen go blurry, but took no damage? That was a hit to your armor. 
So maybe if your MP5 loaded with JHP isn't taking someone down, or shotgun to the chest only makes them get winded, maybe put some lead into their head. 
I would also not be surprised if some of the suspects had a buff where they ignore damage like a real crackhead all cracked out would. But you will find that if you turn their head into a canoe they will go down quick.

Back during public early access, you had the option to choose from different mission types for almost all maps, like baricaded suspect, raid, active shooter or bomb-threat. With 1.0, every mission only has one missiontype of the mentioned ones, which can not be changed anymore. This may be fun for the first and, maybe, second run, but after that it become really repetitive. 
Also, while the addition of the commander mode is pretty cool, the whole stress system is pretty half-baked and rather annoying. The whole story also just ends pretty weak and it feels like, they rather wanted to push 1.0, than finish the story. A lot of the traits, that the AI officer have, do not help that much during mission either, it seems.
For whatever reason, there are also quite a few wierd ""balancing"" choices, like not being able to mount an Eotech, Elcan Specter or Nightforce scope on the G36, despite being possible IRL (even with the KAC rail system we have in game), not being able to run both AN/PEQ-15 and flashlight (the former also lacks it's visible laser option) or no option to equip a gasmask and NVGs at the same time (which was teased in development update #57 back in August '23).
The AI in this game is also... something. For trying to be realistic, every mission turns into a massive shootout (Youtuber ""Civilian use only"" talks about that part in his 1.0 review, saying, that SWAT encounter rarely turn into gunfights). Even low-level criminals have no sense of self-preservation and will shoot at you, like they are on some un-holy mission. Sure, having you go some place and only arrest suspects, that have surrendered upon SWAT arrival is pretty boring from a games perspective, but a mission or two, where it does not feel like, that you need to kill to succeed, would go a long way, cause the motto of this game kinda is ""Stop the killing, stop the dying"".

The team and enemy AI is pretty good considering near limitless tactical possibilities that you can execute. Stack up on doors. Choose to stack up left or right side? Will you flash or stinger(rubber balls) grenade the room upon entering, or set up entry on 3 different doors to overwhelm the suspects? Rifle? Pistol? Flashlight on or off? Civilian? Did you order the perp to drop his piece?

 I have only played with AI team mates, but they are pretty based killing machines. Sometimes they shoot randomly at AI, and civilians, but it's not really a huge problem. It's sad when you or your squad mates die. You can spectate to see if they finish the mission, but you will likely see them fall without your tactical expertise and valor under fire. I think playing online would be cool, but I have yet to try it due to not having any friends.

 AI has a hair trigger and superhuman reflexes. Stay frosty and don't go for head shots. The perps want to kill you, and you'll always have more rules to play by than they do. ""Only fools rush in"", is a good reminder when opening doors. Unless you hear gunshots or cries for help, take your time. Running into trip wire is an insta-kill. You can shoot the trap or snip the wire but make sure your dudes are not near it. Very fun if you like shooting pedophiles. 

The only downside I could see is the mixed messages about conspiracy ""theories"". On one hand, you're supposed to shoot Q anon type dudes who are at war with the pedophile Big Brother types in government, but then you do a mission basically killing a bunch of pedophiles that are part of a huge conspiracy. Seriously, what crime is it to live out in the woods and distrust the government? Oh they shared classified documents about pedophiles in high places? Time to die rednecks! We city folk like 'em young so don't get in our way or we'll send cops to blast you. That mission was kinda silly in my estimation.

P.S. Look out for the Q-anon weirdo in the forest house who likes to hang out with his wang out. He climbs through the floor vents and cracks in the drywall (also not illegal in your own home). Very sneaky. Keep your back to the wall. Also, I felt guilty killing the 3D printer bros, but their mom has cancer (expensive) and she's old. Life is often full of sacrifice and hard choices.

There are no aspects of this game in which it is fair on your account. Enemies will laser beam you with 7.62x39 AKM rounds while you can't keep bead with an MP5 at mid range. Enemies won't flinch when shot (Tested with .357 Magnum on suspect in apartment level.) and seemingly know where you are regardless of how fast or slow you approach certain corners.  

Armor is virtually useless as enemies tend to shoot at legs, while it is explained that certain sects of suspects ARE aware of SWAT's armor status it begs the question ""Why the fuck not put armor ON YOUR LEGGIES?"" 

Guns in full auto seem super inaccurate, shotguns do not have the knock down power that they should, and even when shot multiple times enemies just don't give up nor bleed out. 

There is NO safe zones, not even in spawn, as enemies can just walk up to you in spawn and blow you away. Like is there only me and the squad here? Where is like...the entire fucking department or even backup? (Officer down we need backup! TOC: Roger that, notifying the morgue, get fucked lmao.)


UPDATE: With the new update the enemy AI has gotten a little downgrade to be more manageable, which is wonderful. However four bullets don't seem to be enough to drop a suspect, or even phase them, as they zero my head and blast me like I'm an NPC in CoD. I mean, I shoot them, they flinch, but then rezero my head.

ALSO EDIT : Pistols are strangely non-lethal. A single headshot will incapacitate suspects...a HEADSHOT...tested with all semi-auto pistols. 


MORE COOL SHIT I FOUND WHILE PLAYING: Enemies don't seem to reload properly, I mean the fastest I've seen someone reload an AK I've ever seen. Sleight of Hand Pro, on the Meth they got from Twisted Nerve Mission. 


EXTRA SHIT I FOUND: Enemies that rush up to your face can shoot you for free, and you put your gun up cause realism. Can't shoot something if barrel is unable to reach target. You might think ""Oh this is a good time to use Melee"" you poor poor bastard, melee also doesn't work when up close. 

MORE STUFF: I am sick of shooting bad-guys once, twice, three times, an extra four and seeing them just walk backwards and keep a bead on me. 

IN CONCLUSION: This feels more like SWAT if it was made by Bennet Foddy or whatever the fuck his name was. Exceedingly unfair shit. ",1706889762,1708387417,False,1,3,0,0,True,False,False

The game suffers from, i'd say, the lack of vision on expanding the content and severe technical issues that affect the players' experiencie in a negative way.

First i'll start with the positives:
+Genuinely interesting setting which is backed up by outstanding art direction and environmental story telling, i absolutely love how the missions are tied to one another in some way, 
+The maps are great, they are carefully handcrafted to provide optimal CQB scenarios.
+The core gameplay which is how you tackle missions aka lateral thinking. In difficult missions, it's critical to carefully plan out the raid taking into consideration how much of a threat the suspects are, their equipment and the design of the building, how its structured, how everything is arranged. Having these factors into account the player then chooses how to proceed with the raid, select the adequate equipment for each member of the element and the point where the team will begin the insertion.

Now, the negatives:
-The police department feels dead, empty, with no movement, none of the NPCs talk, the mission briefings could have been done in a way that feels more interactive way instead of having a white screen that pauses the game and listening to recordings.
-Lack of freedom in weapon customization which also affects they way the missions can be tackled.
-The inability to order ""red"" and blue"" to clear rooms simultaneously without the need of looking at the doors which also severly affect your options. (so fucking retarded)
-Performance issues are somehow still a thing, there are places where the game suffers from insane FPS drops.
-They still haven't fixed the issues with the mirrors and glass, what's worse is that suspects can see you perfectly through glass doors and walls.
-Lack of animations or how i like to call it, body language, on both civilians and suspect AI, most of the time you cannot tell what they are going to do to the point that it looks and feels goofy.
-Suspect AI are straight up broken, they'll see through walls, through smoke screens, they'll arbitrarily not be affected by flashbangs or gas and the most annoying issues of them all, the absurd reaction time and accuracy they have.
-SWAT AI sometimes won't follow orders and/or move erratically, leaving openings in the formation, ironic how the suspects feel more trained than the SWAT unit sometimes.

Despite the issues that can affect the player's overall experiencie, i'd still recommend it based on the amount of fun i extracted from it due to the core gameplay. However, it was a mistake from the devs to make the ""full"" release since it's still clearly in a premature state, they need to listen to the player base and actually do more play testing.",1705923671,1708384735,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Get this game at Early Access Price before it goes up, because it will (hopefully). This game has so much potential, plenty of replay ability. Friends and I are spending hours kicking doors down.

In public games almost 4/5 games the Host disconnects as soon as they die which really make completing a public match unlikely without having to join 5 different hosts. This means a lot of public games people just get on to play 1 match shooty shooty and ALT+F4. Again some kind of risk/reward system would help mitigate this hopefully.

- Suspect AI Still the same superhuman react and respond time,wallhack, no recoil and crazy accurate even running and shooting, long range without sense 
- SFX sound travel so shit only hear SWAT footstep but the suspects look like ninja don't even have footstep sound even open the door, gun shot sound direction so noob don't know where it came from and DB less than bbgun sound
- Shield so dump often get shoot though it even crouch for cover all body part
- Suspect carry too many weapons for what? 
- Suspect immune with everything (Flashbang, Rubble bomb, CS gas, taser etc.)
-  23 MB a second mission is a goddamn 911 fales report ""we are not aware of any other threats, a streamer kill his own mother and lock his brother up in his room"" when mission start the whole place start firing at me and when mission end there are 10 suspects in this mission how to hell where they coming from?
- ""switch to your pistol is always faster than reloading"" to my PP, duration of switching is the same as the other weapons or equipment
- There some mission that have optional ways to infiltrate crime scene, no matter what i choose the way in there will be the same location anyway.
- AI SWAT look like some dumbass wearing SWAT uniform and carry gun without be trained often friendly fire, so useless
- Stress system went to make this swat officer become monk so mental weak example down all suspect in mission make the result they get stress, mental ill can barely this shit incident, even resign the job
- (My personal) talking about SWAT unit. It's mean the person with well-trained about tactic, movement, firearms and equipment even mentally but this game your character lack kind of that stuff can barely handle the recoil most of any gun (fly up to the sky), can not change speed movement it so slow when I entering room it's make lack of surprise action, only can throw grenade straight line
- AI know your line of sight that why they always can flank you.
- Hotfix #3 optimization performance so drinking piss, always fps drop when gunfire, entry room, open door
- Hotfix #3 reduce accuracy my ass you just made more chance to survive gunfire a little longer

Fynn Nebula, a seasoned sailor with a heart as vast as the ocean itself, and Miguel Hernández, a brave police officer whose unwavering determination was matched only by his warm smile, shared a bond that transcended the ordinary.

It all began on a foggy morning when news arrived of a pirate raid on a nearby merchant ship. The pirates, led by the notorious Captain Blackbeard, had taken the crew hostage, including several locals from Harborview. Fynn and Miguel, driven by a sense of duty and a desire to protect their community, knew they had to act swiftly.

With Miguel's tactical expertise and Fynn's nautical skills, the two friends devised a daring plan to rescue the hostages and put an end to the pirates' reign of terror. They gathered their supplies, their resolve as unyielding as the granite cliffs that guarded their town, and set off into the unknown.

Their journey took them across tumultuous seas and uncharted waters, their small boat slicing through the waves like a graceful seabird. As they drew closer to the pirates' hideout, Fynn and Miguel shared stories of their past adventures, their laughter mingling with the sound of the ocean's song.

But amidst the danger and uncertainty, there was something else stirring between them, a warmth that blossomed in the quiet moments between their shared glances and fleeting touches. Though unspoken, the connection between Fynn and Miguel was undeniable, a magnetic pull that drew them closer with each passing day.

As they approached the pirates' stronghold, tension hung in the air like a thick fog, but Fynn and Miguel remained steadfast in their determination to succeed. With Miguel leading the charge on land and Fynn navigating the treacherous waters, they launched their attack with precision and skill.

In a flurry of action and bravery, they fought side by side, their hearts pounding in unison as they battled against Captain Blackbeard and his crew. With every swing of the sword and every shouted command, Fynn and Miguel proved themselves to be true heroes, their bond stronger than ever in the face of danger.

And when the last of the pirates had been defeated and the hostages set free, Fynn and Miguel shared a moment of quiet reflection amidst the chaos. In the shimmering light of the setting sun, they looked into each other's eyes and saw not just friendship, but something deeper, something that had been waiting to bloom beneath the surface all along.

As they sailed back to Harborview, their hands brushed against each other, sending sparks of electricity through their veins. And though their adventure had come to an end, Fynn and Miguel knew that their journey together was far from over. For in each other's company, they had found not only courage and camaraderie, but a love that would endure even the fiercest storms.

And so, as they returned home to the embrace of their grateful town, Fynn and Miguel stood side by side, ready to face whatever adventures lay ahead, their hearts entwined as one beneath the endless expanse of the starlit sky.",1708365761,1708365761,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

there is a career mode with about 18 missions for you to play through and a multiplayer mode where you can replay the missions with 12+ people (not sure what the limit is). mod support is great with just about everything being moddable although for some reason ""server checksum"" is enabled for everyone by default meaning if whoever is hosting never bothered to turn it off you will be automatically kicked off unless you have the same mods. the game performance has gotten better but you will still stutter at random points in the maps sometimes in the middle of gunfights and fps still doesn't go past 160 in-game. no matter the setting it always sits at 90 - 120fps at 4k, 1440p and 1080p at least for me. 

as for gameplay it has gotten a tiny itty bit better with SWAT Ai being more useful and less bothersome and suspect ai being a tiny bit fairer but still ridiculous at some points. most notably spraying you through 99% opacity surfaces like bushes, glass, railings or any extremely tiny gap with ""line of sight"" to you. the equivalent of being shot through a bullet hole across the map in rainbow six siege. they also can blast you at inhuman reaction times and begin to shoot the moment your playermodel is visible meaning you die before you could even see them.

the ennemy have sooooooooo much health i mean come on 4 shot of shotgun, literally 4 shot and i recorded it and that dude survived with NO ARMOR. tactical vest aint armor why it take 5 shot of 45 acp just for them to go unconscius, i would understand if they were doped but they are not.
Getting killed by an ennemy aiming at the ground with one shot in under a second even if they were hit pisses me off.
Bullet should go where they aiming at not magically pop your head. Flying empty mag when you reload is ruining immersion and dead bodies being move like they are a bouncing ball when npc walk on it also ruin everything. They should walk over it or grab them if they move???
Why nerf my favorite gun the P90? Now this gun is ass and his armor percing properties doesnt seem to do shit.

Enemy detection is not only spotty but their accuracy and vision are so good that it can make segments unplayable. A.I also can see through smoke and all visual clutter so be aware of that. Civilian placement is more annoying than good because on maps bigger than ""thank you come again"" it's a chore to check every corner for hidden away innocents. Optimization is poor and even if you have an ok graphics card, it's not that great.

Don't let this ""Not Recommended"" banner misinterpret my feelings towards this game; I like it a lot and have been actively following its development since I first heard about it. In it's current state though, I can't recommend it to anyone who is expecting a truly finished and fleshed out product at the price that it is being sold for. If you can get passed this, I recommend it.

-- Performance Issues --

For anyone experiencing severe performance issues and random crashing (who are not running god-tier systems) - update your video card drivers, use DirectX12, turn on DLSS balanced and lower your game settings - this helped me a lot. My friend on the other hand... let's just hope there's a hotfix in the near future that's gonna stop his game from bogging down and crashing constantly.

-- FULL REVIEW --

The game's encounter system and tactical gameplay is more akin to Rainbow Six: Vegas 2 (on the hardest difficulty) than the SWAT / OG Ghost Recon games. The enemy / team AI needs to be improved upon as some deaths / mission failures I experienced was the result of unfair encounters and inhumane reflexes all enemies have, regardless of what their experience is described to be (idk if this is intentional to mislead the player or if this was unintended programming - I'll lean more on the first option). Although, I grew to like how the buggy AI forced me to make quick decisions and improvise with the layout of the environment I was in when tackling the altercation I had with the hostile enemies. Sadly, stealth can be summarised as a bogged down experience as enemies who are half-way across the map can hear you (and even see you through obstacles) even when my gun was equipped with a suppressor. Currently you cannot you shoot out lights / kill the power when playing through the night missions (or missions occurring within buildings).

I would recommend keeping an eye on the speed of QoL updates and checking the game's state before the release of the DLC. Then check how quickly the developer can work on issues caused by new content.


Hopefully the old bugs are going to be fixed by then, but I doubt that because modders were able to fix major issues for FREE in a blink of an eye (Yes, I am looking at you Void, we have seen how many copies you sold, the game is not the cheapest one, and you are planning paid DLCs without proper maintenance of the game).

We NEED proper foundation FIRST so then the DLCs and workshop content can be built on it. The development team needs to be focused on that.

Steam Workshop is still not implemented as of the time of this review. (Which is crucial for the survival of such a game long after the developer abandons it, i.e., Arma 3, Skyrim.)

This game runs surprisingly well on the Steam Deck OLED. It froze my Steam Deck a few times, but it is playable.

- void released a broken buggy POS game (not shocking that any studio would do this)
- before fixing any of the game breaking stuff, they've announced their DLC for spring of 2024
- you and your entire team will get clapped from 600 miles away by a crackhead with a shotgun through a wall in the dark. hope you enjoy not getting to play your video game!

[u]This will be updated further as I re-do several levels on my frankly dumb Solo S-rank runs of levels.[/u] But without mods for AI tweaking, it finally feels like interactions with suspects are more than ""Walk in, shout (optional), see gun, get shot at, shoot suspect, cuff"".
Like what I got to see was people using objects as cover. Their accuracy to hit being possible to deal with as a beanbag shotgun; But not a free win. Hell I had suspects try to walk [b]away[/b] from me without drawing their gun. Someone tried to hide underneath a wire bed in vain!

It just seemed to have make my flashbangs worse. 1/3 thrown flashes worked. Two into small rooms, one outside. Likely will go back to my gas mask and teargas 'nade strat just so I can rely on my throwables to disable.

-----(Original Review)-----
I really want to recommend it. But as it stands, the game sits in a broken state of AI. Not bug ridden, but horridly balanced. SWAT4, the game this is being a ""successor"" to, had more balanced AI for what was reasonable at the time. It was basic, the accuracy of the game forced you to move slowly to not hit a civvie by accident. Basic command tree for AI teammates. And a few rare sniper spots if you needed it. That was 2005, and I never felt it was unfair.

Its 8 years later. Apparently that means an immersive sim should involve really unrealistic reaction speeds and accuracy to targets you are meant to subdue. There's posters to remind you, you aren't military. Bring people in alive. But the peppergun rifles don't make their aim worse so you can actually survive. And the Beanbag gun several times on mission 2, even with a full team of AI with more LTL long-guns; Cannot get one guy with no armor to drop a gun. Tried to knock the wind out of him to stun, then two shots, three, fou- Dead.
""Well you should use your throwables!"" Guess what I had the AI do when entering the room? What do you think I do when I want to do a solo run?

And that directly conflicts with the messaging police need to re-learn. Hearts and Minds, not Widows and Orphans. Even when I take anything other than one of 3 LTL primaries, I discipline my firing to be knockouts and not kills. .45 to the skull may keep myself safe; But means I failed to preserve life. The game only rewards an S rank for a perfect arrest run (that also requires to find all hidden objectives that isn't hinted at what may be important). S ranks unlocks cosmetics to help you stand out from other players. Said S rank is real hard when anything short of an AI is at 50/50 odds of dying to a new sightline.

Just use SkebbZ's [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/readyornot/mods/3169]""No Crack for AI""[/url] mod. This isn't a kind of challenge that respects you. After that, game does start to become more fun to play. And more with friends.
(Side note: Apparently the subtitles and a bunch of media is AI genned too. Is it that hard to just hire an artist? I wouldn't be surprised if the breifs are also AI voiced. Furthering the reasons why AI generated content is both a mistake and should be shamed.)",1705184707,1708238233,True,0,0,0.538279414176940918,0,True,False,False

If you enjoyed the game play to that, but wished it came with a team of 4 other lobotomized AI that get in your way like Skyrim NPC's while you're trying to fight enemies with the aim of Terminator and the durability of Robocop, then this is the game for you. Not Ready Freddy places you into the combat boots of a SWAT officer in what is basically LA and sends you on a variety of missions to ""Bring Order to Chaos"". This being a police sim, you aren't supposed to shoot willy nilly and are meant to take a very slow, methodical approach to combat. If you are looking for a Call of Duty esq experience, this isn't for you. 

What it does well: Graphics are great, environments are fantastically well made with environmental storytelling everywhere and some cleverly hidden jokes. Guns handle and feel satisfying and the sound design is very good. The game is very immersive thanks to the attention to detail. The story is also very dark and gritty, giving you the satisfaction of shooting pedophiles in the testicles. The ability to control the other NPC SWAT team members also makes you feel like you are fighting as part of a unit...usually. Enemy AI is also really good, sometimes a bit too good but I might also just be bad at the game. 

What needs work: 1: Quality of life features mainly. A directional hit indicator really wouldn't ruin my immersion. I think its reasonable that my highly trained SWAT team leader guy would probably know what direction he got shot from and I died many times because I lacked this critical information. 2: Better gun variety. While there are many guns in the game, they don't really feel different from each other. I never noticed it taking less shots to down a suspect with an AK than an AR despite one using a significantly larger caliber. The only guns that feel different from the rifles are the shotguns and even then all the shotguns feel the same. 3: If I have cleared all the hostiles and other mission requirements, please just let me end the level instead of wandering around for 10 minuets trying to find the last civilian that stuck their head in a toilet. It really kills the fun of clearing a level when I have to go hunt down a random civvy that I missed. 4: Please let me walk through or push a button to move my other SWAT team members. They blocked me into narrow rooms so many times but have the audacity to tell me ""You're in my way."" 5: If you're going to give me a timer without telling me like adding bombs to certain missions, give me a damn sprint button. I shouldn't have to waddle around the entire level hunting for explosives, let me fuckin run. 

Glitches: I didn't run into many, but I will say this. I don't mind deliberately difficult games. I like Dark Souls and other intentionally hard games. However, in exchange for harshly punishing my mistakes I expect you to not make any. It may be the lack of directional hit markers but I swear I got shot through the wall a few times. Enemy AI is a tiny bit too accurate. I understand that even a scared moron would get lucky every now and then, but when the enemy AI literally sticks its gun out from cover and manages to land half a mag into me and my team without missing, that is a load. 

Overall I would say the game is worth $30, but just barely. They claim they'll add new content and have a roadmap so I'm sure theres more good things to come. It is a very well made game with alot of attention to detail that's held back by a few poor game design choices and bugs.",1708237860,1708237860,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Pros:
-The tactics and knowledge needed for real CQB is something you will learn quick.
-Fun as hell with a squad when everyone is taking it seriously. (Or Not)
-Large variety on weapons and loadouts.
-Satisfying when completing levels with non lethal options, forcing you think smarter and play different.
-All cosmetics are unlocked though completing stages with high rankings. You must EARN the cool stuff.
-There are some great mods to enhance your gameplay or add new maps and features.
-Tons of gunplay control. Free Leans, toggle leans, walks and strafes, ready down, free looks etc.

Cons:
-Not enough content. I've cleared all 18 maps several times, solo and with friends. I've had to resort to Mods for new maps, and zombie mode for new and challenging stuff to do. 
-The AI is sometimes too damn good. They can pre-fire to your location, often shooting through walls or objects and pixel clipping you with amazing precision and distance. I enjoy the challenge and the realism, the reaction time needed is very impressive, but sometimes downright not fair. But I guess a real gunfight would be no different.
-Your AI team will sometimes stop taking orders. Or just stop moving. Or just be in your way, not allowing you to move around. This can be improved. It's not terrible, but it is noticeable and frustrating at times.
-Finding that last damn civilian. We all been there. It sucks and is an immersion killer.

I will highly recommend for those seeking a challenging tactical SWAT FPS. Reminds me of the good ol' days of Rainbow Six on N64 or Vegas on 360. Much more impressive and difficult to master. But rewarding and fun as hell when you do.",1708237207,1708237207,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This game has so many positives I cant even list them all. Unfortunately, once you complete the Commander mode I tried to go back and complete all the levels and obtain the ""S"" ranking and the fact the only way to do this is to complete all main objectives (reasonable), complete all soft objectives (reasonable), have whole team survive (makes sense) but sadly where this game is completely ruined for me was needing to arrest every single hostile in the level (No kills). 

This sounds like its not an issue but sadly you've got to equip your entire team with non lethal main weapons and then remove your team members secondary ammo so they don't just pull out sidearms and blow away suspects when they need to reload in a firefight. Another thing that ruins the game is the only options for non lethal weapons are pepper ball guns and shotguns with beanbags. Both of which are awful at long range and with the pepper ball guns in hand if the enemy flanks you or you are within 10 feet of encountering them they just blast you through getting shot in the face. So basically, your only reasonable option is to run every level with the entire team with beanbag shotguns.

If you want an entry man with a tactical shield you have to remove the secondary ammo so they don't just kill everyone as they enter room which makes that one member of the team just a walking target.

I hope in the next few patches they change how the scoring is done. As real as this game is I feel like in some situations if you give a hostile multiple chances to surrender and the keep shooting at you or your team you'd be justified in shooting to kill.

I know it is possible to obtain the ""S"" rank even with these issues but I really ruins the game as you're limited to the weapons and tactics you use. In the later levels where you face more hostiles every level becomes the same as you've only got few tactics to take these guys down. Large rooms with multiple hostiles is basically a breach, flash bang or gas and pray the AI doesn't have god like reflexes and destroys your slow shooting beanbag shotgun team.

I'd recommend this game but obtaining 'S"" rank is just too broken and not fun at all at the moment.",1708234255,1708234255,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I bought the founder edition for this way back when it was in development. I saw the potential in it and I absolutely love games in this genre. I take most reviews with a grain of salt at this point given that this review is not even 10 days after release. Many problems are still persistent after years of development and that is disheartening for me with games like this.

I cannot recommend this game as it is. Too many issues preventing it from truly shining. It has potential, great potential and when it works it is fun. There are too many problems to list in this review, however I should not have to compare playing this game to the level of difficulty one would find playing Halo 2 levels on Legendary All Skulls on (SLASO).  I do enjoy this game, but you need friends to play it with and it is too frustrating for most.

The company behind the game is god awful. 
They increased the price from £35 to £45 for '1.0' which completely broke the game for well over a month and now they're trying to sell you paid DLCs for an unfinished project. What was that extra £10 price tag for 1.0 huh? Putting DLCs before bugfixes is a terrible look for the future of your game. I hope that they'd re-add early access features like different gamemodes and maps (Carriers Of the Vine, Hide & Seek, Buy Cheap By Twice and  Wenderly Hills Hotel) however I've got a bad feeling like these devs are going to prioritise being as greedy as possible. The game has shit performance with constant stutters and frame drops and is poorly optimised. Interacting with menus freezes the game briefly for no reason and retrying a mission on Commander mode takes so much longer than it should. They removed the 'retry' button so you have to go back to the lobby, choose the mission again and then wait through 30 seconds of loading screens and pointless cutscenes. I don't know how to feel about the AI. Originally it was ridiculously overpowered with enemies locking onto you through walls and the time to kill being literal frames but now it seems like a lot of people think it's too easy post nerf. 

TL:DR - The game is enjoyable with friends but I have so many issues that I cannot give it a positive review. If you have a spare £45/$60 lying around (will increase AGAIN soon depending on how much they charge for the DLC which should have been part of the base game) then go ahead and buy it.

Liked:
- Meaningfull tactical mechanics, Carefully checking and using deployables.
- Shooting requires u to aim well and not just run and gun.
- Some maps has coolset pieces.
- Randomized NPC placement, made replaying feel a bit diffrent everytime-

Disliked:
- Obvious AI images and lazy use of them too.
- Suspect AI still kinda dumb and bit unfair like, them being able to track me to a silly degree where some would start shooting me through cover before they rounded it themselves.
- Team AI is dumb, they will yell and draw attention to you, not shoot back sometimes and just stand and get shot.
- Inconsistant deployables, seems like things like desk and crate can weirdly decrease things like CS gas AOE.

Money before fixes. Devs are an absolute joke. Do not buy this game and avoid all of their future works.

Everything below still stands.//

------

Well, this was most disappointing. Where do I start? 

The obvious place to start is with the cracked-out super human AI. We've waited over a year with zero updates to the game, running on the promise that release of 1.0 would address most of the problems with the AI. Has it? Has it F..... It's somehow gotten worse, and it was utterly abysmal before! The AI reacts in times faster than the Human eye can send a signal to the brain and have the brain process it, and that's without thinking about how to respond, that's just receiving the visual information. It's a joke and the devs are a joke for thinking this is in anyway realistic, or more importantly, fun. But that's not even the worst part. 

They also have X-Ray vision (cue Mack's X-Ray vision song), and will pre-fire you as you're about to round corners or whilst you're behind solid objects that the devs forgot to set as solid objects (the AI can see through several objects, including pallet stacks and concrete blocks). Yeah, we all love playing against wall-hackers in multiplayer games, so lets introduce it to this single/co-op player game! I've been shot through walls, through floors, through ceilings and even loaded into a level to have all the AI just stood unloading at the spawn area. I didn't get hit and they stopped after a little while, but it did amuse me. 

//Update: The devs openly admit that the wall hacking AI is deliberate to give an element of challenge. Yeah, they suck so much at developing games that they have to make the AI wall hack to make it challenging. Absolute DISGRACE. This makes the next paragraph even more important.//

All the fun AI behaviours they claimed they were adding and which are touted in the 'release trailer' simply aren't there. The AI has one mode: Terminator. Think you're going to peek them, ask them to drop their weapon, watch them hesitate and back up? Maybe they will offer some interesting situations that require you to stop and think about how to respond? No chance. If they even get a hint of you being there then it's full on suicide mode, running at you unloading all their ammo (which is infinite by the way. Yeah, the devs gave the wall hacking AI an infinite ammo cheat). It isn't fun, or engaging. You're simply reduced to grenade cheesing tactics or playing through it like a CoD game, neither of which this game was advertised as, or excels at.

Next up, they removed a load of content. All the fun game modes that they had for the maps have gone, replaced by one singular game mode for that map. Some of the maps had alternate builds, like the hotel or park homes, they're gone. Granted, they've added a few extra levels, but they've removed more than they've added, and they've removed a massive amount of replayability with it. Also, the randomisation seems to have been significantly toned down. Now, replaying the levels, I know roughly where each target will be. I know that there's a civi behind that door without even having to open it. This wouldn't be such a problem if they hadn't removed all the extra modes, but here we are.

The new Police HQ is nice, utterly pointless, but nice. The firing range is... a wasted opportunity? You can bring targets up and down the range and shoot them, inspect the spray patterns, but you can't replace the target, so once it's used, it's rather useless until you reload the level. Could just use another lane, except, each lanes target is a different distance away. Why can't I just interact with the guy sitting at the side and have him change all the targets, i.e./ remove all the bullet hole decals?

Speaking of interacting, there's precisely eff all to do in the station. It's basically a 3D menu, but instead of being able to click, you have to run around at the speed of asthmatic snail. You can't interact with any of the very few characters that are in there, they don't ever say anything or do anything. They just sit there, like weird dolls who track your movement with their heads when you get too close. It's all very odd and an absolute waste of time, space and resources. 

Oh! The one thing you can interact with is the evidence room. You can go and look at some 3D models of items that are for the most part, utterly irrelevant to the cases you've worked on. ""This a anime model, only 50 were ever made. Lots of DNA present, wear gloves lul lul lul"" Yeah, we get it, the streamer is a perv and spaffed on the toy... Great, why do I need to be able to spin that around? How about letting me look through those chat logs from his computer? Or check his emails and piece together who this guys contacts were? Nah, that's interesting, we don't do interesting, we do EdGy! ""LUL LUL LUL! Spunk!!""

So, the police station is an absolute wash. A dull, boring box that they force you to jog through after every level. At this point, just give me a damn menu! It takes long enough to get into a level, without having to do a cardio session before!

Speaking of level loading, loading a level from an SSD is about 9 seconds, not bad. Loading a level from a HDD is about 22 seconds for me (yeah, I moved the install to test). So why do I have to sit through a 10 second count-down AFTER the loading? It's obviously not hiding extra loading, as the timer never changes. So before each level starts, you have a 10 second countdown after everyone's hit ""Ready-Up"". Cool, you then have to load, that's another 9 seconds from my SSD, you then have ANOTHER 10 second countdown. So they've artificially extended their load times to almost (or even over) 30 seconds? I don't even have the words... Why would anyone do this? Also, anything over 15 seconds to get into a game is too long if you ask me. Back in the PlayStation days, yeah, fine. Now, with current hardware, no, get out. And it's not like the stupid 10 second countdown of watching the team in the back of the van adds anything. Nothing happens and it's the exact same animation on a loop. Why can't that play WHILST the game is loading? Instead of the black screen? And then you have to do that every time you start a map, after you've trudged what feels like 10km across the barren wasteland that is the pointless boring Police Station 3D menu.

That was a lot of words... And we've not even gotten onto the performance...

Performance is, well, it's fine for me for the most part. Playing on High settings @ 1440p FSR on getting a normally solid 165fps with v-sync on. Specs are: 
Ryzen 9 3900x 12-Core @ 3.80GHz; Radeon RX 5700XT 8GB; 32GB RAM.
I do get some frame drops on initial level load. I just spin around in a circle for a couple of seconds whilst the game finished loading everything in, something it apparently can't do whilst showing me that GOD DAMN VAN ANIMATION FOR 10 SECONDS!.

Overall, I wouldn't recommend this game. It's a chore to play, has little replayability, doesn't play anything like its scripted trailer would have you believe and simply isn't worth the price they are asking for. The devs utter refusal to fix the god awful AI is my biggest reason for not recommending this game though. It's not ""hard"", it's frustrating, boring and easily cheesed once you've figured out the gimmicks. I wanted an engaging SWAT game, not a shoot 'em up or cheese 'em up, but that's what they delivered, after a year of zero updates.

On top of that tons of bugs that were unaddressed since the ALPHA. Modders fix it with a couple of script tweaks, something the devs fail to be able to do within multiple years. Then they release the game in this obviously unfinished state, despite these issues being present and complained about for literal years, showing a lack of care for feedback. Then charge 50 bucks for a game with worse AI than Swat 4, a two decade old game.

The foundation of this game is amazing, and in the early access I highly recommended it, but I now that this game had it's full release I can no longer excuse the bugs and poor AI. If you're planning to play this with Friends, get the AI Overhaul mod. 

But I'm reviewing the game here, not a mod, and to put it simple, the vanilla unmodded game is a completely unenjoyable experience after the first few levels in the current version of the game as of writing, and does not represent the realistic Police experience of trying to de-escalate situations and ""bringing order to chaos"" that was originally envisioned and advertised for the game, and instead brings a robotic, unimmersive experience that is more akin to playing Rainbow Six Siege against a team of wallhackers that requires you to . It shouldn't be put on to modders to fix a 50$ title for the devs, while not getting a single cent. 

[b]Edit:[/b] [u]The Developers just announced 2 paid DLCs coming this year without addressing the AI issues that make the base game borderline unplayable beyond the first couple missions. [/u]

I'm beginning to think this entire deal with asking people to buy their supporter edition so they can get enough funds to finish the game has just been one giant scam from the start and they never actually intended to fix any issues.

The graphics are fancy but horribly optimized, and thats about it. Next to no content, around 10 hours if youre good at shooter, no replayability at all, horribly stupid OR completly overpowored ai (either they just stay afk and do nothing or they toggle their spinbot and walhacks and just annihalate anything in range) and many, MANY bugs. Also im not sure how exactly the managed that but this game just kind of doesnt have an atmosphere at all, or rather its so monotone, unitting and stupid that you either dont notice it anymore after like 3 minutes you just completly ignore it.

Honestly just go and buy SWAT 4. ready or not not only stole like half their already very marginal content straight from SWAT 4, like ctrl c, ctrl v level lazy, SWAT 4 runs smoothly, has very VERY few bugs, ok ai and a very good and fitting atmosphere. Oh did i mention that besides SWAT 4 beeting the shit out of ready or not in practicly every aspect (well maybe graphics not quite but honestly im not even sure if the gpu that can run his game smoothly has been invented yet) it literally costs 1/5 of the money and is on sale for -50% on regular intervals being only 1/10 of the money. So yeah unless they spent at least a full year activly fixing bugs and that ai as well as adding lets say 7 additional maps for FREE, so that you could theoraticly hit that 1$/hour ratio if you were to spent 2 hours on every map(you wont, most maps are like 10 to 15 minutes).

HOWEVER they decided that after the game is out of early access now(altho it actually feels like closed alpha) its time for DLCs! Yes! Finally you can throw even more money at some unknown company that more and more looks like a scam to me given how they dont even have a wikipedia article!

I'm sorry, VOID. As much as I love you, for now it's a thumb down. How the hell can the enemy AI still kill you with aimbot at times? How can the swat AI still be quite dumb? What about the performance issues? Let's face it: they were obliged to release the 1.0 since the whole fanbase was desperate, and they hyped it up really well. I'm sorry, but this is not enough. For now, I'll wait for hotfixes to be a solution. I can't keep dying when it's not even my fault.

Enemy AI needs some work - sometimes they shoot like stormtroopers, sometimes they randomly turn around and one-tap you. 

Also, non-lethal options are highly limited, and extremely unreliable, especially when shooting any suspect on the move, so most of them. for some ungodly reason you'll have to lead your shot on point-blank range with a beanbag shotgun.

The non-lethal mechanic is unique and a lot of fun to play with to try and get a high score. It is fun that you have the option to either go in hot or try to minimize casualties with non lethal/ low caliber weapons.

A.I
at base state the game's a.i. is pretty clunky, lacking logic sometimes, superhuman reaction times (vanilla is 0.2sec irc, average human is around 0.25), x-ray vision(confirmed in replay mode) and the ability to shoot any calibre of round through almost any surface (the player doesn't receive the same penetration chance as the a.i., not even close.).

Graphics
I highly recommend any mod that removes the shaders and post processing, a nice performance bonus, the game will no longer look dirty and hazy, a genuine graphic improvement.

ROE
the base ROE is a little obtuse, and if you want those S ranks give up on playing how you want or trying out any other weapons, its beanbags and spice balls for you. they couldn't think of a way to make the roe fun AND challenging, but modders did.

>A lot of people also have very bad performance issues because this game is pretty horribly optimised, be sure to turn of world decals AND replays if you get bad stuttering.
>At least void made modding easy, these fixes will take all of 30 secs to apply, guess if you can't do the work at least make outsourcing it easy.
>gunfighter mods are also strongly recommended because of the fixed damage profiles and minor gameplay and QOL changes.

You will. 

You will enjoy this wonderful experience time and time again.

You might have mistaken this game to be a S.W.A.T. simulator - it is not. It's a Spec Ops simulator, but you are the terrorist. 

EVERY enemy has a shoulder mounted anti-materiel rifle that can penetrate wood, scrap metal, steel and Chobham tank armour plates. EVERY enemy has a neural implant that gets a data stream from a F.L.I.R.-enabled drone in the sky, streaming your position 24/7. EVERY enemy has a Type IV (NIJ Standard) armor vest. 

If you think that what is described above is an exaggeration, I welcome you to search ""ready or not blind firing ai"" on YouTube to see the nano-augmented crackhead AI shoot through SEVERAL walls, BLIND FIRING AT YOUR EXACT POSITION. Unfortunately sometimes they do manage to penetrate your skull this way, which, for those of us that have anger management issues, might result in the annihilation of all nearby electronics, furniture, walls and living beings.

But I digress, for enough has been said. 

If you enjoy having your skin removed from your face by U.S. Crack Forces, you will thoroughly enjoy this game. If not, go play S.W.A.T. 4 - at least in that game you don't play as Osama Bin Laden.

The detection radios should be also in the mechanic of the gas, like a circle of radios with full room of gas that the gas grenade is in.

the AI suspect is too strong long range and even behind cover that getting an S rank in GREASED PALMS is like impossible, the map is too wide while the AI headshot rate is 50% any distinct, I am behind a shelf and he killed me in 0.5 second with a random headshot, head shot with beanbags kills them even I am aiming at the fucking torso, make the hit box better please , nerf the enemy AI or just make different difficulties, why when the AI shoot me I am stunned but when I am the one who shoot first the AI don't? Getting shot miles away with an AKM AI and kill in half a second is not fun, it is annoying, getting shot behind cover and just head shot me randomly is even more ridiculous, suspect far away without gas mask which ALREADY surrendered turn back up and pull out a pistol while making a run in the gas is just making me furious, some stair can shoot through some cant, some window can shoot through some cant. This all makes me want to quit, because I feel like I am getting an half-assed product. This game have so much potential and people are giving this game a spotlight, like SHROUD stream and I watch him play this game, that is why I am here, I also watch him clearing this map and saying many of same problem the community have been discovering so far. It is so frustrating when a game that have this much potential giving challenge like S rank while it is almost impossible to do in some maps, and if you think this is still unfinished yet, then why putting out a unfinished product at the first place. don't give excuses and fix the game will be faster and better at any perspective.

First, the game is barely optimized, with a little map that smaller than ARMA and other Tactical game a lot, but performance it take is even worse than them all.
Second, bug is literally unavoidable, the weapon equip is broken when you got shot while having any animation playing.
Last, action animation can't be cancelled. For the example, when you trying to cuff a civilian or suspect and then get shot at, it's should be cancelled. But then I get shot and the bug I mentioned previously appeared, which is unplayable.

It is by far my favorite fps, as I prefer a slower, more methodical approach to video games. Combined with dishing out some justice to these absolute monsters, and the very immersive gameplay, Ready or Not never fails to immerse me in the situation. The guns are the best handling and most true to life interpretation of any I've ever seen in a video game. Like reality, they're loud, punchy, and when correctly handled, are faithful to their real life counterparts. This game is not all sunshine a rainbows, however, as there are some fairly significant performance issues and it definitely will struggle with replayability down the line. I would have also liked for some more variety in the voice acting, notably when reporting soft objectives, as it would better suit the atmosphere. ""Bagging evidence"" and ""Collecting"" just doesn't quite cut it for the fairly large of amount of soft objectives you will have to report manually. However, other than this, the sound design (especially the guns) is quite immaculate and I eagerly await the full soundtrack release. While the 1.0 release had a less than ideal launch and reception, I am very confident in VOID's ability to patch it up and make the game a masterpiece.

1. A realistic shooter: There is very little arcadey-ness in this game. The shooting mechanics are solid, sound design is pretty solid, you have bullet drop and other realistic details such as the actual hit is different from where the reticle is aimed because of the fact that the bullet actually simulated from the barrel. 

2. CQB first: This game is all about CQB. There are very few long range battles. Its all tight spaces, corners , hallways. 

3. Realism and vibe: Its amazing how well this game makes you feel the situation. The stress of distinguishing a non combatant from a combatant where bullets are flying, rules of engagement, the ...feel of being in an active shooter situation or entering into a place where people have been upto some heinous sh!t. With every mission the environment tells a story and I personally enjoyed the level design a lot. 

4. Multiplayer:
This game is best enjoyed with friends and the I havent encountered a lot of issues setting up a lobby and running missions. If you are running mods make sure you both have IDENTICAL mods. 

Some issues:

This mainly comes down to AI. Enemy AI can be a bit wallhack, 360 no scope good and I have seen my friendly AI just stand in a door and eat shotgun shells. Its a bit jank but the mods can make it quite alright. 

In Multiplayer occasionally the game will crash and on a good run that sorta sucks.",1708016349,1708016349,True,0,0,0.497287511825561523,0,True,False,False

The game is no longer in Early Access and so will be judged as a complete game ought to be.

[h1]Content[/h1]
More maps as compared to Early Access; however, the different game modes were removed.  Not a huge deal considering most of the other game modes were largely irrelevant.  Some of the objectives like bomb diffusing were incorporated into the missions.  There are a decent number of different weapons, but you will quickly find the differences to be negligible.  Single player aspects are slap-dash and tacked on.  Overall, decent amount of content for the price, but not amazing.

[h1]The Good[/h1]
The shooting is fun and responsive.  When things work or you use mods to correct the numerous issues, you can find yourself having a lot of fun.

[h1]The Bad[/h1]
There are a LOT of problems with the game.  For a release game, it is not great.

[u]The lobby system[/u] 
The new headquarters is fine, but the readying up is less painful than EA yet still distinctly terrible.  If at least 50% of the players ready-up then a 2 minute counter starts.  If 100% of players ready-up, there is a 10 second counter.  Once the counter reaches 0, the game loads the mission selected.  2 minutes does not sound terrible until you run into it constantly and you wish it were 1 minute or less.  Once you get your weapon loadouts set up, it takes mere seconds to switch between them, thus 2 minutes is extreme overkill.

[u]Pre-Mission screen[/u] 
This is the screen AFTER loading the map that simply shows your officer and him riding in the van.  It serves absolutely no purpose as you can do nothing in this phase.  It simply is a 10 second countdown for nothing.  Time waster.  Supposedly, there will be a planning phase, but it makes no sense to leave this vestigial section in just to waste time.  This sections remains unchanged from my EA review because nothing changed.  It is stupid and should be removed.

[u]Modifying loadout[/u]  
This section also has not changed since EA.  It is terrible and needs major help.

This can only be accomplished in the ""headquarters"" lobby and no where else.  In a mission?  Too bad.  Pre-mission screen? Nope.

The actually process of modifying your loadout is an example of terrible UI.  So much wasted space and unintuitive design.  Select the weapon on the far left then click a small modify attachment button on the far right.  What is the middle for?  Displaying useless models of course.  

What do attachments do?  Small info box that tells you + or - to some attribute.  How much does each attachment modify that attribute?  Doesn't tell you.  You have to test each weapon + attachment individually.  

[u]Controls[/u]  
Many of the standard key bindings make no sense and require you to fix them.  New players constantly have to ask how to turn on their own weapon light etc.

[u]Weapons[/u]
Weapon damage is only differentiated by caliber and nothing else.  Ignore any and all flavor text.  You quickly realize there is no point in bringing submachine guns as their damage is simply inferior.  Within assault rifles, 99% of them are pointless since the only remaining differentiation is the recoil pattern so you select the best recoiling gun per caliber and you are done.  Also AP vs JHP ammo is still essentially meaningless.

[u]Bugs[/u] 
Still have a lot of crash to desktops post-EA.  Good to see the issue made it to release.

[u]AI[/u]  
The AI is still incredibly poorly scripted and broken.  Their most recent ""hotfix"" after two months since release was a simple config file number adjustment.  The kind of thing that mods did days after release.  There are 3 major issues with the AI that require fundamental mechanics changes.

[b]Vision[/b] is a major problem since enemies appear to have 270 degree vision.  It is silly, but compounded with the other problems it become ridiculous.

[b]Detection[/b] is the next major problem.  If an enemy so much as see a pixel of your body they instantly recognize you, count you as ""seen"" (this is a huge problem as described below), and shoot at you.  Given their near 0ms response times, it is annoying.

[b]Wall hacks[/b] is the last major problem.  The developers wanted to make things more interesting by having suspects shoot at you and your general area.  It as a flavor of realism where if a suspect sees and you move behind a wall or into cover they will shoot at that area to try and hit you through it.  Good to go right?  Except they took the laziest approach by simply giving the suspects your exact location, aka wall hacks, to accomplish this.  This means once their supervision + immediate detection kicks in, you are ""seen"", thus the suspect can track you through any wall for a few seconds and land perfect headshots as if they are Neo seeing through the matrix.  This is not some advanced predictive algorithm, it just gives the AI your location absent vision or any audio cues.

All this is terrible enough, but the AI's vision is not impeded by anything.  As long as an object is not considered a hard vision block, then their line of sight will go through it despite it being opaque.  Examples: CS gas clouds - you can not see through it, but because its not a hard wall, the AI can and will shoot you as if it does not exist.  Dirty window that you can not see through, AI can and will blast you.  Tall grass concealing you, guess again.

This gives an overall very poor experience while playing.

[h1]Summation[/h1]
I gave this game too much credit in EA.  The release version is a bit of a joke and is definitely not worth the asking price.  Maybe on a [b]STEEP[/b] discount, then it would be worth a look.  I hope they actually fix it, but considering the level of effort from EA to now in the critical aspects of the game, I would not hold my breath.

After finishing the campaign and a few multiplayer games, here are my thoughts:

This is definitely a spiritual successor to SWAT 4
Great lore that's hinted at, great weapons and AI

The only two downsides are:

To get the best rank you cannot kill anyone, which is unrealistic, as SWAT it's worst case scenario so lethal force is a no brainer
For multiplayer: There's no lobby selection with categories for instance run and gun (which most people do) or tactical ""realistic"" gameplay which I prefer.

- Optimization is poor. With a beefy system I still find myself plunging into the 30 fps range at times.
- ""TOC to Entry Team"" gets old real quick. Maybe once or twice is fine but constant radio comms with a fake narrator is the most annoying thing ever.
- Game crashes sporadically, I've had it happen twice in 6.7 hours of play time.
- Player movement speed is unrealistically slow.
- No HUD for weapon status/ammo count?

Other than these points it is a great game and I find it to be both fun and engaging.

I cannot in good conscience recommend this game in its current state.

There are a very long list of issues ranging from graphical performance to enemy and ally AI, all of which frequently compound together to utterly ruin the experience.

Perhaps the biggest issue I have with this game is the aforementioned AI. As of the date that I'm writing this, enemy AI have unreasonably fast reactions and can also track and shoot you through walls before they ever get a line of sight on you to confirm you are there. The enemy AI also doesn't seem to make any distinction between visual and auditory detection of the player, so an enemy hearing you is effectively as good as them seeing you through walls.

Enemy bullets also seem to more consistently penetrate walls than player bullets do. I can' count how many times I tried to hit an enemy through a plaster wall or plywood board, only for my bullets to be stopped dead while the enemy then shot and killed me directly through that same material. In extreme cases, I've seen the AI shooting through multiple walls to hit me an my squad-mates from two rooms over. Enemies also can and will shoot you through the tiniest gaps instantly if they can get line of sight on you through them, and enemy accuracy is ludicrously precise across the board.

Your squad-mate AI is also frequently unreliable. Most of my squad-mate deaths were the result of them standing around staring slack-jawed at an enemy right in front of them for 3-5 seconds while said enemy was filling them with lead. I've had other instances where squad-mates simply refused to follow given orders or got stuck of doors or terrain when moving to new positions. 

The AI behaviors have a massive impact on the core experience of a game like this, so when absurd things like what I mentioned above are happening on a regular basis (often multiple times per mission) the whole experience becomes an exercise in frustration because you feel as if you have no actual influence over the situations the game puts you in.",1707973129,1707973129,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

They promised us workshop and delivered broken ass mod.io which defaults downloads to C: drive, lacks all kinds of filters, causes game to freeze and download is extremely slow.

Their argument on broken promise is and I quote them on this: ""Steam workshop is underperforming"".
There are more details to this from community manager himself. They chose to fuck us up over mod.io's cross platform support and their incompetence of implementation of workshop (they said mod.io was easier to intergrate than workshop so they chose that instead).

The backlash is intense and yet they stomped their foot and don't plan to do anything to fix this. No workshop, WE are left to deal with this alone.

Their ""Development update"" news which only talks about feature they are ""working"" on. (Map textures for past few months is all they did) end with a Conclusion saying you'll get to test features earlier if you buy supporter edition for 70€ implying you'll get to test out whats in these development updates yet they didn't receive anything special for past 6 months. Actually the opposite, they are going to use their exclusive skin for M4 as default intended for everyone.

The game offers a thrilling experience, with its realistic graphics and immersive gameplay.

One of the things I love about Ready or Not is the attention to detail. Everything from the weapons to the maps is meticulously designed, making each level feel like a real-life SWAT operation. The game also features a wide range of weapons and gear to choose from, allowing you to customize your loadout to suit your playstyle.

The AI in Ready or Not is also impressive. Criminals will react realistically to your movements and tactics, making each encounter feel unique and challenging. The game also allows you to play with friends in co-op mode, which adds another layer of excitement to an already thrilling experience.

Overall, I would highly recommend Ready or Not to anyone who loves tactical shooters. The game offers a level of realism and immersion that is hard to find in other games. Whether you're playing alone or with friends, you're sure to have a blast taking down criminals and saving hostages in this intense and thrilling game.

Hotfix #3 update: latest patch fixes most concerns. There is still the prevalent issue of being tracked through walls by the suspect AI. The SWAT AI is a little smarter but still stands in doorways and in front of windows to get themselves killed. There is still no diversity when it comes to the suspect AI. The suspect AI, no matter the type of enemy, always acts the same with weapon proficiency, accuracy, and IQ. This patch is very promising and is heading the game in the right direction in terms of physical game-play. I still do not recommend this game for the single player experience.

Overall, Ready or Not is an awesome experience and I love playing it. The weapons feel amazing and realistic, also you can choose from a huge arsenal of weapons. There are many shotguns, rifles and submachine guns you can choose from. From an loved HK416 A5 to a classic MK18 Mod 1 to a M1014 to even a P90 or a legendary MP7, gun enthusiasts will have a lot of fun with the guns in the game. One more positive aspect of the game that I have to point out is the immaculate design of the many different maps in the game. The QCB encounters are in lot of moments of gameplay a quick test to your reaction time and your ROE. I do have some criticism about the suspects AI, which is not really realistic. I favor it to be more realistic, like in real life, even the most trained shooters can have a hard time hitting their shots due to the according situation and ofcourse, adrenaline. What I think is that the developers of the game tried to make it more of a challenge to beat the game, rather than just being a simple ""SWAT Simulator"". And this is why I am still recommending the game, even if the AI can be a pain in the ass. And the reason why, is that because this game is PC exclusive, so anyone has the ability to create or download modifications of the AI. So if you do not like the extremely strong AI, you can easily install a mod. I can understand the developers decision to want to make it a more ""excruciating"" experience to engage in a gunfight. But I can also understand the criticism of the playerbase that want a more realistic or casual experience. The game is gorgeous at what it is trying to be, but in my opinion, it could be so much more. The reason why I am still recommending the game, is that it has just left the early access and I have trust in the developers that there will be more content in the future.",1707952111,1707952111,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Overall I liked the game very much. It was just the right level of challenging without being impossible. The level of tactical teamwork you can achieve with your AI teammates or friends is fantastic. Even though I play with an Xbox Series X controller, the controls were pretty good for not having native controller support. Steam's input mapping helped a lot with that. I downloaded a community created control scheme, tweaked a few in-game binds to be more in-line with how I prefer to play an FPS, and it was almost like the game actually had native support. The AI teammate controls leave a lot to be desired on a controller but given that there's no native support for controller to begin with, I can look past that. I just hope that if or when native controller support comes, Void creates a good and intuitive control scheme for AI commands.

Now my issues with the game: In the early access period you could replay missions with different modes and starting locations. In 1.0, you cannot. This completely destroys replay value in my honest opinion. My friends and I beat the game. Now there's nothing to do but replay the same missions over and over again in the same exact manner as the first time, with the only difference being [i]maybe[/i] different enemy spawns and some traps on doors. I have not beat the game in singleplayer. I am up to the last mission in singleplayer but it's going to be the exact same experience as it was in co-op with the only exception being I won't have my friends along this time. Effectively, this game is now dead for me and my friends until more content is released or the ability to replay the missions on different modes and with different starting points is returned.

The game does have Mod.io support, so my friends and I could download new missions/maps to play, but a game should not rely on mods to keep it going. Mods are meant to be an expansion of gameplay. Not to be the main source of new content.

Overall, the game is a solid 7.5/10. The lack of replay value kills it for me the most. If you get the game, play it in singleplayer with the AI first, then replay it with friends. At least that way, you get some semblance of replay value as the experience is a little different.",1707928242,1707928242,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

1. The gunplay. The gunplay aims (ha) to be very realistic and hits the bullseye. One of my favorite things is that there are two ADS modes: Conventional and Canted. This allows you to decide when you ADS whether you want more accuracy and stability or a less obstructed view. The gunplay is well complimented by the size and variety of the arsenal. The arsenal contains Shotguns, Automatic Rifles, and SMGs; with the rifles and SMGs including a wide variety of calibers.
2. The graphics. This game went for a very realistic style of graphics with a variety of lighting environments and accomplishes them all very well.
3. The variety of the maps. Very few of the maps are alike and none of them are too similar to one another. Every map presents an engaging and challenging environment.
4. The tactics. While gunplay is where Ready or Not shines the brightest, the tactical intensity is why I've poured so many hours into this game. Running and gunning like CoD will not work. This game asks the player to make tactical decisions constantly. It is up to the player to bring order to chaos and save as many lives as possible.
 
The suspect AI make or break SWAT sim type games. We as players expect them to act realistically: to place some value on their own lives rather than just be robots for the player to cut down. The AI in Ready or Not, I would say, accomplish this sufficiently. Although improvements can still be made, the developers have clearly put in the work to make the AI opponents varied and engaging.
 
Some miscellaneous pet-peeve issues I would like to see addressed, however, are:
•Weapon descriptions consist of a vague 1-2 sentence summary. These should at the very least be updated to include barrel or weapon length since your gun gets pushed aside and unusable when close to walls/objects. Muzzle velocity would also be helpful for comparing weapons.
•Shouting for compliance makes your aim dip substantially. If you're aiming at someone's chest, pressing the shout for compliance button dips your aim all the way below their feet momentarily and then back up. It would make some sense if shouting slightly destabilized your aim but the current system just makes no sense.
 
The developers have clearly put a lot of work into Ready or Not and have shown they are willing to put in the work to continue to improve their game. I wholehearted recommend this game to any shooter fan and I'm very excited to see what the future holds for Ready or Not.",1702930216,1707902332,True,0,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False

After beating all 18 missions, and getting an average B score on most maps after a few attempts. And S score on the easier maps(using non-lethal). I think the game is currently in a good state. This will probably change, Good things don't usually last. But i hope this does, hopefully Void will continually update this game and add new content. One last note, the AI can still kill you very quickly. They no longer 360 John Wick you, at least in my experience. But it is still best to take your time through the each level. If your using AI teammates tell them what to do. Let them help clear rooms, if you don't give them commands they just watch your back. Sometimes not all that good. But can help in certain situations.

Since 1.0 the game has definitely gotten way better in terms of maps, gameplay and progression. First of all I loved all the new and reimagined maps and most of all I loved the way that the devs took the old maps and either gave them a new layout or gave them some new lore so that they are more interesting. They did that especially well with carriers of the vine and hide and seek. Moving on into gameplay I think it is definitely improved but its had some issues, the game is in most aspects better, both enemies and friendlies, they have gotten smarter and more ""predictable"" in the sense that they do not do random stuff for no reason like before. But I feel that the devs lowered the bots difficulty way too much, before and during actual 1.0 patch they were too hard, the infamous 360 one taps were still happening and a lot of bots could kill you in really unfair ways but I feel that this newest patch that changed suspect ai lowered the bar too much. Before I would take at least 5 tries to finish a level and would still get a B or a C but now its ridiculous I have just finished a level like Brisa Cove while going in solo and using less than lethal weapons in 1 try with little effort or struggle like I would before the last suspect ai patch. Which brings me to progression, I love the new progression system and think it is a great fit into the gamebut the lowered difficulty with the new patch has destroyed the fun for me a little bit. It has stopped being about ""can i really finish this level with a B?"" and it has changed into ""am I patient enough to  clear rooms and neutralize potatos with guns for 20 mins until the game says its enough"" and i can get the cosmetics i want. I understand the community was very vocal against the suspect ai but i feel like this game has lost a bit of its ""hardcore"" feel and its brutality but other than that I love this game.

The game's AI has been massively overhauled;

The SWAT AI has been made incredibly competent, except for 1-2 situations where they acted stupid, I can easily say that the SWAT AI is better at the game than the player, they will maintain formations, search rooms, deploy items when requested and breach & clear rooms with a very appropriate stacking up and flowing in process according to what the player specifies.

The suspect AI has finally been made deeper than a shallow puddle, the AI is no longer super predictable as it was in the pre-release. AIs now have better morale system and react to deployed gadgets and situations more accurately, this leads to more AI surrendering in appropriate situations or taking advantage of confusions better to screw over the player. 

The suspect AI has also been adjusted to fit the context of levels better, in the 1st episode the AI will be drug addicts robbing a store, they are irrational and will throw themselves to the player and have a moral more easy to break, whereas the later levels where you encounter more trained individuals they will not lose composure as easily, they will keep calm, even when they realize that you have breached another room they will generally remain in defense and not run towards your squad mindlessly.

Here are some cons:

-The eligibility for S rank is still boring, it is very difficult to reliably get individuals to surrender without less lethal options, you can shoot a guy 4 times in the leg and they might still try to kill you after recovering. To to get an S rank you must arrest every single suspect. The less lethal options in the game are incredibly boring to use, while this serves as a ""challenge for those who want it."" The main issue with this is that getting an S rank should be a fun and challenging process as opposed to just being a total chore.

-Cosmetic unlocks are lame and can be tedious to unlock.

-Officer morale, basically depending on what happens in a mission the AI will have a varying mental state, if it deteriorates further after the AI is already in a crisis, they will resign even if they survive a mission. 
I think this system is bad. For a lot of missions because it essentially makes it so that your only viable options are less lethal for officer mental health, I can't say that the system is very well thought given that the game provides you with an entire armory to use only to limit it to less lethal, especially considering there are tens of attackers that don't hesitate to gun you down on later levels.",1702757141,1707843803,True,1,0,0.527777791023254395,1,True,False,False

1.0 removed the ability to execute civilians, so no more death squad sim. Guns all look and feel the same, half are just AR platform. One AK with DOGSHIT FUCKING TACTICAL FURNITURE.

NINE.TEENATYFFOR.

LET ME PLAY AS COPS WITH BALLS, I WANT AN RAB SIM, IS THAT TOO MUCH TO ASK FOR? Bangladesh is underrepresented in games anyways, Fuck yuo. I'd do this in arma but this game has way better gunplay and breaching and shit.

Swat me. Go ahead. If you guys think the game is realistic then they wont kill me anyways. I'm white!.!! BETTER LUCK NEXT TIME!

why do people  call this game controversial again? what about this is controversial? you play one-dimensional good guys and shoot evil pedophiles and cultists. What is wrong with playing the game in a way that is slightly different than intended. What actual harm is there to the consumer if the game allows you to kill civilians? None, of course. It's not even realistic, how is it at all realistic to have a swat sniper trained on you at all times, waiting to  kill you if you so much as execute ONE measly innocent civilian (let alone those caught in the crossfire). I sincerely  cannot picture the mind of a potential buyer of this game who is APPALLED by the mere possibility of civilian casualties. HOT  TAKE IN COMING BEEP BOOP BEEP BOOP WAAAAAAAA HOT T  AKE INCOMING 
KILLING CIVILIANS IS BAD :0!!!!!!!!!!! WHAT????????????????????
YOU CAN DO BAD THINGS IN VIDEO GAMES?????????????? WHAT IS THIS!  SOMEONE NEEDS TO PUT A STOP TO THIS!!!!!!!!!!!!

idk man if i find a mod that actually fixes this i might play again, but there are a bunch of other problems that make it tough to enjoy. I guess with enough modding I could fix some of those.

if you know a mod that fixes this ill leave a nice review :)
better yet give me an  RAB sim or something like that. this game would also be fixed if it were set in russia because russia is cool setting. i want to play a cool mission set in 1993. Fuck it. make a whole game about the constitutional crisis you COWARDS!!!!!!!! I will  play that for at least 45 minutess and i will fucking LOVE it the entire time.

Also, enemies tracking you through walls when they wall bang can get excessive sometimes. Furthermore, with only 18 missions, the game was around $6USD per hour of game play if you aren't replaying missions you already beat; this price is mostly justified as the quality is mostly there, but many other games make the price look like daylight robbery.

- every mission turning into a shootout, even the streamer swatting mission turns into a massive gunfight with like 6 guys shooting at you for... reasons?
- use of AI generated images in maps and, most egregiously, the main image for Relapse
- use of AI generated subtitles, which are not only hilariously bad, but genuinely useless for a deaf person
- many spelling errors, grammar errors, and mission briefing inconsistencies (which could all easily be fixed with a bit of proofreading)

This game, you need friends.
It's playable with the bots, But It can get boring fast, I Played with my brother finally for one time, And It was
So Much better then with bots, I almost found myself Never touching the game again unless we played.

The games a tactically-slow-paced, high quality intense-styled shooter.
Where you infiltrate high risk environments for a matter of many tasks, depending if its, hostage rescue, search and destroy,  or a raid, among other things.

The loud outs give you a fair amount of freedom, you can customise your gear, vests everything and clothing,

After the new update, you can now select pants, vests, shirts, tattoo's, vocals, everything. 


The games unforgivingly brutal if you play it like an arcade, you'll be killed, or severely injured depending on how you approach situations, and depending on your awareness of your surroundings, therefore making it a solid realism-based tactical shooter, with unforgiving physical health elements, You have controlled supply so you need to be aware of whats going on, and you need to be aware on how to use and execute them within situations.

The setting and graphics are all around outstanding, same with the environmental story telling, to which you can learn a lot of certain map lore and more.

You have different tactical classes,which you can implement customisation to your own will.

If you wanna be a big brute, packing a 12 gauge shotgun but running slugs? 
You can, Or a heavily armoured breacher? You can.

A Light weight Infiltrator? you can.

It's all up to your own creativity and control.

(I highly recommend looking at the games different modes, and customisation, but also the Gameplay to have a solid idea on what to expect.)

The games a 10/10 For anybody looking for a co-op tactical shooter, realistically based.

(NEW UPDATE EDIT)

The game has been overhauled, new weapons, clothing, mechanics and details, the game has just gotten better.

I genuinely don't think anyone played this build before the launch. I mean [actually] played, as in sat down to enjoy a playthrough. The AI and graphics are buggy, the performance is bad even on a decent machine, many of the levels are far too big for the control scheme, and the hostiles (appear to) behave less like real people than they did in early access. I bought the supporter alpha because I wanted to support this game to be the best it could possibly be, but when they dropped early access builds they sealed the game's (at least the 1.0 launch's) fate.

I know I said that I don't like rewriting reviews but I really hope I'm given a good reason to rewrite this one. I think the team behind this game really cares about making a good experience, and if they fix just a few things they will have one. I will be the first person to change my review back to a positive one if or when an update is rolled out but for now i really cant recommend this game.

New edit: give me a reset button. having to wait for 2 god damn loading screens and 2 menus just to try the same fucking mission over and over and over again is unfathomably dumb.

A cheap copy of the golden age of Rainbow Six games with reduced customization, actions and interactions. Overall had some promise to be more ""realistic"" but failed spectacularly with so much game breaking bugs and downright unbearable AIs.

[h1]Graphics[/h1]
The graphics is okay, but having so much problems in terms of optimization. Poor in comparison to most modern games, but bearable enough

[h1]Audio[/h1]
The music and voice acting is decent. As players require to use the voice ""command"" in-game constantly, it does not register properly where AI does not seem to detect the audio commands provided by players, be it enemy or allies

[h1]Controls[/h1]
Controls are very straightforward like most FPS games

[h1]Bugs & Issues[/h1]
Major bugs may include:
1. Ragdolls causing problems to interact with bodies (dead or alive)
2. Unable to interact with objects like doors, equipment and npcs which is obviously game-breaking
3. AI ignoring commands and ""freezes""
4. NPCs stuck in animation, causing unable to do any interaction with (only fix is to kill them, which is a problem)
[b]Stuck Civilian (Cannot interact):[/b]https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3143336836
5. Enemy AI can shoot through 3 layers of walls with pinpoint accuracy (absolutely insane and broken)
6. Enemy AI ignores damage taken, not flinching or not being stunned properly even with a direct hit
7. Enemy equipment falling under the map and disappearing
8. Enemy or Civilians teleporting due to some weird physics
9. Enemies (not equipped with relevant protection, e.g.: Gas Masks) unphased by smoke or stunning equipment, which beats the whole purpose of using them in the first place
10. Bashing/Melee enemies do nothing, as they just ignore the attacks multiple times (not registering)
11. Team AI can't go around the player even with sufficient space and gets stuck
12. Team AI can't register if there are hostiles around properly, clearly and enemy is nearby, but will register the area as ""clear""
13. To get ""S"" Rank is near impossible seeing you MUST use NON-LETHAL equipment, with NO DEATHS and NO FRIENDLY FIRES, only possible to do this is with friends or 100% SOLO. Your SWAT AI are downright ret@rded and 50% of the time, enemy AI WILL NOT COMPLY OR FLINCH, PLUS SHOOTING THROUGH WALLS
14. Team AI is basically are ret@rd$, clearing a room and standing still doing nothing. MANY cases where the AI just ignores commands to restrain enemies UNLESS THEY ARE DEAD (PRIORITIZE IN RESTRAINING DEAD ENEMIES INSTEAD OF LIVE ONES!)
15. ""Invisible"" wall, weapons (gamebreaking), body or hitboxes that can even block your equipment (grenades/taser) and bullets
[b]Invisible NPC:[/b] https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3142122480
[b]Invisible Weapon (Can't Fire):[/b] https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3147040108
16. Nonsense requirements for ""S"" ranks:
[b]NO PENALTIES, NON-LETHAL, NO FRIENDLY FIRES M0ΤHERFÙÇKING BÙ||$HÍT!!!:[/b]https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3147038759
17. Enemy AI ignores any melee attack, I was bashing using shield multiple times and AI ignores it whilst punching me through my shield and incapacitates me
18. Enemy AI shoots through shields as if they were nothing, tested whilst static, moving, peaking with variable results. Sometimes they one shot you through shields (I see the bullets on shield/visor) then suddenly die WITH NO DAMAGE TAKEN
[b]AI Shooting Across the map through shield:[/b] https://steamcommunity.com/id/hybrid_dragon/screenshot/2335747743641253007/
19. Unable to collect evidence or report dead NPCs, OBVIOUSLY when going ""S"" rank, this BUG screws all the hard work being put in to do a ""Non-Lethal"" run
20. Bugged out achievements, not only it is near impossible to achieve with the AI being imbalanced, when you actually finish it, the Steam Achievement DOES NOT POP, WOW!

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
Overall had a good concept and showed promise, but, eventually turned out to be a disappointment. Only got this game due to being similar to the Rainbow Six games (Pre Rainbow Six: Siege). For those whom like tactical shooters, get this game only when there is a big discount or when all the major bugs are fixed.",1705820754,1707784262,False,2,3,0.501477837562561035,0,True,False,False

It's either crazy or realistic, not much in between. Call of Duty, the Big Mac of shooters, is not my thing; way too appealing to the masses, and all that dlc and in-app purchases crap makes me nauseous. I also have a bit of a dislike for multiplayer(-only) games for a number of (valid) reasons, so I stick to singleplayer games.

When I first saw Ready or Not, buying it was a bit of a gamble for me. I bought it in early access (around the time when Team17 backed the devs), and it was pretty okay back then, but I was not entirely convinced. I played it for a couple of hours but quickly forgot about it. When it released at the end of last year I didn't bother to install it again. My experience with early access is mixed, and I didn't have high hopes for this game.

A little more than a week ago I was a bit bored, and I installed Ready or Not just for the f*ck of it. Man, was I surprised! After the latest patch it has become quite a polished game! I have hardly been able to play anything else since then. It's a rather dry, systematic and business-like affair: just clean out the (varied) maps, rescue civvies and find evidence... Most missions are over in less than 15 minutes.

There are no big bombastic bullsh*t set pieces, but it just does everything right. The gunplay in this game is very realistic, the sounds are spot on and loud, it's tense from time to time and it deals with some heavy topics. This game can be pretty d*mn grim at times (and I like that). Because of the randomness there's also enough replay value. Most surprisingly, it runs like a charm on my archaic 9900K and RTX 2080S on 'epic'.

AI can be a bit janky from time to time, and sometimes the game feels just a tad bit empty. More than once I couldn't complete a mission because a civilian just refused to get on his/her knees, just standing there - all traumatized and out of contact. I also couldn't finish the tutorial/training mission because of a weird bug when splitting the team. A little more NPC activity in the police headquarters would have been welcome, but it's okay as it is. What I also would like to have seen are some options to change map variables, like day/night and weather, number of bad guys and civvies, AI aggression and itchy trigger fingers... I understand the devs chose the current form because of performance related issues. That's fine.

After reading back through some old controversies regarding Ready or Not, I saw that there was quite a bit of fear of alt-right propaganda. The state of the US of Awesome in this game is extremely bad (and in my opinion not too far from where it is now or where it might soon be with the possible second term of that unpleasant, aggressive, orange geriatric baboon). You see tents and misery everywhere, probably all the result of anti-social right-wing policies and the growing wealth gap between rich and poor. Yeah, I'm a dirty socialist (to US standards, and proud of it), so I harbor a fervent hatred for the alt-right.[spoiler]I saw some questionable artwork for a Greenpeace parody (""There's No Planet B"" or something like that) in that creepy porn mansion that felt a bit like a bad case of climate change denial (on the devs' side), but one could argue that this could represent the terminal hypocrisy of the elite or that the intelligent daughter does indeed have some kind of conscience. I really do like the fact, however, that this game allows me to shoot and/or arrest some kind of agitating chubby weeaboo *sshole streamer. Now that was some good fun! Bottom line:[/spoiler] I have yet to discover anything at all in this game that tries to light that little latent fascist flame in me. So in that respect, you could also think of the content in this game as hefty social criticism.

All in all this is game is right up my alley when I'm not slaying demons or flying an F-15 in DCS. Great job, devs! Great game. Love it.

___
December 2023:
1.0 seems to be aimed at getting it released before the X-mas perioid, since that's where the money is.

However, the game just became worse in so many aspects compared to early access.

-Unnecessary re-design (even COMPLETE redesigns) of maps.
-Removal of game modes for maps (some maps ALWAYS come with a bomb timer now, completely destroying my more tactical approach gameplay)
-Extreme increase in difficulty
-Cool switch between combat music and stealth music: Gone.
-Suspect behavior people loved during early access, where they were fake surrendering, doubting, undecided to raise gun or not, where you had the feeling of suspension, aiming at the target, trying to get them to surrender, only pulling the trigger when they point the gun at you -> Well, mostly not happening anymore. Now we got terminator-enemies where trying to have a standoff and watching them (if they even play their alternative animations, it is so rare now) is something you just regret instantly, when they turn into John Wick.  
-Enemy AI that shoots and tracks you through walls, while your swat AI team mates respond by shooting at the same wall at the enemy. Like watching a wallhacker duel. And you as a player just ask yourself: Hey guys, how do you do it? Can you give me a link to the hack you are using? ;)

-Huge police station meta hub, completely redesigned, without any purpose or function.
Feels like someone REALLY LIKES to make maps over at VOID interactice. Maybe the company is run by leveldesigners. Surely feels like it.

Someone really thought too big. Maybe the financial success of the early access phase went to some heads.

A little bit of a more conservative approach to further developing the game would have gone a long way.
But what actually seemed to happen was that they went into perfection mode, touch too many things and trying to redesign too much stuff while adding things that seem like a waste of development time.

One of these things is a completely shallow and underdeveloped roster system, with stress levels for your guys.
It's so basic and irrelevant, that they could have just used that time for something more important.
Not to mention that when you die in a mission, you basically replay it as if it didn't happen (like loading a savegame), yet the negative impact of that failure on your teams morale is persistent. Makes no sense. Either the mission happened, and it failed, or it didn't happen, cause you went back to your last checkpoint. 
So this results in a negative feedback loop, where failing repeatedly will completely waste your roster.


A lot of guns seem quite useless now, because you just need the highest possible stopping power and penetration power, as enemies being hit mostly translates to ""we are terminators, we don't care being hit, instead respond with pinpoint accuracy and snap to aim-lock you in like 1 frame.""
And the penetration is important for your AI mates, as they exchange fire with enemies through walls all the time.
So a lot of possible guns (particular SMGs) are just making the game harder with no benefit.
It also feels like they upped the HP of everything.



Why for the love of god was this necessary?
Why not just improve and fix your game? Why completely re-invent it without checking for ANY feeback during the process? Like, the game went into radio-silence mode for a year, and then releases out of nowhere with 1.0 full release.
Completely abandoning the player feedback process of incemental changes.
Somehow feels like the whole dev team got replaced by some other devs.


And still we got the same major problems in the core gameflow:
-Your mates still don't react to gunfire taken by another mate while the squad is on the move.
-You still run around 30 min at the end of the map to find the last suspect or civilian.
-Still no highlights of things you point at so you know what door/hallway you are selecting to give an order
-AI mates still get stuck at doors
-Many tools still don't have a purpose. Why would you use a battering ram? Why would you use a breaching shotgun? There are no barridaced doors that would require wasting that equipment slot, or any kind of different obstacles besides ""open door"" and ""locked door"".
-Light and dark areas still don't seem to have an effect on AI. Peaking out of a dark corner at night while the enemy is standing in the open bright area has no impace. Enemies will just see you at 30m and shoot at you.
-And still MANDATORY film grain. No video option to turn it off. Just why?
-AI still shoots through smoke/gas while the player sees absolutely NOTHING. I guess, just let the Swat AI and enemy AI duke it out through the smoke/gas...  How that is not a priority improvement is beyond me. But then again, so many decision made in this project are just beyond me.

Overall, in the current state, I cannot recommend it. It's super frustrating and development is just putting the priorities on the totally wrong things. Like they lost the ability to play the game from a customers viewpoint.
They could have just went with what they got and make it really good.
Instead they fell into the trap of re-designing half of the game, even though exactly THAT game sold really well and received very positive reviews.

Fights are very deadly. It really pushes you to use mirror guns to look under doors, flash bangs around corners, etc. otherwise the AI will instantly headshot you. The AI can sense when you see them if they're in ""alert"" mode, even if their back is turned. They can fire with pinpoint accuracy across the map even while running sideways. They can track your exact location through walls and floors and shoot through them to hit you. Yep. But once you figure out how and when to use the utility and non-lethal tools available it becomes easy to earn a perfect score on all missions, but it is punishing otherwise.

Shooting mechanics are very solid and enjoyable. The game has amazing atmosphere, environments, and fun co-op. And there's some fun mods available, including ones that make the game as easy or hard as you want it to be.

There's bugs that needs fixing, weapons that could be added, much more clothing, and tweaks to the UI, AI, and changes to the ranking system. Some graphical improvements wouldn't hurt, but it looks pretty good already. 

One feature I really want for Multiplayer is a way to see WHO is ready and who isn't, so we all know who to yell at, instead of pressing Y to check if it was me. 
I wouldn't mind if there was a non-lethal pistol to use, or the ability to use non-lethals like the pepper spray and taser with the shield, to give it more versatility. Maybe a baton to help speed things along?

The cosmetics really need some more colours, especially since the basic BDU non-black pants and shirt don't match, and there's still no sign of a balaclava in the game, which SWAT often wear. I wouldn't mind some non-helmet headgear either, like caps, police hats or cowboy hats, since you can already wear some more casual gear like jeans and t-shirts. Perhaps an item could be made, like a medkit, to increase the chance of your downed officers to survive. Some more traits wouldn't hurt either, or the ability to have a Multiplayer trait when you play online, to make it so you gain some boosts like in singleplayer. Perhaps these could be unlocked for play by performing certain feats, like causing a certain amount of suspects to surrender unlocking the ""intimidator"" trait for use by the player in both Single player and Multiplayer.

The realistic portrayal of tactical operations and the variety of missions make it a true experience. The graphics and sound design contribute to creating an immersive atmosphere that truly plunges me into the world of police operations.

However, one aspect that can be somewhat challenging is the fact that enemies have the ability to shoot through walls and objects, while you yourself are not capable of doing so. This requires additional strategic planning and caution when advancing, as you always need to be mindful of not exposing yourself to enemy fire.

Despite this minor challenge, I find Ready or Not overall very well-executed. The thrilling missions, the ability to approach them with various tactical strategies, and the intense atmosphere make the game a real highlight for fans of tactical shooters.

The first time my guy told one of the team members to pie the door... I was shocked. Much of what you see is exactly how I was trained.

Pros:
-Hyper realism. Whoever you had consult on movement and tactics, knew what they were talking about.
-Decent difficulty
-When you replay a mission, most everything changes (with some exceptions) so you have to treat each replay like its the first time, nothing is predictable.
-Gear change out is smart, like the options for weapons and attachments.
-Overall fun

Cons:
-The team members sometimes get frozen, you tell them to clear a room, they don't. Tell them to follow you, they don't. Whats most annoying is that I could have a team clear a room, and completely miss a bad guy.
-Ive for sure been shot through things like metal containers, cinderblock or brick walls. 
-Needs a mission retry button. Having to go back to the precinct and go through the whole load up process is tedious, and almost kills the game. 
-Why scroll on the mission screen? The whole screen is open, yet I have to scroll through a list. Doesn't make sense.
-Should have each mission with last stats, things you missed, previous grades.
-If you're on a laptop without a page up button, good luck closing the unlock screen, which blocks a significant portion of what you need to see.
-Why have paramedics if they don't treat your wounds? 
-Should not have to slow walk through the precinct to see if the the optic you chose, is the one you want. 
-Way too much walking in general - this is where the hyper realism gets in the way of the fun.
-Should have an option for bad guy indicators. Could take 20 min to figure out who is shooting at you. Keep that for super hard mode or something. 
-Had a bad guy glitch into the ceiling after being shot (on the penthouse level) took an insane amount of time to find him and finish the mission. Had to shoot him (since I couldnt reach him) which resulted in negative points. Bad guys glitch a lot, but that was the worst one that impacted gameplay. 
-If were going for realism, you should be able to shoot through some of the doors. Scope it, see a guy, sling lead. 

Overall this is a really enjoyable game that is likely setting the standard for realism (although sometimes too much). If you put this on VR, it would 100% be decent training.

The police department is a really immersive area, and it's so cool looking around all of it, there's great attention to detail. For an indie game, this looks great. Not photorealistic but very passable, even on the lower settings. Runs between 80-140 fps on ultra settings depending on the map on my 6700xt.

NPC teammates are still kinda shitty, but the game is now fun enough and good enough to justify the purchase in my opinion.

7.5/10 - Playing with friends is awesome, playing with the AI teammates is exhausting. Probably wait for a sale unless you have buddies you'll be playing with.

Updated for 1.0:

This is an overall great game, with an excellent foundation and premise. Movement and weapons are largely fine, and matchmaking is pretty easy overall. New police headquarters is pretty cool too. 

DOWNSIDES: 
Gameplay and NPC balance. The devs ramped the difficulty up HUGELY, and my biggest individual complaint is this. The suspects are entirely overpowered. The have jedi-tier awareness and they *never* miss a shot. By the time I even OODA my way to realizing that a shot needs to be taken, they're already halfway through a mag. 

This issue makes the game boring. The only reliable way to complete a mission is to get a shield, and let your NPC buddies do all the work since only robots seem to be able to beat other robots. It's boring, it's frustrating, and it makes a gameplay loop that has one option to be successful. 

Lastly, when in single player not being able to restart a mission is idiotic. With superhuman suspects, I should be able to restart if I'm dead because otherwise all my officers are collectively losing their minds because I got wallbanged by a suspect who heard my thoughts and took me out. 

Overall 6/10 for now. It's not worth $50, but on a sale it's not a bad idea. If the suspects get balanced I'd give it a hard 8/10.",1686401060,1707668149,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The AI always has the home turf advantage, and they are supposed to be irrational actors who might not care as much as your squadmates that they are not coming back home alive.

Or multiple maps haphazardly connected into single huge maps. Or penetration being completely incorrectly coded (for example: only cares about the material type on the surface the bullet initially hits, but ignores that some models might be made out of two or more).

Well heres your chance:
Try yourself against an AI which basically has x-ray vision, perfect stability and aiming while blasting your whole squad over half the map through pixel-like gaps.

It´s so much fun.

Seriously:
The maps and core gameplay mechanics are nice but the AI ruins everything and (at leats in my humble oppinion it looks like) the devs simply don´t care since years of early access and now full release. The community is begging for changes or at least some difficulty sliders but i guess that´s to much to ask for.

It´s a shame because that´s the main issue what´s holding the game back.

Will update if they eventully patch it and it´s actually fun to play.


Update 11.02.24:

AI got nerfed/adjusted.
Now there are real gunfights and you can indeed get the ai to surrender if the right tactics are used. Readability of AI behaviour is way better, accuracy got towned to a level where you actually are not dead the minute they see you.

However the AI will kill you if you don´t pay attention, especially in wider areas like in carriers of the vine and port horkan.

Much of a better experience. I hope they keep polishing the game.

(whatever the difference is between those two)

although 1.0 update (final release) is approaching, the developers are more talkative now. it's predicted around this December of 2023 the game will be released fully, and so will the price be. the game is going to be about 50% more expensive from what I've heard. and for the very unique and close to real life experiences this game gives, do not hesitate. buy it and test it, if you wont like it remember you can still refund if you haven't played more than 2 hours (120 minutes) and any longer than a week (7 days).

supporter edition is as it says, if you want to support the developers in their making of this game.



Edit: date is 4th of January as of writing, the game has been released into 1.0 for a while now, supporter edition is no longer purchasable.

i really hate having to say this, but trying to keep this review as honest as i can. i am greatly disappointed of the 1.0 release.

i am grateful for all the hard work, but the devs simply worked so hard, on just the wrong things.

if you mean to tell me cracked AI, worse than it's ever been, massive poor performance on maps which ran fine before, where even the newer and overhauled maps are still a mess at times. swat AI being dumb as fuck but with better training, is a good improvement. you're an idiot.

the suspect AI have no brains, it's just shoot to kill. Always. not to mention their god-like accuracy, in short aimbot, wallhacks and other bullshit some people have made whole near 10 minute videos on youtube showcasing the issues. and there are a lot of em.

there are simply too many issues for this game to be considered realistic, the guns most of all.

 the only thing i have to say to the developers, i understand you're a small team. but you're focusing on the wrong things. ""to manage the advanced, you must master the basics"" yet it feels like you all completely skipped most of the basics.

for the guns, i recommend looking up Garand Thumb on youtube, he has done videos on both calibers and guns that exist in the game, and his info is very accurate. you can learn a lot from him alone but do fact check everything.

even if it's time consuming, in a game like this where your gun is your fate, it's certainly the most necessary.

in general, look up things such as ""ready or not bugs"" or glitches, issues, rant or whatever on youtube. this will give you a big idea of how the game is for others and what needs to be worked on.

my biggest complaint is the weapon handling, anything from the red dot not following too accurately when turning the camera, all the way up to the recoil. most importantly too much visual recoil than actual recoil. or too much or too little of both

You can either play with friends or with an AI squad, both of which have their individual gems that make both modes of the game a re-playable experience; fun shootouts, intelligent friendly/enemy AI, amazing weapon sandbox, fun but challenging enemies, etc.

But what gives? From what I said it sounds like I would recommend this game? For me, it's a yes and no but leaning more toward no.

There is one reason for that... BUGS. 

This game is a massive bug-ridden mess with glitches happening so frequently, that is kills my enjoyment despite all my love for this game.

1. Invisible enemies: I've now had multiple experiences where enemies are straight up invisible yet are able to shoot at me. You may think I just didn't see them? Not at all! I was playing with friends and started taking fire, but I heard no shots? My squadmates came to help me and dealt with them, and I confirmed with them that he was invisible to me but nearly killed me anyway. GAME BREAKING.

Another example was on the level ""Elephant"" where I was corned by two floating muzzle flashes.. again, GAME BREAKING.

2. Failing to completely load civilians: Time and time again there had been instances of civilians not spawning (most likely the same invisible suspect glitch). On the level ""Valley of the Dolls"" I was trying to grind for S-Tier, yet was having trouble finding the last civilian. I spent about 30 minutes retracing my steps only to figure out the civilian did not even exist. Even using the ""Search and Secure"" command didn't even work. A glitch that costed me a successful S-Tier attempt. GAME BREAKING. 

3. Failing to load objectives: Another step to my S-Tier grind, the ""Elephant"" level. I brought order to chaos and defused one of the bombs, yet I could not find the other one. I searched the map 3 times before the timer ran out and the programmed death occurred. The bomb did not completely load in and the attempt was unwinnable. This game does rely heavily on RNG for replayability, but with the glitches it seems RNG also determines if a level is unwinnable or not. GAME BREAKING.

4. BS ""Friendly Fire"" penalties: On the singular attempt that was successful for my S-Tier on Elephant, it was cheated from me due to a ""friendly fire"" incident. Now that was odd.. all of my AI teammates were healthy and everyone was running non-lethal... apparently I was doomed from the start again... what a thing to run into after doing the tedious grind for S-Tier for cosmetics I want. 

There are other bugs in the game such as trainers not showing up, suspects going t-pose after killing them, random framerate drops, etc. but those to me are not important. They don't really kill my enjoyment of the game like the other GAME BREAKING bugs I listed. 

To reiterate, I really love this game. But these bugs I keep running into after hours of attempts and carefully orchestrated strategies only to cheated due glitches.. it's tiring and it makes me want to step away and never come back until they're fixed..

In the game's current state, I WOULD NOT recommend you purchase it right now. You may end up getting a bad taste in your mouth and end up giving up on the game entirely. Wait a few months.. maybe a year, and then give it a try. These bugs will definitely be patched by then.",1650857564,1707644933,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

The fact that they gives you realistic maps and blueprints that let you plan things out is very cool too.

[/strike]
The thing i have to complain is that I have with this is the crashes and some optimization issues. I found myself played until the condo level and then it kept crashing. Maybe because I alt-f4 and corrupts something? And I had to reinstall the game over and over again until it magically fixes itself. Not sure if its the 1.0 problem or not. And the other thing too is that I just wish you could restart mission a bit quicker. I get that quitting gives you penalties and what not, but i thnik its fine too if you let the player restart while still giving the penalty and making the process a bit quicker. Although, they did implement the practice mode which helps whoever wants an S rank on a level i guess.

Impressive, very nice.

Actual post release review:
I love the concept of this game. The only game being so close to my beloved SWAT4...blah blah you all heard it.
The gun and officer customization is excelent.
The levels are very nice, there is nice balance of maps giving more attention for tactical approach and then few that are almost like some arcade type of shooters. Which is great, this game is no boring simulator.
Sadly, AI in general is bad. SWAT AI came a long way since early stage of the game, they do feel a lot better, but they are not perfect - still failing to pathfind, look other directions during breaches, stuck on ""move"" command.. It is what it is, playing coop nullifies this issue
[strike], but it doesn't change the problem with suspect AI. The reaction times, accuracy and literal ""wallhacking"" makes the less tactical maps frustrating.
Not gonna mention it makes players playing Ironman campaign mode using the most cheesiest of playthroughs.
I am sad to leave a negative review because of this. And even more sad to lay this game off for some time as I don't want to ""fix the game with mods""[/strike]

I cannot speak for the experience with random players. ***

Ready or Not is a very enjoyable SWAT simulation game. You play the role of a SWAT police officer in a team of 5 players in Single Player (4 AI bots) or 2 - 4 human players (Multi Player). The game is Coop only, so you don't play against other human opponents.

Before every mission, you select your loadout in the briefing room. There is a middle-sized selection of assault rifles, shotguns, SMGs, pistols and non-lethal weapons that you can choose from. The variety of the weapons feels limited, but the weapon types all feel very different and suit different maps and playstyles. In addition, you can modify the weapons to a certain extent and attach gadgets like lasers, flashlights and suppressors to your gun. Another decision has to be made how heavy your armor should be, because heavier armor will limit your mobility and the amount of extra equipment (ammo, grenades, C4, lockpicks, etc.) you can carry with you.

The mission selection itself gives a choice of around a dozen crime locations around the city of Los Santos. For some of the crime scenes you can select a subtype of mission, but not all subtypes are available to all crime scenes. The subtypes are:
- Barricaded suspects: Default mode, medium number of criminals and civilians.
- Raid: Large number of heavily armoured criminals. Relaxed rules of engagement (comparable to Terrorist Hunt in other games).
- Active Shooter: A gunman on the loose tries to kill innocent civilians in sight. You have to stop him quickly.
- Bomb Threat: You have 5 minutes to defuse two bombs.
- Hostage Situation: Self-explainatory.

There are two universal goals that you have to fulfill in every mission: rescue all civilians and neutralize all criminal threats. Please note that you are a virtual police officers, and you must not simply shoot every criminal, but rather try to coerce them into surrendering and arresting them. Granted, if the criminals are uncooperative or attack the police force, you are authorized to kill the assailants irregardless of the game mode. 

As a result, the game is rather slow-paced. You have to take time to assess the situation before you attack with well coordinated attacks. Still, it is very satisfying to breach a room full of barricaded suspects with flashbang grenades and a breaching shotgun from multiple entries. Unfortunately, you have to know the maps beforehand. At the moment, there are no blueprints of the maps available in the game.

The maps themselves have been improved significantly with more details in the most recent patches and give a variety of types of criminals and locations.

Overall, due to the recent improvements, I can recommend the game again for people who want to play a SWAT police officer and understand that the game is not intended for run and gun gameplay.

Please note that you have to manage your expectations, because the game is in an Early Access states. That means:
- The game is very playable, but you have to expect smaller glitches and bugs. Please report them to the development team!
- The amount of content is somewhat limited, but grows with previous (and hopefully upcoming) content patches.
- The performance, especially with night vision equipment, is rather lackluster.

====================================================================

Previous review (Negative):

In its current state (07/2022)  the game is a clear step back from earlier patch versions. Main reasons are:
- the enemies have aimbots and can / will hit you through walls even if there is no line of sight.
- the damage model is extremely inconsistent: some enemies (even without body armor) can tank multiple bullets from assault rifles.

This is sad because I clearly enjoy the game in its earlier state and I don't complain about the difficulty.
I hope that with the next patches I can revert my negative review to a positive review again.",1657393599,1707595433,True,0,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

The movement is as close to real life as you can get without adding in ladders, climbing, sprinting, jumps and drops, which would drastically increase the speed of the gameplay, making it not as realistic or immersive. The only things that need addressing; in game voice chat needs to be overhauled and updated, and the GPU/CPU settings need to be better optimized.

Why have a full loadout of lethal force options if the game prioritizes taking enemies alive, and penalizes you for having to use lethal options? You lose out on score for not taking certain enemies alive and your officers accumulate more stress when lethal force is used. This wouldn't be so bad if the AI wasn't so resistant to surrendering. Enemies will straight up refuse to give up unless directly hit by a flashbang or stinger round (which are limited ammo) and half the time they pretend to surrender only to pull out a backup gun and fire away. These issues could be overlooked if the game play made up for it but it doesn't for one huge reason, the AI has godlike senses, reflexes, and aim. Enemies will shoot you through walls, doors, and concealment and you will not even know where the rounds are coming from, they will see the tip of your boot from across the map and start immediately shooting. Imagine getting shot twice through a wall and dying while behind a shield and wearing full body armor. Biggest problem with all of this? THERE IS NO RESTART BUTTON. You have to watch the game tell you how bad you fucked up, load back into the station, all your officers accumulate stress, then you have to select the mission again, and wait for it to load up all just to get back in the action. This is just bad design. I couldn't keep playing this game, I felt like I was trying to complete the later levels just out of spite. I have rarely ever quit playing a game because it made me hate playing it this much, and I barely ever write reviews. In this instance I think a good idea has been hampered by bad implementation. Fix the AI knowing where you are at all times, add more less lethal options, and add a restart button to streamline the process and you would have a much better game. Until that happens I can't recommend playing it.",1707579914,1707579914,False,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

So either most of the development budget went to PR and marketing, or people are just genuinely starved for tactical shooter games. Either way, the hype is most definitely undeserved, and here is why:

1. Poor technical implementation
- The game doesn't look great. With all of the graphics turned up to the maximum, the image is still quite unappealing: pixelation and aliasing artifacts on anything which isn't in the immediate proximity of the player, artifacts in the reflections, a general blurry and overprocessed quality to the image of the game. Turining down post-processing helps a little bit with the latter, but the other issues persist.
- The environment is surprisingly non-interactive, to the point that it feels like playing an early 2000s era shooter. Best you can hope for are some bullet and blood sprites on some surfaces, that's it. Almost nothing is destructible, almost no object reacts to environmental interactions like gunfire and explosions. It's jarring. FEAR set a higher standard in 2005.
- Buggy and janky behavior of most objects that can be interacted with, such as NPCs and doors. Knocked out NPC bodies will clip through the environment, get stuck in it, twitch and ragdoll around, it looks and feels pathetic. Doors, one of the most important and most interacted with objects in the game, will also sometimes bug out, e.g. somehow get wedged in the open position.

2. The AI
There are many praises sung to the new AI that was released with the version 1.0. I have not experienced the old AI, but from what I have seen, it still needs a ton of work. The AI teammates will bug out on the regular, for example a 2-person squad will for some reason get split (the game treats these squads as atomic for the purpose of issuing commands) and stuck on an order, which is a huge problem in a tactical shooter where one relies on coordinated action.
The AI teammates are just terrible in general. They block your path, stand in exposed positions, ignore your orders, execute commands, which they ""forgot"" to carry out, minutes later, leading to hilarious incidents, like flashbanging a room which you just cleared, with the grenade landing directly at your feet. And worst of all, they will kill NPCs you're supposed to take alive and they will get themselves killed, ruining your experience and level score. So if you want an S ranking, prepare to park your AI teammates outside the objective and clear everything by yourself, like some sort of discount Batman, while hoping and praying the enemies don't find their way outside by a backdoor you haven't secured yet and murder half of your squad, who are haplessly standing around in the middle of a street, because automatically using nearby objects for cover is too much to ask for.

3. The controls
Frankly, the controls aren't too terrible, and after some moderate re-mapping, it plays okay. There are however still a few infuriating aspects of them, like for example the sequence of miscellaneous gear: if you bring both door wedges and a taser, they are both assigned to the key ""4"" by default, but your character will always take the wedges out first for some dumb reason, and then you have to hit the key again to get the taser out. Even if you preemptively cycle through the equipment and select the taser, the sequence resets. So imagine that you're in a pinch and want to get the taser out ASAP, because you need the adversary alive. Well, tough luck, the wedges come first. This is bad control design.

4. Game design BS
This probably belongs to the technical section, but I am putting it separately just because of how infuriating it is. This is by far the biggest issue with this game: the enemies will shoot you though cover which makes them nearly or completely invisible to you. Yes, try having a firefight with a guy standing behind a pile of random crap which is opaque to you, but he can somehow see through it. Try getting shot though a door with no transparent elements on it, while standing a good 2-3 meters away from it. Try getting shot through a thick, semi-transparent glass panel with so much glare on it, it is effectively impossible to see anything else in the room. Nuff said.

5. Level design
For the last point, I actually have something good to say. I found the level design great, all of the levels are rich in detail and fun to explore and navigate. There is a sense of realism to the locations presented in game, and it helps a great deal with immersion. Props to whoever put in their effort to design and model the maps. It is a great shame the rest of the development team could not hold themselves to the same standard.

In conclusion, I believe there is potential here. The engine is clearly capable of so much more than what has been implemented so far, and the level design really carries the game. I just wonder if the developer ever resolves to give the game the effort it deserves.",1707571959,1707573002,False,6,0,0.568862259387969971,1,True,False,False

After the gameplay update, I found it engaging for about 15 hours, with the condition that a considerable amount of time was spent just in the lobby. Yes, you can spend another 15 hours on this game to complete all missions with an S rank, but it's not worth it. 

The main complaints are:
* The AI behaves strangely and unrealistically in some cases (not always, but it happens).
* A large arsenal, but there's not much to choose from due to the lack of variety in weapon attachments. We need more scopes and collimators.
* New locations have areas where the FPS drops by half.
* There are plenty of maps, but only one mode: eliminate all weirdos, but don't touch those weirdos who theoretically can surrender but will resist.
In conclusion, it can be said that, in my opinion, the game is not worth the money due to a lack of gameplay content. However, if we are talking about mechanics, they are excellent and well thought out.

There are a few kinks that should be noted as it is sometimes annoying. But overall it was a good game and the last mission, just wow. anyways it was worth it to me, not much to do other than replay missions once you complete it but, heres the kinks I ran into.                           

1. AI for enemies, they are better from when 1.0 dropped but still have great accuracy, I used a mod to fix this
2. The SWAT AI sometimes you will be annoyed when they all enter a closet behind you and you get stuck in the closet because they are following you. They do not always secure evidence, civilians or combatants and it can cost you from S to A-B rankings.
3. The atmosphere is amazing however, it would be helpful to know whether NVGs would be recommended or not. 
4. The missions are long and complex and it is VERY easy to miss a civilian that is hiding in a area that you already cleared so there is missions I spent 20-30 minutes clearing every room again and again to see what I missed to find out it was at the beginning in a closet or office.
5. Weapon selection screen can be redone to show you what you have unlocked after completing a mission successfully 
6. The SWAT AI again, they do not always try less lethal or arresting, sometimes they will shoot the HVT and it is annoying to restart because you cannot get a S ranking with them dead.

Other wise I would say this was a great game and the mods that are coming out will only benefit it. I have a feeling with how the last mission ended (no spoilers) they are setting it up for a further set of missions and I am hopeful that they would.

I must say despite my enjoyment with the game, i think even in the most fundamental level this game is deeply flawed and probably won't get fixed, ever. 

How is it flawed? Right before that i must give them some credits.

They really did a great job for optimization on this game...somewhat. I have a pretty low end laptop (i3-6006u, Intel HD Graphics 520, 12 GB RAM) and it is somehow playable. Granted i did do some trimming on my own Windows and tweaking in the game engine but still it is impressive that the game can even run let alone running above 20-30 fps. Plus there were some maps in the Early Access version that just chugging a lot like powerpoint slides of chugging but as of now, it was gone. The maps were redone and i liked some of the maps and i disliked some others but as for the performance goes, there was barely any moment that the map dropped my fps that hard. 

That being said, let's get through the negative part. 

The Police Station kinda sucks. In the early access version, the lobby was a small confined space so i could join multiplayer games easily in and out. And yes, i could play a bunch of multiplayer with this garbage of a laptop and it would perform similar as how it would be played in singleplayer. But in the release version, it took a long while to load in the station so in the multiplayer, simply it never had the chance to load in properly and screw up the visuals. Sometimes it crashes my games even. I know it's not really surprising since i'm waaay below the supposed specs but i think it's still worth to note upon. 

Next one and the most important one, the AI. I don't really mind to have a more challenging AI and whatnot but the fact that i have to take care 4 babies that doesn't even know when to take cover, when to suppressing fire. and when to follow my orders mostly, that's just so FUCKING ANNOYING. And it's not like the enemy AIs are the same. I saw with my own eyes, some of the terrorists COULD DO JUST THAT while my teammates were never NEVER EVER DO THAT. Not to mention they would FUCKING WALLBANGING IN THE MOST NON SENSIBLE WAYS POSSIBLE. This felt like i'm playing a European game from 2000s with all of those European Jank glories. This game has novelties but the execution of it just really, really flat. 

And here is the kicker, they were intended to be like that which is the most basic way of a game philosophy of giving a hard time for players. Which is, in my humble opinion, an utter bullshit. Like i get it, we wanna make the game as unnerving as possible but even so, don't break the immersion of the game by making your allies AI DUMB and the enemies AI very much more superior. I even saw an enemy AI crawling, and neither of me and my allies can do that. Having a deliberate disadvantage for the players to make things spicy is the most outdated mindset in game design and i think it needs to stop. 

If there's any way to mitigate my negative perception of the game, they would have to get rid of that ancient design and just make everything balanced and make sense. I want to take upon a role as a SWAT officer, i don't want to play where i take a role as a SWAT officer. Having these issue for me really breaks that immersion away and i keep being reminded that i'm playing a video game, which is sucks. Might as well just degrade the graphics to look like SWAT 4 and rehaul the gameplay to be as fast as COD, hell even the enemy AIs have already play like that. But if this game wants to keep the integrity of the game's aesthetic, might as well make everyone behaves like how close they are in real life. Because that's the impression that the dev had given in the past years, grounded and immersive. 

I think they really don't need to change a ton. If they think making more maps or game modes will save the game they are deadly wrong. It's not about the content, it's the core gameplay and as of now, it is an utter shite because of the discrepancies of gameplay between the players and the game's AI. I truly, truly do hope this will get rectified and by then, i can proudly say i enjoy thoroughly playing this game.",1707510439,1707510439,False,1,2,0.510489523410797119,0,True,False,False

Okay, my original review was definitely cringe.

I've changed my mind about this game since Feb 6, of 2024.
Ready or Not - HOTFIX #3 was released then and updated the game.

I can wholeheartedly recommend this game without shame now.
It's still not in a state I would consider to be finished but I can say that it's a dope cop game and it's definitely worth the cheddar.
VOID clearly spent their time reading reviews and watching critiques of their work because the patch notes scream, ""We heard you!"" and the results are very enjoyable in-game.
They fixed a bug allowing prolonged engagements between suspect and SWAT AI, through walls, without the need for re-acquiring line of sight. They halved suspects' bullet damage through walls. They revamped how suspect AI calculates suspect accuracy and re-balanced it. They also added a lot more audio to suspect, civilian, and SWAT characters. They also added more audio to mission maps making them more immersive.
There are still things missing like icons for items in the customization menu (for example the ballistic face mask has a customization option keeping it black but tinting the visor gold. Its option's representative icon is a red, 'X,' and little text reading, ""missing data.""). The AUG assault rifle is held improperly and I'm guessing it's missing all of its proper read and reload animations too (from third person).
A complete product should be more polished than this game is in its current state (Feb 9, 2024.). So I'm not going to say it's ready, but I will say it is fun and it is a dope cop game and it is definitely more fun than it was!",1705984321,1707503708,True,0,0,0.503622472286224365,0,True,False,False

- Friendly AI is still broken and your orders are ignored 90% of the time (until you ""reset"" by ordering fall in and retrying which also won't always work)
- The performance is terrible and the FPS drops to 30-40 even for people with amazing hardware
- Some maps are really huge and labyrinth-like. That sounds like a good thing, right? Well, no, considering that you have to spend like 20 more minutes running around a cleared map trying to find that one last civilian that you ordered to be restrained 40 minutes ago and the SWAT AI confirmed the order and proceeded to just stand right next to that civilian instead of doing anything. 'Rescue all civilians' was a great objective in SWAT 4 where maps were relatively small and very focused. These behemoths shouldn't have such general objectives unless you're going for an S rank.
- The gamemodes that added cool diversity to the small pool of maps RoN has were removed for no reason
- AI-generated artwork, AI-generated subtitles, Ai, Ai, AI
- The replay feature is a hot mess. At first it couldn't be turned off and would fill your drive with gigabytes of files and now, after hotfix, it doesn't save the setting you choose. You have to enable the replays every time you play if you do want them. Not to mention that the system itself is just borked, has issues with metadata (you have to find your replay by time & date because every map's name is TransitionMap according to the replays)
- THERE IS NO MULTIPLAYER LOBBY BROWSER, only automatic ""matchmaking"" queue. I hope I don't have to explain how bad that is
- And if ONE MORE TIME I'm going to be ADADADAD strafe-killed by a low income housing resident I'm going to lose my mind

Back then the AI wasn't too crazy, the gameplay was enjoyable, if not a bit repetative due to not many maps being available. Then the ADAM update released in december last year. It introduced some new maps and several game breaking bugs as well. Also they somehow made the game run like ass even on higher end PCs. The update made the SWAT AI useless because they could not even enter a door anymore for some reason, and they made the suspect AI almost impossible to deal with. They shot through walls with pinpoint accuarcy. They would turn around and instantly shoot you in a millisecond before you even had the time to pull the trigger, even if you had an advantage over them. They never surrendered, constantly rushed at the player with no sense of self preservation. The ADAM update was a year ago. In this year the developers only released one hotfix in early january that barely fixed anything and then went radio silent. They would share some really minor details about the developement during their ""biweekly newsletters"". After serveral community outrages because of the lack of updates we finally got a date to the 1.0 release. I was really excited, even more so because of the AI rework they mentioned. But when 1.0 dropped it just wasn't what I expected. Before 1.0 I could run the game on high setting at 50-60 fps. Now I get huge fps drops even on the lowest setting on some maps, reaching as low as 12 frames per second. A tactical shooter where you need pinpoint accuarcy at times is unplayable like this. The update also made the suspect AI even more agressive somehow and now it's basically impossible to complete some maps alone or without casualties or non-lethally (the last two are required to get S rank on the maps). They still shoot you behind walls and through doors even if they don't see you, they still rush you, they never take cover, sometimes they are not dazed by multiple gunshots at all and they continue firing, and they very rarely surender. The only thing 1.0 brought was some new maps, and some reworks to the SWAT AI which makes them usefull again but it's still far from ideal. Ready or Not was not ready for the 1.0 release (which is quite frankly ironic) and calling this anything but still early access is simply wrong. After having a full year to fix stuff there's simply no excuse to release a game in this state and call it version 1.0. No matter how much I enjoyed this game when it first came out I just cannot recommend it to be purchased at this time especially after the price increase which came with the full release. It's a shame too because this game has so much unrealised potential and would be the pinacle of the genre if the developers simply put more effort into it.

Edit: (2024.01.18) One month after release, VOID is still not adressing (or even acknowledging) either the performance issues, nor the unrealistic ultra OP suspect AI. They released one hotfix one week after release, went radio silent for 3 weeks and just released a hotfix today. Neither of these hotfixes fixed any major bugs.

Edit 2: (2024.02.09) It's been almost two months since the 1.0 release. VOID released a really small hotfix on the 22nd of January, which again didn't fix anything major. 3 days ago they released another hotfix that actually fixed important issues like the aimbot suspect AI and such. Overall the game is much better now and actually enjoyable because you don't get inta-headshotted through a wall when you don't even see the enemy. But there are still some major issues. Even though the suspect AI has been toned down a bit they can still track you throught walls too accurately and they still lack any sense of self preservation, still rushing at you guns blazing. The performance, although a bit better, still leaves much to be desired because you still get massive fps drops on some sections of some maps. Overall I can see the improvement, but my rewiew will stay negative until VOID delivers on their promises.",1703702567,1707483788,False,4,0,0.546451449394226074,0,True,False,False

I used to be happy and enjoy passing levels designed for 5 people alone, now because of the damage that I (don't) take I feel that the game forgives my mistakes to the point that I pass levels with the first - second attempt from which it ceased to bring the pleasure that I used to get by passing levels alone, even after 10 attempts.
Also appeared some problems with the rendering of walls, appearing and disappearing literally in front of your eyes I can accept and put up with the holes in the hostages models, missing clothes from the models, hats and vests flying near the models or corpses, but the invisible walls are too much for me

[h3]cons:[/h3]
- it's buggy, your team get's stuck on staircases, stuck in hallways, stuck responding to an orders
- the enemies react with superhuman reflexes, a crack-head will see you from 100m in pitch black darkness through a window on the third floor of a house and start shooting from within half a second. This usually feels unfair, this is a common complaint evidenced by the countless mods tweaking the enemy AI
- it can be tedious, a lot of the time an objective is ""secure all hostages"" which means the mission doesn't end until you've checked every single room for 1 guy you might have forgot to cuff.
[h3]pros:[/h3] 
- there's a bunch of maps, 
- the game feel tense to play, 
- it's got all the tacticool stuff I think most players would enjoy,
- you're rewarded for being slow and methodical.
- random objective/enemy/civilian placement means replay-ability is good.

This is a very fun game. I love the tactical mechanics of it, which reward you for taking your time and methodically approaching the situation.

I love the lethality of the firearms, I don't think they should be tweaked at all. However, the squadmate AI could use a bit of work. It is a problem that sometimes you issue an order to your AI squadmates and they just stand there and don't complete it (sometimes they just stand there without doing nothing). It's also an issue when you clear a room and your AI squad either doesn't cover you and you get killed while arresting a suspect, or if you let them do the arrests themselves sometimes they don't do so and just leave suspects as is (which allows them to get up and fire at you again).

Looking forward to future updates that fix the superhuman AI suspects. I also hope the developers add a PvP multiplayer mode (that would definitely add a lot to the game).",1704665815,1707443923,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The complaints I had from the initial release (old review left below) are still here, but the with Hot Fix 3, the initial accuracy feels a lot less punishing for peeking your head over a window or slicing a doorway a little too wide.  The AI will still spot you inhumanly so, and react wildly fast, BUT you don't get lased by AI bullets right away.  The erratic first shots really tone down the punishment while still keeping up the stakes and the potential to recover.

I am only really speaking from a True Solo (no player / AI teammates) perspective.  With friends--and I'm sure the AI Squad/Team aspect--this game is a joy to play.  But to progress well, or complete missions with high grades, a constant self-reflection after every death and failed mission is needed.  To borrow a quote the From Soft community uses: Get Good.

A 1hr play session of constant deaths in one mission might go:
Q:  Why did I die there?
A:  Well, you didn't wand under the door to that hallway before opening the door and got blasted.
Q:  Why did I die there? 
A:  Well, you got that hostile to surrender, but you rushed into the T intersection of doors and a hallway to restrain them without clearing and got blasted.
Q:  I wanded under the door to the hallway before opening the door, I got the hostile to surrender, and then I made sure I was clear down the T intersection.  SO WHY DID I DIE THERE???
A:  Yes, you did all those things, but you could have cleared the building in a totally different path as to not open yourself up any kind of sideways scenario in that hallway from that approach.  Again, Get Good.


If you like realistic, smart, and reasonable approaches needed to accomplish difficult tasks, this game is for you.  Would Recommend.

I recommend playing the game with a voiceatack profile (until we get voice commands like Swat 4 SEF mod). With voice commands you can manage your squad pretty well and always keep every corner protected.

This is really important because AI is really hard in this game. Sometimes they will rush you in, start running away from you, blind firing from corners, trying to gett you from behind, even some suspects can lure you into a trap when arresting them. AI is very hard. AI used to be super soldiers, since last patch AI is okay if you manage your corners and back correctly.

For me AI is now max level dificulty, but NOT supersoilders (unplayable). With a good management it's now posible to do all levels without somebody of your squad dying. So for my setup (with voiceattack) AI is perfect.

That being said, if you play without voiceattack or similar I can totally understand that the game becomes imposible. In the current state the game is almost unplayable in very open maps if you dont have voiceattack or similar. So please if you are going to buy the game take into account that. I think it's still posible to beat it but probably going super slow.

Finally if you expect this to be the house raid Modern Warfare kind of gameplay, DON'T BUY THE GAME. You will get too much frsuted starting from the 4th level or so. This game looks as good as most of the new MW games, but don't be fooled. The dificulty of the game it's not like the ones you can find in AAA games. 

To make an idea most of the players do not even have the achivement of completing all levels with a C (only the 1.3% of players have it, as of writting this) or greater. In order to have a C or lower you have to commit a lot of faults, more or less equivalent at killing 2 civilians (in points).

The Devs absolutely need to re-work suspect morale, because it's absolutely insane for a suspect to still be a crackshot head-eyes aimbot after being pepperballed with a full mag and also getting a direct flashbang 5 feet away. 

Mods completely fix most of the issues that people have gripes about with this game, which is almost the only reason why I would recommend it in its current state. It is incredibly fun to use VoiceAttack to give your AI voice commands in Commander mode. Multiplayer is fun, but good GRIEF it is impossible to go non-lethal even WITH gas, pepper rounds, beanbags, etc. These should absolutely be disorienting to the suspects, but for whatever reason it doesn't make a shit of a difference.

Devs, you've fixed so many of the gamebreaking issues but I am still not sure I would call this a finished game with the state of the AI (but thank you for fixing the ridiculous shooting through walls, or addressing the issue). 

The game has come a long way, but it still has many finishing touches it needs. There is hardly any time to coerce a suspect into compliance, and I wish there were more hang time for a suspect to decide whether or not they are going to promptly headshot you or your teammates. Mods address these issues perfectly -- but the game should not need those mods, nor should they need to be the top downloads.

With all of that out of the way, I really love this game. I love the tactics, the strategy, and I love the grittiness of the game. It is innovative and I believe it will shape future tactical FPS games. It truly is a great game.

theres no way to restart the mission if your AI gets bugged and if you leave some of the officers will develope what i can only describe as a panic disorder and cry about it to the therapist. The only way i found was to alt F4 of the game so i dont get fucked by a bug.

The game challenges you and punished you for the smallest of the smallest of things making you play slowly and methodically making sure to check every single corner. The game punishes you for playing too fast, and slow . Playing too fast will result in your death, while playing too slow can result in some maps blowing up.

The song design in Ready or Not is also incredible, every gunshot sound is so intimidating making me think twice before shooting… and it’s amazing. You need to always question if someone is surrendering or not. From the screams of children, to the moans and groaning of a dead body on the floor, to the 911 calls is amazing.

That being said, I'm going to have to err on the negative side and not recommend this game. Keep in mind, the patch itself only took around 10 mins roughly to load, so it wasn't an internet issue. It was the verification process that took ages because as of update 1.0 it is still a pretty buggy mess.

Okay, lets start with the positives: great AI, world building, good gameplay and fun with friends. It is in every sense of the world a successor to the acclaimed SWAT 4 series and it does its job well. The maps are expertly detailed, the gunplay feels solid and impactful and the tactical aspect is pretty fantastic, as expected. The SWAT AI has seen massive improvements too with 1.0 and its pretty great how they've thought out how the AI could be helpful rather than a hindrance to the player like in former versions of the game.

Now, onto the negatives. Lets talk about the fact how the developer is just really absurdly inconsistent with keeping the community informed. At times they are excellent, providing detailed overviews of whats to come in new updates with gameplay footage and explanations in laymans terms, as to help the average player understand. But then, out of the blue, they'll go radio silent for MONTHS on end. This is behaviour I'd expect from amateur game devs, not a studio that has a solid reputation and thousands of supporters. This behaviour would have flown years ago when the game first entered early access. Its been literal years and the game is still in early access, but the devs have not shown a good commitment to improving their standing and keeping their community informed. 

Next, what the fuck is up with the enemy AI? All that work put into the friendly AI is frankly negated if the enemy can 360 blindfire and one tap your character when they are completely flashed. To put it nicely, the enemy and civvie AI in this game is a buggy mess. For all the improvements of the friendly SWAT AI, the game completely nullifies them by the lack of polish and work done on EVERY OTHER ASPECT OF AI in this game. Don't believe me? Check out the subreddit as well as Youtube; there are plenty examples of what an inconsistent mess the enemy AI has been. Frankly speaking, I am very let down by this considering the game is considered 'completed' at 1.0. This is acceptable for a game early in the development cycle NOT a game that has been in early access for several years only to be presented with a buggy mess like this. 

Lets also talk of the lack of polish. While the levels of the games itself are very detailed and clearly have a lot of love put into them, the fact that much of the game lacks any real polish cannot be ignored. Simply put, the game just FEELS unpolished and janky, even with years of work put into it. The sad fact is, this inherent jankiness can be ignored if there was more love put into other aspects of the gameplay, such as the AI, but both of these problems in tandem just make for an unpleasant gameplay experience. The textures of the game are inconsistent, compounding the issues of lack of polish. The overall feeling is just...not great, even with years of development. Extremely disappointing as I've been closely following the development of this game for years and was extremely excited when it touted itself as a spiritual successor to SWAT 4. That being said, even SWAT 4, a 20 year old game at the time of writing feels more polished and smooth than this game does with it's next generation graphics.

All this to lead into my next point, which is that, as of 1.0, this game is a buggy, unoptimised mess. From weapons glitching through the walls to absurdly poor file optimisation, the game is just messy in every aspect. It is unbelievable that, even with a dedicated team working on this game and no other projects, they have no found a better way to get the game to update. It is absurd that a 2.4GB patch takes 2 hours because of poor file optimisation leading to slow verifying times. For 176HKD, I honestly expected a bit more. In the past year I've owned this game, I've found myself coming to it less and less because of its frankly awful load times; in the past week alone I tried launching this game TWICE for quick play sessions only to realise that the slow patch cycles paired with the buggy mess of a menu made it impossible to even join a lobby to play the game. 

It is precisely these issues that make the game a novelty and unpleasant for new players to actually get into. With development progressing at such a slow rate, I'd expect most of the dedicated playerbase to continue to decline until this game becomes a forgotten relic unless the developer takes strides to improvement the subpar gameplay experience as a whole.

I know I've been very critical of RoN thus far, but it really isn't to say I expect a triple A experience from a developer clearly unequipped to provide one. But for fucks sake, some communication with the community would allow for more leniency from the playerbase. The fact is VOID has neglected to do this, letting down the entire dedicated community and it is with a heavy heart I must say this game is just simply not worth buying at its current state. I was once a proud and outspoken supporter of the devs, constantly coming to their defence when people criticised them for various reasons online, but even now I am forced to say that they were right and I feel extremely let down over the years of development this game has seen so far. 

TL;DR: At its current state this game is undoubtedly NOT worth buying.",1707402264,1707403001,False,5,1,0.583243131637573242,0,True,False,False

IMO, it has the smoothest animations and ""feel"" for CQB combat in recent history, and is extremely reminiscent of the old SWAT 4 formula, and in many ways can be seen as it's predecessor. Even some of the UI for commanding your SWAT team in single player feels almost ripped directly from SWAT 4. Online, with a few buddies, this game absolutely freaking shines if you're all on the same page. If you're looking for thoughts on the game, don't bother with the forums... This community, like most in this genre is extremely hostile and toxic. But, take it from someone who's still got the original CDs of many of the original old tactical shooters - this game is fantastic. 

Some of the highlights for me are:
- Weapon barrel length matters. It's hard to clear doors with long barrels, or stay close to other members of your team.
- The friendly SWAT AI is generally fairly competent compared to the contemporaries in the genre.
- Lots of weapon porn. The animations for the weapons, look, and function is absolutely spot on, and closely reflects what many actual real departments both past and present have used, even down to the bolt hold on the MP5/10.
- A few ""game"" like devices to make things a bit more fun (optical wand, door wedges, etc.). Do they exist? Sure. Are they really used? Not much that I experienced IRL, but they don't detract from the game in any way.
- Builds on the concepts of SWAT 3/4, both of which I adore.
- Plenty of achievements, customization, etc., that I feel add to the gameplay.
- Lots of little things, such as in-between mission story elements at the HQ changing, as you can see the story evolve, etc. The story isn't super rich, but they're all tied together in subtle little ways that reflect as you progress through the campaign. Take a few minutes and look between missions. 

Some other notes:
- At first I didn't care for the ultra large maps, but they've since grown on me. Still, I'd prefer to see more linear and/or smaller maps included in the future.
- AI isn't perfect, but it's still damn good. The recent patch (as of this review) has helped a bit. Be prepared for suspects to shoot through walls, and flank. Go slow, methodical, and think.
- There's a few UI and other little bugs, such as the compass not working properly, etc.
- I'd like to see a bit more intel on the briefings to help determine kit loadouts for new players.
- Doorways are kinda funny in that they open both ways? I can overlook this, but I'd like to see this adapted.",1707370779,1707370779,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Yes you can bring a different loadout, yes enemies will be in different places, but all of that didn't really stop me from finding the mission repetitive really quickly.

The game has a charm, it's really great to discover a level and run it for the first time, the game is gorgeous, the environments are fun. But aside from wanting a higher score, there's no reason to replay a level, and all of the wow factor will be gone.

So, if you're like me, and don't think you're going to beat the same levels over and over again just to see a score number go up, well this game is 18 levels that last about 20-30 minutes each, they don't get much longer as the game progresses (confirmed by friends who beat them all), so assuming you're good at shooters, you're looking at around 15 hours to beat every level.

It's not an original formula, but in 2024 it might as well be.  In a world where everyone wants to develop the next big live service MMORPGFPSPVPVEMOBA game, Ready or Not just wants to be a tactical shooter with big brass balls.  The game strives to be realistic and mostly succeeds, but it does so without feeling as sterile as something like ArmA III.  Instead, Ready or Not presents its grimy, dirty setting in a way that might make you believe the developers wanted to score a horror tag for their Steam page (as of this writing, a sizable portion of the tags actually are for horror).

There are a lot of things to love about Ready or Not.  I already mentioned the setting, which is so thorough that people are able to make lore videos for each level on YouTube.  The gunplay is weighty and crunchy and full of consequence.  The squad controls are simple, intuitive, and as of 1.0, enable the player to command their team with far less micromanagement than similar shooters.  Speaking of which, the 1.0 SWAT AI is fantastic:  they take cover, arrest suspects, gather evidence, and even take initiative to move into connected areas, all without your prompting.  There's a lot to love here, and not a ton I don't.  I absolutely recommend this game.


Now...that said...I have some concerns.  As of hotfix 3, I'm worried that the game might be getting too easy.  A very vocal subset of the community seems to have spooked Void, resulting in Void nerfing enemy AI considerably.  People were angry because they claimed to be repeatedly massacred by AI firing through walls after seeing just a little pixel of the player character.  I haven't had this experience at all and I think it's a skill issue:  anyone who takes the levels slow and really thinks about their next steps while taking deliberate measures to control the situation can successfully play this game and do well.  I don't think that Void is right to cater to the people who routinely get their whole squad killed by a booby trap because they didn't take the time to scan the threshold.  Before hotfix 3, I felt a lot of tension on each mission, believing that death lay in wait for me or my team behind every door.  I was always very careful and very deliberate because it was what the game required.  Since hotfix 3, I haven't lost a single squad member, and I feel less tension.  Hotfix 3 didn't ruin the experience, but for me it has altered the experience in some unpleasant ways.  Hopefully this doesn't become a trend, because I like the high stakes hardcore nature of the game.  I'd like to see that preserved.",1704494236,1707359158,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This game can be played as a shooter, but the real fun comes if you play it like a tactics puzzle. Most complaints you will see around this game are around A.I. difficulty.... As of hotfix #4 at time of writing, I think most of the issues I had with the AI have been fixed.

If you find yourself dying alot my two pieces of advice: 1. slow down and be careful, 2. door wedges are your friend.

Multiplayer is super fun if you play with tactical people, really good with friends and there is an active community on discord, if you find drop in matchmaking to be too chaotic.

The current version, the newest update, and this game, Ready or Not in 7th Feb 2024 is [b]STILL[/b] the definition of [b]2 steps forward 1 step back[/b].

[strike]Call me noob I don't care, but the AI has return to its ridiculous state, aimbot or smart, I call that a bullshit. Wall-banging? Yeah, it has return with horrible ways. Other than that, I can mostly tolerate. 

[b]Edit: After tried various way like human being would do, I understand that the game intentionally wants you to play extremely methodical and no run and gun which is understandable, but the suspect AI being able to snap-aim is just unbearable, only thing to have an advantage over suspect is to stun the sh*t out of them. Because stunning suspect is a requirement, it defeats the purpose of being ""Special Weapons And Tactics"" unit, its just ""Special Stun And Arrest"" at this point.

Edit 2: After finishing the campaign with multiple failures on my belt, I have to say that the suspect AI is extremely inconsistent. 
[list]
[*]First of all, suspect morale. Most suspect I encounter are stubborn and will get up asap when you're out of their sight, AI SWAT will not keep their morale in check which is dumb. (Only certain characters such as the disguised workers in the Port map will comply without problems.
[*]Second of all, suspect accuracy. Yes I've noticed they finally took note of some of the older AI overhaul mod where if your distance between suspect is farther, they will more likely miss the shot and vice versa. But in this current version, [u]it's inconsistent[/u]. Sometimes, suspect will don't have any problems hitting you in 40 meters, other times, bullet storm without a single scratch which is very frustrating to deal with.
[*]Third of all, the suppression mechanic. I understand that even in irl, you will definitely be flinching if bullets fly right by you, well, that is when its only [u]a problem to the player[/u]. You see, suspect won't even flinch or lose accuracy or any visible decrease of morale when being suppressed. Making the suppression mechanic felt like it working against player rather than AI.
[*]Fourth of all, AI interaction with world geometry. As many people and I already pointed out the nature of suspect's wall-banging behavior, another issue is that any semi-opened doors are a danger to the player due to whatever the logic running behind the scenes determines that {if door is open = visible behind the door}. Same goes to windows and certain semi-transparent object as well, where there are many graphics rendering issues (which I'll mention below) making it difficult to look through whereas suspect won't have any issues with it (same goes to CS gas).
[*]Last of all, the trailer units are broken, only appear in Gas station level once. Felt funny when they mention about trailer units in the announcement update just to only work in one scenario huh.
[/list][/b][/strike]

[b]They've now mostly fixed the suspects AI problem. Yes, read again, you got it? No? I said MOSTLY. They sometimes still shoot through walls without line of sight. (My first playthrought on Neon Tomb) Other than that, you can mostly stand a chance against suspects alone which is plus.

Ah ah ah, you think that's all? [i]Weeeeell[/i] in return, we got a significantly worst SWAT teammate. One or two of your member is like having hyperactive ADHD syndrome and start walking to the next room and losing against an enemy who sprays their gun for 5 seconds in their general direction to react. Or even unable to shoot their gun due to being too busy panicking and stand around like a sitting duck waiting to be killed. 

Even greater is that any civilian you told them to exit DOESN'T COUNT TOWARDS ALL CIVILIAN RESCUED. SERIOUSLY? I WASTED MY 26 MINUTES METHODICALLY CLEARING THE DANCE FLOOR AND NOW YOU DECIDED TO F ME OVER? You know what I'm done, I will keep playing for the sake of ""fun"", not stupid ""immersive"" logic. [/b]


And whoever working on the graphics department, I hope you have a pair of thicker glasses as the game is awfully blurry as hell with or without anti-aliasing, only way to make it clearer is to slide the render resolution up to 150. No, I did not have motion blur on or any fancy thing just to write an excuse, this is serious and it's frustrating to play. (same thing applies to opti-wand picture-in-picture mode.). [strike]For the object semi-transparency issue, certain objects such as hair, glass, and many other transparent object will not render correctly making it look like someone put a fishing net on objects.[/strike]


[b]Edit: Glad they fixed the shield glass glaring issue, just forgot to mention here. And other semi-transparent/opaque object fixed. [/b]


And whoever is working on the technical side of things, I hope you played the game and understand how much broken UI you introduce while older UI bugs left unfixed. [i] And why is choosing entry point doesn't work on certain maps? Is the UI for show?[/i] And why can't I see other player's ping with your new fancy chest tablet? It's just ridiculous how much things can be better but it always require extra step to do so.

[b]Edit 2:[/b] [i]After a bit more playing and fiddling around SWAT AI morale & benefits mechanics, first of all, for the positives, I definitely like the little details about each SWAT member, their small ability perks, personalities during in-scene (dialog/ comments on certain environment) and morale system. HOWEVER, when it comes to how morale affect their performance in-scene, it isn't really noticeable at all, and the small ability perks each member provides are barely even useful when the main problem is still hasn't fix (suspect AI morale, behavior & accuracy).[/i]


[b]Worst case is when you're regularly being killed by ridiculous suspect AI or killing suspects, SWAT member morale will drop due to being arbitrary traumatized by your death or their death until they either got KIA or disbanded which made an even bigger mess in terms of gameplay variety for player choice.[/b] (I literally fired all my SWAT members go in empty handed with default SWAT members)


Overall, I appreciate the update, the new/ overhauled map, the new weapon, the new campaign, more cosmetics and achievements. But the technical side of things is just unbearably horrendous. And as I already mention, current state of the game is the definition of [b]2 steps forward 1 step back[/b]

They also had two really great quality of life improvements. First one, in the Adam Update (aka Early Access), the Swat AI will deploy the shield and have it stay out (except when they would interact with the world), as it does now. Really helps them out during surprise gunfights. But for whatever reason they took it out during 1.0 but hey, I didn't really see anyone complaining about it so I figured it wouldn't or at least be awhile before it was addressed.

After 57 hours - Swat AI is still hit or miss, they will either clear a room like CQB supermen and eliminate all threats in one shot, or they will blindly meander around getting shot to pieces like Officer Murphy, while not reacting or getting hung up in killzones. Many times it feels like the enemy AI is better trained than my Swat AI, with preternatural reaction time and aim, with many runs ending because I get bushwhacked by a suspect who's skill is on the same level as the morlocks who dominate lobbies in shooters. But despite the glaring issues with AI tuning, I love this game. The setting of a fictitious LA/California analog called ""Los Suenos"" (with a squiggle over the n) is honestly one of my favorite aspects of the game, as it allows the narrative and environments to reach further than mundane urban policing; Los Suenos is like Detroit in Robocop, where all the contemporary social, economic, and criminal issues are dialed up to 11. The environments the missions take place in are a wonderful example of environmental story telling, with clues, details, and ambiance that paint a larger picture; in addition, the overall art direction of these environments really shine through in certain areas, where something like as simple as a highway overpass over car dealership, is an oppressive cyclopian monolith that blocks out the sky, it's realistic, yet there is something over the top and dramatic about the set pieces. The over all narrative of this game exudes feels like season 1 of True Detective, film nior, mixed of course with pulse pounding, tactical CQB law enforcement; there is always an implacable sense of unease and dread found in the locations of Los Suenos, with conspiracy and tragedy around every dark corner. It feels odd writing all of this about a shooter with no cut scenes or narrative beyond mission briefings and environmental clues, but after 57 hours, there is more to Ready or Not than just a successor to SWAT 4.",1706310145,1707331153,True,0,0,0.53972017765045166,0,True,False,False

Completed all missions, but overall & objectively, I would not recommend this to anyone with a 10 foot pole.

There will be some extremely troubling situations, including active school shootings, mass murder with piles of corpses, hostages with bombs planted on them, suggested child sex offending, drug overdoses, and more. The shooting is great, background sound is mostly ambiance with slightly more pumped up music when in acive firefights, and every engagement is life and death. If you hesitate or slow down too much, it might lead to you or your squadmates death. It is an extremely difficult game, and you might need to try missions multiple times, and with different equipment to succeed. In the tension, it can sometimes even feel like a horror game. The levels are varied and well-made, full of details and visual storytelling. 

A lot changed from early access with the 1.0 release, but some of it is almost hidden, and mentioning it might improve the game heavily for some people.
1. There is a fully voiced intro, map and info on suspects and civilians on missions. This autoplays if you have your pda open by pressing TAB. But if you havn't, you have to press TAB and press the play button in the briefing window to hear it. Without this, it just feels like selecting random scenarios, instead of getting some story to go with the missions.
2. You can tell civilians to leave the scene, if it is too dangerous to cuff them, or you simply do not want to. Aim at a civilian at a decently close range, press middle mouse and press 5. But do note that some civilians might still be dangerous.
3. You can tell your AI to search and secure with middle mouse + 6. This can help end missions with a missing civilian somewhere faster. If you have not beaten the map yet, this becomes ""Search Room"", which is also useful to make the AI teammates secure any evidence, suspects or civilians in the area.
4. Just as another big tip, you can far lean up, down, left and right (or combined in many directions), by holding ALT. If enemies keep hitting your legs, you can almost prone with this and force them to hit torso area, by holding alt + press down + press left/right around a corner.

AI as of patch 1.03 is good, and they value their lives more.

You are also very often in a situation, where you need to find 1 civilian or so to end a mission. The tip above with ai swat searching only seems to work if the civilian is somewhere you have looked already, and can really drag out a basically finished mission. Time to pull out the PDA and look at the map.

Another downside is that the players hub, the police station, feels extremely dead and lifeless. Nobody is talking, or doing anything really, except for a speaker asking for a person to show up at the desk sometimes. Even the chief of police has nothing to say. And you spawn random places after each missions, instead of just near the missions table and equipment station, which because the hub is extremely dead, is just time waste. You also cannot simply ""restart"" a mission, which I understand because of the new commander mode, but most people would probably like the morale penalty immediately, and just be allowed to retry without being sent back to the station.",1672443801,1707317714,True,2,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,True

This can all be proven if you just watch a replay.

The problem with the AI in its current stage is how horrible it feels to fight them. How are you meant to ROE when the AI can turn around and shoot you before your brain can even register the aggression after yelling for compliance? It's completely immersion breaking.

I picked this game up in mid October 2023 after seeing a video of a team of Marines run the hospital mission. After the first ten hours or so, I was hooked. The mechanics, the gameplay, the graphics, all of it was amazing. And it was still Early Access, believe me, I was stoked.

In early access, you had multiple missions with multiple different modes they could be played on. Customisation was limited, but unless you're a Fortnite player, skins shouldn't matter all that much. The SWAT AI was reasonably intelligent and got the job done, but could've done with some improvements. Suspect AI was pretty damn good, if a little silly at times (having five armed SWAT officers pointing guns in your face and screaming at you to get down isn't exactly a prompt for the average bystander to take out their phone and take pictures), but beyond that, the game was a solid 8.5/10 and I happily recommended it to my family (my sister ended up getting it) and building a 'clan' of sorts, a small but tight gaming community centred around RoN.

After some thinking and deliberation (and admittedly, the temptation provided by that glorious FBI drip) I bought the Supporter Edition and began taking part in the SE Exclusive server, providing feedback, suggestions, asking questions, etc. $100 for mulitcam and some same-but-different guns. Meh. I didn't care, I wanted to support VOID and that was enough for me, plus the promise of early access to updates was a big draw for me, because it would mean that I got to personally have a helping hand in the game's development.

However, VOID failed to deliver on their promises. Supporters were given little more than an extra idea of what would be included in the 1.0 update, when in fact, we were promised early implementation, playtesting even. There hadn't been an update, no matter how small, in well over a year. In short, VOID Interactive took cash for nothing and lied to their supporters. A scam.

Speaking of 1.0, the flagship update was hyped up to the point where you simply couldn't go a day in the discord (either SE or standard) without having someone ask 'when update'. Truth be told, it got remarkably repetitive, rapidly. 1.0 itself was to be the crown jewel of RoN, the biggest and best thing to happen to the game since the ADAM update. However, this was not to be the case.

1.0 has actually taken the game from 8.5/10 to a 4.5/10. It has removed the various gamemodes, made enemy AI frankly impossible to play with (think COD hackers level of infuriating), introduced countless bugs, crashes, start-up errors, glitches and more, whilst adding the bare minimum content. The aesthetic customisation is purely surface level and honestly lacklustre. The new and improved police headquarters (pregame lobby) is, while admittedly beautiful, utterly for show. The maps are excessively large and difficult to play through, unlike those in EA, and many features listed in the changelog (notably the presence of 'trailers', those being Officers who come in and clean up after SWAT has done their thing) not actually appearing in-game despite the Devs themselves listing them as being implemented.

The hallmark of 1.0, Commander Mode, is a weak and poorly implemented shadow of a storyline intended to act as a 'campaign' whilst having no narrative or storyline whatsoever, with the closest thing to a cutscene we receive being the audio-only briefing available on our in-game tablets.

The Stress mechanic does NOT work well with the hyper-aggressive new SWAT AI (which, tactically, is a major improvement, however is a let down in nearly every other regard) and essentially makes the Commander Mode, the only singleplayer mode in which one can enjoy the game with AI companions, a clunky XCOM-esque micromanagment simulator, and that is without even touching on the ludicrous new mission requirements for S rank, the restrictive manner in which we are forced to play, AND the lack of ability to remove stress and linear level playthroughs whilst still playing singleplayer.

In short, 1.0 has overall reduced the content within the game, introduced countless bugs and issues, destroyed replayability and made the game effectively multiplayer only while managing to p*ss off and disappoint every player who happened to get hyped up at the prospect of Commander Mode being an ACTUAL story-based campaign (I know I was).

In conclusion, while I do indeed love this game and believe it to be the future of the Tac genre, it is absolutely NOT worth buying at this point in time. Come back in 3-6 months and check my review then- if VOID can get their collective sh*t together and unf*ck their game, I will gladly edit or even rewrite my review entirely.

Let the butthurt begin.


ONE MONTH UPDATE

As I'm sure many of you are aware, VOID just released Hotfix 2... a month after release. And still, the disappointment continues. Are we Asian Parents? Must be. For starters, their 'hot' fix fails to fix any of the issues I or my friends have encountered, bar one, that being suspect death animations.
Second, more lies and empty promises from VOID, as they promised Russian VAs on release, and yet still fail to even mention them when they talk about localisation in their 'hot' fix. Oh, and they managed to misspell Portuguese.
VOID and their moderators continue to lie, bully and silence anyone who dares to call them out on their thievery and failures. Their so-called 'brief' break was a longer holiday than I've ever had in my life for a job that was probably about as taxing as my morning dump.

For all of you who are tired of being told 'skill issue' or 'get gud' whenever you raise these legitimate concerns regarding the AI and poor overall work by the devs, take the video linked below. Post it, share it, spam it everywhere the Devs and their cult can be found huffing pure Copium in their Cope Dens. Don't let these c*nts gaslight you.

https://youtu.be/EiL1b3obwwI?si=CYmon7M-zRrc4Nyo

UPDATE: HOTFIX #3 (07/02/2024)
Hotfix 3 has, thankfully, tuned down the AI to playable levels, however, there are still a plethora of bugs and glitches that hamper the game from getting a positive review.
Now, you are unable to change which firearms you carry, no matter how many times you select one. Changing to certain loadouts will also crash your game completely, effectively limiting you to a fraction of the content you had access to prior.
Additionally, wedges can now no longer be placed under certain doors. The prompt simply does not appear.

These are just two issues I've noticed after playing for another couple of hours. Some may say ""it's a mod issue, remove your mods"" but no, it's not. I tested it. I uninstalled my FOUR mods (I know, I'm practically playing an entirely different game, it's soooo many) and it still didn't work. Even if that was the case, you shouldn't be forced to play vanilla in order to play with different guns or not have your game crash.
People are having RAMPANT issues with game crashes, including my friends and I.
The devs need to bring back all the content (namely maps/mods) they cut from Early Access, as well.

Still do not recommend, although the game is actually worth buying now, it should still be in EA/at EA prices.",1702800923,1707295095,False,10,1,0.59513014554977417,1,True,False,False

2024:
AI is currently on x games right now which is a bit irritating long term, but if you like action then its fine. The gun play has drastically improved and there's finally customization. Still no level time settings, but performance has improved which is a big win for games like this. 

in summary the game is still a good game, it just needs FPS optimization on sinuous trail and valley of the dolls.

Bug when you select a mission in coop (you see cursor and input from keyboard doesn't work). Some times you don't see wedge that you just put or your teammates don't see model of wedge.
One day I opened the game and saw that all my saves were deleted. Steam Cloud didn't help. But this I'm not sure if it's my fault or not.

Very big problems with FPS. It doesn't matter if you have EPIC or Medium graphic settings. FPS goes from 100+ to 15.

AI of my teammates is low tech (they get stuck pretty often). And they cannot execute a command if they aren't able to be on the right position. The most sad moment is when you die right before the end of a mission and your NPCs don't move :(

Training doesn't cover all mechanics or at least 75%. A lot of stuff you have to learn by yourself.

It looks the same like the very old game SWAT 4, but with new graphic (even some missions are very similar).
I don't understand why it got released if it's still beta version.
And I do not understand why it costs 50 EUR.

Now RoN pulls me in. Unfortunately the issues the game still has, though minor on their own and having very strong gameplay core, leave the impression, that it hasn't left beta yet and bring it close to a point, where it is hard to recommend, to players who have a perfectionist play style, in which these problems become a game breaking issue.[/h1] 

RoN is among the best in this medium in handling violence. RoN (among few others) taught me how I want violence to be shown in games I play: dark, gritty and brutal, with no glorification about what is going on. In RoN violence never is fun. The game makes a statement by letting the violence speak for itself; not shying away from the dark theme; rewarding the least violent gameplay; shocking settings close to reality and impactful environmental story telling. It is an important, grown up, mature game, like we have seen very few, if at all and it achieves this without additional commentary. Everything done well in this game, serves this purpose.

The Maps, already amazing pre-1.0, now 18 in total, all very different from eachother, having their own narratives: dark, gritty and beautiful merged into one another or in opposite contrasts on the same map, delivering scenarios that mirror the hell, real life can be. Don't spoil yourself: the missions develop their narrative, while doing them. At times, I stopped playing for a moment, due to their emotional impact. At the same time you get interesting cqc-puzzles, not easy but fun to solve, without being streamlined for purposes of game play. Only later on the maps feel too big. It didn't worry me much, but it might others.

The enemy AI may be one of the best I have seen. Suspects react in the frame of their training, state of mind and have a very diverse pool of behaviors. It rarely felt like I was encountering the same of enemies on different maps and the voice lines enhanced the atmosphere. However, the AI is still not where it should be: most at the time they are too accurate, react too fast and see you even through pixel peeks. Especially in none lethal attempts - the only way to get a S-rating - they respond late to gas and stinger grenades. This is easily solved by very good in-game mods. But for a game at full release, the vanilla AI, while very impressive overall, is a game breaker when it comes to its aim bot qualities.

The SWAT AI in SP also does its part. You have to control your team on every step. Easy to command for tight gameplay the AI enhances the seriousness of the missions. One mistake can cost a team members live and on the higher levels micromanagement is very important. The game is unfair by design. Counter balances are your wits, tactics and team control. Simultaneously the game was not taken from me: I was an active commander, who had to be ahead of the game by preparing the encounters for my team. I found this puzzle very compelling and interesting to solve. However: the more I went down the rabbit hole, the more I had to navigate wrong or no responses. Minor at first, it became a real problem, once I was going for the most difficult achievements. It definetly ruined a considerable number of runs. I am OK with dying to my mistakes, but when have to play around broken mechanics, that's an issue. 

That said: all this is better, than playing with randoms. That's where the real chaos happens.

Unfortunately SP is the weakest part of the game right now, which is really disappointing. Providing nice challenges and unlocks,  managing the stress level of your SWAT-Teamin in particular  – while in itself a good idea - has no real impact. You will always have a full team, even with every SWAT-member in therapy, dead or incapitated. And this mechanic is the selling point of the SP. But every level is available in MP anyways. That way there is no point in the SP-campaign besides the unlocks. 

And there are  other problems: fps issues, not game breaking but noticable; guns not different enough, to even bother; smg's are useless; no weapon stats; limited number of loadouts you can save, the game doesn't tell you: saved loadouts get lost. All these issues don't hurt the game at first sight: RoN could be a 9 or 10/10 but all this added up over time and RoN it is closer to a 7 or 8/10. This is underlined by the fact, that game modes from early access have been removed in 1.0.  This hurts the staying power of the game at least for now. 

One has to notice, the issues mentioned are especially noticable, due to everything else being so strong and a gameplay, that is all about micromanaging tactics. Flaws become more obvious, than in other games or genres. The developer has shown that he cares and is trustworthy. I'm sure, these things will come or be patched. RoN is inspite its problems one of the best games I have ever played, which is why I still recommend it. But it would be ignorant, not to mention its problems and at this point I have to say: depending on how hardcore your approach is, these unfortunately are close to gamebreaking.

[h1] In sum RoN is a diamond in the rough for any player who likes hardcore tactical shooters, doesn't shy away from difficult themes and want them to be taken seriously in a morally responsible manner. RoN is for those reasons a thematically heavy and difficult game. Besides its issues, RoN manages to set new standards in the genre or maybe gaming overall, even when this might not be noticed by a broader player base. More hardcore players though, might have to consider the issues the game has until they are fixed. I love the game but there is no denial that it became a disappointment over time.[/h1]",1669628703,1707256251,True,2,0,0.541666686534881592,0,True,False,False

so, i only play commander mode since i dont have any friends that play ron, so everything i say will be based on that.

the levels are good. i like them, however, a few depict fairly sensitive topics (and ive heard the ron team is planning to add a literal school to the game) 

honestly, my biggest problem with the release is that i like to play whatever level i want whenever i want, i dont want to have to complete other levels to access a level. 
[spoiler] god i freaking hate that i cannot just throw a teargas grenade at amos voll right now [/spoiler] 

the guns feel good to use, responsive n' all and i like that. 

the suspects have smart AI's... which is all fun until you realize that they have automatics and that basically any headshot is gonna kill you (ive had memories where i open a door and immediately die to a makarov-using suspect)

the taser is not just a typical sidearm now which is cool, and you can have other pistols with it
the SWAT ai is now a lot smarter than in the early access and they're just more useful 
they'll report suspects for you, they'll arrest people for you, all without the need for you to order it (unlike early access)

 (ok this one was patched for the most part so mostly disregard this) AND THE SUBTITLES. lol the subtitles are HILLLLLLARIOUS. they get quite a bit wrong, like for example, the subtitles say ""merit"" when judge actually said ""mirror it"" or, ""talk"" instead of ""TOC"" -- even ""wand it."" becomes ""want it?"" -- i get how ""wand it"" can be mistaken for ""want it"" but thats legit kinda funny 

also i freaking HATE the officer stress system this is a tactical shooter not the freaking sims games. its easy to get the hang of but somehow officers can spend like 324765239 years in therapy. as im writing this i have 3 officers in therapy, ive been playing so much its clear that i dont touch grass and theyre still in therapy.  like literally how are they still in therapy, thats 5 real-life hours. and like, ingame thats canonically weeks -- so like, idk, either theyre doing real wacky things with their therapists, or theyre living in the therapists office. 

tl;dr buy the freaking game if you have money.  [spoiler] look if you really need a ""tl;dr"" paraphrase, you either have a low attention span or you suck at reading and avoid it like the plague. why am i writing one of those essay reviews you might ask? well its 'cause its fun! i love typing! [/spoiler]

edit: A) it's been like 12 hours. how much csgo have my officers played with those therapists
B) yeah, uh, the school was added. that could def deter people from the game but as i said, the game has sensitive topics
once again another edit like a month later: i think the therapist uses gaming as his sole form of therapy because now everyone i put in therapy spends YEARS in there. ",1702587494,1707249230,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Not only are the enemies elite 360noscope gods with wallhack enabled, but your team members are as bad as the enemies are good, and they constantly get in your way and refuse to move.  
Furthermore, since the game's release you've been forced into a campaign-ish mode, where you need to babysit your team members, so they don't get PTSD. Try to be tactical and arrest all suspects, and die trying? Tough titties, now you gotta send your whole team to the shrink, or else they'll be sat in a corner in the fetal position the next mission. This forced game mode means the safest bet is to go in all guns blazing, full-autoing everything that moves, consequences be damned, because trying to arrest someone could get you or a teammate killed.

First of all, the SWAT AI still sucks.
-they don't take cover
-they shoot blindly into walls at enemies even when using pepperballs and wasting ammo (which the enemy has an endless supply of that they take full advantage of)
-they botch their grenade throws constantly (hitting object in room, hitting doorway and affecting team, missing enemies entirely
-they stray away to pick up evidence and secure suspects/civilians when you don't want them to and subsequently get shot to pieces
-they let suspects take the first shot even when using nonlethal arms
-their pathfinding messes up so sometimes when you order them to stack on a door or follow you they'll wander off somewhere else (where, I don't know since they die before I find out)
-can't navigate around you so you have to move out of their way and don't recognize when you're trying to enter the stack
-just plain don't listen to some orders, like telling one to watch a direction

other things of note:
-bullet penetration feels VERY biased in favor of suspects. Bullet penetration is so inconsistent that sometimes armor-piercing bullets can't penetrate wooden doors or cardboard walls. Maybe the same goes for the enemies, but they have the advantage of infinite ammo to full-auto and suppress you with all the time.
-vision is weird. Some windows that you can see out of easy are seemingly opaque to suspects, while others that you can barely see through they'll lock on to you through. Peeking feels worthless with how the enemy can identify you by your earlobe and just as easily shoot it off
-your aim suffers when moving, but the enemy can strafe-sprint and gun you down 40m away no problem

weirdly missing or removed features:
-level ranks aren't visible until you beat them again
-weapons and attachments have little-to-no statistics or explanations. only way to figure out the differences is to feel them out by test firing and comparing, which the game makes annoying by placing the loadout and firing range/training room far away. attachments have a vague ""more accurate, less recoil"" tag with them, but they don't help you compare attachments against each other. there are 2 night vision headsets and I have no idea what the functional difference between them is since the game doesn't explain jack. 

there's so much that's messed up right that I can't even put into writing. I urge you to not buy the game until the devs at least make a statement about the direction of the game going forward.",1706941299,1707216265,False,4,2,0.529596030712127686,0,True,False,False

A Good tactical game.

Negative things for updates/patches: 
1. At a certain point way too early, heavy armor and shields become the default loadout for your AI.  Boring.

2. We need to be able to set up delayed breaches. IE: I want to approach a space from 2 angles and can't give commands to the AI remotely or have red and blue breach their different spaces at the same time. 

3. There are not enough small to medium maps for a two-player co-op. 

4. Should be able to resurrect downed human players or treat downed players. eh.

5. Al should have the option to order the AI point-blank (Gas from behind a closed door works), short-throw, or long-throw munitions.  

6. Pepper pistol for when using the shield.

7. A sniper for missions with big spaces for overwatch.

8. Speaking of two-player co-op, each player should control one AI bot.

9.  Red teammates should stay together, and blue teammates should stay together their constant mixing has delayed so many actions as they run back to each other.

People are defending the game and developers, saying it's skill issue. The skill issue has come up in so many posts on the forums from so many trolls, who state the game is perfect as it is!

 Perhaps they are right the developers didn't have the skill to create believable and fun AI. They made AI with Aimbot that can track you and shoot you through multiple surfaces regardless of ammo or gun type!

 They also lacked the skill to complete and polish a game with little to no bugs. There are videos of all the bugs inside of the release of 1.0, which don't even talk about the horrible AI.

 They probably even have the lack of skill to communicate with the community who are very upset. There was hardly any communication for a year just repeated new postings of their current status of the game. Once they released the game in December they then took a month break, and had 0 communication with the community. In-fact they still have not replied to a single forum post!

Most of these reviews were made before the release of 1.0, so there is still a very positive experience, based on pre 1.0. Content has been removed or broken from 1.0 so these reviews are not even up to date with experiences.

This game is a bare-bones shooter with auto aim bots who react faster than humans can in real life. they know where you are at all times soon as you make a noise on the map due to how your tracked by the ai. Many users are complaining about horrible performance on decent hardware. Not to mention some of the features in the game such as bounce lights don't even activate in the options menu!

There are features in game trailers during EA that have all been cut from the final release which is 1.0. As well as the latest trailer depicts a game with a story-line and cinematic. There are no cut scenes, just dialogue you can hear before a mission and see some photos taken!

The developers are relying on you not to look at the negative reviews and just assume the negative reviews are trolls. They are relying on people with no integrity, to praise this game for it's pretty graphics. They are expecting people to use mods to be able to enjoy their game, and fix the issues they can't be bothered to fix. 

There are even rumours going around that VOID is making a new game now, and will not be supporting this game, or giving the game the huge of amount of support the game needs to be a fully functioning game as advertised.

Don't listen to the positive reviews, they are either lying or trolls, or accept a broken game that has pretty graphics as an excuse that the game will be patched later on. 

There has been no communication from anyone from the company on the public forums at all. The community has been torn apart between those who hate the game, or want a refund, and the trolls who say the game is great, and it's a skill issue!

If you still choose to buy this game after everything I have listed in it's current state, then you are the reason game developers continue to release game unfinished, and the community accepts this waiting for a patch that may never come!

Ready or Not at $50 is overpriced. The ""AI"" are just laser aim bots. I get it's supposed to be hard. But in a game (key word game) where you aren't just shooting your way through a level. You need to attempt to arrest the targets. Which sometime is impossible leading to you or your team getting shot and killed. Putting your own laser bots up against them is sometimes the best option. The Leader moral aspect is a cool idea although I feel definitely needs work. Honestly my biggest gripe about the game is simply how long it takes to get back into a mission. I don't want to see a silly grading scale I can't skip. Just to have to walk back through the damn station, select the same mission and wait for a timer to tick down. I'm playing single player, why do I have to wait around? Movement speeds is ridiculous I get you don't want players sprinting around. But to make us be forced to move at a ridiculously slow speed when getting around a corner to get sights on methed out cyborgs is the order is just unfair. That is not how SWAT moves. Give us some realistic speed, but make the AI respond to it. More speed more noise, more noise more likely AI investigate or just start executing hostages. 

All them guns but I can't use them? Get lost.

The gameplay and graphics are ripe for VR, and I think it could be a hit in that space with some development. Also, I feel the game could benefit from tougher AI bots. As it stands, they can be a bit too easy, leading to a somewhat lax approach when clearing rooms or dealing with enemies. If the bots were more of a challenge, it would force players to stick to tight tactics and stay alert. While there are mods out there that tweak the bots' behavior and intelligence, they don't fully solve the issue.

The AI may need some fixing because it sometimes behave like it has superpowers (will track you and shoot you through walls with stagering accuracy).

Most of the time people will go in random directions on the map and end up shooting each other by accident when they come across each other.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and we adopted our son together. Both are now 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I felt lost and unhappy. I was self-destructive. One day, I was so angry with everything spiraling out of control that I punched a concrete wall in a moment of overwhelming emotion. This resulted in breaking my fifth metacarpal in my right hand—the hand I worked with, played games with, and used to carry my children to bed—the hand I desperately needed to ensure I could continue providing.

Upon learning the severity of the self-inflicted damage, I became almost suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man, with no history of depression or anxiety. I had never experienced anger outbursts, nor was I the type to break down and cry, but I was in a tough situation that truly prevented me from seeing the light on the other side.

With nothing better to do, I looked for a game I could play WITH ONE HAND while recovering. Somehow, I stumbled upon this game and read some of the comments. I decided it was worth a try... I must admit I didn't beat the game, nor did I play as much as some of you. In fact, I may have played this game for only a day or two. That being said, after doing so, I had a new joy and hope for life. I managed to leave behind the pain and suffering that had been thrust upon me. I could experience the joy and happiness of other people. I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ minutes listening to this music, long enough to realize that I would be okay.

After realizing this, I turned off the game and went back to work. My hand hurt a lot, but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so sorry for myself and became the father I needed to be at that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving like.

Today, I am close friends with the mother of my children. We don't fight, argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents and friends.

Now I have 3 children. My third child is, wait, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my separation, and we just unexpectedly stumbled into each other's lives. We have been dating for a year and are very happy together.

Moral of the story: you never know what life has in store for you, and if I had given up when all odds were against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

The game desperately needs better AI, your SWAT AI is terrible and will get themselves killed over and over. Meanwhile the suspect AI is cracked and will shoot you through walls and not miss a shot ever. There are many times where you will die and have no idea what killed you.

Solid game that needs some fixing

1-When a gun is shot within a few meters of you your screen gets blurry and shaky and full of smoke basically turning you blind and mitigating your abilities of responding fire. This makes NO SENSE, that is not how guns work. A experienced ember of swat should be able to maintain composure during a firefight, one of the first things you learn when shooting is NOT to flinch or close your eyes,  this is nothing more than theatrics at the expense of realism and gameplay. I hate to see a game with gunplay so realistic have such a stupid and easy to fix problem.
2- The bots AI has improved massively but is still not enough. Bots will often walk into rooms without checking their corners, they will shoot through civilians to get to enemies, they will randomly switch to their sidearms they flash rooms too slowly leading to enemies shooting them while they wait in front of an open door, among other problems. And in multiplayer people play like its COD, so unless you have some friends who are interested in buying the game and playing with you this will be a major problem.
3- you cant shoot anyone to get S rank, even if you do not kill anyone and just injure them, you will still not get S rank. Simply stupid. In real life the rules of engagement are very simple: If a subject is pointing a gun at you, shoot to kill. If a subject is brandishing a gun and refusing to comply, use of force is authorized. Death of an armed suspect is completely expected and not frowned upon. The perfect run is a run in which the basic objectives are completed without the injury of any civilians or officers, that should be the criteria for an S run.
There are other small problems here and there but that is most of it. I am aware the game will continue to receive updates and I am willing to change my review in the future, but for now the game is not worth this much money.

If you could get the game for 25 bucks on sale then go for it if you're really interested, but otherwise, maybe consider finding another game like Insurgency Sandstorm, Arma, or some of the other realistic shooters out there.

Before I elaborate on why I say this, here's some pro's and con's that I've found with the game, in my opinion.

Pros...

* Pretty great graphics overall. (Guns look great, building and environment textures look great.)

* Movement is smooth, and feels pretty good. (Slow, ""realism"" movement style?)

* Sound effects for guns are alright.

* Can be fun with friends with mods, and once you have the maps memorized

* Some bugs and glitches can be pretty funny in multiplayer


Cons...

* Many, many bugs and glitches, including *some* game breaking ones. (Ex. gun disappearing, animation locks repeating while fighting, laser attachments suddenly disappearing, attachments always showing your flashlight even if you choose a laser attachment, etc.)

* Ballistics aren't real. There are times where you can magdump an enemy from maybe 10 feet away aiming center mass, and the enemy will either keep shooting you without being affected, or they might start twitching like they're getting stung by bees just to raise their gun and blast you while you're reloading.

* AI is pretty poorly designed. They do some cool things like pretending to surrender, however I'm referring to the important part of the AI. It is very common for enemies to track you through walls, and sometimes you'll even hear them shooting at you from another room, without ever having seen you. It is also important to note that when this happens, they tend to shoot through one or two walls and can hit you. This usually happens when they are relatively close, not when they are across the map. Also, there are plenty of times where you can see an enemy standing against an object or wall looking directly at you through said object, with their gun raised.

* Playing in hand with my previous point-- shooting through walls. This is a pretty major issue with the game at its current state. Countless retries have been caused by an enemy shooting me directly through walls, doors, statues, trees, and pretty much every other object you can find in the game. Most commonly, this happens through two objects at the same time. For example, you might have an enemy ahead of you that is inside of a building, but they manage to shoot directly at you through both a wall and a tree at the same time. It can be pretty frustrating, and the only thing that has often kept me playing was spite for the AI.

Now, you may think that this has a simple solution. Just spray and pray through the walls and doors. Unfortunately, these same physics don't apply to your character. Enemies will shoot you through metal doors, but if you dump multiple magazines through the same object directly back at them, the chances are slim that you'll damage them. I've tried plenty of times, especially through wooden interior doors, to no avail. Keep in mind that you can sometimes see their arms and guns poking through the doors, and while you mag dump them through the door, they will stand completely still and not take any damage at all. This is one of my biggest gripes with the game, aside from the AI tracking you through the entire map.

* Lack of updates, bug fixes, or really anything. The developers haven't really done much to the game since its release other than a few minor hot fixes to my knowledge. 

* Customization. Customization is another thing that I don't really like with this game. There's quite a few unlockables you can get by playing the game and beating missions with high ratings at the end (B, A, S, etc.), but it seems very half-assed. Most of the clothing does not match, unless if you want to wear all black clothes, or gray. There are, of course, different colours and camo's like multicam, black multicam AOR1, AOR2, green, and blue. However, you'll be hard pressed to match your top, bottom, armor, and/or helmet with any of the listed colors. 

What I mean, is that you may unlock green pants and a green shirt, but they're not the same green. Somehow, the colors and camos noticeably do not match each other on different pieces of clothing. There are a few that come pretty close, but usually never the same. The AOR2 clothing is usually different shades of the same camo, and sometimes the camo looks slightly different. It's hard to explain, but its almost as if the texture might have been stretched for, lets say, a shirt, and shrunk for the pants. The same goes for the solid colors. The green shirts don't match the green pants, which don't match the green armor.

It may seem like a silly complaint, but the reason why I mention it is because I fail to see a point in including the different customization things when none of them match in the first place.



Anyway, overall the game can be fun if you aren't against replaying the same missions mid to late game over and over again until you can get an S, but I wouldn't buy at full price because of the state it's in. I would also highly recommend looking into some mods to make the game a little more enjoyable.",1707013411,1707014417,False,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

The game is meant to be hard and stressful, but in a mission based in a post office shipping facility, AI will just wallbang you with no indication that they are even on the other side. At first I thought it was between packages and they just had super vision or something until I witnessed a barrage of gunfire with audio queues in front of me, and impacts in front of me straight through a blue wall. There was no gap and there was no way that he saw a pixel of me from the other side, just terrible AI. And everytime you die, your team freaks out like and either quits or goes to therapy, forcing you to get a new team while 3 of your guys spend 3 months in therapy and are just completely useless. Any progression with your team just goes straight down the toilet instantly.

TLDR: Great game with great mechanics and realism, but with equally terrible and gamebreaking AI. If you want to get it on sale, it might be worth, but $50 for an unplayable game is ridiculous.

[h3]1. old review as of may 2023 found the game to be broken and development momentum to be lost[/h3]
[b]i.VOID had a jolt of creativity but development slowed down and communications broke down,[/b] they then resorted to their ""newsletters"" and ""developmental updates"" to try and keep the playerbase happy, and the effects are as expected.
[b]ii.the hype was real closer to the actual 1.0 launch,[/b] where the simps happily licked VOID's boots and proclaimed that all the haters will be proved wrong

[h3]2. 1.0 update has brought about some positive changes [/h3]
[b]i.vastly improved SWAT AI,[/b] where your bot teammates will now proactively clear rooms, secure personnel and bag evidence. They can also be told to search and secure areas, making it much easier to find that last stupid civie
[b]ii.new weapons and locations,[/b] we got a bulpup rifle that would hopefully be less prone to running into walls, new and really gorgeous maps and the ""story line"" is starting to form
[b]iii.ability to highlight evidence,[/b] which should honestly be enabled by default. well at least it is available now

[h3]3. unfortunately, VOID being VOID, updating the game somehow reminds us of how much is actually lacking [/h3]
[b]i.new maps are not optimized at all and fps is low on even decent hardware,[/b] forcing graphics downgrades and defeating the whole point of making those new maps nice looking.
[b]ii.newly added mechanics are broken,[/b] as the officer stress level system is completely ridiculous. The best way to play is now to just unlock as many slots as possible then let them resign whenever, since you cannot send them to therapy until they are literally about to break. Why bother adding ""personal traits"" when your game mechanics do not even allow for the officers to stick around for more than a couple missions?
[b]iii.hit reg and throwables are still inconsistent,[/b] CS gas being the obvious thing (and it also still magically dissipates in less than a minute), pepper ball feels slightly better but is still a joke, and actual bullets occasionally just stop working, too

[h3]4. and perhaps even more concerning[/h3]
[b]i.RON is still a point and click FPS, not a police simulator,[/b] AI are still going terminator with their aim and nonlethal options are too weak, with the embarrassingly bad animations and transitions still being a thing, leaving the player with little to no choice during engagements
[b]ii.VOID has now adopted the tone of ""yea we meant to do that"",[/b] spewing utter nonsense such as ""AI is supposed to shoot through walls, we just made them a bit too accurate"", and ""spamming voiceline and waiting for a reaction is a solution for finding the missing civies"". this is a new low even for them

 [h1]to summarize: 1.0 as a milestone means nothing if the actual game breaking issues are not addressed (which is the case here).  [/h1]
this update would be much better received if it came out as an regular update, not the crossover from early testing to official release. moving the goal post does not actually mean progress. and look, I really want RON to succeed here, because honestly why tf would I not want a SWAT simulator that I paid so much money for to be good? Ironically, the game is far from ready, yet VOID is adamant on pushing it out the door.",1683464420,1706984504,False,66,10,0.615435659885406494,0,True,False,True

AI has no weapon collision, they just point the rifle through walls and shoots you dead as you struggle to keep your weapon up when standing behind a teammate holding a shield that is crouched in front of you.

The same traps that instantly kill your fully trained and armoured SWAT officer will only cause the AI to flinch.

Their pistol calibre weapons seem to have more penetration through walls than your armour piercing rifle rounds.

They seem to be able to see through smoke perfectly as long as they aren't inside it despite you being unable to see through the smoke at all.

They can shoot with near perfect accuracy when moving at almost full speed while you can barely keep your weapon steady unless you're slow walking or crouched.

The AI can somehow hear you arresting someone or telling them to surrender better than you shooting an unsuppressed firearm in an enclosed space.

Multiple new features promised with their 1.0 release are broken and not present at launch, and other features previously in early access versions are gone completely. The enemy AI is a mess, somehow landing in both the laughably stupid and frustratingly overpowered/broken categories. Your SWAT team however, will get stuck on doors, walls, each other, and many times just refuse to obey your commands like restraining suspects, leading to them just picking their guns back up and shooting you because you took too long to restrain them. There is no setting to make your team go less-lethal only, and though you can equip your mates with less-lethal primaries, they will still switch to their pistols in some situations and routinely kill suspects that way, failing any S-rank run you were going for. You can then however, take the ammo out of their pistols, but they will still switch to them, pointing empty guns at suspects until said suspects gun them down. In rare cases, even though you took all the ammo out of their sidearms, they will still spawn a single bullet into their guns when they swap to them, killing the suspect anyway. Commander mode lacks a quick restart button, making the gameplay loop essentially: load to the menu, load to the lobby, load to the mission, you or a squadmate gets killed because the AI is terrible, close the game, re-launch the game, rinse and repeat from step 1. Cant recommend in its current state, while there is fun to be had, it fades fast and the game becomes more and more aggravating with each restart.

It offers a refreshing FPS experience that forces you to think how you approach every corner, and the pace of the game is much slower than your typical action shooters like call of duty or battlefield. If you attempt to move with haste, the game will severely punish you. This lends more weight to your decisions, and when you are successful in clearing a room, there is a reasonable sense of achievement which is accomplished without having to give cliched cosmetics that are attempting to drive the rest of the industry. When you do clear a level, sure, the cosmetics earned are a bit more sensible to give a tangible reward, but if you were to ask me, the reward is in the entertainment of seeing a room successfully cleared. 

The major short comings of the game for me is that there are no characters, or character development in the game, and a limited AI (though I think this is slowly improving), which could take this tactical engagement to the next level. The AI enemies and hostages are generally superficial, and this probably could be developed a bit more, but I dont think the team have the resources to develop this out like a standard AAA game. More enemies are scattered through the map than would be realistic in real life situations - though this is the game attempting to jack up the difficulty in what would otherwise be a 'too easy' situation. The hostages are boring, and I would like to see them react more dramatically to stressful situations. 
The team AI are not bad, but I would like to see more robust teams that replicate real life SWAT. It would be nice to be able to command the team remotely, as you have to move your team mates through line of sight commands. i.e. its not easy to have your AI squad flank around the other side of the map. It would be nice to have more AI team mates, and approach situations from multiple simultaneous angles like a real life SWAT. Too often I find the AI can flank me, because I cant move my team efficiently. 

All in all a good experience, but I would just like to see a bit more development in how the AI handle, some character development and some more realistic situations. I feel the latter is not currently achievable as it would probably blow the budget out for the developers - but in time and perhaps if there is a strong community and reasonable sales, iterations of the game could possibly make this one of the best FPS franchises - but it will require smart development leadership.",1706934832,1706934832,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

One mission, you need to go apprehend a Twitch streamer and he has a bunch of anime dolls and child pornography. It was satisfying killing all of his henchmen and arresting him. 

One thing that I would change, and this is pretty big. Some of the missions are very, very difficult. I have been stuck on a few that take me days and weeks to complete. Please just let me restart the mission. I don't want to have to go back to the station, wait for two different 10-second countdowns and loading screens. Just let me fucking restart the mission or at least not go back to the station. It makes me play the game less because I just don't want to have to wait through all of it.

Instead of fixing the underlying issues with enemy AI behaviors and nonsensical gameplay (like not being able to rush a shooter), the devs instead figured that they should keep adding maps and a needless therapy system rather than fix the underlying issues people have complained about for years. Suspects will shoot you through walls like concrete barriers, and on some maps the devs decided to add several one-way viewports for the AI to do this safely. SWAT Officers are given tasks that shouldn't be theirs, like securing evidence. The viewmodel inertia feels horrible, like my arms are made of jelly. The only progression and unlocks is cosmetic and for new missions, some of which are like torture of the balls.
This game does not look good in my opinion, as it visually fails to stand out in a world full of Unreal Engine tactical shooters like Insurgency and Squad, and a whole lot more. It's as if tactical shooters in Unreal Engine should be its own genre.
Also the game has several instances of AI generated artwork which screams to me either laziness or a need to rush a 1.0 version through the door to sell more copies.
I feel like the development of this game has been painfully slow already, and the fact that the devs have refused to listen to feedback and fix what's already there makes me lose interest in playing this game any further. I think I would rather play Six Days in Fallujah (another Unreal Engine tactical shooter) where the AI at least behaves as they should, and I can use my legs to move faster than a brisk walk.
With the label of early access I might have recommended this game, but seeing as this is supposed to be the finished product I can no longer endorse it.",1706927204,1706927204,False,3,1,0.528013885021209717,0,True,False,False

The developers still haven't fixed major issues with the game (some of which weren't present in early access at all) and have only put out two hotfixes since it's ""full release"" 1.0 version on December 13th. They still haven't given their supporters the soundtrack that was promised upon full release or the 1.0 version. The AI of the game has become worse than it previously was in early access. There's accurate wallbanging from suspects as if they can see you through walls (which from my testing and experience they absolutely can), They rarely ever instantly surrender after being pepperballed or at least stun they usually just keep full autoing you, they can run into you and stunlock you while still being able to shoot you while you can not shoot them as your gun goes into high ready, numerous new bugs and old bugs that weren't fixed and are still present from early access, the campaign mode ""Commander Mode"" is an absolute joke to even call it content. Commander Mode is essentially Practice Mode with named officers who do not have any unique attributes or personalities except their name and what they can do as an ""ability"". I type ability as ""ability"" because, people have tested them and most of them don't even work and you can't restart your mission you have to go back to base each time. There's essentially no point in playing Commander Mode unless you want a worse version of Practice Mode.

It can barely get above Resident Evil 4 Remakes player count. I really thought they would fix it by now, but as of February 2nd they have put out two hotfixes since release which was December 13th, neither addressing the major issues with the game. The player count is dropping and is abysmal for a CO-OP game, the developers are way to slow with updates and to make all this worse a lot of content was cut in version 1.0 or full release.

But that love affair has turned into a bitter breakup, thanks to the developers' misguided quest to turn every AI character into a superhuman killing machine. It's like the game's sole purpose is to punish players for daring to enjoy it.

Let's start with the absurdity of the AI. Apparently, the developers decided that even crackheads should be elite soldiers with X-ray vision and psychic abilities. Meanwhile, your character, armed to the teeth and clad in heavy armor, might as well be made of tissue paper for all the good it does. It takes a whole magazine to take down a guy in a hoodie, yet one shot from a revolver wielded by a crackhead through a closed door spells instant death. Talk about imbalance!

And don't even get me started on the bugs. Oh, the bugs! It's like the game is determined to find new and creative ways to sabotage your enjoyment. Mission-breaking glitches, crashes, you name it, ""Ready or Not"" has it all. It's like the developers wanted to add an extra layer of challenge by making sure you never know if you'll actually be able to finish a mission before the game implodes.

And let's not forget the joy of trying to go non-lethal. Spoiler alert: it's impossible. Pepper spray, tasers, flashbangs - none of it fazes these AI killing machines. They'll just keep coming at you, guns blazing, until you're lying in a pool of your own frustration.

In short, ""Ready or Not"" went from being an awesome game to a lesson in game design gone wrong. Save yourself the headache and steer clear of this mess unless you enjoy banging your head against the wall in frustration.",1706857133,1706857133,False,2,2,0,0,True,False,False

The AI needs an overhaul especially the AI that is with you. Half the time they end up just blocking you in entry ways and I don't have the time to click and give them instructions to leave the room so I can actually exit. I mostly play now because of the mods. 

Pros:
- Great graphics
- Decent amount of customization thanks to the modding community
- Also a decent amount of maps to pick from 
- There's co-op which is nice if you want to play with others 
- Great amount of tools and gadgets to pick from 
- Firing range is half decent and you can run CQB drills

Cons: 
- The AI either end up blocking you in doorways, or killing you from across the map (hide and seek)
- No restart function for single player, but there is for multiplayer? why not implement things in both? 
- The game doesn't give you tips like when to use high-low or having a smaller firearm to peak around corners without getting blocked by terrain
- Diffusing takes too long. While I know this is a game it's still too long imo

Areas of improvement: 
- Be able to load directly into the briefing room
- More customization options for weapons such as barrel length, optics, grips, magazine size, canted sighting 
- AI not gatekeeping you from exiting a room or doorway 
- AI not flopping around when being restrained then throwing themselves 15ft into the air
- AI not allowing you to restrain so you have to be exposed for longer periods of time",1706853238,1706853238,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Disastrous launch.

I'd say wait till they fix it but since its in 1.0 now no one should be giving this the kind of patience they would to an early access title.

The main arguments include a comparison to SWAT 4, the slow pace to fixes, the unfinished product at release, and the backflipping of a statement during an AMA about dynamic lighting (first it was the unreal engine cannot allow for shooting lights out or disabling the fusebox to prepare for a night-vision raid, then it was backflipped after it was pointed out modders have done this already).

In short, SWAT 4 had far fewer developers and managed a knock-out title in a couple of years. This title has been in development for nearly a decade. While it mostly copies or is inspired by (you choose) SWAT 4, I feel this title very much was not ready for launch and was likely a means to generate profits. I'll check in on the state of things after I finished an entire university degree....

EDIT: in regards to dynamic lighting issues.
Ubisoft produced Splinter Cell as a Metal Gear Solid Killer. What blew everyone out of the water with Splinter Cell was precisely dynamic lighting and audio; shoot out the lights and sneak up or around the map to complete your mission.
The fact games were created on (comparatively) sub-par hardware and software (ps2) and can outperform RoN reveals to me that the state of modern gaming is just abysmal.",1706846607,1706846767,False,1,3,0,0,True,False,False

There is persistent teammate status in singleplayer that deteriorates when you do poorly, so you are randomly punished for things out of your control with no 'reload' option available.

Breaching takes too long, by the time one teammate opens a door for another to use a less-than-lethal grenade, they are getting shot to death by the people on the other side or the suspects have fleed.

The devs wanted to make a realistic game but made the enemies quake-level of twitchiness and cracked out while the player and their squad are as slow and sluggish as real life.

[list]
[*] Sprinting. When you're a cop and your job is to run towards gunfire, you should be able to sprint. Violence of action is a valid strategy sometimes, and it's hard to be aggressive without the ability to run. 

[*] Multiplayer not only needs PVP, but also a rating system for PVE - There's an opportunity to do this in a really creative way, where you can view other player's stats (unauthorized UoFs, D-S rating finishes, etc.) as if it's an Internal Affairs report. In addition, ""bad"" cops should be paired with other ""bad"" cops in public matchmaking, so that the players who are actually trying to do well aren't dealing with as much trolling.

[*] AI (both SWAT and suspect) needs some more love, but I know this is hard to refine and that the devs are working hard on it. If suspects would stop aimbotting through walls as much, that would go a long way.

I do wish the set of missions was a more balanced and realistic example of what real life SWAT deal with. It would be great to respond to a bunch of armed terrorists on one mission (which does happen in the game) and then the next mission respond to a phony bomb threat. The streamer mission comes to mind as one where I think it's a real shame that they decided it had to be connected to a child trafficking ring and a gang instead of simply having it be a streamer you go and arrest because of a ""swatting"" from an audience member. I do also wish that the suspect AI was more willing to surrender when a bunch of armed SWAT officers tell them to get on the floor or get shot. Finally I wish that there was less of a clear distinction between civilians and suspects. It would be excellent if those who seemed to be civilians could pull guns, suspects could spawn without a gun and try to grab one or pose as a a civilian until an officer stepped close enough for them to pull their knife on them, or if some missions had civilians who were lawfully carrying a concealed weapon or were roaming the halls of the building looking to shut down the same shooters you are while looking like they could be said shooter. Overall however, the game is fantastic and tons of fun. The SWAT AI teammates are great and playing it co-op with friends is also a great time. It's so much fun to methodically breach and clear every room or smoke out suspects with tear gas. Experiencing some of the story for the missions through the briefings and the environment is great too. I remember going through Brixley's Talent Time with my friends and after clearing a room we find a desk with an action figure and a doll arranged in such a way that they appeared to be having sex. The effect that had on us was incredible, it made us feel very immersed as we all said: ""Jesus fucking Christ, these bastards are sick."" The gun selection is great and the animations are excellent and realistic to each gun. For example, it's possible to check out many rounds you have in your active magazine, which with most guns involves briefly taking the magazine out of the weapon, checking it, and inserting it back in the gun. However, with the P90, the animation for checking how many rounds you have left in your magazine is just tilting the gun up slightly and looking at the magazine sitting on top of the gun, without unloading it. Overall it is a blast and if you enjoy games that are more realistic or slower & tactical, you will absolutely enjoy this game.",1706821584,1706821584,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Great game if you liked R6S before it went to crap. The attention to detail on the maps is amazing, really immerses you into a city that's going to hell in a hand basket.

Update: After a friend of mine suggested I should do so, I've tried to play the game again and give it another chance and it wasn't much better.

The only public lobby I could join just had a bot micspamming bible verses like a paranoid schizophrenic, the AI was terrible, and looking into it I discovered that the developers have actually been rather incompetent when it comes to fixing issues like long standing bugs and the aforementioned AI.

so i really really want to give this game props for that, and its been really fun quite honestly even when alone with ai team it was great,,, 

then the full release came out i did play thru it and im doing it again in iron man since i didnt lose any officers the first time, however that seems to have been a fluke since the ai in ready or not is,,,, well,,,, not,,,

dosent matter if its street thugs in over their head, robbing a gas station or cultist with military grade weaponry they will die for the cause and they seem to have joined the john wick school for blasting u to hell, walls, doors, windows, heck a m1 abrams is not stopping them from taking out their bloodlust on u and ur team,
seems strange to me since before the 1.0 release the ai seemed fine, sure they sometimes were kind of braindead but nothing too serious, now ive been taking breaks from time to time because the ai is worse on both ends, ur ai team will walk right past a surrendering suspect, or open doors with their backs facing it, meanwhile some roided up umpalumpa will run into the room firing full auto at anything and everything that moves,

there is a decent couple of maps and overall the foundation is there, weapons, movement and gear is good and detailed in many aspects, with added unlockable cosmetic options so u can make u and ur team look different, some clipping issues are still there but nothing too serious that ive noticed except if u look at ur self thru the helmet cam of an ai ur gear seems to be hovering around where u are standing not attached to u or the physical plane of existance :P

i would have liked to see more variety from the full release as before it had a few maps but multiple different scenarios such as hostage rescue, active shooter, barricaded suspects and bomb threats there, they are there in the form of a few missions but mostly they will be the same barricaded suspect,

personally i think its a good game with a great premise and they have done very well with it however i think they released it too soon as tends to happen to often and in my opinion at least ready or not is not ready, 
wich is why i do not recommend it yet, i did recommend it before launch, and if u feel like playing thru these issues especially if u have a team of friends go for it, it can be alot of fun,

Bottom line upfront: Totally worth the buy if only just to give you hope for the future

An exceptionally well handling and visceral shooter with an emphasis on darker tones. The world Void Int. is creating in its fictitious amalgamation of a West Coast mega metropolis is going to be very dark indeed, but let's be honest that's what we want. As a top-tier SWAT team we are playing the good guys, therefore the badder the bad guys, the ""gooder"" we feel right! Anyway, Void has showcased in early access well executed level design with immersive tiny details that make each environment feel truly unique. From filthy derelict ghetto housing slash methamphetamine labs to ultra-luxurious mansions slash tomb of reprehensible secrets, I am looking forward to inspecting every inch of the final game while genuinely feeling unsafe in the environment as a SWAT team leader hunting down armed and dangerous suspects. 

The weapons handling was given a lot of attention; Speed & Tac reloads, mag checks, swapping mags for different ammo types, even a thumb animation gives you a short visual and auditory que when switching selective fire, all these things will now forever make any ""tactical"" shooter without them a lesser competitor. 

Also, explosive breaching FINALLY looks passable in a game, much love. 

Looking forward to Void rounding the hard corners and shipping a polished gem that I am sure will set the tactical community ablaze with many many hours of entertainment. 


1.0 update:
Good - AI
New friendly and enemy AI improvements are noticeable, palpable upgrades to their individual competencies. Good guys pie and take rooms systematically, and automatically cuff and stuff bad guys and evidence. Makes them seem much more human. Bad guys will pull some sneaky tricks more often which keeps you on edge too. This is 1.0's greatest strength. 

Not so good - Single player
The commander mode is ok, its not much of a campaign as the missions are map specific, would have benefited more from a branch narrative where player score and evidence found directly influences the unfolding sequence. Also, this is supposed to be a full fledged SWAT team and I don't feel like im in command of anything besides 4 guys, because I am not. No snipers, K-9, negotiators, EOD robots, drone usage, cyber capabilities etc. These are tools a player should be able to use as a ""SWAT commander"" to tackle a volatile situation and preserve life. Probably too late for any of that but, there is also the plethora of type edit mistakes and unpolished audio clips that make it seem like the single player experience didn't get a thorough scrub before release. 

Bad - Mental Health
Ok guys, good idea but bad design. I like the idea of having to manage a team with personal elements, truly. But there is probably a better way to accomplish this with training and real injuries sustained during a mission. For example, maybe none of my officers have any advanced skills so I send them to a ""tactical-paramedic"" course. Which takes them out for awhile but upon their return then they unlock that trait. This would also prevent the annoying trend of having 5 of the same useless traits like pacifier on my squad. And if anyone gets shot in the plates maybe they sit out for a round, doctors orders. Or if they take heavy damage maybe longer. But a bunch of SWAT guys getting ""anxious"" just because they used lethal force, its a little unbalanced and not fun having to send them to therapy because they decided that SWAT plays too rough with pedophiles and terrorists. Lame

Really Bad - Planning 
The 'planning' element needs some serious work. First off, I have to decide between vague spawn points before the brief. Whoa cowboy, tell me whats going on before I commit to whatever 'back alley' or 'Side 1B' is. In addition, the player is not clearly shown starting locations on the tablet, this prevents orientation to the crisis site at mission start and you usually have to roam around for a minute to know where you are. Very annoying as this robs your sense of planning and limits your tactical approach to basically figure it out from 'the elevator' every time. Yes, in some crisis situations you wont have time to plan for a perfect raid with handy architectural interior layout's. BUT, even in the worst case scenario I WOULD know which side of the building I am starting on, and SHOULD be able to decide where I park my truck AFTER I hear mission details. It should be Mission Brief -> show map with clearly defined start locations -> choose one and then go. Ready or not is instead; Pick between ""stairwell"" or ""elevator"" -> here's a terrible napkin map with the start point you picked not even labeled on it -> into the mission blind 

Review over

A brief note about the genre, not Void int. 
Time, time is the most essential element of tactical dilemmas. Even more so than space because space is related to a problem with time. Time is not used effectively in this tactical shooter and it could have made them stand out more. Bomb threats on a countdown timer are cliche and uninspired (and not true to realistic IED's or conventional initiators as they are largely command det). How about a bunch of hostages that are going to get killed if you don't get to them after you are compromised. How about choosing the time of day for the assault? How about the number of civilians killed is directly related to how fast you can find and stop an active shooter. What about the Bank Robbers demand for a getaway car in 30 minutes or he starts blasting. Or serving a warrant to seize a pedophiles computer but if you take too long he fries his hard drive. No one in the genre does this (If I am mistaken let me know!) and its a huge gap in design for ""tactical"" shooters. Essentially, you can count down to a goal or count up to a goal and I just wish more games would put you against the clock. The goal could be mission pass/fail and it would put real contextual stress on your team as you attempt to bring order to chaos. Anyway, wow you read this far? Well, thanks friends, have fun being Ready!....or not.

However, the optimisation a piece of crap, you gotta fix the issues for hours.
For 3060 I somehow managed to fix the freezes after some hours of research on forums. Yeah, I finally got rid of freezes, but sometimes the FPS drops up to 12-20, which I don't know how to fix.

The accuracy on the npc's is a little insane tho, but still, the difficulty is welcome!

So maybe tone down the npc's aim just a tad, maybe make them flinch a little after getting 2 hits in the shoulder and arm.

And maybe some optimization since it can run a little choppy if you team up with friends in different countries.

Game visuals and AI just are not up for the 2023/24 release. For example the friendly NPC's in Police station are just sad to watch, they look out of place visually, do not move and you can not interact with them in any way.
Civilians in battle just stand there with stupid faces and have no reaction to you nor gunfight.
Hostile ncp's are not hard to kill, its just the blur and stuf the game fills your screen with what makes it hectic sometimes.
I do like the guns and loadouts but even the firing range is half done, missing scored shootouts and so on.
This game probably only pleases for the haredcore police sim players but it could be so much more and so much better with some effort put in it.
It reguires a decent PC to play it on full graphics but on same time doesnt offer anything of beauty, everything looks so 2018, the cars just look like out of GTA3, mirrors are blocked so you cant go infront of them to notice the missing reflections from game.

Managing the teams is fun, syncing breaches and running through maps flawlessly for that S rank non-lethal. But it can be tedious, managing each team clunky, sometimes spending so much time trying to get the AI to walk to the destination door (maybe 1/10 chance) or tabbing through actions that it feels like a minigame in itself. Sometimes the bad guys have made a decision before I've had time to get the AI to do what I want.

Online is a lot of fun (If you use you mic! A must!) with some connection issues or bugs with using the mission table, locking you out of interacting with the UI and forcing a restart. But by and large it plays exactly how you would expect it to. You and some Joe's kicking in the first door only to getting blown up because there was a door trap. The next run, there might be a bad guy, there might be nothing. It might not be until a few rooms in that you encounter resistance and BAM, another door trap because you got complacent. 
It's punishing in an ""I KNEW IT!"" way, and it's a lot of fun.
Buuut, sometimes the AI will just yeet you with precision accuracy cross-map and that can be tough.

In the end, I think it's a good game, with a good chunk of new maps recently added, standard character and weapon customization, and plenty of gadgets to make navigating those door traps as well as baddies a little easier, it has a lot to offer. But, selfishly, I want more.

Ready or Not was the best selling game on Steam in the week after its release and has been celebrated as a spiritual successor to the Police Quest: SWAT series and early Rainbow Six games.

        [td]💾Graphics[/td]
        [td] I absolutely love the graphics for Ready or Not. The night maps are the absolute best maps to play on. The lighting is top tier and the animations are some of the best out there in terms of shooting games. The flashbang effects are incredible and the particle effects are top tier. It truly looks impressive and intense. Every map is so unique from each other. Some having a weight of dread, some having a terrifying back story, etc. The graphics overall is just incredible, and feels Triple A worthy.

        [td]🎮Gameplay[/td]
        [td]So Ready or Not finally released 1.0 and I have to say that it's pretty darn good! Each mission has a unique objective (for the most part). Some are pretty easy, but others can be a true challenge. You also now have a new Commander mode (basically a singleplayer campaign). in Commander mode, you'll be accompanied by up to four AI-controlled SWAT officers who will follow your orders to the dot. A new great feature added is the stress system for your SWAT teammates. You have Content (green) to Anxious (yellow), Stressed (orange), and Crisis (red). Make sure you give some of your SWAT members a rest so they can come back to a more stable mental health. It's a super unique feature and I'm all for it! You have a ton of weapons and a good amount of customization for a swat game. You have a choice of lethal and non lethal weapons that can make a difference in your endgame score and survivability. You do have to deal with traps and the enemy can trick you and kill you really fast so be on your toes! You can play singleplayer with bots, or co-op with friends. I do prefer co-op for this game, but I have to say that the AI bots have had a major overhaul in the 1.0 update. The AI teammates now are pretty good and follow orders much better than before. They will check under beds, closets, watch your back, and stack up in a much more realistic way. This game does have mod support which allows you to add new maps, weapons, attachments, skins, etc. This is an early access game so some of the game modes are not complete on all maps just yet. The developers are really active so expect a lot of new content and improvements in the future.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]🎭Multiplayer[/td]
        [td]The multiplayer makes this game perfect. It’s super easy to invite friends even when they have mods. There is no PVP mode in this game so it’s pure co-op. That’s not a problem for me, but some people may want it in the future. Personally I feel like the movement fits co-op only since you do move pretty slow. The game is beatable with 2 people, but having more is just so much easier (especially trying to get a S rank).[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]🕛Playtime[/td]
        [td]With the mod support and the monthly updates, the playtime is pretty good. The game has a great challenge and the enemy spawn randomly each time you load a new match. The mod support is pretty good and you can even install modded maps to more replayability.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]🎧Sound[/td]
        [td] The sound effects are breathtaking. The gun shots are so punchy and sound like they can do some serious damage to you. The enemies can taunt you and make threats which is pretty immersive. The flashbangs are loud and sound really realistic. I am really impressed with the sound design. It’s one of the best games in terms of sound design. Also the music in this game reminds me alot of the movie HEAT. It's perfectly designed for the maps and will keep you on edge. Just incredible soundtracks throughout. Probably the only tactical shooter I recommend having the music on.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]❗Bugs❗[/td]
        [td]I have still seen some annoying bugs present that have not been fixed. For example the enemy AI will not react to some non lethal shots (not sure if this is a feature). Also the character customization menu doesn't show all the items properly (some items have a ""no data"" symbol on them). Nothing game breaking yet, which is a plus.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]🔅Performance[/td]
        [td]The performance has gotten worse since 1.0 for some odd reason. many people has had issues with DX11 (including me). The framerate will tank so low for no reason, then go back up to 60fps randomly. DX11 does feel broken on my end. Now the only way to play this for me is DX12, but even that can give me some annoying stutters that has gotten me killed multiple times. Now I am playing on a HDD so it may be worse for me than for others. If you have a higher end PC compared to me, then you will be fine.[/td]

 I LOVE THIS FREAKING GAME !
 for all it's short comings it does everything else right.
 Rainbow Six can't give fans a campaign and Ready or Not picks up the slack we been missing but far from finished by maybe another two years at the most.
 And last the game engine needs refining and better optimization you are losing frames on the lowest setting,
 Almost unplayable at time.
please fix theses problem soo i can rate this game a !! 10 !! cause this is what we need for the modern age of gaming.

I find myself replaying the same missions over and over just to get killed by the last guy because he shot me from god knows where.


Along side struggling with the new AI I also find myself having inconstant frame rate issues. One minute I'm clearing a room the next I am watching a slideshow of how I died. AI also seem to forget to be affected by tear gas and will continue to fight through it without failure.

Mindjot
Brisa Cove
Twisted Nerve (only in the tunnels and meth-lab house) hit 10fps when entering meth-labs
the Car Dealership
Hospital

The AI is just game breaking. Enemies will see you through closed doors and shoot through the door before continuing to shoot you through the wall as you move off of the door. Enemies will also detect and shoot you through smoke, frosted windows, anything that isn't coded as a completely solid surface. You call out to enemies to surrender and before you even get a chance to react, they're shooting you. But if you shoot the man armed with an AK facing your direction before calling out, you might fail the mission. He's not going to throw down the gun but you need to wear a few bullets before the game considers shooting the dude who planted explosives and is looking at you while holding an AR justified. 

Unfortunately, if it were just the enemies it would be one thing, but your team is also borderline suicidal. You just killed an enemy who was rounding a corner at the end of a long hallway? Well, there goes your teammate running past you into the middle of the exposed hall to secure the weapon he dropped. Tell a friendly to secure a suspect you convinced to surrender? He's going to walk circles around the suspect before the suspect gets bored and starts to move for a gun upon which your teammate will instantly execute him.

How is it that you're expected to secure a sprawling 10 acre facility crawling with a dozen or more heavily armed gang members with a 5 man SWAT team? While simultaneously there's no over-watch or surveillance. Suspects will run a quarter of a mile on city streets around the exteriors of buildings with no issue or warning or police cordon to deter of slow them down.

When I bought this game it was in early access and cost me $40 US, which frankly was more than the game is even worth. However now the game is $50 US and is in ""Full Release"" (which is a joke). Price is everything in this economy and quite frankly this game could be great but they are trying to charge only about 17% less than a AAA title.

The AI for both suspects and the SWAT are absolutely terrible. Both the SWAT and suspects have reaction times that are so superior to that of actual humans that you are literally better either sending your AI teammates to clear every room by themselves or just shoot on sight every suspect you see. The alternative is if you try to play ""tactically"" and actually make sure threats are armed before using lethal force you will be doing a lot of restarts or spectating. 

Then there's the single player mode, don't play it. If you don't have friends to play with then don't play at all because you just aren't going to finish a mission unless you do the above ^

Yeah the gun play can be fun when you get to use it but most of the time either the SWAT AI eliminate your target first because they saw the suspect pull a gun mere milliseconds after drawing, well before you as the player can ever possibly see and react to the same thing; or the suspect guns YOU down because the SWAT AI aren't close enough with the super human reaction time to save you.",1706606532,1706606532,False,1,1,0,0,True,False,False

You can only join a multiplayer server if they're at headquarters and not in a mission, so if you're repeatedly trying to join and it won't let you, host your own server because others will be doing the same thing you were doing.

I've played for 13 hours so far so good and have had no issues. The community is great and I even went through Green Team and a string of ops with one of the hosts that gave us a great time. His name was Alasku if anyone plays with him.

Everyone has a desire for tactics so you'll be getting the best experience as long as you can communicate a plan, even if its a short plan, and have fun executing it. Regarding the AI in multiplayer experiences, they are smart but not overly intelligent as to portray a realistic simulation. If you flashbang them and tell them to get on the ground and surrender, they will. If you shoot them to near death, they will likely surrender. If you use non-lethal weapons on them and tell them to surrender, they will. However, if you take too long to secure a surrendering suspect, they may pull a weapon if they see the chance.

Overall, to anyone checking out this game, don't listen to reviews that say the AI is bad etc etc. Normally, a ton of people are just starting out like you and are terrible at the game albeit it not having a steep learning curve. When someone doesn't like something or understand something they will definitely complain.

They seem to have aimbot. I'm supposed to be fighting inexperienced gangsters not navy seals. They spot you immediately and get headshots way too common. Its like they're super human. I've spent 30 minutes on one mission being as careful as possible just to get shot in the back of the head before i can react and then all my officers go into a crisis and i have to do a bunch of easy missions before i can continue. Its annoying as hell and i actually had to mod the game to tone down the accuracy and reaction time to be more akin to an actual shooter.

3. Ally AI are also good, sometimes stupid- but good. They have great aim just like the Enemy AIs but sometimes they don't follow orders properly and/or do something really stupid that'll cost you ( You can always order them to stay at spawn if you don't want them ).

My frame rates and overall fidelity are significantly worse in 1.0.  From a near locked frame rate at ultra 1440p on a 3060ti before the 1.0 update to stuttering constantly and medium 1440p.  

AI are horrendous and worse than before if that was somehow possible. The new AI controls they've given us are janky and buggy and only work sometimes.  The QOL features they added like auto reporting suspects and civilians are very nice though.

But man...  For a game that tries enforce strict ROE, the AI is no where near adequate...  Suspects are unstable at best.  Going from shady looking to headshooting you in a second or less.  They are very buggy without line of sight in this update where they'll instant hit you when you peak the corner, but if you shoot within that timeframe you'll often get hit with an ROE penalty if you didn't yell compliance even though if you do you'll die half the time.  

AI team mates are still useless at best. They'll often flashbang you instead of enemies when clearing a hallway or anyroom where there is a wall near the door.  

The new campaign mode is needed, but mostly useless considering how useless your AI teammates are. They'll stick themselves into line of site before a flashbang goes off and get killed. The new map and breifing are what the game was sorely needing and a great update, but the rest of the package is pretty buggy.  Lots of stuttering in the mission select screens.  

I've also encountered numerous ingame bugs that are new to 1.0.   IR Laser sights refuse to toggle sometimes unless you turn off your NVGs, turn the sight on, and turn your NVGs back on.  Which is kinda useless.  

Overall, it feels like a pretty rushed 1.0 that wasn't ready for release and needed a lot more ironing out before rolling it out.  

THE AI NEED TO BE FIXED. That is really what 95% of my frustrations are centered around and I can live with a lot of the other issues if the AI could just  work.",1706563817,1706563817,False,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Is it worth 50€ price tag? NO. Definitely not. It is an incomplete early access game still even if it claims to be ready. For 20€ it could be a good game but for 50€ I would like to get more for my money. 

More in depth:

For some reason this was better before the official release, the game runs very poorly even though my computer passes the recommended stats and it ran much better before the release. Also there are still a lot of things missing from a tactical perspective, prone for example. The AI has aimbot which is super unrealistic. Much more realistic would be if the enemies were scared and some couldn't even shoot straight. Enemy morale is incredible and they can take multiple shots to the knees and still charge at you.

Also the ""story mode"" is entirely pointless and just consumes some more time as there is no longer the possibility of a quick restart. Mu whole team died on a door trap and in the ending screen only one of them died and the rest went to therapy. If your entire roster is unavailable it has no effect on  the game, because you'll just get random guys instead. You cannot freely configure your team's loadout anymore either. Also now if you shoot, accidentally or on purpose, a restrained suspect you will be promptly executed without trial by your fellow policemen. Yesss, veeeery realistic.

Still if you download a mod that fixes the terrible ai and play with a friend or friends instead of the ai it is indeed quite a good game resembling SWAT 4 and games like it.",1688590268,1706538049,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I have to say presentation wise the game is pretty decent, been looking for a tactical multiplayer squad focused shooter akin to Rainbow Six Vegas 2 Terrorist hunt mode and this game certainly delivers.

As of the 1.0 update the game comes with 18 level's each ranging from different objectives and difficulty.

Pro's

- Weapon customisation allowed me to tailor my play style exactly as i wanted and the aiming and shooting feels natural.

- Enemy AI presents a challenge and constantly makes you feel on edge, they could be anywhere at any time so clearing out rooms requires tactics and forward thinking.

- Level design has lost of lore and themed focused objectives which are fun. Accomplishing them feels like you are increasing in skill and the progression systems goes towards getting better upgrades.

- Squad customisation can be tailored to support you and your play style. Want the squad to arrive decked out with heavy armour and riot shields? sure no problem.


Con's

- No official controller support by the developers. However i was able to rectify the issue with community controller mapping option through steam. However I would recommend mouse and keyboard for natural play as certain bindings for squad commands assigned to the directional buttons can be confusing.

- Enemy AI as of 1.0 can be infuriating especially during the later levels, fast reaction times, shooting through walls, instakilling you on sight and aimbot from across long corridors felt unfair at times. Community has addressed this, and hopefully the developers will fix or scale the difficulty going forward. In the meantime i recommend scaling the difficulty spike with nexus mod's as community fixes can tailor the experience to play naturally.

- More levels, I haven't played it prior to the 1.0 update but having completed all 18 maps i am eager for more. Community mods has a supermarket themed map, that would be a fun inclusion in further updates, or maybe a plane hijack akin to Airforce one or Executive Decision 90's throwback.

- Squad AI sometimes can be unresponsive to commands and will remain stuck, this can be annoying especially during shootouts. Once your dead the AI will do its best to complete the objectives without you, however i found more often than not the AI has pathing issues and sometimes is unable to proceed forwards after getting stuck beside a wall.

The squad AI also needs to be scaled with the enemy AI in its current form it feels like the enemy is operating with 100% hit detection accuracy where as your squad is handicapped with a 50% chance they won't die trying to find the enemy.

Id say the game in its current state is 7.5, i bought it at full price and looking forward to jumping into this game with my friend however i am eager for further updates to bring more content and or fix the AI whilst adding official controller support.",1706533663,1706533663,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Highly recommend, play with friends and surround sound.

EDIT: 
After playing this game from the release of early access to now (May 31st as of this edit), I can say without a doubt that this game has a very bright future. I can't say that I've played another game with AI of this level of uniqueness and sophistication. You occasionally still come across the John Wick .357 or shotgun suspect who's doped out of their mind and couldn't care less about the well being of themselves, but over all the interaction with all the different types of civi's and suspects has been quite a joy. Best gun play of any game out there, every shot can be felt throughout my body and induces this very strange form of enjoyable stress that's almost craved. Other than Insurgency: Sandstorm, the firefights are of the most intense nature I could imagine having in a game, knowing that any one shot could be the one that drops you, and the amount of screen shaking and adrenaline-fueled vision blur from near-misses will leave you a damn mess. With the June update just around the corner, I'm very excited to see how this game continues to go above and beyond, rejuvenating the FPS genre in ways I thought had been lost to the 2000's.

EDIT: 
It's been just about 5 months since the June update hit public servers, and I have to say that it's blowing my mind at how addictive this game still is. I'm definitely not hitting this game with the boys nearly as often as I was a couple months ago, but it's still getting some love from me about once or twice every 2 weeks or so. I was really worried that, after waiting this long for the next update, I would grow tired of this title and move onto something else, but that's not the case. What keeps me coming back for more is that I seem to learn something new every time I launch the game, be it AI behavior, gun-play, or even environmental story telling. On top of that, with the induction of in-game mod support, it increases life expectancy by a very long period of time.... With that being said, I am beginning to feel the longing for a new update with additions coming strait from the developers, not nearly as bad when the June update was being worked on, but still feeling a bit of craving for the next chapter of RoN.

EDIT: 
With the Adam update in full drive and plenty of hot fixes put in place, I can honestly say that this is, by far, the best tactical shooter that I've ever played. With every update, they up the games enjoyment far beyond my expectations. The new maps are so much fun and challenging, good environmental story telling, new and intriguing AI suspects, crazy interactions with AI civilians, and the addition of new missions continues to add replayability. I find myself wanting to play them over and over again, even when my whole team dies and we fail repeatedly. The new subs and hand-gun are just top notch, they feel good, sound good and increase the enjoyment of gun-play substantially. Personally, my favorite thing about this update is the overhaul of AI behavior. I can finally say that, 90% of the time, if I die then it's because I faltered somewhere in my game-play skill. I don't find myself feeling that I got screwed during a gun-fight because the suspect was like the second coming of John Wick, it feels balanced. I will say, my biggest complaint is the new map, Ridgeline. It needs a lot of improvement, the mission doesn't deliver the kind of raw, intense, dreadful feeling of being hunted that I was expecting. I thought that Gerard was going to be playing a high-octane game of cat-and-mouse with the SWAT team, constantly hiding in places that you'd never think to look, changing positions in the house at all times to prepare for an ambush, traps all over the place... And I just didn't get that. In conclusion, I really enjoy where this game is going. Keep it up Void, y'all are making something amazing here.

EDIT: After a year of waiting with the utmost patience, I can confidently say that I am very disappointed in this game. I expected something huge here from VOID, but all I got was map changes, new guns and some new character models. I couldn't care less about the police station, the new one looks ""better"", but it's not something that I was overly ambitious about waiting a year for. For starters, the AI have not been changed in the slightest, it's the same mega-accuracy bulls*@# I experienced when the game first came out, so from that perspective we've moved backwards instead of forward. There's no new animations from the suspect and civilian AI, which is also very disappointing. The animations that were in the game aren't even present anymore due to the new update, which the devs have addressed and are (supposedly) working on. The campaign mode is absolutely atrocious, the new SWAT AI have superhuman senses or no sense at all, there really is no in-between, and that's quite frustrating. The map rework of Hotel (which was my favorite map in the game) is trash. They took a fantastic map, and completely ruined it by making it into this dark, compact map that has no character or interesting factors, its just some hallways, some hotel rooms and a lounge area. Finally, my friends are constantly experiencing crashes and glitches in this game, ruining the immersion and fun-factor of the game. Overall, I'm quite unhappy that this is what the 1.0 version of this game looks like. I understand AI is very difficult to get right, but that doesn't take away from the fact that a full release and a price increase is unacceptable for this version of the product.",1641226044,1706513106,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

This game is fantastic, or rather could be. 

Pros:
The gunplay is amazing.
The levels are well made and designed.
The graphics are gorgeous.
The customization is incredible.
Multiplayer (can) be tactical as hell.

Now, with pros like that, whats holding this game back?

The lack of quality of life features. Why when im playing in commander mode (this games ""campaign""), do I have to be sent back to the hub, re pick the mission, re-ready up, and sit through yet another loading screen? Would it be so hard as to simply add a restart button and have an OPTION to go back to the hub?

Why can the AI see me through walls (as many others pointed out). Why do they have near instant reaction time? 

Why is the optimization HORRID? 

This game is NOT anywhere near worth a FIFTY USD dollar price tag.

If this was early access, okay fine, its early, but for a supposed FINISHED product? This is flat out dropping the ball.

This is like going to a chef, handing him the best ingredients possible, and then he makes like an overcooked burnt BLT.

This game has the POTENTIAL to be a FANTASTIC EXPERIENCE, and all the parts needed are ALREADY MADE! So with a couple quality of life updates (which should have been in the game in the first place, for a 50$ price tag), this game will be worth it.

As of right now, if your looking for a singleplayer SWAT experience, just get SWAT 4.

To add insult to injury this is not the first time the AI has been beyond abysmal, last time it was pretty much for months on end, then sprinkle in the current rampant lag issues and you have cancer in the flesh.

Being forced to locate all civilians soured the whole experience for me, as finishing the final level was impossible. 
 
Gameplay can be quite fun and tense, but it is also ruined at times by enemy ai, which will wallbang you or instantly kill you without a moment's warning if they have a line of sight. Friendly ai also has a tendency to trap you in rooms or corners, which becomes incredibly frustrating. 

Also, the games runs very poorly. Even on a good pc, the game struggles to maintain 60 fps in any area with lots of ai. In a game where reacting instantly means the difference between a lengthy restart and success, this becomes a real problem.

Just go to GOG and buy swat:4, it is not even comparable how much worse this game is.

If the 1.0 update is meant to be the complete package than this game is a failure and they've just been doing nothing this whole time, not only is EVERY SINGLE ONE of the issues this game had during early access still there completely untouched, but there are even more bugs than there was before. 
Even worse, systems that were good and functional in the previous build are either completely worse or just straight up gone and more than half of the content they teased for more than a year of them not updating the game is nowhere to be found...

-The game runs infinitely worse than it did before for no reason despite actually looking worse and some of the maps being smaller, this game would look dated during the xbox 360 era and somehow it needs even more powerful hardware than some of the most visually impressive games of the current generation.

-The AI is still John Wick despite supposedly being fixed, perfectly one shotting you and pulling impossible maneuvers and still shrug off 5.56 and even 7.62 rounds like they're nothing and sometimes not even being affected by flashbangs, pepper spray, stingers.

-The ROE(Rules of engagement) still make no sense and punish you for shooting back at someone who is shooting you or civilians, there have been times i got deducted points for ""unathorized use of deadly force""for shooting back at a suspect after they literally KILLED one of my guys.

-Your guns still have such exaggerated and unrealistic recoil that im convinced the devs entire experience with a firearm is rb6 siege.

-You still have to kindly wait for the suspect to be polite and comply to your orders which they will always ignore and you can't put them on the ground yourself.

-Friendly AI still can get stuck somewhere on the map and ignore your orders.

-You still have to play forensic and walk through the entire map at the speed of Bizarro world flash to find that one piece of paper the devs FORCE you to find on this awful poorly designed maps with zero clues as to where they are otherwise you can't leave, this has been an issue since day one and like many things they refuse to change it, except now it's an even bigger issue since you're forced to do it to access the other maps in the awful commando mode.

-The """"""Realistic"""""""" and """"""gritty"""""" story is something that not even an 8 year old would write for their creepypasta, all of the maps have some of the stupidest most on the nose edgy garbage story that is downright impossible to take seriously.

Additionally before you could select what situation (hostage situation, active shooter, bomb threat, etc) you wanted to tackle on whatever map supported it, this was great as it added replayability and truly made every encounter unpredictable and pushed you to try and get the highest score on all of the maps and situations, now you have to go through this awful career mode that is not thought out at all, you can't restart to try and get better ranks and can be cheesed easely, completely removing what little there was of the ""tactical"" portion in this ""tactical"" shooter to the point that the only way you could consider this a good tactical shooter is if you've never played anything else like it before, even the game its supposed to be a spiritual succesor to.

****The AI 100% CHEATS and exploits.**** 
I have seen the AI exploit the game and cheat the player in the following extreme ways:
1. Shoot you through a wall without knowing you are there visually or by sound.
2. Spawn out of thin air in front of your eyes and instantly head shot you.
3. Have an inhuman instant reaction time to fire at you if you make a noise or spot you visually (if they haven't instantly wall hacked you by then)

The level of cheating the AI does puts ""Camomo's"" Banning Rust Cheater videos to shame.

Until they fix the base AI without having to hack/mod the game losing your official scores. ***Avoid this game at all costs for your own mental health.***

Title: ""Ready or Not: 

In the whimsical and imaginative world of ""Ready or Not,"" players are treated to an extraordinary gaming experience where tactical operations meet the unanticipated charm of monkeys mastering mathematics. This unique fusion of adrenaline-fueled tactical gameplay and the joyous allure of numerically inclined primates offers a delightful escape into a world where bullets and bananas coexist harmoniously.


As the commander of a squad of highly trained monkey operatives, players find themselves navigating through diverse scenarios that demand both strategic acumen and mathematical prowess. The core objective revolves around overcoming challenges by harnessing the distinct math skills of each monkey. This unconventional blend of tactical decision-making and numerical problem-solving elevates the gameplay to new heights of entertainment and cognitive engagement.



At the heart of ""Ready or Not"" lies a series of math challenges that players must conquer to progress through the game. From calculating trajectories for banana projectiles to solving complex numerical puzzles, players are immersed in a world where mathematical dexterity becomes the key to success. Each level presents unique challenges, ensuring that players not only advance in the game but also sharpen their mathematical skills in the process.

Monkey Agility:

Beyond mastering math, players witness the dynamic agility of their monkey operatives. Commanding these primates to swing from vines, climb structures, and execute acrobatic maneuvers adds an exhilarating physical dimension to the gameplay. The combination of tactical strategy and nimble monkey antics creates an immersive and entertaining experience that keeps players engaged throughout their mathematical journey.

Multiplayer Monkey Madness:

""Ready or Not"" embraces the social aspect of gaming by offering multiplayer modes where players can team up with friends. Cooperative missions become a test of teamwork and collective mathematical proficiency, while competitive modes add a layer of unpredictability to the equation. The result is a multiplayer experience that not only fosters camaraderie but also showcases the diverse strategies and math skills of each player.",1706388797,1706388797,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Past all that tho, graphics and team movement are just awesome, but again commander mode feels like corporal mode at this point

In short: Enemy AI is very hard at this point. They are beyond the point of realism. They have crazy aim, tankiness, crazy running speed, and other craziness, which like I said is beyond realistic.

Enemy AI:
1) Enemy AI is WAY too hard - I mostly solo this game without NPC officers. What I observed in my solo adventures:
a) Enemy AI can shoot precisely through cover without peeking. The nearer you are to the said cover, the more accurate the enemies' wallbang gets.
b) Throw a deployable/nade to disorient the enemies without having a proper line of sight? The deployable will always bounce and go to the left. Dunno why.
c) Flank the enemy AI stealthily? They will know where you are, always.
d) Hold your position and aim at a medium distance so that you can get him when he jumps out of cover? He will almost always prefire and kill you when his aggression is high
e) Shoot his arms to disarm him? He will simply shift the gun to his other hand. 
f) You will need to shoot him 3-5 times in non critical areas to incapacitate him and 2 shots in the center of chest or head to kill him
g) Take cover behind a hostage? He will shoot you through the hostage and the hostage wont get hit. Beware you cant do the same
h) Enemy AI can strafe-run at full speed and shoot at you with above normal accuracy (maybe even kill you)
i) And then there are other minor glitches and bugs",1705419394,1706354464,False,1,0,0.503094911575317383,0,True,False,False

[h3] Pros [/h3] 
• Excess weapon variety.
• Lack of grind for weapons & tools; as they're all available. 
• Nicely done weapon customisation, and attachments.
• Great selection of maps with greatly designed interior.
• Accurate and well-made weapons.
• Push to talk! 
•  Great gameplay experience especially if it's done when people constantly communicate.

[h3] Cons [/h3] 
• Very poor optimisation. (With MSI GTX 1650 Super, I had to lower all graphics settings to minimum to get stable FPS).
• Not able to select which region you want to play. 
• Poorly performed voice acting in general. [Compared to SWAT 4 (2005)] 
• Not able to join games from a server browser. (Server browser that is similar to Left 4 dead's)
• Uninteractable NPCs at the headquarters. 

[h3] In Conclusion [/h3] 
•  As it can be seen, all the negatives mentioned above are to subject to change for other people, and are subjective opinions too - excluding the optimisation. 
•  Therefore, I would definitely encourage people to give the game a try.
•  The gameplay is done in such a great way, you don't have to grind for anything. Just select your preferred guns and gear, and roll in to the mission! Big thumbs up for that!

[h3] Verdict [/h3] 
I recommend it - after giving the game a more ''objective'' look compared to my initial review.

Either on sale or not, up to you.

the controls arent bad, however the mobility is needlessly nerfed imo, they dont allow you to jump.

your loadouts are very customizeable, you can choose to sacrifice armor in favor of more deployable or ammo. you can choose armor materials which affect your acceleration and what happens when you get hit.

weapon customization isnt as up to speed as i would wish, as an example its pretty common to have combined module that acts as a flash light and a laser 2in1 in this game you can only choose one or the other.

even joining randoms isnt that bad had a bunch of fun joining on strangers

**single player**: the premise is simple > same as single player but friendly AI tries to fill the space of real players.

then why is it 100 times more frustrating then its multi player counterpart?
for me its the fact that you cant restart missions... 
you loose a mission and then you are forced back to the police station and watch your bots have a mental break down or quiting the job so that you have to replace them and then you have to sellect the mission again and go on it again, man i dont give a f*** just give me the option to get right back in after a fail without wasting time, i would straight up start alt + F4ring and quiting the game outright after every loss cuz i didnt wanna deal with this shit...

i get that they tried to make the single player distinguished from multiplayer, but this aint it chief, i felt like having an enurysm playing single player but had a hell of a time with friends. completely different pollar oposite results...

i would honestly rather just host a solo multiplayer session for a better single player experience then this

[h2] The good: [/h2] 
This game really lives up to the tactical shooter genre premises. Most of the times it has a very slow paced, intense and anxiety inducing gameplay where you often find yourself not being sure of what to do and just doing it anyway.

Of all the FPS games, tactical or not, I've played in my life, this one is amongst those that have the heaviest and most distinctive atmosphere. It is not like Call of Duty or Battlefield where you feel like you're in a movie, no. It is as if you were in an actual realistic and possible enviroment/situation where your life is just about as fragile as of the suspects you are shooting.

The level design is pretty well made, diverse and detailed. It can and will subtly give you hints of what you're experiencing more in depth. It is also ""edgy"" in the proper way an FPS like this should be, as in, it portrays the reality it tries to emulate very well (even if it is a heavy dramatization, which kind of very necessary in almost any story).

[h2] The bad: [/h2] 
Even though this is an actual good game and certainly a fun experience, specially with friends, it does not come without its flaws. Let's start with the mildest of the problems and then a little worse one.

I've never been a soldier or a police officer, but I can assure you from talking to anyone who is acostumed to constantly shooting guns that there is no way on earth that guns should have that absurd big of a recoil. And keeping on the weapons theme: 9mm here almost does not kill. It does barely any damage even to a suspect with not even a kevlar vest.

This might be a subjective thing, but I really think there should be more morally dubious missions, as in like Ides of March (Brisa Cove). In that mission you have to neutralize a situation in which military veterans barricaded themselves and plan to assassinate a presidential candidate, Senator Freemont, because in his campaign he proposed a bill which would cut veteran funding.
On an emotional level and on trying to emulate a reality:
You can't sympathize with school shooters,
You can't sympathize with illegal arms dealers,
You can't sympathize with p*dos (not sure if steam lets me say words like that here),
You CAN sympathize with people who are in a fucked State and are getting more and more fucked by it by the government cutting its assistance and shit to those in need. That seems an awful lot like a reality because it is. And that is why this mission is plot-wise, in my opinion, the best and most meaningful in the game.

Now onto the less worse part of the suspect AI: It is way too simple. way. too. simple.
The suspect AI doesn't really make any meaningful decisions beyond fighting back, giving up or killing themselves. Sure you got the ocasional perfidy, but they don't do anything much more than that. As an example, they could very well be programmed to run away and flank you and find the best routes to do so, but it seems like they just try to find the nearest route to you and only really shoot you from the back without any meaningful thought to it, even going as far as making the stupid decision to do that while 4 other officers are aiming at the door.

[h2] The ugly: [/h2] 
I am going to get straight to the point: The suspect AI is absolute dogshit. Not because it is too easy to fight them, no, it is quite the contrary. They seems to have aimbot and wallhack hacks and they can hear you from miles and miles away. The suspect AI is the main thing that ruins this game. Yes, you can mod the AI to make it less John Wick-y, but Void, what is the point on delivering an unfinished AI on a game you made such big promises on? 
And even if you do download mods for the suspect AI, in all the cases I did, it fucks up your friendly AI, so it is like a trade-off of some sorts, which is stupid and would be unecessary if the devs actually took the time to fix the AI.
Yes, I know that they left us, early access players, one year without any meaningful updates, yes. But I would rather wait one more year to get a FULLY DEVELOPED AND COMPLETED GAME than this.

...also, the optimisation is also dogshit.

[h2] Conclusion: [/h2] 
Should you buy this game, full price or not? Depends.
If you want to actively see the development of the game and feel the changes and all, then yes, buy it.
If you want to have a fully developed and polished tactical shooter experience then don't for now. Wait a bit.",1698860132,1706331392,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game has full mod support from an integrated mod.io menu as well as an active community on NexusMods (as of this post the Vortex extension for the game does not work, you must manually install mods from Nexus).
The overarching story in the base game maps is highly detailed and fleshed out for the singleplayer campaign, integrating as many story related objectives into the maps as possible. 

- Gameplay wise, the gunplay is well thought out in terms of how it affects suspects and officers alike according to body armor worn and rounds used and where targets are hit. For example using high caliber AP rounds vs non-armored targets have a high chance of over penetration causing little to no damage. In the same fashion, by using small caliber AP rounds they may not be able to totally penetrate heavy armor and thus require more rounds to down a target. 
The AI is famously unforgiving with quick reaction time and a detailed ""Suspect Stress"" AI system. (Suppressed weapons and low grenade use is your friend!)

- Story wise, as a SWAT team simulator it is highly emphasized through the main campaign that you are largely part of a police force trying to keep your corner of the world from falling into total decay. Though it's plainly obvious mysterious forces behind the scenes have their own objectives. You can only do what you're told and perform your duties to the best of your ability and hope that after you do your job the detectives, federal agents and lawyers will do theirs.

It's a police procedural where you're supposed to arrest people?

Ready or Not in its current state is a dumpster fire of a police procedural. Suspect AI is the main thing you will be engaging with during the game, and it has both superhuman (.1 second) reaction time and accuracy, often shooting you through walls and doorways after spotting fabric from your uniform poking from concealment. 

This would be fine if it were not a gritty tactical SWAT simulation - but that is the game that RoN portrays itself as. The suspects run the gamut from drug addicts robbing a convenience store, to armed security, to die hard criminal types - however every single one of these suspects acts exactly the same - armed suspects regardless of type will unflinchingly refuse to surrender unless less-lethal options such as flashbangs are utilized, and otherwise will proceed to commit suicide by cop. Suspects who do surrender will unerringly be faking it and will pull a holdout piece to shoot you if you don't immediately order them to turn around to be cuffed, only to be blown away by automatic weapons fire upon drawing a weapon by your AI squad mates.

SWAT Officer AI similarly behaves in this superhuman manner, as in the aforementioned scenario it will often look like they are executing an unarmed suspect, but also incredibly dumb – the go to for Officer AI is to “move and clear” rooms. This works fine if the room is a box. Things go haywire as the levels become more and more complex and labyrinthine, as Officers will stand in hallways next to open doors and call out that “the room is clear” before being blasted by a suspect 5 feet away in what is technically another room.
 
The effect this has on the massive undertaking that VOID has gone under to provide a gritty and realistic depiction of the scenarios in Ready or Not cannot be understated - this obliterates all sense of immersion. This is honestly such a shame because the level design of Ready or Not borders on incredible. But here we are sabotaging that again with the sudden 1.0 inclusion of a ton of AI generated artwork. Some of these are funny like anime girl posters with 8 eyebrows, but almost all of it is unnecessary. This is such a bizarre choice when compared side by side with the massive level of detail that these levels have – it’s very clear that there is someone on the team who is very passionate about what they are doing, and being absolutely stabbed in the back by whoever else was responsible for these assets.

The only other conclusion I can draw from this is that VOID has absolutely phoned it in across the finish line. For a game that was charging 80$ for the early access “supporter edition” that came with all the levels in development, it is hard to believe that this is the current “finished product”. These issues with suspect AI have been the state of the game for multiple years as levels were being produced. (In fact, I remember it being better a year ago.) Game modes that existed pre-1.0 have been removed. The replay feature is broken and borders on nonfunctional – but don’t worry, it will be filling up your hard drive with replays and cannot be disabled. The only way to select a mission is through the elaborately designed HQ, which is slow. The touted Commander mode that 1.0 has launched with is a mess. It is barebones and after completing the campaign using it I can say that it adds nothing to the game. S Ranks for levels, which is what you will be shooting for (besides the suspects) after completing Commander mode, are not tracked on any of the game screens besides when you complete the level. The only way to tell what levels you’ve S Ranked is by checking what tattoos you have unlocked in the cosmetic menu. 

All of this adds up to a massive bummer. I loved SWAT 4, and while I’m certainly no tactical shooter expert, I can appreciate when an FPS does something different from the typical Call of Duty style cinematic military rooty tooty point and shooty. Slow, cerebral pacing through levels where you are trying to keep everyone alive, even the bad guys, makes for an interesting dynamic for a video game in an industry where nearly everything is just the opposite. Ready or Not, however, is basically only fun if you play it as it’s not meant to be played.

With all of these issues, it’s very difficult to recommend Ready or Not.",1706313439,1706313661,False,464,37,0.724037349224090576,26,True,False,False

It does deliver on a very unique tactical shooter experience that there are simply no other games like it. That swat fantasy alone might be worth paying for in most cases but objectively speaking the game still has lots of issues.

The biggest reason why I do not recommend this game is that it basically brings nothing new to the table. The game is essentially SWAT 4 with a little better graphics. I would expect there to be a more noticeable difference in games that are more than 15 years apart. Things like modern gadgets could be implemented, better animations, better ai, more meaningful procedural generation. Things that would make the game innovate on the formula. The point I am making here is that while Ready or Not does preserve and deliver that superb formula of the old SWAT games, right now there is absolutely no reason for you to buy this game over SWAT 4.

AI deserves a special mention as it is very disappointing still. Commands for your team are just very limited. Most obvious example I can come up with is that there is no option to force your team to switch to less-than-lethal weapons like tasers and tear gas. The game encourages you to arrest suspects rather than kill them (which in itself is pretty dumb in most situations like when dealing with outright terrorists) but the ai teammates just make it harder by killing a suspect who is alone in the room and you could easily overpower him.

Optimisation and bugs are sadly another thing I have to mention. The game runs outright bad and it does not look all that great either. AI teammates get stuck on doors and there is clipping. Also a super weird glitch is that some doors do not full cover the opening so you can basically see into the room for free without being noticed.

Finally another minor but concerning thing is the suspicious marketing. Idk if its just me and I am willing to give the devs the benefit of the doubt on this but it seems to me like the 1.0 trailers make it seem as though there is a deep campaign and/or highly scripted set pieces and drama. In case anyone else gets confused that is absolutely not the case. The game is 18 levels where you are in charge of a swat team. You are given an objective to save civilians and clear out bad guys. There is no dialogue, no cut scenes, no characters. Do not expect a flashed out campaign with a deep story

Things like these make me say that I do not recommend this game. I miss SWAT series so much and there is simply no other tactical shooters like this game out there so I still do not regret my purchase and will probably have lots more fun with this game. It is just that at present I would expect more",1706299849,1706313505,False,1,1,0.502060472965240479,1,True,False,False

The performance is worse than pre-release, some content got (unnecessarily) cut, and the enemy AI is inconsistent at best and supernatural at worst.

My main with the game is its structure. Now the campaign consist of separate missions with a police station serving a purpose of hub/intermission, when you can manage your squad, equipment and see briefings before starting a mission.
The most aggravating feature is that you can't restart the missions and exiting them will count as a failure (which punishes you by increasing your squadmates stress level). It adds nothing of value to the gameplay, as you will be either forced to sit through loading screens while going back to hub and choosing mission again (while being punished for failure) or ALT+F4 and restart the game, again sitting through the loading screens. This design isn't very coherent within the game story as well, as realistically SWAT team couldn't retreat, regroup and try again next day.
The game would work best if progress was mission-oriented as well, with no penalty for trying again (something akin to other mission based games, like old R6, Splinter Cell or MGS games).
Also, please let us see our best score on completed missions.

1144200,156862184,76561198040572263,0,5,4491,0,4491,1705907837,"I loved this game when it first opened on steam for purchase, but if I knew it was going to end up were it did, I probably would have ignored it. It is the game that ""Could have been"".

I bought this game for myself and friends, I also bought the support pack DLC because I wanted to help give this game every chance that I could, and in its earlier days, regardless of the bugs, it was turning out to be well worth it.

The game had a dark sense of realism to it, human trafficking, active shooter, hostage situations. It didn't shy away from showing you the real kinds of things Police Services deal with. it hit you on a different level that left you really thinking. Nothing was over done, but with the changes to maps, One (Of Many) that comes to mind being The Port map where it felt like a fast moving operation for human trafficking, finding people in shipping containers that you just felt terrible for and you'd have an urge to want to search and clear every last inch of that map to insure justice. Well, at least that's how it was. Now you get some over done Hollywood movie take where you find cheesy eye rolling text inside an unbelievable ""Hide out"" that appears to be run by the VIP's of ""Squid Game"". I'm sure their dialogue would have been just as good...

A huge down side was the removal of the different modes you could select. For every map there were 5 different modes. Barricaded Suspects, Bomb Threat, Raid, Active Shooter and Hostage Rescue. (All of which are still advertised on the games steam page in a video as this review is posted) All were ripped from the game and you're forced to go with a standard pray and spray into John Wicks Cloning Facilities.

Everyone is saying it, and it is true. The AI is WAY to fast. If you want to argue on some maps that they should have faster reaction time because they are trained, sure, I'll buy it, but when I walk into a drug den and get 360 no-scoped in a way that would make John Wick blush by a guy whose veins died last year I have to wonder... 

The scoring system is way out of wack, you want a perfect score? Bring flowers and ask the bad men to handcuff themselves, because if you even think of shooting someone who tries to do someone harm, it's okay, you'll always be average. I don't know why I can walk into a club where I can see 60+ Bodies on the ground that were slaughtered trying to escape and piled up by their killers with their phones ringing probably from their loved ones that will never be able to speak to them again and I get in trouble because I yelled at guys in full body armor carrying LMGs to get down multiple times, and didn't listen but because they didn't point their gun at me I'm the bad guy because I shot them.

All in all the game feels different, I view posters with passive aggressive tones towards Law Enforcement. The game feels more like an over-done movie than it does trying to create order in chaos. I'm still waiting for the day I find a shirtless guy with bullets strapped to his chest calling himself ""Rambo"". If you are looking for a small fun time with friends, sure. I don't recommend the game aside from that, it's ""Okay"" at best. I wish it had gone in the direction it started but it honestly feels like different people are working on it now. I don't like the passive aggressiveness towards law enforcement or veterans in the game at all.

[h1] INFO [/h1]
I go by Tomato, I have 400+ hours on RON, and have learned and practiced CQB tactics.
Why would I negatively review RON after all of this? 
I’d be very dishonest and in contempt of all of my findings and experiences and the findings and experiences of others post 1.0 if I were to choose a positive review over a negative at its current state. If sufficient changes are made for the better, I will absolutely change this review to a positive. If you have any criticisms of this post, say such, ask questions, the comments will be open. 

[h1] WHAT I THINK RON SHOULD BE [/h1]
IMO, Ron should be a tactical SWAT Simulator. 
But based on so many design choices and lack thereof, I can’t be sure of that being the design focus, and It's terrible. The lack of tactical mechanics and development is questionable. Shoulder tapping, a fundamental applied real world CQB tactic, is completely absent in Ready or Not 1.0 base game. Must you rely on your modding community to accomplish what should've been implemented in the base game to begin with? It's true with AI too, which will be covered.
Another opportunity for a mechanic not implemented is the ability to change which shoulder you hold your weapon with. 

[h1] 1.0 RELEASE [/h1]
1.0 was NOT ready. Full release was an absolute dastardly decision IMO.
What really puts it into perspective is the current state of the AI. Basically, what they said was: ""Here is our full release of Ready or Not Suspect AI! Full with insane accuracy, aimbotting, wallbanging, insane cover penetration and reflexes among other things like instantly taking and killing civilian hostages during gunfights."" The AI is just unrealistic and boring. 
Also the amount of bugs never ceases to shock and surprise me. Have fun with your clothing / accessories / helmets / vests having occasional clipping or layering issues as well. I understand that fixing things like that are very hard and may take unique innovation, but is it not worth it? Anyway, there are substantial bugs like the physics system being literally insane, making suspects throw AKs / Machine guns across the room or map, completely invalidating S runs. Doors on the ground from C2 literally bouncing around the concrete map AND teleporting the player around if stepped on. The AI can literally shoot you WITHOUT their barrel of their gun being pointed at you, even after being shot and flinching (to add insult to injury.) There are animation issues and carelessness. What the hell?? Sounds ready for a full release IMO.
I've been a bit sarcastic, so I'll be blunt; Devs have seemed quite frankly willfully stubborn towards their game and the Ready or Not community. It feels like a ""Do the devs even play the game?"" type of ordeal, and the lack of accountability from them is stunning.  I have heard that VOID likes the AI reaction times, when everyone should have been hearing ""we are sorry"". I feel if this continues or is not resolved, Ready or Not will be one of those games that had their big moment of fame (Perhaps for their advanced 1.0 SWAT Ai) but miss the mark completely and fizzle out over a period of time.

[h1] MISSIONS - From another players perspective. [/h1]
[b] “Is this game supposed to be a Police sim or a Military sim?” [/b]
“So, I get to the 32 Megabytes per second mission. [...] One barricaded suspect with a hostage in some apartment rooms. A great early mission simulating a realistic SWAT scenario. Awesome. Just what I'm looking for in a SWAT police simulator.”
“Then you start playing and it feels like you're assaulting an insurgent building in Fallujah.“
“Like...what the hell is happening? Why is half the apartment complex shooting at us? It really feels like there was some major disconnect during development”
“Honestly, it feels like this for most of the game. The VAST majority of people you deal with have no regard for their own lives and just won't surrender.""
[b] Commenters Elaborate [/b]
""I don't care that the game explains why there are 15 armed suspects in the building, this was the perfect opportunity to have a small, routine swatting mission.""
[b] My thoughts [/b]
There isn't even an official bank robbery mission, instead, all of these missions are tailored around a story basically involving and restricted to the scope of a pedophile ring, in a game that DOESN'T EVEN NEED A STORY TO BEGIN WITH.
Additionally, VOID removed the option to be able to pick different variations of certain maps/areas, such as bomb threats, active shooters, barricaded suspects etc, limiting player choice.

[h1] RON - Realistic or Not? [/h1]
While RON is generally quite realistic in many aspects, there is a lot of completely unrealistic things and weird design choices. 
This would be generally permissible  if realism was sacrificed for better gameplay, but instead, we are at a lack of both. 
There’s a lack of “ideal and logical” realism, like shoulder tapping previously mentioned, and drones instead of an unrealistic ""mirror gun"". The way long tactical equipment is carried on the back (40+ pound Ballistic shields or battering rams being carried on the back) is not a thing in real life. But I will concede on that specifically because it does have gameplay values. Here's one I haven't mentioned; GORE! The devs have surely blessed their player base of tactical realism based operators now... By making limbs and full heads and necks just come clean off due to a shotgun, regardless of range. Just *pop*. Great. That sure is realistic. Even if I didn't care for realism that much, I still wouldn't want to see it just because it's so over the top and generic. 

[h1] Breaching methods [/h1]
Making entry into locked or even just closed doors and rooms is a fundamental aspect of SWAT and Ready or Not. The thing is that Ready or Not really just neglects it entirely in many ways. Firstly is door kicking. Door kicking is still so quick and generally (VOID) of consequences that everyone simply goes to the method first, generally succeeding in 1-5 kicks. 
(Doors?) I forgot to mention... Doors are literally magic in this game! They open both ways and don't conform to door frames. 
Anyways, yeah, why use battering ram or a halligan tool (IF IT WAS ADDED) when you can just kick doors open so easily and quickly despite all the gear you are carrying.
Not only can you kick them down so easily, you can literally quietly lockpick them in seconds or one second 1 reusable deployable.
[b]HERE COMES MR BREACHING SHOTGUN!!! [/b] Open a locked door from across a hallway or perhaps a whole house, by shooting it in once or twice in the middle of the door. Just shoot it anywhere, why aim for the hinges or knob. Angle, range, placement, who even cares.

[h1] MELEE [/h1] 
SWAT operator melee / self defense is just completely absent. The only thing a SWAT operator can do is use a melee strike with a gun. But what's the point in melee if you can't strike an enemy because they are [b] [i] ""too close."" [/i] [/b]
Also, the suspects can kill you with melee, but you can't kill them. Hell, you can barely effect them at all. 

[h1] Did I miss some things? [/h1] 
Absolutely. I may have missed some things on accident, or purposefully reserved some things to not be deliberately addressed in this post. Also, edits have been made for clarity. Though, the great thing is that other great people have addressed what I have not.
[b] As such: [/b]
Shout out to Lex_ for his review which notes the AI's millisecond reaction times.
Shout out to Chris the cop for his insights, and other truly brave and honest influencers.
Shout out to Noah, Psycho, benrfn and Yngvi, and MrBread to name a few for sharing their experiences.
And a moment of silence to the new players of RON, many of which have refunded the game.

The game is laggy and stutters with every frame, making it nearly unplayable. This level of poor optimization is reminiscent of some notorious releases from EA, which is disheartening.
I cannot recommend this game in its current state. It's a shame because I can see the potential in its mechanics and concept, but the unoptimized performance overshadows any positive aspects.
Until significant improvements are made to the game's performance, I would advise against playing it Keep an eye on future updates and community feedback to see if the issues are resolved. :steamsalty::steamsalty::steamsalty:",1706235342,1706235342,False,3,1,0.485666930675506592,0,True,False,False

The AI is insane in terms of accuracy. Some enemies it makes sense for (ex special forces and the like). Others will one shot head shot you from across the map even with zero line of sight because reasons. It makes some maps extremely infuriating. Add to that ridiculous numbers of enemies (really? 17 enemies against your 5 man squad?) and there is little more than luck involved in some maps. The other big issue is enemy health. On some maps (specifically the female cult map) the enemies can take HUGE amounts of damage. I have dumped 15 rounds into an enemy and she still killed me and my squad. I have put a flash bang at enemy's feet and they still shot me and killed me in two shots. 

There is a difference between hard and unfair. This game is generally just hard but some maps it gets into the unfair. With the health issues, AI issues, and numbers issues the game is damn near impossible on large maps (enemies can just circle around you so you have to just keep clearing the same rooms constantly and eventually that last enemy will kill you in a room you already cleared twice).

All that being said the devs have said they are working on fixing these issues. Given the level of detail in this game I am positive they will fix everything and make the game perfect.

Overall, I would say that this game captures the intensity of a shootout very well. The gun mechanic is great! The maps are made very well, with a great design that is befitting of the game's style. The creativity the developers poured into this game is absolutely wonderful. That is why it saddens me to say this, but I must be honest. This game has plenty of issues, and the issues are so awful that it makes me regret buying this game that I was so excited to play. This is directly for VOID; please fix your AI! The AI in this game is incomplete, both swat and enemies. The AI in this game is extremely broken. I've had enemies snipe me with a pistol on Port Hokan while I had high ground on the tower. Enemies have shot and killed me through smoke screens; they can also easily wall-bang you at anytime. They seem to always know where you are, and they are also quite aggressive. Enemies will stupidly enter a room full of swat members and get gunned down—not very realistic, if you ask me. The enemies have all the advantage, even though it doesn't make any sense. For example, how can a street thug have the aim of a special forces operator? Maybe they go to the shooting range a lot. OK, how can literal drugged-up junkies have better aim than my own teammates? I really can just keep going with how terrible this game's AI is. Although there is a story line, the way it is presented is complete garbage. There is barely anything to connect the player and story, which ultimately makes the game feel empty. You feel afraid of the enemies because of how broken they are, even though you should feel confident since you are heavily equipped with gear and armor. Your AI teammates are useless; they are totally brainless without your command. Also, it stinks that there isn't a prone feature; the crouching and movement feel too slow. Which doesn't make sense since, in real-life combat situations, you need to be able to move fast or slowly depending on the situation, but in this incomplete game, the only option is slow. Although there are aspects of the game that are great, the problems outweigh the good. Until VOID manages to fix its AI problem and add actual realistic features, I do not recommend this misleading game.

9/10 gameplay

This game is brutal to the core to say the least, one mistake and it will punish you with instant death and make you start the map from scratch. Love it <3
Enemies shoot through walls! Enemies perfect accuracy! However, both points you gotta love and i think that's what makes this game stand out to me ~ Its a challenge.
I can see myself downloading map mods for this game to carry me until the next update.

6/10 teamwork (This will increase when i play with friends).

Teamwork for me makes a game, i like games with lots of teamwork and communication.
Sometimes the bots are stupid, not doing as they are asked, getting in your way.. running out into the other end of a loaded shotgun pointed at their face - even if its mine :)
Playing the game with AI is a little sad to say the least and i cannot wait for playing the game with friends. I feel with friends this game is going to be epic.
I have seen mods for voice commanding the bots which i think should be a standard feature for the game, this would bring this game to the next level of team based AI game.

7/10 features

I feel the feature of personalising your char and weapons is a little slack, don't get me wrong the customisation that you can do so far is almost perfect but with a little push it would be perfect.
OK i know mods will change that but devs, add more shiZ, your char clothes list should be endless this will let us differ between who is who ingame, even with the bots i like to have different skins for what equipment the bots play, but with friends this is a must IMO.
Gun customisation is something i look for in a game too, i know the guns can have attachments on them but let us really customise or guns, let us position which side a flashlight is on and have a lazer on the other if we wish.. BUT punish us with weapon weight ~ ADS speed will be slower etc. (I want to have both, i get scared in the dark and i want lazer because i cant aim for shiZ.

Interesting level design and gameplay that forces you to take a slow, calculated approach to completing the objective. However, as someone who plays only single payer the AI is infuriating. Teammates continually seem to ignore commands, neglect to detain suspects and civilians, and when clearing an area often extend too far in passing open doorways where enemies could be located. This basically forces you to do everything yourself with the teammates used only as decoys and additional firepower (even then they cant be trusted).  Warning enemies prior to engaging risks them spinning 180 degrees and killing you instantly, but engaging without prior warning results in a penalty. Using the AI overhaul mod helps a little towards slowing enemy reaction times.

I'm currently experiencing a bug on the level Elephant where despite disarming the bombs the timer continues to run and detonates only killing me even when well clear of the explosive. Its only when I'm dead does Talk come over the radio confirming all bombs defused. Having bombs on this mission at all seems a really strange choice!

It has great potential but until it improves upon some fundamental issues I cannot recommend paying full price for this incomplete game.

Ready or Not is an intense SWAT-simulator where you are given a wide range of tools to take control of high-stakes situations and need to make split-second decisions in order to succeed. At least, that’s what it wants to be.

It upsets me to leave this game a negative review since had I left one about a year ago, when I first played the game in Early Access, it would have been positive. However, in its current state the game feels more flawed and incomplete than it felt prior to its official release and I sincerely hope the devs turn this around so I can enjoy the game RoN should be and recommend it to others in good faith.

The two biggest issues that sour my experience with the game at the moment are the shallow, unfun enemy AI and the shoddy implementation of new features.

When I first played RoN dealing with suspects was stressful but exciting. I had to cautiously choose the tools I used to deal with them, pay attention to their every move to prevent bloodshed and carefully assess when lethal force was necessary. After the 1.0 release however, every suspect, regardless of their background, became a battle hardened death machine that will shred you to bits in a split second if you don’t respond with violence immediately upon entering their line of sight. Many complain about the difficulty, which is fair since you’re playing against actual aimbots, but that’s not what ruins the experience for me. I don’t mind a challenge, but the new overpowered AI is far less fun to deal with even when you manage to beat it. This is because earlier you had to try and defuse the situation, then shoot if left with no other options. Now you shoot first, then try to apprehend the suspects if they’re still breathing. The intensity of confronting unpredictable suspects has been replaced with a repetitive test of reaction speed.

The new features that I have a gripe with are mostly related to the world-building and environmental storytelling of Ready or Not, which I found very intriguing upon my first contact with the game. The maps are extremely detailed, tell very little but show a lot. The official release introduced mission briefings which provide more context for the individual scenarios, but for some reason are highly inconsistent with the gameplay. Some are out of order, some make false claims (There is one example where this is intentional, but in other cases it doesn’t seem to be purposeful), not to mention the typos. It feels like the writers and programmers got the same prompt, made the brief and level separately and didn’t bother to cross-reference the two. Noticing these discrepancies really kills the immersion which is a key selling point of the game. There is also a prevalence of AI generated images littered across the new maps. It’s really disappointing to see the detailed environment downplayed by ugly, uninspired artificial “art” plastered on the walls. I also believe this is against Steam’s ToS, so I’m puzzled as to why the devs would risk getting their game removed instead of getting an artist to make some extra textures, especially since they managed to make the rest of the game look great without AI.

In regards to new gameplay elements there is now a career mode, which was clearly not thought through. It does pretty much nothing to enhance the gameplay, only results in pointless micromanagement and ultimately wastes a lot of your time. It seems that, for some reason, the devs rushed to release the game when they did, and did not take time to quality control the new additions.

When it comes to optimization, overall it’s not bad, I could run the game decently on a not so powerful rig, but there still are issues that need addressing. If I consistently had poor performance I could blame it on my PC, but if I have 60 FPS on one side of a room and 20 FPS on the other there is clearly something wrong here.

In general, Ready or Not has solid foundations, but until these problems are resolved I cannot consider this game “fully released” and recommend someone pays triple A price for this incomplete product.",1706213842,1706213842,False,1,1,0.502060472965240479,0,True,False,False

However, the one issue I have is the suspect AI. It seems like VOID gave them enhanced reflexes and the ability to shoot through walls that's impossible for the average human to react to and shoot.

Why? It doesn't feel any good; in fact, it gets irritating after you go through levels when there's tight space and one of your teammates gets in the way, and then you die because of that. To fix this, I had to download a mod called No Crack for AI from Nexus Mods to make the AI surrender and not be a superhuman, so at very least it's fun to play, but that's a band-aid fix that developers should have already done themselves before the ""1.0 update"" if it wasn't for their laziness and incompetence.

So, in the end, I like this update so far, except for the suspect AI. It needs to be balanced.

=====================================================================================

Original: I have been playing this game sporadically since July 2022, and while the AI has improved slightly over time, it still requires a significant overhaul to enhance the overall experience. Currently, I am unable to recommend this game.

though the bots do work fine for the first half of all of the maps, they do not do their job properly in bigger and more complex layouts. Normally when you want them to flash a room after opening a door, they do it just fine, but when the door is facing a wall on the other side, the bots do not try to throw the flash around, or bounce it deeper into the room, which results in their death when running into a single gunman, this limits your choice to throwing the flash by yourself, or enter the room with a shield, just so you can be consistent in achieving a high score. mean while, there's a nice mechanic where you can queue up commands so you can leave your bots and remotely tell them to do something, which allows you do execute nice entries that are satisfying, but this queuing of commands works in a poor fashion, this is because when you are looking through another doorway, and execute the queued command, the bots for no damned reason do the command on the door you are looking at instead of their door you already told them to post up on, this can be avoided by looking away from doorways when executing the queue, but because of how complex the maps can get, there could be doorways all around you and you just might accidentally execute the bug. lastly, it's the most annoying and infuriating aspect of the bots, which is that sometimes, they just stand around and do absolutely NOTHING when you give them a new command, while you can fix this by telling them to follow you and repeating the desired command again (turning the machine on and off again), EVEN THAT doesn't always work and the bots just stand there, being completely brain dead, which lead to many avoidable deaths that I have came across.

there are more nit picks about the bots, but these are the most egregious ones, and greatly limits player choice when trying to avoid using these mechanics as much as possible. I tried to find people who play the game and tries to get high scores and communicate, but the demographic that I played with in public lobbies generally do not know/understand swat tactics, and or just wants to gun everyone down, mean while I cannot find a clan that is within my timezone and aligns with my playstyle. If you are looking for a tactical experience, this game will do fine even in singleplayer, just be wary of your bot's capabilities and plan accordingly, and I hope these kinks will be ironed out in future patches.",1705740779,1706203754,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

There are many glaring issues and the 1.0 release felt like just an other EA patch. The devs also seem reluctant to acknowledge any fault, which is very bizarre.

Suspect AI is unrealistic and 1 dimensional. Every type of suspect from crackhead, to veteran, to teenagers robbing a store all act the same suicidal way. They will rush you down, they will fake surrender and they will 360 no scope you with the precision of an elite sniper.

Civilian AI is static as fuck. It seems they are supposed to be able to hide, yet they never do. They stand in place until you show up and yell for compliance, thats about it.

Swat AI is extremely robotic with zero decision making of their own. They feel like 4 roombas with guns that you control. They won't move to help you if you get shot, they won't hide if they are taking fire, they won't use the equipement you give them unless you specifically tell them to, its quite sad.

""S"" rank, which means a perfect score for a map, is ruined by the fact you need to go non-lethal, in a map not designed for non-lethal. No non-lethal sidearm options and if you remove all sidearm ammo they will still swap to their empty sidearm and get stuck with it, unable to do anything. All non-lethal primary cannot penetrate or break windows, yet swat AI will shoot at windows regardless, while getting destroyed by suspects with guns that do penetrate windows. Some enemies with just suicide across the map, which means a suspect will be dead, which means you cannot get ""S"" anymore. This is somewhat a problem since cosmetics are locked behind ""S"" rank.

Still a lot of bugs left and right and optimisation isn't great.

Once you get past that initial layer of polish though, you'll realize just how half-baked and unfinished the core game is. 

Plenty of reviews have brought up how unfairly accurate and suicidally aggressive the enemy AI is - tracking you through walls, seeing you through smoke, refusing to surrender no matter how many guns are pointed at them - but your teammate SWAT AI is just as frustrating. They're hardcoded to a horrible degree, to the extent that they will clear a particular room in the exact same manner, following the exact same paths every time, even if enemies are firing at them or are in the way. If they have decided to restrain an enemy, there is no way for you to cancel that order or force them to fall back. In general, you can't even interrupt their current actions without running the risk of them bugging out and ignoring the next couple of commands you give them afterwards, which makes the entire system ridiculously tedious and inflexible during gameplay. 

The big selling point of the singleplayer ""Commander"" mode - managing a roster of SWAT officers and making sure their mental health doesn't crack from the missions you send them on - is also buggy and lackluster. Several officer abilities don't work. The mental health system is little more than a number on each officer that ticks up or down after a mission. Even more frustrating is that officer mental health takes the biggest hits from killing enemies on missions; this might fit thematically, but when every enemy always does their best to die by SWAT, it simply ends up punishing you for doing what the game, by default, forces you to do. As a result, playing Commander mode is practically no different than playing standalone missions with friendly bots, and is overall a worse experience because of the conflicting gameplay systems present.

However, I think the biggest problem with Ready or Not is that VOID Interactive comes across as a studio that has simply just checked out of their project. The current state of the game is what they advertised as 1.0, their full release, and yet it came with so many bugs that a basic QA pass would have caught immediately. This is a studio that, for whatever reason, decided to use a laughably poor AI to generate subtitles for voicelines, remove completed maps and gamemodes for ""narrative purposes"", and has a long list of features and promises that were brought up at one point and then never mentioned again. I have zero confidence that they will continue to support the game past the first half of 2024, especially since it's already spent years in Early Access prior to the 1.0 release.

But, the game can be very buggy at times.

As well the aim of the suspects can be pretty annoying, with the suspects aiming primarily for the arms and legs instead of your armor. Or dying from 2 shots even though you haven't taken damage. Other than the negatives the game is a fun fps shooter with a more tactical point of view than the regular fps.

TL;DR: Game is great, But there are a few bugs and design choices that can be annoying.

Edit:The game has become worse. Prior to my review I had naively believed the devs would listen to the community. But, as I have seen with new updates and notes about the game, the devs have clearly not paid much attention to their own community. As of right now the game is hot garbage for fixes and playability. To fix the game from jumping from 60 fps to 2 I had to lower the graphical settings to low, as well I must run vsync to satiate the fps problems. If I were to give advice for fixing your game just mod the game, the ai has become unfightable without flash-bangs or steel plates and a shield. And due to the new 1.0 update removing different modes such as barricaded suspects and raid and so on, if you were to shoot first you gain a penalty against your final score.

I have mixed bud more of positive feelings about the game and it's ""1.0"". Tldr its the spiritual succesor to SWAT games and the game is good but it has few issues and it should be left in the oven for a little more.

 Let's write some points for new and interested people and then get to the changes and opinions:

Positives:
+Great gunplay
+Tactical action and variety of tools
+Capable friendly AI for SP mode
+Immersion
+Atmosphere
+Enviromental story telling
+Soundtrack and sound desing
+Various maps and locations (gas stations, crack houses, hotels, luxurious villas, cult compounds...)
+Balls for the realism and severity of depicted crimes (CP, human trafficing, drugs, domestic terrorism, ""active shooters in educational location""...) and managing doing it respectfully without any glorification
+Graphics
+Every gun and tool has it's use

Negatives:
-Enemy suspect AI (it needs a little bit tinkering from devs, suspects are still too like terminators, the devs are working on it but it will take time)
-Basic and barebone weapon customisation, you can only put optic, foregrip and one illuminating attachement on gun (might change in future)
-Optimalisation (It's improving but it's still not there)
-A little bit clunky movement system
-Singleplayer mode is micromanagement heavy (this is personal negative)
-Some guns and tools while useful are very situational
-Rare visual glitches
-Some maps have multiple spawn locations but the selection works only sometimes and only on some of the maps.
-Game is limited for 5 players at the time (can be resolved with mods)
-Poor modding integration

Now changes and personal opinions:

What changed in 1.0 since early access version? A lot. There is new hub police station, new and better shooting range, new maps, few new weapons, new visual customisation system, reworked friendly AI, new sound system, new singleplayer mode, new immersive tablet (with briefings and maps during pregame lobby and with map and objectives during the missions) ability to command civilians and surrendering suspects, the Hotel map was removed, other maps were modified/reworked/improved etc. 

What should changed but wasn't? Enemy suspect AI, it's a little bit better than old john wick terminator from EA versions but its still borderline cheating (flawless accuracy, hyper agressive and almost suicidal, hearing that would beat even bats, no recoil, tracking through walls, resistant to damage, inhuman reflexes, sketchy animations - suspects often snap from stun to shooting in miliseconds...), weapon customisation (same barebone system from EA days, and it's sometimes broken). 

Personally I like the new version of RoN, it is an improvement but it's not perfect and there are some missed opportunities (some might be done later). Look for example at streamer map. It could be ""just an accidental swatting"" with streamer and like one or two suspects guarding the farm but NO we got like 10 highly agressive teenagers with shotguns and AKs plus the streamer (who is always at the same place btw)

What could be improved/changed? Already mentioned weapon customisation and suspect AI. More and new tactical tools like camera drones (there is already system wich shows headcams in the tablet, just make it use the drones camera too) and I don't mean those silly cameras on wheels from ""tactical"" game wich I don't dare to name here. There are loadouts for guns and gear but not for visual customisation wich is a miss. There is no idicator what is player's best rank on the mission during the mission select ( if you want to know which missions you already completed on S-rank the best dyi solution for now is checking the tatoo customisation sice tatoos are rewards for S-ranks) wich could be added to the briefing (like a new tab that would show all players ranking on selected map). Make lights on the shield actually work. I know and understand why was taser moved to tactical from secondary slot and I like that decision but what is stupid is that now we cannot equip shield and tazer together.",1641823651,1706119313,True,3,0,0.528588533401489258,0,True,False,True

The game recently released, but it's still buggy. Devs are actively working on fixing the bugs, but it's still not uncommon to have AI shoot you through walls and completely ignore any injuries. Besides, bots have a complete lack of fear and will get up to try and stab you even if they have 5 lethal weapons pointing at them. There is enough content, a LOT of detailed maps (plus mod support) and weapons (however, a lot of the guns feel the same, there are like 10 copy/paste AR-15s with a slightly different barrel lenghth and stock design). The game also most certainly lacks a difficulty selector, as right now a lot of the maps simply feel unfair.",1706116664,1706116664,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Graphically its kinda heavy so a good pc is recommended.
In single player your own bots will absolutely light you up if you are between them and a hostile which makes missions like Brisa Cove and the Mindjot data center borderline impossible.
Enemy AI wallbangs like they're in a competitive Rainbow Six Seige match.
Related to the previously mentioned problem, the enemy AI sometimes detects you from 3-4 walls away and will start shooting you not like they hit you due to 4 walls being there.
Also Enemy AI also don't give a shit if they live or die (of course the crackheads are understandable) but the Mindjot data center guys will rush you like zombies in cod knowing damn well there are 5 armored S.W.A.T. officers armed to the teeth that just obliterated his buddy because he took to long in putting his hands in the air.

All in all fun game but too annoying to keep playing due to the AI being way too aimbotty I get that trained security personnel will hit their shots but not to be able to see me trough 3-4 walls.

Your AI Swat team often do not follow commands to breach or enter and clear a room, or sometimes one guy will inexplicably  wander off for no reason (forcing you to track them down) and they have a tendency to give away your position by yelling at civilians and AI baddies who are meters away and behind closed doors. 

AI baddies still blindly shoot through walls, in many cases with pin point accuracy, they will, in the blink of an eye, 180 snap shoot directly to your head, Doors can be checked repeatedly for booby traps, using both wand and peaking the door, with none being found but as soon as you open the door, it will unexpectedly explode. 

Any one of these issues occurring periodically could be ignored but these issues occur regularly and as stated at the beginning that should not happen with a game at this price point. Most can be fixed using mods, like the AI overhaul mod (which is terrific), but some issues still remain even with that mod and for the average player, in my opinion, this ruins the game. 

I hope the Devs are working on fixing these and many other issues and I will still most likely continue playing, but primarily because I spent $50.00 on the game. Until these issues are resolved you should not spend the money....unless you are drawn to the grind or intrigued by the challenges described above...then have at it.

The AI alone has driven me to the point of writing this review, both enemy and allied. Enemies are gods with the ability to one tap you through 16 inch concrete pillars with 9mm handguns while you wear full body armor consistently. 

Your allies hardly qualify for parking meter maids with nerf guns.

There are countless videos on this topic with plenty of evidence to support this, go look for yourself. In my playtime alone I actually ran out of disk space from saving so many clips of me getting killed through the map, AI teammates dying to a surrendering suspect right in front of the whole team.

Situations in RoN range from raiding small-time arms manufacturers to drug busts to active shooters at public locations. Though a fun and intense game, a lot of deaths are more frustrating than fun, and the more I played RoN, the more I realized a lot of gameplay includes game-breaking flaws instead of one-off glitches are incidents.

[b][u]Customization:[/u][/b]
RoN offers a lot of different weapons and loadout choices, including primary weapons and secondary weapons, armor, lethal and less-lethal weapons,  and a variety of tools/deployables. I enjoyed utilizing different loadouts depending on the scenario, but it also wasn't always clear on first playthrough which levels would be better with which loadout types.

The effectiveness of each deployable seemed to be very inconsistent, resulting in many cases where a stinger grenade can go off right on top of an enemy and yet they end up not effected at all by the blast. This often results in needless deaths of you and your team that get frustrating.

In order to receive the maximum score on a map, nobody, including enemy combatants, can die in the mission. Therefore, the only way to receive a perfect score is to utilize less-lethal weapons and deployables. However, there are many levels where utilizing less-lethals doesn't even make sense, most of all terrorist attacks.

Armor selections mean less slots for ammo and deployables, and the type of armor each has their benefits and drawbacks. However, it isn't directly clear from the descriptions of which armor type actually offers the better survivability (and under which scenarios), so that level of customization doesn't necessarily help.

Lastly, the game allows you to change the look of your character and what clothes they wear under all the armor, etc. I [i]was[/i] a little disgusted that you could unlock a wristband to wear that matched the wristbands worn by shot-up patrons of a nightclub during an active shooter/terrorist attack. I know it's ""just a game"", but that was a tasteless addition.

[b][u]Missions[/u][/b]
The types of missions vary, which also means the size of the maps, the types of enemies and their loadouts, and the overall design. The missions are generally grouped to follow connected storylines. It's fun seeing how the success of one mission can produce evidence that leads to another mission down the road.

Within the missions, you can encounter varying amounts of enemies and civilians. And the locations where enemies and civilians spawn is varied, forcing you to take caution each time and not just ""memorize"" enemy locations. Certain missions can also include explosive traps on doors or bombs that must be defused within a time limit. These add another element of caution and tactics required to successfully navigate a mission without dying.

Missions with active shooters means that the enemies will try to kill civilians sometimes. Receiving an S on a level requires all civilians to survive. However the AI can sometimes decide to kill a civilian instantly. You can get lucky and the civilian is only incapacitated instead of dead, but that is truly luck of the draw.

[b][u]Enemy AI[/u][/b]
Although there are many different enemy types dependent on the level the behavior and capabilities of the enemy AI is one of the biggest issues with RoN. Even with mods that change those behaviors and capabilities, the Enemy AI is often way too powerful.

Enemies can detect you, turn around, acquire their target, shoot, and accurately hit you (often killing you or putting you in bleed status) before you can even react to their presence. Their accuracy is insane, whether they are shooting a long distance or actively moving fast while firing a machine gun. When first playing, I thought some of my deaths were luck of the draw that I or a teammate got killed so quickly, but after playing almost 50 hours it's clear that the AI is just too good sometimes. Regardless of enemy type faced, they all seem to be professional shooters with godly reaction times, which is very frustrating.

In order to successfully take an enemy out of the fight, you must kill them, incapacitate them, or arrest them. Incapacitated enemies can actually be faking it and end up standing back up. So cuffing an incapacitated enemy is a must. To arrest an enemy, you have to shout them down. Most of the time, enemies will not surrender just to shouting. Hitting them with less lethal munitions or deployables,will usually result in them surrendering. However, enemies can choose to stand back up and continue the fight with a sidearm or knife. So you need to keep your eye on surrendered enemies and arrest them ASAP. My biggest gripe with this behavior, similar to the issue with AI shooting ability, is there isn't variety between enemy combatants. A meth addict is just as likely to un-surrender and attack you again as professional security. The behavior of enemies just doesn't always match the type of combatant, and, currently, the rate of enemies standing back up after surrendering is extremely high.

[b][u]Friendly AI[/u][/b]
If you are playing the single player mode you command a team of 4 SWAT members. Utilizing the Friendly AI can be important as they are just as capable as the enemy AI at shooting. However, the AI design is overall very poor and glitchy, often in ways that gets you or them killed.

AI often enter the room in a stupid manner. The AI will often enter a room and turn their back to the one opening, giving enemies the chance to shoot them repeatedly in the back. Other times, an area is big enough that the AI will spread out and clear different parts of the area alone instead of in tandem, putting each individual member more at risk of dying to enemies they encounter. Lastly, once they have cleared a room of all active combatants, it's important for them to arrest suspects. Unfortunately, many times their pathing or command glitches, and they'll just leave people uncuffed. As I mentioned with the enemy AI, they are able to surrender and then decide to stand back up and fight. Even directly commanding your AI to arrest suspects often glitches out so that your teammates ignore the command.

Lastly, the AI does not know how to properly handle open doors in a room. Once they've cleared the current room, they require another command to move to the next room before continuing and will just stand still. If an enemy in the next room spots them through the doorway, they will kill your teammate while they just stand there and die.

[b][u]Conclusion[/u][/b]
Overall, I've enjoyed the game a lot as a tactical shooter, including playing the single player mode and playing with friends online. However, the current design of the game includes too many issues to recommend the game to anyone, especially at $50. Enemy AI are too powerful at times, regardless of ""who"" they are. Friendly AI are poorly programmed and prone to glitches. The core gameplay is pretty good, though, and a lot of thought went into designing most levels. Many improvements are required to put the game at a place where I'd recommend it to others.

-Great ""realistic"" Swat simulator
-Gun play
-Damage simulation for body parts
-Loadout modification from guns to body armor type
-single player with team member management (could be deeper than just managing and putting to therapy)
- a blast to play with friends
-traps and hiding (would like to have more scenarios and AI behaviors like that)

Negative:
- Stutters especially when first time playing new maps.  
- spectating other team members camera while still alive tanks the frame rate.
- Caliber description/effectiveness (like difference between SOME and SERVICEABLE. Could be clearer.)
- Friendly AI breaks down:
->Refusing to move or do orders, cannot go around you if they are ordered to do something and the player is in their path even if there is enough room.
-> sometimes going to ordered place while walking backwards and getting shot at the back of their head.
-> sometimes fails to cover player or each other when hostile run outs through the door even if stacked on the same door and/or getting killed without firing a shot.
-> often doesn't take cover on bigger maps like hospital and gets gunned downed while standing in the middle of the hall way.
-> On hospital map bots don't move on stacks on long corridors and advance to far from the party and gets killed.

-Enemy AI
-> inhuman reflexes, sometimes shoot you before their animations are done. (like turning around and shooting).
-> sometimes feels like the bots hit boxes doesn't register or dosen't have an effect even if 2 to 3 party members dump a hole mag on target with AR. 
-> bots flinch when taking damage irregularly. like when shooting their leg of with shotgun and they still walk on pair of bones (and probably kill you).

Hopeful improvement ideas:
- Performance
-AI (fixes and new tactics behavior)
-More guns and calibers, Longer barrels to improve velocity and stopping power etc.
-More maps
-Revive system (friendlies could go unconscious and be patched up by a friendly. Or hostiles could even take a friendly as hostage if unconscious). -Dragging system to pull them to cover like on squad.
- A backpack to get ammo and utility gear when not playing on full MP squad. You simply run out of stuff when playing less than a full party because of limited inventory slots. Why not have a backpack compensating for the missing team members. Of course you would have to take of the bag off and look into the bag to get more equipment which leaves you vulnerable. 
- More in depth SP story than just debriefs or officer lore texts.",1706045321,1706045321,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Solo play is fun for the first 3 missions until you get to the big complex maps where your AI teammates struggle to do anything because every room has an ambush or an enemy always flanking your AI and killing them.

Multiplayer is unplayable 99% of matches I've ever joined in Ready or Not over the course of Alpha to Early Access to Full Release have always been either a votekick immediately upon joining or a teamkill the moment the match starts.

So why not play with friends? Good luck convincing 3 other friends to buy this $50 game.


This is not a successor to SWAT 4. In Ready or Not the game tricks you into thinking this is gonna be a realistic shooter but in reality the enemy AI acts like CS:GO bots that will laser you down the moment they see you and it forces the player to treat the game like you're playing Rainbow 6 Siege. AI needs to be tweaked so that they actually start acting like scared gangsters and robbers and less like a bunch of armed to the teeth militants. Granted, there are levels that fit the aesthetic of you fighting against more well trained groups, but for most levels the AI should not be so insanely well trained.",1639966386,1706034818,False,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

The game is fun and frustrating.

Now that the game is released, they messed up the AI and now they are all John Wick and will kill you through walls with a Makarov. It's crazy to have some Joe Schmoe in street clothes be a tactical genius who can track you through walls. AI has such insane reaction time and accuracy making peeking nigh impossible and sometimes they will shake off stuns (Flashbangs, etc) instantly or not be effected at all. 

The maps are beautiful and polished, but they are so cluttered and often times AI will see and shoot you through obstacles you won't be able to, which exacerbates the AI issues. Furthermore, the piss poor grenade physics makes these obstacles a pain in the ass to make sure your grenade goes where you want it. 

Don't touch the mods if you plan on playing with other people, even touching the screen will prevent you from connecting to other people unless you get the exact same mods. If you do, make sure to delete all the mods/mod folder.

So let's talk about the campaign, it sucks. That's about it, the game doesn't have an overarching 'plot', the characters feel stiff as hell because they are, and pretty much everyone in the fucking game has 0 personality, from teammates to suspects.
Speaking of teammates, what VOID doesn't realise is that the reason why we loved them back in SWAT 4 was that we didn't have to switch between a bunch of nobodies every 2 missions because 'oh no I shot someone', and I understand that Ready or Not has a significantly 'darker' tone than SWAT 4 but god damn, the officers have about as much personality as a fucking sandpaper. There is no banter between teammates, only one-liners that... aren't even noticeable, I mean holy shit you have to have certain members JUST to get one extra line of dialogue on some maps. VOID cannot humanize neither civilians, nor your teammates nor anyone else, it just sucks. And it's directly a result of the game taking itself way too seriously.
Games either oughta have Marvel-esque writing or try too hard to be as gritty as possible, gritty as long as it doesn't cut their sales of course.
The mission designs are not faring any better here... they're very forgettable, like super forgettable. The soundtrack is a downgrade compared to the 5 tracks that were available in early access surprisingly, the 'lore' is dogwater, so really this game doesn't have much going on for it... except the gunplay.
So it's just a glorified COD campaign but only the tactical bits and we're not fighting Russians (not exclusively at least) for once.

In my opinion, it's a 3 out of 5 stars, UNTIL they can optimize this game. BUT it has POTENTIAL to be a 5 out of 5. Some of the issues include...

SWAT AI
-I don't get where people are saying that the swat AI are ""massively"" improved. They are still just as dumb. The only things that have changed is their stacking (which is still bad), and will USUALLY gather evidence/ arrest on their own, meaning sometimes they will outright not do this. A lot of times, when gathering/ arresting, they will completely walk into danger just to do this, such as stepping in line of fire, standing in doorways, walking into uncleared areas, etc, which will usually get them killed. Their stacking has improved somewhat. The actual stack looks okay, but they only sometimes provide coverage. There are times where the AI are ""covering"" a doorway, and an enemy AI outright kills one of the swat members from the inside room, so another swat member fills that position, providing empty ""coverage"" and does nothing to react to the enemy that is standing in the corner of the swat AI's view. A lot of the time, their ""coverage"" isn't really coverage. During stacking they will also over-expose themselves into the doorway, allowing enemy AI to just full auto into them. 

- SWAT AI constantly get in your way, and now they will also tell YOU, that you are in their way. You can have them stack, but if you want to be the first man in, you have to work around them, because if you get in their ""spot"" they will not shut up about how you are in their way. Once you give command to open and clear, they will not do so because one of the swat members are not in their ""position"". So if you wanna be first man in, you gotta either awkwardly work around them, or have them stack on the opposite side of you, which then exposes your back in a lot of areas. They will also get stuck in random places, trapping you in the process, this happens a lot in doorways.

- SWAT AI will get stuck and not follow commands. You can tell them to stack up, and they will not do so at random times. Then you have to switch between ""fall in"" and ""stack up"" a few times until they finally listen to the command. This obviously takes unnecessary time, and is super annoying when you are trying to get into a room quickly.

- SWAT animation is wayyy too slow. It takes them much longer than it should to stack, check if door is unlocked, open door, and then breach. Each specific animation takes too much time, especially when opening the door, they will take too much time opening the door, which allows them to be shot while in the animation to open door. Swat AI also does not follow each other close enough, leaving gaps when breaching. They will trail too far behind you, leaving you exposed constantly. It's more like ""follow the leader"" rather than them covering different sectors. 

- Swat will constantly shoot in full auto, and completely empty their pistol, only to barely hit the enemy AI, but will somehow accidentally kill any nearby innocent. If enemy AI takes a hostage, swat will not think twice to full auto into innocent, killing them, then full auto into enemy. 

-Swat AI will tend to bug out, and wander off on their own, into random parts of the map for no reason, getting themselves killed, which then leaves you with no clue what happened to them until you stumble upon their body. When clearing, they tend to over-extend into uncleared areas, with too many different angles to cover on their own, overwhelming themselves and getting killed. They sometimes will clear areas in an awkward manner, walking in backwards and unable to react to a threat until they turn around.  

LIGHTING ISSUES
- In almost every map, there is this ridiculous amount of blinding haze created by lights/sunshine. Which blinds you to the point where you can't even see what's in front of you, which gets you killed.

- Red dots are almost useless. The dot is so dim you can't even see it and effectively use it, this is a problem I have brought up to the devs before.

-Flashlights are too dim and narrow, almost as if they want this to be a horror game rather than a realistic-tactical shooter. Modern weapon lights are very bright and have a wide amount of coverage, capable of flooding an entire room with light. 

- Night vision is almost useless, in dark areas there will still be unnecessary dark shadows that should not be there when using nvg's. 

ENEMY AI
- Enemy AI are all cracked out, capable of spinning 360 degrees and shooting you in the head instantly. I've had enemy's do this to me and swat AI with a pistol.

-Half the time, enemy AI will completely ignore a flashbang or c2 charge, even if they were right next to the detonation.

- Enemy AI is incredibly accurate, capable of shooting full auto from across the map, and effectively hitting you with almost every round.

- Enemy AI will react through even the smallest opening, shooting any moment a single pixel of you is exposed.

- Enemy AI will shrug off rifle rounds. I have died while shooting them center mass with a 556 rifle, only for them to not feel a thing and walk straight towards me and kill me. Other times I will shoot them, they kinda ""bend over"" in pain, then to get up and shoot back, running away as if they are totally uninjured. 

- Enemy AI will constantly know where you are at, capable of hearing you from multiple rooms away, and knowing the exact spot you are standing in.

CONSTANT FRAME DROP AND STUTTERING
-The game is not optimized, no matter what you do to the settings, the game constantly will stutter and have massive frame rate drop, The game needs to be better optimized.

VOID DOES NOT LISTEN TO IT'S CUSTOMERS
- They got rid of great map's that were fun to play, as well as the option to choose different scenarios for that map, which would give you different locations to play on, in specific maps. Original hotel and it's secondary map for barricaded suspect. Original port map with its secondary map for bomb threat and hostage rescue. The original farm map. The fast food map (which was a work in progress). There was no reason to remove these. 

Overall the game is fun to play, however there are a lot of annoying issues with it. I don't believe this game was ready for an official release, and needed a lot more work prior to the official release. As of now I give 3 out of 5 stars.",1705560048,1705992737,False,5,2,0.5469169020652771,0,True,False,False

You also cannot filter for servers or see servers or anything. some people run mods that you dont want to play, but it is not possible to see what mods or settings are being used in any hosted games that you join. this game also doesn't feel like 1.0 and should still be in early beta - the AI just isn't polished. The game is absolutely not worth $50, probably closer to $15. It is very fun at first, but then becomes extremely underwhelming. The player characters movement is also illogical at times, and again, makes this game feel very much like a beta game. STEAM should have more regulation regarding alpha/beta/1.0 completed games.

i also just need to add that the overall mechanics of the game really need more polishing. It REALLY feels like an alpha or early beta just on those grounds alone - like very basic character movement etc. Very surprising as bad as it is, given how easy it is to implement these days in development. 

Unfortunately, the player base can also be exceedingly toxic; there is proxy chat and sometimes the racism/sexism and overall really ugly vulgarities are just too much. unfortunately, there is no way to report players or anything, so people can say and do whatever they want.

Game is janky and need a lot of tweak from our consumers side to make it work. Both in perfomance and AI. I had to research to run the game better and rely on mods to play with a decent AI. Those are not hallmarks for 1.0 release. Void is complacent. They should have playtested this.

Also RON 1.0 got cut a lot of content that was available during EA. Different map layouts, suspect placements are missing. New redesign maps are hugely underwhelming and pretentious as hell. RON is game of missing fundamental pillars. 

Still one the good game in its own class for realistic tactical games when it comes to sounds, gun designs and cqb tactics especially back in EA but I don't recommend for new players.

- RTX3070
- 32GB RAM

Thoughts after playing the full game or 1.0 patch:
I loved this game when it was Early Access, now that it's full (sort of) I love it even more.
I don't care what anybody says, I don't encounter that many bugs and glitches. Now I'm not saying they're not there. You will come across bugs and glitches but what game doesn't have bugs or glitches? In my opinion triple A games are even worse sometimes. 
But we're not here to talk about triple A games. 
I wanna talk about Ready or Not and thank the developers for making me feel that special feeling when I played masterpieces that gaming companies used to make in the 90s or 2000s.
Most games today are so simple that it doesn't matter which one you get, you have three objectives: Grind, Rank up, Be competitive.
Ready or Not is not like most games today and most gamers wouldn't like this game because they're so used to ""Run and gun"" or ""Team-Deathmatch meta"". In simple words games today have made people lazy, they just want to compete and prove the weaker person they're better and tell the better player to get a life.
In Ready or Not you don't grind, you learn to survive and keep your teammates alive. 
You don't rank up, you gain knowledge and make better strategies the next mission or the next restart. 
You don't compete, you learn teamwork and how important it is to work together, if you try to go solo you or your team won't make it till the end of the mission.
This game does have problems, yes. But they don't bother me because there's way more pros than cons, at least for me. What I'm trying to say is, if you're like me and you still want to play a game that isn't about who has a higher KD or who has a higher rank, or which strat is better now and where you can relax without anybody fighting in the chat, this game is for you. Because at the end of the day you can play this game every day or once in a while, at the end of it we all have one objective.

The suspect AI is such a thing that makes me question if 1.0 was rushed and isn't worth getting until they fix it. The thumbs down will stay until its patched.

This is a natural sequel to the old SWAT series, and the realism and story telling through the different maps is very good! Highly recommend to anyone who likes the slower pace of tactical shooters, be it ARMA or SWAT 4. It might feel too slow for COD players, but when the proverbial feces hits the spinny thing, you gotta think, move and act fast!


Edit: 360, wallbanging, noscope, aimbot Suspect AI is just infuriating - Devs have a way to go to make the AI actually act like human beings with self preservation in mind. I get it if we are up against a coked out druggie that would storm you, but giving the same ""class"" aimbot and wallhacks doesnt make any sense. Same with your regular hoodlum being the second coming of John Wick and not fearing for their life while staring down the barrel of 5 SWAT officers yelling for compliance.

For that alone, I recommend it. The new 1.0 version is a giant leap forward for the playability of the game. Despite this, I think there are some QoL improvement to be made. Here are a few:

1. The post-mission status report (i.e. grading screen) should be skippable. Having to sit through the whole grading, particularly for more difficult missions, becomes tiresome.
2. Related to the above, players should be able to ""replay"" mission without having to jump back to the HQ and then reload the map. I think this whole process should be optional in case players want to make loadout/squad modifications.
3. There is a glitch with the flashlight on the Pepperball gun. I select laser and it still runs the flashlight.
4. The AI are incredibly quick, accurate, and can see/shoot through walls. Their reaction time needs to be lowered, because as it stands they can turn and shoot you in less than a second.
5. The squad AI need a new ""back up"" or ""get the f* out of my way"" command (or need to be adjusted). They cluster into doorways and prohibit the player from quickly moving through rooms.
6. The player AI sometimes do not respond to player commands/prompts, particularly when it comes to ""Restrain"" or ""Deploy"" commands. The AI sometimes become stuck in idle.
7. The ""Execute"" command needs to be reviewed. I task both Red and Blue teams with their respective actions, but once I 'execute' them, they fall into only performing the action of one team. E.g., if I task them with breaching and clearing a room through two separate doors, they stack up on one door and perform a single breaching action (this is especially bad for maps like Valley of the Dolls with multiple entries into small rooms).",1705935314,1705946158,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I wouldn't blame you if you mistook the crackheads and cartel members you get into gunfights with for T-800s. The reaction time and accuracy of enemy AI is ridiculous. The nature of this game encourages you to play at a slow and methodical pace, yet you are punished by near-instantaneous deaths from all-seeing, hyper accurate demi-gods before you even have the chance to aim. This is especially frustrating considering the fact that dying at any point during a mission will net you a loss and require you to restart it in its entirety.

I said that the optimization was poor, which was being generous. This game's performance is laughably bad. Impressive even, given the engine it runs on. I run a high-end rig and find my PC regularly dropping to 30 FPS on some maps, even on low settings. This is an issue that is not specific to my PC either, as many, many other players corroborate that the performance is egregious as well.

Compounding the poor performance with overtuned AI and hardcore gameplay elements, you're left with a rather unfulfilling and frustrating experience.

It's a slow (no sprint), methodical, and tense experience unlike any other game I've played, broken up by intense and unforgiving shootouts. There are 18 maps currently and the random placement of enemies and civilians make each game a different experience. The Police aspect adds gameplay aspects that are new to me: The idea of ""Rules of Engagement"" and non-lethal takedowns are a great style but totally avoidable if you don't care about score. Which I try not to.

The game is obviously meant to be played with friends but the single player experience is pretty good in it's own way. You only get AI squad mates when playing solo but being able to order them around changes the strategy nicely. It does mean that playing solo with 4 bots can be easier than playing with only 2 players. I haven't tried to play with other public players.

The npc activities are incredibly well done. Enemies will play dead or fake a surrender, and take civilians as human shields. civilians will panic and flee if there's too much going on. An npc you thought was safe could pick up a fallen gun while you look away and turn on you.

I really like the slow progression of difficulty between each levels, almost every level adds in a new mechanic that you have to look out for like trip mines, new enemy behaviour, and threats (although it does mean that early levels could become boring for lacking these mechanics).

There are no equipment unlocks, meaning that you start with all the tools and can try out everything to find a setup that works. Which might change depending on the mission select. Some customisation options are locked behind level score requirements but most are pretty easy to get.

When all the objectives of a mission are completed the game ends and you are given a score depending on how you did. This score is strictly for achievements/bragging rights and don't negatively impact you. It's based mostly heavly on 1: Completing level objectives 2: Rescuing all the civilians and 3: Keeping the players alive. You get bonus points for taking the ""Suspects"" (the bad guys) alive but it isn't required to complete the level. Some levels have objectives for taking specific Suspects alive but the mission doesn't fail if you kill them. I've ""completed"" levels with an F rank before and probably will again.

The game is DIFFICULT. The enemies are merciless and great at holding angles, flanking, and taking you by surprise. As of right now, there is a lot of talk about the bots being TOO strong: reacting too fast and being too accurate. My opinion is that they're mostly fine. I've seen very few instances of them being aimbot/wall hacking. The fast reaction can be worked around by moving slowly and avoiding doors that they're actively guarding will allow you to get the jump on them. When the bullets start flying though it's better to get behind cover rather than try and out shoot them.

One downside that all of my friends ran into was the Tutorial being broken in some way or another. It's a bad first introduction to the game.

If you're looking for a slower more tactical shooter then you might love this game, there's already a lot of content to enjoy and I'm looking forward to additional content that is likely to come at some point in the future.

If you REALLY want to, buy it, play it for an hour and if you don't feel comfortable with this, just return it. The game is FUN to watch but man am I just too much of a pussy to play this game.

Got an A on the first mission which was the convenience store but I was so on edge that I ended up shooting my teammate when he came through the door suddenly. I do NOT like that at all. Despite having the knowledge now that you can add visible player tags for teammates that go through walls, it gave me enough of a reason to think about playing this and frankly, I can't see myself doing it.

I'll consider rebuying the game if it goes on a big sale and keep it even if I don't enjoy it. I suggest waiting for a sale if you're squeamish about this stuff, too.

First: The SWAT AI. It's terrible. I command my team to go down a hall, and if there is a room to the left or right and the doors are open or an enemy opens it, they will just keep going while the enemy guns down half my team, and only one of my team actually tries to attack. I think it's because with each command, they take their own roles, so only one or two are actually shooting. But they should at least react; it's supposed to be a realism game. You would think someone would react getting shot in their rib three times. The SWAT just doesn't feel like SWAT; when they attack the enemy, they never do it well, and more times than not, they end up getting killed, and sometimes my whole team. You would probably be better off playing solo.

Second: The enemy AI. The enemy AI, paired with the horrible SWAT AI, is just... I have no word for it. I pulled an all-nighter for one map multiple times, and you would think after all that I would get better? Nope, I tried many different loadouts for me AND my team; I'm still not past that map, and I've given up by now. It's just the bad SWAT AI paired with the crackshot aim, past military training AI, makes the game unnecessarily hard. I don't want it to be too easy where you can just fly through the game, but you really don't understand how long I was trying on a SINGLE map. Even the meth heads seem to have better coordination than my team.

Third: This is kind of a small one, but it's the streamer map. If you look close enough at the art in the streamer map, it's AI. They used AI for the pictures. It wouldn't have costed that much to just hire someone to make art, maybe in early access, but full release? AI art in full release? Seriously? I guarantee you they had enough money to hire an artist to just make art, but no, they had to hop on that weird AI trend for the art. It's so stupid; I don't know why they would make it AI.

Modders have fixed the most glaring issues with the AI in an hour that the dev team has not been able to fix in 3 years. They're either super incompetent or they just don't care. As a result, the AI are super-powered robots that will instantly lock onto your head and destroy you within 0.2 seconds. Surrender is rare, even with nonlethal weaponry. They will often pull out another gun or knife even as 4 other officers are pointing a gun at them.

S Rank requirements are deranged and the game isn't built for it. Suspects can also shoot themselves or each other and you get a docked rank as a result.

Singleplayer seems fun for 2 missions and then the glaring issues pop up. AI teammates are terminators that will insta-dome suspects across the map but then need therapy after 2 missions because apparently shooting at people with beanbag shotguns gives them PTSD.

Multiplayer is OK but things get so laggy that it's barely playable. Riddled with technical issues, you can't turn off the forced film grain for instance.

They lied about a lot of their promises with the 1.0 release, removing things like alternate mission types in the same map.

AI is very dumb/weak. 
When you lean over the corners you are invisible to enemy AI. Your teammates are most of the time on your way, or are pushing forward to secure suspect when the location is not secured yet, and getting shot/killed.
Many times I shoot on target and it doesn't register for some reason (single player game).

Some  issues I've ran into while playing is that the non-lethal weapons don't seem to be doing their part, as in the bean bag shotgun nor the pepper ball gun does not stun/stagger the criminals. The grenades also don't seem to be working properly. With this, the game is pretty tough, especially when adding that the criminals don't seem to be missing their shots and can shoot you through walls. However, these are all issues that can be fixed. Hope to be playing this more often.

Update:
This game is released now. The guns have been fixed, but the grenades are unreliable. The gas grenade will, at times, not effect a suspect who is not even wearing a gas mask. In my experience, the most reliable grenade is the stinger, since the flash grenade will not hit a suspect who is not looking at it.

The AI teammates in the game are useless, bug out often, and will body block you in a hallway so the suspects can kill you. They constantly make noise, so good luck trying to sneak around. The suspects will hear the AI teammates and start unloading on you.

The suspect AI is massively overpowered. They will empty a clip into a wall and kill you with a head shot. Shoot through doors while you are opening it. Pre-fire from corners while unloading a full clip into you. Sit in a corner of the room until you get near and then unload a full clip into you. Reload in half a second.

This game is more so a shooter like Rainbow Six, but masquerading as a SWAT game.
The missions go from SWAT like, into full blown shooter status towards the latter missions.

I still play it since there isn't any other game as similar to SWAT.

Update:

I forgot to mention the framedrops. Why? No idea. Both DX 11 and DX12 will result in massive frame drops regardless of what setting you put it at.  Frames will drop whenever you are around AI, which adds to the ""fun"" of shooting them before they shoot you when they have aim bot and you have 10 frames, if even.

Last Update:
I'm pretty much done with this game. The suspects have instant AIM BOT. As in, they will turn and shoot you square in your face as soon as they see you. You have no chance to respond. If you're playing single player, good luck because your squad AI is literally retarded and will constantly yell which attracts the attention of all suspects on the map. You will consistently see this in Ides of March where the suspects will already know where you are as soon as you start the map. The guns are pretty much all trash and there's no difference between the majority of them. The only gun that actually staggers suspects is the bean bag shotgun. You need to stagger because the suspects are unloading their entire clip into you as soon as they see you. So if you're trying to outgun them, best of luck since their bullets stagger you but you don'[t even tickle them.
Seeing as to how it's been 3 years since this game went into development and this is the AI of suspects on ""Release"", best of luck. It will likely take 5 years for this to even get fixed in which case the game would have already died.",1660270054,1705862119,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

I must said from the beginning to everyone that interested to buy this game: this game is not for everyone. If you like quick paced action shooting game when you can shoot everybody easily, or an one man army shooting game when killing enemy is the only objective, then this game is not for you. But, if you like tactical shooting game when you need to proceed very carefully and prioritize teamwork, then this game is for you. 

Let's start with the positives in this game. First, this game really makes you feel like a real SWAT personnel (well, for me at least): commanding your squad (or communicating with your friend when you play multiplayer), using a variety of tools for a variety of different situations, the fear of death and failure, is something that I enjoy a lot. You can't go alone recklessly in this game because you are not an one man army.

Second, THERE IS NO MICROTRANSACTIONS in this game! All the weapon are unlocked right from the start, and for customizable gear, you can unlock it after finishing mission with good score. I think this is something that should be highly appreciated, considering the recent gaming market conditions which are full of microtransactions. I hope the developers will maintain this principle.

Now, let's talk about the negative thing. I think the main negative thing in this game is the problem with the suspect AI (the enemy). For most of the time, they can see past wall and shoot you right away! Not to mention that they have a very quick reaction time (lot of video already shown this issue). This problem often make the game unbalanced. But is this problem make the game cannot be beaten? Not really. I already complete lots of map in single player, and even in multiplayer (with just one of my friend) we are able to finish some of the map (after a lotttt of restart). Of course I don't support this situation. Because this problem make feel frustrated for lot of the time. I just want to say that this game can still be enjoyed, and I hope the developer can solve this problem soon.

Second, playing multiplayer DIDN'T COUNT FOR ACHIEVEMENT. It's like, what the hell? I don't know if this was something intentional by the developer, or an unintentional bug. it's really annoying! Why make us can only get the achievement by playing the single player mode? It feels like all the efforts achieved from multiplayer are in vain. Please make the achievement count in multiplayer, dev!

I think that's all I want to say regarding this game. Don't hesitate to buy this game if you have the money. Because I'm sure you won't regret it (but you will very likely be frustrated when playing this game haha)",1705857108,1705857108,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Weapon variety and customization (for a game of this type) is also great. The co op gameplay is fun provided you are plying with people who understand the game and its mechanics. The environmental storytelling and lore is harrowing yet intriguing.

Not a few versions ago this was a great item. I'd have recommended it. Now they're touting it as released? Absolutely not.

In order to play the maps now you have to sequentially unlock them. This means your fun lives or dies on whether you're able to complete - potentially - a single map, or not. The difficulty therefore can vary from extremes. Can't deal with the far extreme? Well it might not be your fault - I'll cover that shortly. But it does mean you'll be locked out of the rest of the content.

Let's cover friendly A.I first; they're dreadful. Considerably worse than they were a few versions ago as mentioned. Pressing Z was NOT an instant win button back then, you still had to take care in positioning and choosing your route and steps taken through a map to attain success. Nowadays you can order your squad up to a door to Open and Clear and they'll move in the requisite 6 metres into the space and clock off for the day. This becomes a major concern on larger maps with larger rooms, where they'll enter potentially very many lines of fire and sit and wait to be deleted without returning fire. Compounding issues, friendlies in FRONT of you will complain about being stuck on you even if they're the ones taking up space! That Void had the nerve to release ""Commander mode"" in this state (good luck trying to take any of your officers to the finish line, by the way) is ""No man's sky"" release astounding. It's Cyberpunk 2077 release astounding. It's measurably better than ""Gollum"" astounding though. Still, when friendly A.I is told to open and clear, I've seen them move in to an area, have two of their own squad die and they've then proceeded to NOT clear the threat, again clocking off for the afternoon. How do I know they didn't? When I went to report the downed officers and bag their weapons, I was shot by the same threat! They don't have the wherewithal needed to be competent officers.

We're not done talking about large maps though - draw distance on enemies seems to be negotiable! Some enemies will outright warp out of space and time on your screen. Don't worry - they're still there. In fact they can shoot you while they're phased out of reality, but do enjoy trying to return fire on the invisible man.

As for the enemy A.I something has gone very, very wrong here. The game doesn't seem to want to be a John Wick simulator. You're a police officer, you should be moving to apprehend first and foremost. But if you do that, enemies will react and open fire far quicker than you can even get line of sight on them sometimes. They'll snap to you no matter if you're in the same room or a half mile across the map. The gameplay is at odds with the hyper-realistic graphics here - you can't discern enemies through the debris, but they can definitely see you. There's no description of scopes available yet either, so you're always at that disadvantage especially considering as mentioned, enemies disappear at range. So you're at a crossroads as to whether this is a police roleplayer or a pure squad based tactical shooter. But there's more! Enter the rules of engagement that state whether or not it's appropriate to use lethal force, which seem very arbitrary at times. Told a suspect to drop the weapon and then shot the weapon out of their hand several seconds later? That's not allowed. They're not dead, just incapacitated but that doesn't matter. Now, what if that same suspect had opened up on you instantly? You'd be dead! So there's no 'right' way to go about it at that point and it becomes unplayable. It will remain in this state until at least, enemy A.I has to acquire you as a target at distance with reasonable delay that equals that of the player. The maps are too dark and cluttered for you to be on even footing with them, presently.

To add to this, the TUTORIAL broke! When learning about how to instruct your red and blue team I was locked out of progressing, unable to issue commands. I had to shoot my own officer to have the others kill me, restart and progress. When that's your introduction to the 1.0 game space, that messes with you. It's a terrible seed of doubt to plant in the player's mind that your inputs are negligible or just outright worthless.

I have no idea what possessed void to take a product that was smooth and well running and turn it into ..this, but this is how it is now and based on how it is now I cannot recommend it. As is you're only getting a minor selection of playable maps before you hit a major stopping block. I was seeing great potential in RoN, now I don't know if I'll be hanging around to see if these get ironed out. Playing commander mode having lost all of my persistent data in the form of the officers I started the campaign with, there's no reason to not offer me an immediate restart button, but there it isn't.

Ain't no way ya'll be releasing dis shit. Every fucking patch breaks the game more like fucking fix your game not break it, oh and new patch have fun downloading an additional 56gb.

Oh and another, i love taking 10 minutes to load into the main menu and then take another 10 minutes loading into me mates game. You know what I also love, my screen constantly tearing, to be fair I run the lowest setting with ultra performance but it should not be tearing this bad its almost like reality is ripping apart every time i move mouse a little.

On the other side the game has much more pros than cons but the cons' weight is just simply too much to ignore. I can't say much for single player cause I never played it. When the game runs well (rarely for me) its an absolute blast to play with friends and I'm gonna keep playing this despite all the issues cause at the core of it, to me this game is great fun or else I'm probably a masochist.

gritty game play that requires a level of disconnect from what is actually going on to what is required to complete the mission.

Of course with the amount of videos of this game showing up on social media with its full release, it has a massive influx of inexperienced fps players complaining about the difficulty while blaming their lack of skill in the game on the game itself. The AI behave as though your playing against real people which is what has created the amazing fan base it has. If you've always wanted an actually realistic tactical fps where the AI aren't idiotic and put up no kind of challenge then this game is for you. You are not god or rambo in this game. You have to actually plan how to handle every engagement. The AI move around the map and flank like actual people and do not stay in one place the whole game. You will need to read the stress and the moral of the enemies as that is actually simulated in the game. If you're moving around loudly then they will know you are about to come around the corner and will be aiming and ready. They will sometimes spray through walls or doors if they think you are there even if you aren't. Give your squad mates roles and use them. Give on guy on both blue and red a riot shield and when clearing and breaching they will lead in first. There is a noticeable difference between gang bangers, crackheads, and ex military based on how they respond, shoot, and move. Crackheads will stand in the open and be yelling letting you know where they are. More intelligent enemies like the secret service (yeah them) and ex military will be quiet and will listen to you and wait to ambush you. If you are a casual gamer this is not for you. If you want an honest to god fps challenge that actually feels realistic and puts fear in you then this is it. This is a game where you will most likely have to try levels a few or maybe even several times to complete. This is not for people who like to fly through a level and not put any actual effort into it. The AI in this game is by far the best I have ever seen in a video game and people who say otherwise are probably just frustrated. Sure they could add a difficulty setting but I admire a game without one that you have to get good at to play. In a world where games have become increasingly easier and more handicapped this brings back a time when games had a spine and said ""You're going to learn how to play this if you want to beat it."" Some missions are hard, some are easy, some are almost impossible at first. Some maps are small, some big, some claustrophobic, and some are wide open. The game hits every kind of mission you could want and every kind of environment as well. An incredible modding community continuously brings in new maps as well. Don't buy this game because you watched some guy on facebook or tiktok fly through a level alone and wipe out all the enemies and think that you can do that as well.

I've had the game for more than a year now, and I feel that its a must buy if you love tactical shooters. The singleplayer is great. The multiplayer is even better. It punishes you for trying to go fast without a plan. It even has less lethal weapon options if you want to give yourself a little bit of a challenge and even rewards you with cosmetics for doing so.

Only problems that i have noticed in my 10ish hours playing the 1.0 release are low fps for seemingly no reason in weird places, superhuman reaction time from suspects and almost all suspects have no self preservation programmed into them causing the game to turn into a shoot first ask questions later SWAT simulator.

But I think that they end up expecting too much from the people playing in single player. Currently I am stuck on the level called elephant where you have to deal with shooters and defuse bombs or in 13 minutes the bombs explode. The briefing does not talk about the bombs and there are countless. On one try I defused 3 and the place still blew up. Now I can get 2  before the place blows up. All in all I believe that this map is too big and not enough information given to adequately pass the level in single player. The map appears better fitted for multiplayer. I would not have such an issue if you had all the levels unlocked like in early access but in order to unlock missions you have to play each one.,1705799576,1705799576,False,1,1,0.511278212070465088,0,True,False,False

- AI is awful, both in enemies and allies.
- You can only play with bots in your team in career mode (solo). This means that playing this game with only one friend is just barely possible since there will only be two operatives in your team... to clear houses, caves, mansions, villages, etc. So the only good way to play this game is either solo, or with at least 2 friends (3 players total).
- There is no way to change the loadout of your team between attempts without having to go back to headquarters.
- Even with SSD, the game takes long to load.
- Sometimes, between attempts, someone in your team can randomly lose all their armor, forcing everyone to go back to headquarters and restart the whole mission.
- Weapons dropped on the floor often clip through the geometry of walls and floor. Use the ""highlight weapons"" in the accessibility options to at least be able to see them.
- There isn't much customisation, even in weapons. It's often a case of ""use this good sight, or any of these other crappy ones"", or choose between laser, IR laser, or flashlight (you can only have one equipped... for whatever reason).

I purchased this game at full price because of pressure from friends and I deeply regret it. Also, don't buy this game if you only have one person to play with. You'll be limited to playing maybe the first 4 missions, things beyond that takes more people in your team.",1705796695,1705796932,False,1,0,0.503759443759918213,0,True,False,False

""Put 'em on safe and let 'em hang"", no more. 
If you carefully analyze statements in the latest Vol. 67 Ready or Not Development Briefing, Void isn't admitting any wrongdoing on their end but in fact; you, most of the world, and myself are just bad. 

""Why is the taser in the tactical slot rather than being a secondary?

The taser was moved to the tactical slot to address a growing desire from players to carry a lethal sidearm and a taser at the same time. By making it a tactical slot item, we improved the flexibility of less lethal options.""
-How does removing an equipped weapon slot, improve my less lethal flexibility. I used to be able to have Primary, Secondary (Taser), and Pepper Spray. Now, you just remove your sidearm, no alternative option. Unless the intention is 'all non-lethal options shouldn't take a firearm slot', in that case pepper guns and bean bag shotguns should be turned into tactical as that would technically increase my non-lethal options by Void's stance. More eggs in a basket means more options to Void, instead of having more baskets. 

""Is further work being done on Suspect reaction time and game sense? When should Suspect AI be able to detect me?

Yes, we are working to address these systems to make the process fairer and more enjoyable for the player. Suspect AI aim, reaction, and game sense can sometimes be too fast or accurate for what should be expected. Currently, auditory sources are a large factor of whether Suspect AI can determine your location and how they may react to you.""
-This can be interpreted as, ""Yes, we are changing the A.I. because you're bad and can't/don't hold the SHIFT key while in retention (ready to fire your weapon - as going into low ready means you move faster but make more noise)"". By using the phrase ""sometimes be "" implies that the majority of the time is the contrary, which would be that the A.I. is acting as expected. 

""My SWAT AI switch to lethal force (i.e. pistol) when I am trying to get an S-rank on a less-lethal play-through. Is there anything that can be done about this?

The granular control you have over your officers’ loadouts lets you remove lethal options, including ammunition, which can help circumvent unintended situations where they use lethal force for those of you striving for the coveted S-ranks. Furthermore, features to further facilitate less-lethal playthroughs may be expanded upon, such as potentially making less-lethal options like the TPL also available in the secondary slot in a future hotfix. Programming quirks may need to be sorted out for other less-lethal items such as the taser’s simultaneous compatibility in tactical/secondary slots, however.""
-Here, they don't really see the true issue. The SWAT A.I. will swap to their sidearm with no ammo. You can setup their loadout all you want, all barbied out for non-lethal. They will still swap to the pistol with no allocated ammo. 

""Are Suspect AI intended to be able to shoot through walls?

To a degree yes, partly to prevent players from too easily shooting suspects through walls and to give Suspect AI further tactical flexibility, they are indeed intended to be able to fire through walls. However, we are seeing instances where their estimation player tracking appears too precise or their proclivity for engaging through walls is perceived as too much.""
-""Instances""? ""Perceived""? Watch Operator Drewski on Youtube. The Suspect A.I. have literal seconds of esp. What they're really saying here is the A.I. in the majority of cases, is balanced and functionally normal.

That being said

If you are here for a gritty, harsh, swat-sim experience, this isn't it.
This game is an unintentional comedy.
Crackheads tracking you perfectly through walls and debris, soccer fans hitting you three floors away through concealment, commands being on the same key as actions so you scream at a civilian to comply standing 6 inches from them, after they had already complied (points for realism there at least) 

The story doesn't really exist, not that it needs to. Crimes be occurring and you be stopping them. Its when you look into the police department that it gets *really* funny. 
Therapist has to take unpaid overtime while you have full access to an arsenal of weapons including prototypes, foreign designs, and weapons that have never been used by any law enforcement agencies, absolute peak of comedic writing.

The friendly AI is mostly good to really solid. Your teammates will stack up, breach, clear, hold, all competently. And they apparently went to whatever crackhead training camp exists. Or maybe the crackheads are ex-police. Whatever is funnier to you.

A pure peace of copaganda filled with more bugs than a rock in the woods that you and your friends will enjoy every second of.

The game has a good spirit, good idea and a nice successor to SWAT 4 and that game had it's flaws. The worst part of this game is AI and performance. The performance is really inconsistent. I tried both epic and low settings. While I can run epic settings around 144 fps, sometimes I get lag spikes and game turns into PowerPoint presentation and after that I get console experience(around 30 fps). Same thing happens on any graphic settings.

AI in this game is something else. Enemy AI basically has wall hacks and sees you through smoke grenades, blindfolds and other ""obstacles"", that they are not supposed to see. Even in low lit, smoked corridor enemy will see your small pixel and will be able to run and gun you down as if I am in CoD.

I don't think the AI in this game has improved since I bought it in early 2022. I don't know why this game is getting as much praise as is when it is so clearly not ready for release. Edit: Now the game crashes every time I try to play the map Rust Belt. Yay!",1704227479,1705787915,False,2,0,0.491883575916290283,0,True,False,False

The game was running awful since day one but it was running nonetheless. Up until v1.0...the game would crashed almost instantly upon booting it up on both Direct11 and Directx12.

Tried reinstalling the game hoping this fixed the issue and it didn't, It did however stopped the instant crashing upon booting the game but would lock up the system within 5 mins of gameplay, on the 3rd attempt however, after a 3rd force restart. I no longer was getting picture output from my GPU... the GPU fried.

I tried my sister's GPU and that gave me picture right away, I threw in my GPU and no picture. Booted up the PC with the onboard CPU graphics and my GPU was not being recognized at all by my system...

""TOC"" needs to immediately stop talking and micromanaging every time I secure evidence or people.
AI needs to tone down the aimbot just a smidge
AI needs to stop engaging me when I secure a suspect (or give me a way to cancel the animation). Example: I  hit a suspect with a bean bag and I have them move to my position in a safer position, I wait and make sure its safe and then as I interact with the surrendering suspect, I get lit up by someone who just walks up on me magically. I get shot through walls a lot when I am in an enclosed room with no suspects.
If the AI can see through the smoke of CS Gas then remove the obfuscation from the player as well. Make the effects of the CS gas last longer too, just because I walk out of the smoke does not mean I am magically free of the effects.
Bring back all the different game modes from the pre-release.

Biggest complaint is ""TOC"" needing to STFU until the end of the mission. No crap people are standing by and no crap I need to continue on with the mission... Nah, I think I am gonna just stop here and head out.

Modding also makes scores unofficial. So I cannot mod ""TOC"" out.

The whole ""don't kill anyone to get an S rating"" is awful. 40% of my shots don't register so I get rekt because of how slow the damn shotgun is. The AI is incredibly annoying. Their ability to know when I am in an animation that can't be stopped is terrible.

While the whole idea and story intertwined into this game is incredible (and most of the execution is good especially after 1.0), the AI still hasn't been fixed. 

The fact that I can open a door and an AI can headshot me from 100 metres away with a pistol is just so infuriating that many sessions have involved me just closing the game after this has happened. 

Then there's the optimisation. Void claimed they optimised this game a lot from the early access to 1.0 but I have seen almost the complete opposite. I have gone from averaging 100-120 fps on the early access to now where I am lucky if i even get 60 fps in every mission (I'm running a 4070 ti and 13700k). I don't know what has happened but I just wish the game worked well.

Would I recommend this game as it stands? That depends. 

If you have incredible hardware that can cope with this game and are looking for an updated SWAT 4. Yes

However, there are some minor bugs and certain things that I think the developers need to fix, especially with multi-player and singleplayer. The minor bug fixes would be when players have on their gear like plate carriers especially when you go to arrest someone on the other person's POV you see your character arrest but then you see a floating plate carrier where you character is supposedly standing as you are arresting a civilian or suspect. Another bug is when in singleplayer and you have your AI team with you, and you're either clearing a room or arresting a suspect or civilian they like to always get in front of you or get in your way. Also, with the AI team, they are automatically shooting through the walls at suspects that you don't even see yet before you clear the room. Another bug is also when you have the AI team running less lethal to get S ranks they always switch out to their pistols even when you set them to have no ammo in them yes realistically it would be bad in a situation when your running pepperball guns only but it just makes it hard to get those S ranks if the AI will waste their ammo in their primary gun and switch to a pistol that is empty and die to these suspects. One more bug that I think needs to be fixed is also the game crashes when waiting for friends to load into lobby or after you get done with missions and you hit return to headquarters.In my opinion, I hope the developers bring out some good updates with this game or more missions as it's a really fun game to play with friends or run solo.",1705737344,1705737344,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I would like to preface to say I only play this game via Multiplayer, mainly with 2 friends, sometimes 3. I do not have any experience in the single player campaign/mode I have not really looked at it at all. Overall I do enjoy the game and think it can be a lot of fun to play, but you could say that with any game you play with friends. Right now I would not recommend this game in its current state. It has a lot of fundamental issues that may be fixed in the future, or can be adjusted with mods. My squad plays this game vanilla with no mods.

I originally put the game away pre-1.0 because every enemy was John Wick and sometimes it was just impossible to get through a match. This seems to of been toned down quite a bit, but there are still some missions that feel nearly impossible to complete with the AI being crack shots shooting you through 2-3 layers of wall. Sometime's I'll see them running away from me and still shooting at me with their back to me. The game is currently in Full Release and it still has a lot of issues that were present in Early Access. Frame rate can drop from 140~ to 15 from just entering a new room, with AI as cracked as it is, its literally game over if it happens. One of my favorite things added was customization, unfortunately it is also bugged. Right now in order to unlock more options you need to get a certain score in certain maps. However if you receive an S rank it doesn't actually unlock some options. After completing an S Rank map, it should have awarded our squad with a watch, tattoo, and several clothing options however only about half the clothing options were unlocked. 

As of Right now I do not think the game is actually in a 1.0 State, I would not recommend anyone pick it up today unless you have 3 friends whom can laugh off all the bugs with you.

It's a great tactical game.  It makes you slow down and think about what you are doing.  The user interface has increased tremendously when the game went to full release vs. early access.  It's a great game to play with your friends.

The game takes place in the fictional location of Los Suenos which is pretty much just a scaled up downtown Detroit. The game includes many tactical gear options like armour, weapons and tacticals but if you wear anything other than NVGs you are not winning drip or drown and that's truly the most important thing in the game. The game has many unique maps that each feel like their own experience, these maps include: 
Twisted Nerve- The OG experience where you can mag dump into one single crackhead only for them to whip around and one tap you with the smallest possible calibre.
Ides of March- The most realistic experience of what its like to live in the middle east where any and every door is set with an IED.
Neon Tomb- A map that almost emulates the amount of stress I am under in any given real social interaction.

Though 2 things at the moment that do cause frustration while playing are AI (both Suspect and team AI) and doors, both need a rework. 

Suspect AI) They seem overly aggressive, often coming out of the building or travel through multiple rooms to attack you. Now maybe some types should do that like veterans (with previous tactical knowledge) or drugged up suspects (with aggressive behavior and a dulled sense of self preservation) but I'd imagine basic suspects would rather remain rather sedimentary. When trying to apprehend criminals, they are very stubborn to surrender, even when its 5 SWAT Vs 1 with SWAT already aiming at them. Even when they do surrender they almost always seem to pull out a second weapon when you close in to cuff, this feels like it should be a rare event but it's not, it's nearly every suspect.

Beyond the issues of trying to arrest them they are also extremely observant, are exceptionally good at wall banging, able to turn and shoot accurately extremely fast, and can seemingly see straight through tear gas. For their observance ability, I was probably 100 feet away looking through 2 sets of doors and a hallway, a suspect came into view in the middle of the hallway looking away from me, but then instantly turns to engage us. They are able to track you for a moment after seeing and engage you through a wall, you can see this especially on a map with a staircase right next to a door, the bullet holes with be following you as you climb the stairs until they most likely get a head shot. With CS gas you can not see very far through it, but the AI seem to be able to see and engage you with no issue as you travel through the cloud.

Teammate AI) When order to clear a room are actually fairly competent, If one has a shield they will take point, AI will check under beds if that's something on the map. Now and then they pick a wrong direction to focus or go in a less important  section of a room, but people do that too so don't really fault them much there. The issue with teammate AI is when following you or stationary after an order. When following or moving to start an order they really don't help much (probably because they travel single file and block each other's  LOS). When stationary they aren't very reactive at all, they might shoot back a bit, but they should seek cover when under fire and should move to help if one of them is under fire.

Doors) Every door in the game can be opened in both directions, that's not how most doors work. Some doors should also be spring loaded and shut themselves after being opened, like doors you would find in businesses and schools 
(but not residential doors and such), this would help a lot on certain maps where the suspects seem to have opened every door in the building (again I would say moving around too much for people that I would imagine would probably prefer barricading themselves instead).

Overall it's a good game that I enjoy, just with some frustrating elements currently.",1705710177,1705710177,True,1,0,0.526627242565155029,0,True,False,False

While people will say ""oh just play tactical"" or ""get good"" to my reasoning. No. That's not the issue here and this game is not immune from flaws and critique. I have played every way these people suggest and it's still an issue. 

The AI is way to over tuned, I even tested in replay mode and tried researching how other people also felt. And I'm not the only person being killed before average human reaction time can kick in, or getting wall banged instantly by a suspect who saw me through a crack in the door and 100% accurately tracked my location through a wall for 3 whole seconds. This doesn't seem normal and feels like a bug. I want the game to be lethal, but what I don't want is to be up against AI I can't even react to because they don't even have frames between being idle and then firing at me.

This game is really cool and I love what it's trying to do but I can't recommend it at this stage. Not until the AI has been reworked, save your money and wait until the AI at least gets some reaction time or tracking tweaks.

AI's reaction times are insane. I thought it wasn't bad at first and then I got insta-killed the literal moment I leaned through a doorway.

They did not change how the AI acts - nobody surrenders and civilians are still uncooperative. I think they made it worse, actually.
All of the ""stop the killing"" and ""your job is to bring order to chaos"" propaganda plastered around the station is almost funny - it doesn't matter what mission you're doing, how big or small time the perps are, they want you and your entire squad dead and will stop at nothing to do so. My advice? Forget going non-lethal, just put them down. You can maybe arrest a couple if you incapacitate them with a flashbang but don't count on it.

Considering every mission in the game has you against multiple (at least fifteen) fanatical, bloodthirsty suspects with automatic weapons and level XIVV-whatever body armor, the LSPD should be sending in thirty-man government death squads in Call of Duty juggernaut suits with LMGs and air support, not four underpaid SWAT officers in cheap body armor and helmets that couldn't protect them from a BB gun, let alone an actual bullet.

I mean, this is insane, how are two jerk-offs running a bitcoin farm able to bribe what feels like a small army of gang members (who SOMEHOW have automatic rifles, despite Los Suenos being an obvious stand-in for Los Angeles) to put their lives on the line for them during a SWAT raid??? I mean, terrorists, cultists and drugged-up meth addicts acting erratic I can understand, but why are small-time thugs with makarovs so willing to throw their lives away against a four-stack of armed and ""armored"" SWAT personnel? It's insane.

On top of that, Void has been using AI art for pretty much everything they can - posters, photos, even UNLOCKABLE COSMETICS, and it's damn ugly. This is worse than Early Access.

THE GOOD:

RoN has INCREDIBLE gunplay. Every gun feels like it packs a punch, and shooting them feels incredibly satisfying.

The loadout customization is top notch. RoN has many guns, ranging from shotguns, to submachine guns, to rifles, and with some less lethal guns sprinkled in there as well, alongside your pistol sidearms. Every gun has lots of attachments and other goodies, so you can get that perfect loadout. Alongside the guns, you can equip many different tactical gear items that do all sorts of things. There are also lots of cosmetic items for you to equip as you unlock them.

RoN has incredible attention to detail. Every map has lots of hidden details and lore in them, connecting every map to each other in a cool little story ark. You could spend hours looking through every map, trying to find the details that paint the full picture.

RoN supports modding. Need I say more?

THE MEH:

RoN has very little progression. Everything in your loadout is available from the moment you launch the game (excluding cosmetics). The only visible progression is by unlocking maps and cosmetics as you complete missions.

Friendly AI is... decent. The cop AI can recieve many commands and clear areas for you, which makes them a very useful tool. However, they often get in the way (especially when navigating tight spaces) and refuse to move. Alongside that, there are several bugs that range from funny cosmetic glitches to game breaking.

THE BAD:

This game's optimization is GARBAGE. It is impossible to overstate how poorly this game is optimized. The best computers will be brought to their knees just trying to load the menu. If you don't have a semi beefy computer, don't bother buying this game until it gets significantly better optimization. 

The suspect AI is cracked. As in, on crack. Suspect AI has perfect vision, aim, and tracking. It makes clearing some areas nearly impossible, because you'll be getting shot from 5 different places at once and cannot hide behind cover because the suspects will just shoot through the wall directly into your head. Plus, it is next to impossible to get a suspect to surrender without putting bullet holes in them, so good luck trying to get any of the ""arrest x suspect(s)"" objectives.

Many of RoN's maps are huge. Maps that take less than 30 minutes to properly clear are incredibly rare. A side effect of this is that it becomes incredibly frustrating to play the game when you die 45 minutes into a map because the suspect AI shot you from three stories up and was impossible to see.

SUMMARY:

If you have $50 to burn and have a beefy computer, I'd say go for it. But, if you don't, wait. Wait for the game to go on sale, and for the game to receive many more updates. The game right now is in such a precarious state.",1705690828,1705690828,True,2,1,0.535993099212646484,0,True,False,False

- performance drops (I got drops from 120 to 15 FPS),

Design & UX Issues:
- Way to slow movement pacing with fast shotouts & one-shot kills. So gunplay is a huge turn off (I know, it doesn't needs to be fun in a police simulation).
- Can't get instant mission replay in singleplayer (WHY?!), despite grind team-leveling mechanics and mission scoring, so you need to often replay missions, but after every defeat you need to get back to HUB, and choose mission again.
- No tutorial (ZERO! WHY?!).
- Incomprehensible game HUB (Police Station), it's big and with every mission you are unlocking a location... So no training ground for you newbie.

As I bought this game from Early Access and the Supporter Edition, and now I keep continuing to play this game, here are my feedback for 1.0 update.

Positive
- Gameplay (The gunplay is amazing)
- Customization of your loadout (Weapons, Attachments, and Outfit)
- New weapons
- New maps (some maps have 2-3 different entry points)
- Features a portable tablet which you can check the details of map's objective, the profiles of the suspects and civilians, and the 911 audio calls.
- Improved SWAT AI (although sometimes it is janky)
- Graphics

Negative
- The game is unoptimized
- Removed game modes for all maps.
- Suspect AI is even worse. They have aimbot, tracking, wallhacking, John Wick, and going suicidal approach to engage with players as if they have no qualms in their lives. This was already existing back in Early access days.
- Rules of Engagement (RoE) is sometimes wonky. Also the RoE is strict especially in a terrorist or active shooter maps.

I would really like to recommend this game. However, in my opinion, the 1.0 update feels like it was rushed. The developers should have delayed and tested it properly ESPECIALLY the Suspect AI and the optimization of the game. This is 0.5 disguised as 1.0.

Currently at this state, the game is totally not ready and I recommend to wait for sale and buy this game at a reasonable price. At this moment, I will not call this as a SWAT game but more like a milsim game.",1659515536,1705678218,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The devs have made it clear they are well aware of the AI issues and have already publicly stated at least two hotfixes forthcoming directed at that.   I am confident based on their track record of support that this issue will be improved upon.   I think it's telling that many of us continue to play this game even despite the current issues.   The game becomes SWAT 5 if they bridge the gap. I can't offer any higher praise than that. Nothing is perfect of course.  

Details: 

Positives:
- Excellent looking game with some nice attention to details. 
- Solid SWAT team AI  (lean on them nonstop for everything)

It isn't about progression, grind or getting upgrades for your guns so you can ""shoot"" better. Ready or Not approaches game play from a pure cooperative mindset. Your team is the main asset, not the individual player, and all of your efforts as a team determine whether you can complete a mission.

What Ready or Not offers that other games don't is the challenge of completing a mission without making a single mistake, or completing it with the least amount of mistakes possible. It's about coming up with a strategy, executing it and reflecting on what has and hasn't worked. I'm lucky that I have a good team, where we constantly talk about how we execute missions and how we can do things better. When we fail missions we examine our loadouts, our strategy and pacing, and react accordingly. With trial and error and using different combinations, we've managed to create a somewhat versatile team that can respond to a variety of scenarios. For example, during hostage rescue missions, we employed the use of lethal and non lethal firearms, riot shields and door wedges to lock and secure hostages indoors to keep them safe. We give assailants the chance to surrender by using non lethal firearms first, and when they choose to engage we take them down. With bomb threats, we equipped breaching shotguns, SMGs and light armor to quickly access areas and prioritize the bombs. 

And this is where the game falls short. It is impossible to achieve this if you are playing with randoms, and I'm not saying that you won't find good random players, but this game is best played when you have a team of dedicated people that are willing to learn the game with you as you go. 

There are some areas in the game that could be improved, mainly the AI for me. They do react in a strange way sometimes but that can be fixed in the future. After the last update in January, I did witness a massive improvement when compared to the earlier build. With more maps I think this game will be something unique that many will appreciate. 

If you have a team of 4 players, I highly recommend you get this game and experience it yourself.

So I actually purchased Six Days in Fallujah first. I found the gunplay in that game to be rough and clunky somewhere between Arma/Squad and it had no solid single player options. So i refunded and paid the difference to try this game out. Boy am I glad I did.

You play as a Swat Commander, a leader of a 5 man team, and you battle against the chaotic criminal element of fictional Los Suenos to save innocent lives and stop bad guys, with lethal force if necessary. In single player you command four AI SWAT team members with a wide range of commandsfrom wedging doors shut to restraining enemies to breaching and clearing rooms with difference devices and weaponry in hundreds of potentials combinations of easily accessed andused commands. Commanding the AI team members feels very smooth and easy to do while you work alongside them to stop the bad guys which i really liked. It's so accessible and intuitive and was very easy to get used to doing.

In multiplayer You and up to four other players work together to complete the missions and while real world tactics and stealthy cautious play is highly rewarding, you can just as easily chuck four flashbangs or shot gun a door down and run in blasting.

The gun play in incredible. It's the best feeling gunplay ive ever seen in a game. The recoil feels real: It's there but controllable, the weapons move incredibly realistically, and they sound incredible. Movement with your weapon aimed down sight feels like watching a helmet or gun angle from a hollywood block buster. 

Speaking of guns there are dozens of rifles, submachine guns, shotguns, pistols, weapon accessories, less-lethals and explosives, gadgets and devices, armortypes, and clothing and gear appearances to choose from giving you literally thousands of possible combinations to choose from. Just a few out fits i like to be kitted out in are all black classic swat apparel, button down and jeans with hiking shoes like i just responded off duty to call, or straight boogaloo time with a hawaiian shirt, gold rimmed morpheus shades, and a big fat sparkling diamond studded watch with my AK variant.

You can also customized the load out of each of your individual guys(alpha, bravo, charlie, delta) and they are separated into two smaller commandable teams of blue and red. I like to qeue up orders to have mytwo man fire teams breach two different doors simultaneously and give myfirst-man-in a ballistic shield with pistol and the second man a high powered rifle or semi autoshotgun to stop threats from behind the firstmans shield. Or i cna run them four strong (five including me) and have them absolutely dominate a room together.

A cool thing too is this game isnt just about killing all the bad guys. While you CAN do that, you are graded for your performance at the end of each mission and you get a better score if you can take more bad guys alive. So that means using less lethals to break enemy morale and force them to surrender so you can safely cuff them. You can also tap the F key and your swat guy will yell at suspects to get down and surrender and when your whole team is firing at an enemy position yelling at them that can make them surrender and give up without dying.

Your Ai team mates also have indivdual skills like ""negotiator"" which makes it more likely enemies will surrender when yelled at, or door kickerwhich makes it more likelyyour team will kick a door down in one kick, or""moral officer"" whihc makes it less likely your teams stress will build up. Which is another thing! In the campaign you have to manage your guys stress. After a mission they may be ancious, stressed, or having a crisis. If these things arent addressed they can break down mid mission or quit your team and have to be replaced, or be forced into therapy and un usable for 2 or 3 missions. Taking suspects alive,  avoiding injuries and deaths on your team, and keeping the active members of your team content all contribute.

Other than the enemy AI being a bit overtuned, which is resolved by mods and is getting officially addressed in the next few patches, a general lack of polish makes it hard to justify its asking price.
The AI generated textures for artwork featured in maps and briefings feel very cheap and amateurish and take away from the worldbuilding and immersion.
The speech-to-text subtitles have not been proofread and as a non-native english speaker I would have found them useful to understand some technical and tactical lingo, but as is they're unusable.
I could be wrong on this but some maps' furniture appears to have strange hitboxes.

That being said the sound work is fantastic and the mechanics are great. The atmosphere is conveyed well to the player and some missions really gave me the creeps for the first few playthroughs.

If you want to go through and shoot everything in sight, it's a fairly fun shooter, but as a tactical police shooter taking inspiration from SWAT, it falls very short.

[h1]Biggest Issue[/h1]
The biggest issue currently is that Suspect AI have no variety what so ever and are extremely accurate and aggressive. They all act very similarly, whether they're a drug addict in their crack den, a homicidal maniac barricaded in his home, or straight up terrorists shooting everyone in sight. A meme among the community is that every mission in this game makes you feel like you're assaulting Osama Bin Laden's compound, and that's not very far off. They constantly fake surrender with 5 guns pointed at their head. They constantly rush past corners and into open areas, despite knowing you're there. They constantly resist non-lethal or even lethal shots until you spam F. The root of this issue is the suspect AI are currently programmed to be very aggressive and offensively mind-set, even on defensive maps like barricaded suspects, with very little difference among them, leading to a game-play experience that is extremely predictable.

[h1]Repetitive Missions[/h1]
And because there is very little difference in the suspect AI, the missions become the same thing, over and over again. You're most likely going to be shooting 80% of the suspects you encounter, no matter what kind they are, and the game gets very repetitive after you've completed Commander Mode. A prime example of this disconnection is the streamer den mission. VOID advertised this mission as going into a streamer's home who has been swatted, with a false 911 call about him shooting his mother to death and taking his brother hostage. This mission could of been this game's Fairfax Residence, with very little suspects at all, just civilians falsely accused of a crime who have no idea you are there, who may be armed or not, perhaps falsely believing their home is being invaded.

Instead, VOID decided to make it another fucking trip into Fallujah. Why are there 10+ gangsters in this mission with automatic weapons and shotguns? I understand there's some kind of illegal server farm (which has people walking around with guns as if they're constantly expecting the cops???), but why are these people in the streamer's room and in the hallways? I don't really care if there's a reason for it, it just speaks again to this game's issue of having stale, repetitive missions and how much missed opportunity there was. Clearly, VOID was afraid that a slow paced tactical shooter wouldn’t be liked by mainstream audiences, and that’s why most missions feel like a shooting gallery.

[h1]The ""S"" Rank Hell and ROE[/h1]
The ROE for these missions are pretty dumb, with S rank always requiring you to bring every single suspect in alive, which basically requires you to spam beanbag shotguns, gas, and F compliance yell until your fingers hurt. Why do I need to bring in actual Jihad terrorists or school shooters in alive to get an S rank? For missions where the suspects are defensive, I can understand that mentality, but for missions where lives are at risk or the suspects have offensively assaulted a location, why would any police department have that kind of ROE? They wouldn't.

[h1]John Wick Suspects[/h1]
If you don't install an AI mod like I had to do, be prepared to deal with AI who can snap shoot you through walls. The way the devs programmed it is that if you fall within a certain ""visual cone"" within 500 meters, the suspects immediately identify and turn towards you with a 0.1 (yes, that's actually how it's programmed) reaction time. Because of this, they can spot you through the smallest holes in geometry, which usually results in you getting shot through walls randomly whilst walking through open areas. The most infamous example of this is the postal office warehouse.

[h1]Lot of Needed Improvements[/h1]
There's also a lot of other issues currently which makes the game seem half-baked. Lack of QoA (can't save outfits in customization, no gun stats), lackluster story, god awful optimization (I have a 4090 and the game still runs like shit sometimes),  VOID clearly rushed this release to capitalize on the holidays, and it's hilariously sad to see how it has backfired on them, going from 40k daily players back down to what it used to be around 15-10k.

For those unaware about the history in recent years with VOID, they've mishandled this game. They rarely had updates in early access, despite making 2 million dollars off of it, and most likely more off this recent release which I hope they put towards improving and fixing the game, instead of a rumor which I will go into down below. VOID is a small company, so I can understand that things take time, but this release in particular came out of nowhere. It really did feel like they got our hopes up, trying to market the game as finished, when in reality it wasn't and they just wanted to grab as much money as possible off of the holiday rush.

There's talk that VOID has begun preparing to abandon this project in favor for a new one. All I can say is if they do that, they aren't getting a penny from me in the future, and I encourage you to do so the same. It's a real shame to see a project you were invested in turn to such a wet fart.

This game was not made to support controller so me as a controller user that brings its own difficulties but i understand that with all of these controls it could be very difficult to cram them into so few buttons. Luckily you can change your settings as you see fit. Also the loading times and the game lagging out while online needs to be fixed or atleast worked on. 

All that to say that i really enjoy this game and recommend it to everyone. Rating it at a nice 8.8.

If you have Christmas money or if you have friends to play it with, definitely. But honestly, SWAT 4 is also just as good, just get some mods for it and its practically the same if not better for practically free. The only downside to doing that is the graphics and slight clumsiness of the controls. (And possibly some brains to get a server, mods, and whatnot running). 

Overall in its current state, would recommend. Just again, if you don't have the money to spare don't drop it on this *just* yet.

And I use the term ""sleeper hit"" very lightly, as this game, while having a fairly decent sized community, will probably end up being outshined at some point. However, I think this game will be the father of the modern generation of FPS tactical shooters that AREN'T a PvP slog. 

If you're coming into this expecting a fun COD jaunt, leave. This game won't be for you, and I don't intend to sound mean saying that, but you won't be able to win just by flying through rooms shooting everything that moves, as you have to keep an eye on civilians, who's faking dead and who's actually dead, terrorists trying to blend in with civilians, and a variety of other random scenarios that seem to be implemented really well so far. 

I recently came back as I saw the game finally released in 1.0, and so far from the almost hour and a half I've played of it, I think they devs have truly outdone themselves. When I played this when it was still in EA, I had my hesitation, thinking they would just cave and turn it into a Tarkov-like, but I couldn't have been more wrong. 

The game, while suffering from frame drops in certain rooms with a ton of effects, still looks and feels good. I've experienced only one crash so far. You also have to remember that VOID Interactive is a team of less than 50 people who have managed to, in my opinion, blow most AAA FPS games out of the water (I'm looking at you Modern Warfare 3.) Hopefully, with a few more updates, this game will be in perfect playing condition.  

I think it's funny that so many people are currently complaining about the ""aimbot AI"" because, if anything, it makes the game feel much more realistic and punishes people who aren't being careful about their next steps and making good calls. You have to think that maybe they programmed the AI to be better, faster, and more responsive to what's going on because in the same real situation, the criminals might have had time to learn the layout of the building and secure potential weakspots. They had time to figure out their strategy whereas you have to make yours up on the fly. Just like if something went belly-up for a real life SWAT team. 
Sure, it's not fair, but do you think SWAT operators are put into fair situations?

Overall, outside of a few small issues that don't really make the game unplayable, I think this is a fun, realistic way to put yourself into the boots of a SWAT team commander.",1705639012,1705639243,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

However that being said: This is by far one of the if not the most realistic shooter I've ever came across

This game will challenge your patience your wits and your bronze in order to survive.

I'll be putting in some pros and cons for this one

Pros: 

- The Guns all feel and act differently. Each weapon in this game is unique despite their similar appearance.
- Breaching is strategic and fun
- Animations are superb. Limbs fly off enemies scream in pain and bleed-out if not attended too.
- Objectives are similar but enemy placement and different strategies used by A.I makes each encounter feel different. 
- Scores affect your characters cosmetics. Higher scores equal fun cosmetic unlocks.

Cons:

- The A.I Is a bit broken in this game. Regardless if you attempt a stealth approach enemies can somehow see you through walls and even have god like eco location
- The game stutters horribly. I wish this wasn't a problem, however I have seen multiple stutters happen in this game. Tried to limit fps, lower graphic settings and stutters still happen.
- The hardest mode doesn't really feel like it affects the player that much

Overall Ready Or Not Is a fun experience for those wanting something different. However in the games state that it is now I certainly hope they patch a lot of the buggy issues with it. Not bad but really needs some fixes.",1705636955,1705636955,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I have a longer list of reasons why you might enjoy this game than i do not, however some of the reasons i dont like this game are too big to ignore and just have fun otherwise. So here some of them are:

~If you fail a mission there is no quick restart. You have to load through the entire post mission screen, load HQ, re select the mission by walking to it, wait 10 seconds, load up the mission again  only to possibly get smoked 30 seconds in because you weren't aware of trip wires being on that particular door or something. I understand them wanting us to take a tactical slow approach and penalize us for failing but this is NOT the way to do it. Lazy and makes me rather just not go through the load times and play something else.

~There are massive FPS spikes for no reason. I have a top tier PC and sometimes the game goes from 90 fps - 40 or even 20. From all my research this is due to the games latest versions being completely unstable.  In my first Ides of March run where i actually thought i was going to beat it my frames dropped all the way to 15 and i ended up getting killed SO ANNOYING because this mission is difficult anyway doesnt help that the devs unstable build causes more pain. 

~An issue maybe more personal to me and not experienced by everyone else is i cant join my friends with mods. It always gives an error even tho we disable server side check sum, but i can join random online lobbies no problem.  

These are the 3 biggest issues, top 2 being most relevant to everyone else. I also really hate that they have sniper scopes with ""variable zoom"" but theres no keybindings for the variable zoom so theyre all 1x scopes... seems like it couldve been something pretty ez to add to 1.0 imo.

You have all these tools at your disposal yet they seem to do nothing in the face of Aimbot AI. If you are spotted, basically at all by an enemy that has a gun, you will die or immediately injured to the brink of death. Yes, i am fully aware this trying to be as life like as possible and they are tense situations, but humans dont have AIMBOT! The AI is literally the only thing bringing this game down for me right. Im not a game devloper so i have no way of knowing how to tweak this to make it better but as it stands its so infuriating to instantly die, load back to the station after a minute. slowly walk back to the mission table, select mission, ready up, wait ten seconds, wait another ten seconds. Go back in, only to die again trying to peek a door with an enemy facing the other way and turning to do the famous 360 no scope on you. 

Devlopers you guys truly did do a good job at this game. So many life like reactions from your AI team, the code words, weapons and feeling of being in SWAT (i am not that in real life) But at the end of the day. This is a game, not reality. IF you make a game so realistic its bordering un-fun, bang your head against the wall slogs than tweaking may need to be looked at.

To those that may say ""Well why dont you use your AI team mates"" I do. While they are busy clearing a room i asked them to do, im keeping an eye on the back. And ive had multiple times where an enemy just walks around the corner and just one shots. While im aiming at the door and firing back. And also with the AI team mates. They are so efficient that if i just rely on them to do everything, then whats the point of playing the game when the game can just play itself?

I never give thumbs down for any product that I buy because if I don't like it, maybe others might like it. This is my only exception, as this is one of those immersive, tacticool, muh-realism games.

The average human being has a reaction time of 250 milliseconds. The AI has a reaction time of 200 milliseconds with near perfect aim. They will react with impunity, despite being being shot, or theoretically dazed by whatever options you dish out. Moreover, they will always land near perfect shots and even *WALLBANG* you. 

Some other unrealistic scenarios would include thin and waifish female cult-members perfectly handling an SA58 with perfect recoil control on full auto. While I expect extremists to maybe be trained with firearms, I also don't expect fragile flowers to be proficient in firearms like Solid Snake. 

Ally AI is also worrisome but manageable, working quite well in small and relatively enclosed and predictable spaces but performing very poorly in long, unpredictable corridors. You are often babysitting your ally AI seesawing between making them clear out the room (they also have near perfect aim) and pulling them back because they're often walking into an open space that will get them killed. Takes the fun out of the game. 

It pains me to give a negative review; but it simply is unplayable after a certain point.",1705631774,1705631774,False,4,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

This game is a damn bust, it's just not that good. Despite what it says, the game may as well still be in early access. Still very buggy, still very unpolished, still very unfun. They want you to play the game slow, careful and tactical. But the AI just dissuade that playstyle, they're way too accurate, they have little to no regard for their own lives, they can see through objects sometimes and have a tendency to wallbang way, way too accurately. Trying to subdue them is an absolute waste, you need to be DIRECTLY in their line of sight with no object blocking them for them to hear you. And you need to wait for them to do something threatening in order to have permission to shoot them, but more often than not, giving them a chance to surrender ends up with them one-tapping you faster than a human can realistically react. Sometimes flashbangs and tasers have no effect on them, the latter, sure. But the former is ridiculous. And they can be kinda stupid too, for example they can fake their deaths and get up when the opportunity arises. But they get up the second you turn around, and if you collected their weapon already, they stand around like goobers waiting for you to arrest them again.

And on top of that, the performance in this game is abysmal. It gets REALLY laggy in some maps and in some rooms, it absolutely sucks and makes this game downright unplayable at times, since you need to be able to react quickly to situations.

All in all, this game's a joke. There are mods to sort of alleviate the issue, but you shouldn't have to turn to the community to fix the devs' problems.",1643159197,1705623680,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

however, in its current state, it is not worth £45 which it was marked up to after version 1.0. i personally believe that a price around the £20 (which i bought it for during early access) range is reasonable.

the gameplay is fun and immersive. the weapons are powerful and it is especially fun to play with friends. i don't particularly enjoy playing by myself but the commander mode is a nice touch.

my main gripe with the game is for one the awful performance. the game suffered performance issue in the past, though i was able to write them off considering the game was in early access. however, with the 1.0 release, i expected these issues to be ironed out; they were not. the game runs okay but the frame rate is not consistent and i frequently experience fps drops as well as general stuttering. this is not an issue with my pc as i definitely have a machine capable to run such a game. another major issue is the insane enemy ai that has inhuman accuracy and reaction times. sometimes you will try to command a suspect to drop their weapon and they will instantly turn into john wick and spin 180 and one tap you. this game is unforgiving and half the time, it feels you have no control over how you died.

Enemy AI are shooting through walls, they don't need LoS or anything, they know where you are and shoot you through walls.

Friendly AI is broken:
- They switch to their sidearm when they expend a rifle magazine, even if they don't have any sidearm ammo.
- They take forever to register enemy AI and get killed more often than they kill the enemy.
- They block doors.
- They drop their weapons unintentionally and run around WITHOUT GUNS for the rest of the match.


The new Singleplayer Commander mode sucks. JFC it's faster to ALT+F4 the game than it is to sit through the mission recap screen THAT CANNOT BE SKIPPED and then you have to walk through the entire Police station in order to reselect your mission and start it again; It's faster to ALT+F4 and relaunch the game than go through that BS, I've timed it.


I just noticed that in the trailer they falsely advertise being able to drag your injured teammates to safety, this is not possible. This feature isn't something that I necessarily want but don't falsely advertise something, don't be BF5.

I thought i bought a tactical swat game instead 6 days in Falluja is a joke compared to this, they just lack RPGs unfortunately. The devs decided to release the game unfinished before Christmas so they could earn more and they went on vacation for 1 month while people couldn't even play due to game breaking bugs. After they come back instead of fixing these issue they released an ""hotfix"" for localization adding new languages but guess what? Even those languages are broken and messed up.

The first person animations are satisfying and well-made. Finally, new content released (after a year without content updates). That's the end of compliments. 

Runs like a slideshow randomly every couple minutes even on potato settings, and somehow worse with each update while looking no better. Shoddy unreal marketplace assets are not to scale. Some of the more passable content has been removed for no reason at all. 

Most of all, devs are unable to address the biggest complaint about their game after two years in early access. Suspect AI will shoot you through multiple solid objects while strafing in full auto while your SWAT braindead teammates just bodyblocks you while telling you ""Get out of my spot"" and suicides to the aimbot suspects. Seriously, the wallhacks are such BS you'll get suppressed from bullets twenty rooms over that can't even penetrate that many wall. It's hilarious that they added replay mode to help advertise the game but the only content people make with it clowns on the terrible AI. What's sad is that players have made the same critiques of the enemy AI for a over a year. How many fixes to the AI in that time? Zero. 

For a PVE game the AI is worse than HL2 and singleplayer FPS  from twenty years ago. Programmers can't code anything remotely resembling something fun to play against so they just made their enemies ignore being shot, run around 180 spinning and spray you down because they know if the game is ""hard"" mouth breathers will gaslight themselves in to thinking there's actual ""tactics"" there. It's not just the AI, every mechanic (commander mode! ""gore and response mechanics""! command interface! ""nonlethal"" lmao) is half-baked and barely works as intended if at all.  Incompetent studio ran off with over 500 million dollars while pole riders still glaze them endlessly each time they ""update the game"" by fixing localization files. 

Once you realize the aimbot AI is a cover for developer skill issue you'll understand a lot more about why they were so desperate to turn this game in to a garbage R6 clone until they were literally forced to stop. And Void couldn't optimize a UE4 game to the low bar of playable for full release after a year of waiting.

This will be a quite long review, but if you want to get a good impression of the cons and pros of buying this game then take your time reading. There are potential spoilers on guns, maps and other stuff, so if you dont want to know anything about that i´d recommend you to skip my review. I will also edit this in the future (if possible) if anything changes. Two friends of mine and i bought the supporters edidion back in early 2023, and therefore played since late alpha or early beta, i can´t remember 100%. I have to admit that since then, the game made big progress. There is 18 Maps which look pretty decent, you can tell there was put a bunch of work into the artwork/graphics. Also the Lobby is freaking awesome with lot of nice features like a locker room, a shooting range, a testing/simulation/training area, a meeting room and more stuff. The maps subdivide into diff. sizes and difficulties, but most of them are fairly big & lets call it ""challenging"" (extremely difficult). Second of which has following underlying reasons:

-First, Ai is waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay too good. Not the challenging good but the unfair good. Most of the time they can shoot through walls and doors or seemingly bulletproof glass (you as Swat can´t shoot through it lol).

-Second, they tend to take a crazy amount of shots, not just from non lethal guns but also from Assault Rifles or Mp´s while you as swat even with steel plates and full body armor (strongest/best possible armor you can equip in the game)sometimes die from a few pistol shots (it gets more ridiculous than this, trust me).

I want to elaborate a little more on this point and give 2-3 good ingame examples we´ve encountered several Times in the last two weeks alone. There is a Map called Neon Tomb. Its basically a Night club occupied by terrorists. They are well equipped, hence i understand that they wont give up instantly when we shoot them with beanbags or they dont die instantly when shot in the stomach with an Mp several times. But how can it be that when one of them gave up, then pulls out his pistol, shoots me in my stomach or legs or whatever i instantly die?? I doubt that some terrorists are better equipped than fucking swat. Also, once i shot my ENTIRE Pistol mag in the Head, Neck and upper body of an attacker from 2m distance and he still survived. Like c´mon, seriously? But this alone wont be that bad. Now on another map, called Car Dealership, there are some gangsters (or at least simmilar looking) in the Workshop without ANY FKIN CLOTHING (upper Body not nude lol). Guess what, they took 7 Ak shots to the entire upper Body from round about 10m distance and were still standing. I on the other hand got 2 shottet by an AR. I get that the game wants to have high realistic standards, therefore you can´t do the John Wick and tank every bullet. BUT SO SHOULDN`T THE FUCKING ENEMIES, particularly those without ANY FUCKING ARMOR!? In some situations, the taser is more effective then a beanbag-shot. Bro the enemy has a 20cm thick armor on, long sleeves, a neck protection and a helmet. How tf is my taser able to penetrate his armor and his skin but my beanbag with 12 cal. cant do shit???

But i want to name a positive thing. They made the weapons super realistic. They behave like they would irl. The way you hold them, pull them, shooting sound, reloading, equippement (laser, rl laser, Flashlight, silencer, muzzle and much more), bullet ""consumption"" and recoil. A thing that bothers me tho is that on a mission, when you stand infront of a door and the enemy steps in, you hold your weapon up in the sky and cant shoot. This is to protect you from shooting a civilian or your m8´s when close to them, but Devs, PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD remove this feature when enemies are close to you because not being able to shoot fucking sux and is not realistic at all.

Now the last BIG problem with the game which is probably the most annoying one.

Me and my friends all have pretty decent computers, I do have a Nvidia 3090rtx 8gb, Intel I9 12900, 32Gb ram and windows 11 pro. My friends have similiar setups.
(Note: We all turned down the graphis to medium/low, important information for the next part!!)
When we chill in the lobby we usually have arround 150-200 fps. When we start a Mission, our fps instantly drop under 100, which itself isnt that bad. but the closer you get to the actual House/entrance/whatever, the more the fps drops. This happens on 16 of the 18 maps. Dont get me wrong, the maps are fucking beautiful. For example the (sun-)light, light reflection, shadows, houses, people, environment just everything looks so good. Even on low graphics. But how the hell is it possible that my frames tend to drop UNDER 30 FPS? Like my Setup is not that bad, i know there is better setups, obv, but man there is a lot of worse setups out there, how are the others able to play this game??? Just look on what they say on their website for recommended Components.  Its fucking ridiculous. An Intel I5 would be grilled, so would the 1060 and the Amd parts. I would bet that the game wouldnt even start the mission or you can grill some eggs and bacon after 2 minutes into the game, because even my setup (i have water cooling) gets over 90°C (about 200°F) occasionally. 

Don´t get me wrong, although all these things are terrible and annoying the game itself still makes fun, especially with friends. It´s just sad to see that the devs seem to give no fux on performance and balancing and focus more/too much on realism. I have no problem to play Neon Tomb for a couple of days every night for 3-4 hours to get it done non leathally and get the ""S"" on the map (definetly didn´t happen, i didnt jump from 22 hours on sunday to 47 hours today, thursday), but its the way how/why we played. It´s because there is sooooo much bugs and every try we die because of another Problem, You cant use gas for example because then enemies shoot you through it without being able to see. You can´t use shield because after getting shot once or twice the little glas is broken and you cant see anymore. You cant use c2 properly because even if the enemies stand 5 meters away from the door they die from it. You can use wedges, but ocasionally the enemies are still able to open the doors and flank you so we die. You can use Flash/stinger launcher, but ocasionally it just ""looses"" its mag so even if you did reload or you didnt shoot since the beginning of the mission there is no bullet inside. Also, if you die you can see the others helmet-cam, but the POV is BEHIND THE CAM ITSELF. It can´t be so hard to just eddit out the cam to make it look like we actually watch the cam, rather then seeing the whole fucking camera and the on/off button. Last thing i want to mention that the Team-cams you can use during the mission are peretty realsitic and well-made, but they also take like 10 to 20 fps, for which reason we have to stream each others view on discord so we can see what the others see.


So is it worth buying now? 100% NO! Rn there are way too many Problems that make the game A unplayable/hardly playable and B that take your fun playing the game. Is it worth buying if it is on sale or in the future? Depends on how much it costs and how much they work on it. Rn they are in their winter break but will resume work shortly. If its in sale for 20 Euro ish then yeah, i´d prolly recommend buying it and also in 4-6 Months from now they hopefully patched most of the stuff (especially the annoying things).

The Devs seem to put a lot of effort into adding onto the swat 4 formula, with riot shields, battering rams, door peeking, ect, but the effort is wasted due to the extreme difficulty where the AI will only surrender once they've been hit by something, and extreme awareness of their surroundings makes it so the main way your going to get a lot of them surrendering is either through your own AI companions all using non lethal, or by modding the game.

To the devs; replay swat 4 again. you'll notice that the AI do not immediately open fire once your spotted. some run for cover, some can get spooked if you sneak up on them and start yelling and will drop their guns, some will hesitate for a second giving you time to hit them with less lethal, some will just run away. you still need to be careful, but you can actually get through levels without having Aimbots just walking through the place cracking heads. your next update NEEDS to be an AI fix, or your game will be dumped on eternally.

Edit: Oh yes, it would also be advisable if you decided to massively overhaul what counts as visible for AI so that you don't have firefights between two inch cracks in the scenery.",1663991332,1705551747,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

-Performance is spotty 
-AI have insane reaction times and accuracy for people who are, with the some exceptions, usually average people who have no firearms training. Their reaction speed and accuracy are not affected by suppressing fire or even being wounded multiple times.
-They can track you after cutting line of sight perfectly and are able to wall bang you with ease.
-Smoke and foliage offer no cover from them.
-Video of AI being crazy in demos: https://youtu.be/EiL1b3obwwI?si=XDq07LR9AkIAMe-A
-There are lots of small issues like the compass turning itself off after every single restart of a mission which is very aggravating for a game where callouts are needed.
-The new demo system cannot be turned off which is going to drain resources (a workaround is to remove write permissions to the demo folder).
-Mault IR laser obstructs iron sights on the MP9, i could understand this oversight if all attachments were available on all guns, but they aren't.
-Removal of being able to see your weapon while modifying it.

Devs, take note, people are making youtube videos and reddit posts about the crappy AI and have been since the game came out. Nobody wants to play your game because it feels like the enemy has aimbot and wallhacks. They can see through window blinds, CS gas, dense bushes, tiny single-pixel gaps, and their reaction times are stupid. All of this compounded with their unrealistic marksmanship makes a game that is just not fun to play.

Regardless, I do feel that this review does have some merit, but ultimately it is not wise to put it as not recommended despite my personal issues with it, as I truly do recommend it.)

Online, the game definitely is fun between going ham on civilians, and actually trying to play the game tactically. However, with single player, I feel that I am forced to play more tactically, which in of itself is not a bad thing. That's why I bought the game. However, with the cracked out AI that shoots you across the map because there was a box that it decided to not register as a solid object, I do not have fun, and it does not feel like intentional game design at all. 

The issues with the AI started to show this issue in the Ides of March mission when I tried to S rank it, however I simply brushed that off as them being better fortified and equipped due to their military ties. As for Greased Palms, my experience has been completely awful. Getting insta-killed from across the map, having the teammate AI decide to shoot the armed target we have to take in alive, and civilians dying in the cross fire. I have not managed to beat it a single time to the degree that it wants me to without either someone dying who needed to live, or dying myself. 

This is also not to mention the Rainbow Six inspired system of different individual officers you can hire and operate with. Though, this feature seems under-baked, and actively hinders the already infuriating single player game play. The concept is very interesting, however I feel it should be optional, as it adds basically nothing aside from the copy and paste abilities certain officers hold.

The game is **really** good for those looking for a SWAT game, though, and I've absolutely had a blast with friends. But OH. MY. GOODNESS. The AI does not seem ready for long sight lines like in Greased Palms, and until the issue of every criminal being John Wick or Chris Kyle gets addressed and solved, I do not feel I can give this a positive rating.",1705031147,1705537973,True,0,0,0.52173912525177002,1,True,False,False

There was a huge issue as of 1.0, that as of time of this review has yet to be addressed. The game used to be very well optimized, and this update dropped my frames nearly in HALF.

I mention this so that hopefully the developers fix this silly issue, and anyone having performance bugs can play the game the way it used to play.",1705533995,1705533995,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

- Maps are very detailed and overally well made, easy to achieve high immersion especially if you do the debrief. Some maps are hard to contain into ""hallways"" using doorwedges, which creates a logical challenge to make your team have safe flanks.

However. I feel like some (literally few) of the maps are WAY too big and complicated for a 5 man crew to do all the work. I found myself going all the way back my steps for one missed civillian too often to call it fun.
Sometimes the immersion is botched because of not interactive doors that a simple wheelcart was put against them. But OK at least i see clearly the boundaries of maps (except the postage center. I got lost there many times)

AI - Wow very good. enemies and civilians are sometimes hard to distingiush. Erratic movement to covers or run aways, Stubborn slow backing away almost like no guns are pointed their way. It really excercises your perception, especially if you have multiple contacts in the room. 

As for friendly TEAM AI - Awesome, in 95% of time they will be far more coordinated than any of your friends you might be playing with. their movement is smooth, thresholds are checked, suspects are dead, and civies are secured. And they look cool while doing it. 95% of time.

As for other 5% of time, some might go to different floor of freaking building because they decide it will be perfect spot to be for ""stack up"" command for door in the room you just cleared. If you dont notice officer go on the adventure and stop him, you will loose him to some dude with a knife.
Also whole group tend to return fire through solid walls if any of you are shot at. It creates very chaotic situation where most of the time you will die to suspect with a pistol because whole team just unleashes their whole magazines around you and therefore SUPRESSES you, and yet none of the bullet have a slightest chance to reach the threat. and you die because you cant shoot straight because screen shakes and vision gets blurry etc. Its even worse when you try to go lesslethal and they just pepper spray everything. (I heard that developers are trying to fix it so i hope that it will be treated)

Whats more?
-Guns are fun to shoot, have slick animations and every hit on target is satysfying. Altough im sick of AR platforms and there is no reason to use anything but rifles.

-The carreer mode and whole hiring and ""grooming"" your team officers is fun and innovative way to make you want to spare as much lifes of suspects as you can, and yet be careful in it. Loosing experienced team member is somewhat painful. And they can not only die but also resign from duty due to killing too many OR killing the suspects that they think dont deserve to die (As for example ""ends of the earths"" mission)

- As for said ""ends of the earth"" The missions, they vary from lore-filled masterpieces to axceptable scenarios. Some I accomplished on the first try, some (and sometimes because of lore i wanted to go lesslethal) I passed after more or less 30-50 tries. Seriously.

- Game is not afraid of depicting gruesome, shocking, tears inducing scenarios. question morality of people. Sometimes you will feel like you are the one who's on the wrong side.

- Great replayability due to rating score. I passed the campain as best as I could and now going for S rank on the rest. and then I will probably have some fun and then play some online etc. I have like thousand of hours on SWAT 4 so this game might just provided old sierra games masterpiece to retirement.

My biggest downside is that it doesnt feel completed. As it was announced in 2016 or 2017 it feels like 1.0 release was a little cheated. it plays and is amazing but some things are off. SWAT 4 spoiled us with expansed, detailed and very immersive voicelines. Here they are meh to OK, many more should be added. 
Many things misses their image data in the customization menu and there are many bugs in it.

Overally game kinda feels more like its release 0.95 where many things doesnt require poilishing but grinding before polishing. It does not feel like its out of late BETA. But well many AAA games that comes out recently comes out in even worse state and then is being fixed. Certainly for RoN scenario will be similiar.

And so... Very good game. If you liked SWAT 4 then you won't be dissapointed. It literally feels and plays like SWAT 5. I love it, and was waiting for such game for 18 years. and Im ashamed I didnt purchased supporters edition.

Ready or Not's level of realism is unparalleled, in my opinion, it really shows you what it is like to be SWAT and how making any mistake can cost you your life. How hard it is to make the right decisions in intense moments and sheds light on why reality plays out the way it does.

A suspect gave up, you assume they aren't a threat, you turn your back to arrest another suspect? Well the other suspect had a gun and now you are dead. Or they had a knife and now you are dead. It really sucks you into the role you play and shows you the darkness that these people face.

I fully respect and thank the team that helped create this game and give me the ability to see into a realm I typically wouldn't be able to. This game is eye opening and also a blast to play with 4 other friends, the most fun that i can remember in a long time.

Alright, the main issue I have with this game is extremely fixable; the suspect AI are ALL psychopathic cop killers who WANT to die. The way every suspect acts would be fine for terrorists, or like the ""Russian mobster"" guys in later levels, but it makes no sense for the majority of suspects like criminals who held up a gas station, security guards, or my favorite; random people in their own apartments. These ""suspects"" will:
 1. Always be armed. (And we're talking 50 round smgs first level, AKs second level)
 2. Always shoot at cops. (Do you remember suspects running away in SWAT 4? Yeah no one ever runs away in this game, they just attack you until one of you dies.) They'll literally bust down doors to attack officers they hear yelling.
 3. Never surrender from being yelled at. (And also barely ever surrender when SHOT, like legitimately they'll surrender to a beanbag gun shot, but not a real bullet.)
 4. Fake surrender like 25% of the time, just to try to kill you, and throw their life away, even when they're under gunpoint from your entire team. They'll fake dying to gunshots too.
 5. Grab hostages.
 6. Shoot through walls. (The best part is when your SWAT AI shoots back through walls and kills civilians - yes, this happens.) Special shout-out to the Private Security who will spray through cover with automatic rifles upon seeing part of your leg, and thus kill their own co-workers.

Every single suspect, from Terrorists, Mobsters, School-shooters, Cultists, Crack-heads, Gas Station robbers,  random people in their own homes, FBI AGENTS (Yes there is a target on a level who is a ""FISA"" agent)... they all act either exactly the same, or so similar that it really is impossible to tell the difference.

This game is a great first person shooter, and I've had a lot of fun goofing around in multiplayer, but this is supposed to be a SWAT game, and the AI just takes me out of it so much, they are so over the top bloodthirsty. Again, no problem with later levels with actual terrorists and stuff like that. SWAT 4 ends with you fighting armored, machine gun toting terrorists as well, (Ironically I think they're still less insane than regular Ready Or Not suspects) but it starts with pretty simple levels, with suspects who act more or less how they should. Level 2 in this game tells you that you're going to stop a hostage situation with ONE PERSON. Instead you fight 11 petty criminals, who, in their own apartments, with no fore-warning from the police, just walk around armed, and decide that they all want to die today.

The ridiculous part about this is that I remember the suspects actually being much more reasonable when the game first launched on steam.

I could make a whole other review going over other issues like bugs (TONS OF BUGS), the AI being stupid, the game not being particular stable, matchmaking not working well, mod.io being awful, optimization being really bad, the briefings lying, the lack of info the game gives players, bad development decisions - like remaking the same levels over and over, the recent update being a massive letdown, removing a bunch of variants for levels, removing weapons (that are still referenced in the game btw)... I wanted to focus on a more foundational issue with the game's design. All of things things can be changed, and If they would just fix the insane AI, I would recommend this game.

 If this was say... Ground Branch, the AI would be acceptable, good even, if you ignore the bugs... but this is supposed to be a SWAT game.

I notice in other reviews people saying that everyone just needs to ""git gud"". I want to be clear, this is not a difficulty thing. I've S ranked most of the levels including the last one, and completing all of the levels isn't hard. The AI is just so far removed from natural behavior that it completely ruins all immersion. 

OH AND THE DLC IS A LIE. """"SERVARE VITAS"" - Conduct operations under the banner of the United States' most elite tactical unit, the FBI's Hostage Rescue Team, with this unique DLC. "" 
I have to add this in here, because I feel that it's relevant to the scummy-ness of the devs, and because I only just became aware of it; After the newest update, they removed the ""supporter edition"" from steam, no warning as far as I know. and now EIGHT of the TWELVE bullet points from the DLC are either a direct lie, or haven't released yet. All of the outfits and the shield got changed to remove the FBI and HRT writing, the rifle is named differently, the gas-mask got changed for no reason, we're still missing the coyote camo uniform, the supporter test branch hasn't been used in months (which honestly I like, but still it was promised) the soundtrack has not been released, and there's ZERO information about the promised next DLC. AND YOU KNOW WHAT, THEY MADE ZERO MENTION OF THIS IN THE UPDATE NOTES!!!!!!!! CAN YOU TELL I'M PISSED? I may have my problems with the game.. but learning about this made my blood boil. You officially launch the game and make zero mention about how you just screwed over people who payed you 70 EXTRA DOLLARS.

If you want to just go massacre people in Coop this game can be fun with randoms... sometimes. It can also be extremely frustating - people dying constantly, not even trying to work together, killing everyone. 1 in 1,000 matches you'll actually get a decent team that can properly go non-lethal, and those are the best experiences.

If you want a good singleplayer SWAT game, this is not it. My recommendation would be to go get SWAT 4 on GOG (It's not on steam) and honestly also get the SWAT: Elite Force mod, it's just adds more content and fixes some bugs.",1702590331,1705525829,False,329,8,0.863357365131378174,33,True,False,False

To actually complete later game levels you have two options, flash-bang, and CS everything, or shoot almost immediately after seeing a suspect. Some of the most memorable moments in SWAT 4 for me, weren't the gunfights, it was interacting with the AI in a way that felt believable, in Ready or Not most of the time the levels just turn into massive shootouts the second you enter, regardless of the scenario. To top it all off as of 1 month after launch there has been a single hot fix which didn't even address the main complaints with the game, and there has been little to no communication about what is happening or if they are even planning on fixing anything more.

Full release of Ready or Not is incredible, especially for the size of the dev team. Holy. 
The game is a real nice breath of fresh air in the shooter scene, something siege and the other shit hero shooters can't fill. I miss SWAT man :( and RoN will fill that role.

Sadly the launch isn't without its flaws; mainly the AI. 
It's like fighting against Al-Qaeda special operations group. These mfers have aimbot, wallhacks, 360% degree vision, MW juggernaut suits and bombs absolutely everywhere. No fucking way are a bunch of mexican border hoppers and some junkies more well equipped and better at firefights than SWAT OFFICERS. 

The AI in general will target you through Jerry's fucking mouse hole and shoot a 7.62 caliber round straight through your dome no matter the body armor or cover you have. You CANNOT combat these little fucks. They're literal Overwatch Top 500 Hanzo mains

On the contrary, your AI is batshit retarded. They're so dumb its actually questionable if their intelligence programming is supposed to be a indication to real life cops in the US. They'll get stuck on doors, shoot at walls for no reason (ALARMING THE WHOLE MAP) and also turn their backs completely on suspects they know are there, to EVIDENCE BAG A FUCKING CONDOM FILLED WITH COKE ON THE GROUND. 

Ontop of that; half of the levels have the worst lighting known to man-kind, it might even be worse than tarkov. In a game where you have to meticulously scan each room and have noticeable target acquisition finding the thug is like playing Where's Waldo but he's a crackhead with snub nosed revolver and no intentions to surrender.

But... you can kill a furry otaku pedo streamer in the game..

Ready or not is a paradoxical game. 

On one hand it provides gripping, tactical gameplay with many improvements in AI, graphics, and mission design.

Only, that's what VOID seems to think.

In reality the AI is a complete mess, the AI are not intelligent, the AI cheat, they wallbang you, they have ridiculously precise aim that only the most on the ball players can effectively deal with, regardless of the enemy. It doesn't matter if you're fighting War veterans, druggies, or security guards, they all have perfect and sometimes impossible aim, miraculously able to pinpoint your location regardless of the situation.

I should also add there's a complete lack of optimisation, even if you have a good system like I do, which is the minority, you will still run into issues. If your computer isn't beefy, then you'd best look for something else because this isn't it. 

Flashbangs do not work, the enemy will wallbang you. You cannot play Ready or Not like a normal SWAT game, because the AI will not allow you to.

The ai does not have a sense of self-preservation, they are the terminator if terminator was human, they are emotionless trigger-hungry robots.

The subtitles in the game, are not made manually, VOID took the lazy way out and AI generated the subtitles. 

VOID, honestly, is such a lazy dev team, it's beggars belief, instead of making competent AI, they take the CA route and just give it tons of cheats to mask it's ineffectiveness.",1693634149,1705505229,False,3,0,0.502756953239440918,0,True,False,True

Devs are actual clowns - if you create more loadouts than fits on screen - there is no slider, no scrolling, your earliest loadouts are just gone lol). The game is prone to crashing when going back to the station and using the loadout table. And it's not patched since release.
Horrible lighting in the elite hotels, literally worse than Darktide's factories.
Highly inconsistent bullet penetration (9mm of AI goes through a window with a mesh, but your AP 300 BLK doesn't).

---BEGIN REVIEW---

It's incredible. Even if you're not a tactical shooter person, it is still worth playing. The devs are very active and communicative, and watching this game grow and improve has been a joy the past years.

The only thing I could complain about is performance, I suspect with such active development optimization has taken a back seat. Still, I have no trouble getting 100s of frames at medium settings, 1440 ultra wide and the game still looks great.

There are some problems with the game however. The AI, can be completely cracked at times. They can see you through walls, as well as kill you with no line of sight. The game also seems to be very unstable. I have experienced frequent crashes, random frame drops in certain rooms, and enemy guns either de-spawn, or are invisible to certain players. 
Even in it's current state, the game is something special. If the developers continue to add maps, weapons, and game modes on top of tweaking the AI and fixing the bugs, this game will be legendary.

If you are looking for a hardcore, tactical swat shooter game where the goal isn't to simply destroy everything in sight, this game is for you. If you are looking for a polished shooter game, you may want to wait and see how it continues to develop.

Game is still fun. There are more levels although it seems that the alternative game modes have been taken out for some reason, which is unfortunate. 

The swat bots are not quite as dumb as they used to be, but they still have their moments.

The enemy bots are maybe a bit better tuned, but they still will randomly go agro and shoot you 32 times through three walls and a dumpster occasionally even if you are walking and opening things softly. This ends up being the only really big frustration in the game. If you enter loud and kick things then sure they should respond by shooting through the door or wall or whatever, but this random super-bot-rage that they seem to get occasionally can ruin a slow methodical run, which is just frustrating. 

You shoot back and there's no flinch, you flash them and they don't care, the superbotrage cometh for thee. They know exactly where you are and they have perfect accuracy. 

Hopefully more tuning to come for the bots, and hopefully the additional modes will come back.

Still worth playing, although with the price increase I might be less forgiving if I had bought it now and got randomed constantly by superbotrage. So maybe pick it up on sale.

___

Game is fun but still clearly a work in progress.

Hopefully the current maps will all get every mode (bomb, hostage, etc.), and more maps would be nice, although there are already a solid group of them. The level design keeps things interesting and the attention to detail on the environments is impressive.

The enemy AI sometimes seems to go a bit nuts, somehow hearing you from several rooms away and starting to try to shoot you through a few walls. It also occasionally will prefire you through a corner or door (this happens less often if you are moving quietly, but still seems to happen sometimes). I like how the bots flank, and try to ambush you when you're cuffing someone so hopefully the devs are tuning the enemy behavior during early access to iron out the rough edges.

If you play solo expect to shoulder most of the work since your swat bots are kind of potatoes. Swat bots do okay in a heads up fight, but I have watched as an enemy approaches from behind them, and slowly, one at a time with pauses between, kills them all without them even reacting. If you point them toward a room with enemies they seem to do a bit better when they move to engage.",1678431920,1705475611,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True
1144200,156153192,76561198329284492,0,8,4198,0,2649,1707164861,"I got this game a very long time ago, around the time it came into early access. Now, I have some love hate with this game. A little back ground is that I play shooters from Halo to CoD to Escape from Tarkov. So I would like to think I have experiences various types of AI from adaptable AI from MGSV to bullet sponge cover seeking blitz rushers of The Division series. 

I do have background in military and see that this game does implement entering clearing buildings and managing a team size element but really its a squad since you have Alpha team and Bravo team. Anyways the game play as far as that aspect is amazing and very well handled. The uncertainty of what is on the other side, will it be a short room or a long room? Will you hook left or right? etc. not to mention using the environment to both the players advantage and AI advantage suddenly a wall that only sticks out roughly 3 feet is now your worst enemy because of lack of sight in that area.

Weapons and customization are both honestly great and not outrageous like having a magnum with a 12x scope and a pink paint on it. Simple weapon customization sight, barrel, rail system and that is all you need and you can make load-outs for your team and save certain ones. What is great is that you can Juggernaut up, go full operator, or defender of peace with pepper and bean bags its all there! As far and player and team you can not make your own officer sadly but there are few things such as shirt, helmet, gloves, pants, boots, small arm tattoos, watch, glasses/ gas mask, and kit (body armor) small things but it is something. I wouldn't mind if they get the chance to add more stuff. Doesn't need to be crazy, I don't need cat ears on my helmet. Maybe add patches? Wouldn't also hurt to add females, because why not? I mean sure you can mod the game but I rather keep mine vanilla.

Now the AI, the most controversial thing in this game that deals with violent crimes that we have seen in the real world. Yes, I can agree the AI is insane and makes the game rough to play. But, to me I feel it's a great way to keep us in check. When I first started playing this game I figured it was going to be like Rainbow Six from the early years. Manage some guys but you still get to be the hero. No, not in this game, YOU ARE A LEADER! Lead your men assist where needed that is how I've cleared most of the game in the commander mode where if and officer goes down you lose him forever if he dies and you have to monitor you team's mental state. Everybody wants to be a cowboy but nobody wants to be a sheriff. I do hope they tone down the AI in the game a little but if they don't then oh well. I mean whats the difference form this simulator then to facing someone on R6 Seige or CoD that wall bangs? 

All in all I can recommend this to people who want a challenging game to play solo or with a friend. $50 is not a bad price especially with how much games cost now-a-days so if you have that money to spend then okay, if you don't then wait and do more research ALSO a lot of the game play you see on YouTube IS MODDED so take what you see with a grain of salt.

If you're not a fan of the tactical FPS shooter genre, I wouldn't recommend it. This isn't your COD run and gun, or takes no skill kind of FPS shooter. This game is what Siege should have, and could have been. Honestly I was skeptical to throw $50 at it, but I love gambling; which is why I didn't refund it when I was very short of the 2 hour steam refund in game time and still could have.

I played the single player for about 8-9 hours and it's not bad, but compared to the multiplayer it is such a let down. I was scared to try the multiplayer, expecting myself not to be good enough; or have the comms/braincells for it. However after a few runs you'll get the hang of it, learn comms, and figure out how to truly strategize with any team. The multiplayer experience is so good I haven't been able to put this game down, its a mix of Siege and Tarkov in the greatest of ways. It'll have you on the edge of your seat no matter how many times you play a certain map or how many hours you put into the game. 

When it comes to maps and gear, this game nails it pretty well. Especially considering she's just now truly ""released"" and still has a ton of potential. However it could use some more of everything, more attachments, sights, maybe cosmetics, weapons (especially non lethal). Again though, she's a fresh product so I have very high expectations and look forward to an even better assembly at one point or another. 

Mods on the other hand are also super fun and unique, just like about any game there's 3rd party mods with mod launchers; or from simply importing the files. This game has its own built in mods/launcher that is extremely easy to use, and not so easy to remove (to return to Vanilla game you have to remove all mods, there is no separate launch Vanilla game feature). Since your not using a mod launcher or 3rd party mods, you have to manually uninstall all the mods imported inside the vanilla game through your games directory files and there's no way to save or bookmark them. So if you don't screenshot them or write them down, you may lose some personal favorites for a while. Overall though the mods are very enjoyable and range from zombies, to custom guns, anime girl characters + voices, new maps, visuals, and even more (no sex mod unfortunately).

Playing for 30 hours in this ""wonder,"" I can note the following things (mostly negatives that you need to understand when purchasing this game):

1. The game is not worth its money relative to the content you get; consider buying it only at a 50% discount (as there are no interesting mechanics in the game - join, kill, try not to die from bots shooting with prefires).
There are quite a few glitches with textures. In one multiplayer session with friends, some people may see dropped weapons from criminals, while others do not. There are bugs with attached elements, like armor, which constantly detach from the model and fly off.

2. Bots are something else. Starting with allies who can get stuck in the texture of a ladder, ending with enemies. The enemies are a real horror; you can play stealthily, move carefully, change positions, but it's all useless. All bots are by default in ""ready"" mode, always waiting for you in the right place with a pre-aimed scope at the head, occasionally shooting with a prefire. Sometimes, bots in light body armor or even without it can survive two shotgun shots from a distance of 5-7 meters. Also, if the mission is about to end and you get killed, you can't count on your bot allies. If an enemy bot gets stuck somewhere, your comrades will just stand in place and wait, and the enemy bot won't move (tested, waited for 30 minutes, they did nothing, just stood and waited).

3. The surrendering mechanic is also terrible. Bots often shoot you before surrendering, and they don't care if you come from behind alone and threaten with a shotgun or if there are 5 people with lasers aimed at them. They might ignore you and stare at you, and after the 10th time you shout ""on your knees,"" they might think about it, after which they may either open fire or pretend to throw their gun, then retrieve it and repeat this 2-3 times. The surrendering mechanics with a taser and pepper spray are also horrible. If you shoot a taser, be ready for the bots to not care; they might continue shooting at you or run towards other bots, ignoring the taser shots. The same applies to the pepper spray; they might start shooting or run towards other bots, and they won't care about shots aimed at their legs.

4. It's unclear how to adjust the difficulty of bots, especially in multiplayer. Therefore, if you want to run around and have fun with friends over a beer, this game is not for that. Be prepared to sweat and restart the mission 142 times per session (and you won't even be able to move far from the spawn point). I also noticed that there is some kind of ironman mode. If it's enabled by default in online mode, it explains the difficulty of the bots but doesn't justify their cheating gameplay. If something less than this difficulty level is in multiplayer, I'm afraid to imagine what the bots can do at this difficulty level, considering that regular bots kill with prefires.

5. There's no proper mission planning system where you can collectively study the plan, the estimated number of criminals, their locations, preparations, and equipment. Your maximum is a text brief with 5k characters, a map image, and a tablet with a building plan where you can put some marks, but their meaning I still don't understand. Also, in multiplayer, there's a lack of the ability to add bots. If you're playing with a friend, just the two of you in 90% of cases won't be enough, considering the bot's strength. Having the ability to add 2 bots for assistance would be an ideal solution for this.

6. Equipment and its customization also leave much to be desired, especially in weapon attachments. Why have a x1-x12 scope in close-quarters shootouts? Why not add more holographic sights and variations of reticles for them? The standard one is too bulky and obstructive. Why aren't there extended magazines, additional pouches for ammo, and various types of ammunition? Why can't you take two masks for a mission, ballistic and gas masks, for example? Or ballistic goggles, gas masks, or ballistic goggles, anti-flash goggles, gas masks? Due to these limitations, your operation must be tailored to either clearing everyone by tanking damage or gas flooding or bombarding with flashbangs.

7. Additional scenarios. While playing, you'll always wonder why the special forces, in the developers' representation, are so clumsy. Why can't you launch gas or cut off the power before entering the building? In some places, adding the ability to descend on a rope, jump/leap over obstacles, shoot from a supported position, or from cover (peeking with q/e doesn't always help because bots have aim assist and will inevitably hit you in the head) would be great. It might be more common in third-person view games, but I don't see the difficulty in adapting this mechanic.

8. Сlose combat, which is nonexistent. If you get close to a criminal, for example, with a shield, when you approach close enough, the bot will start shooting through the shield because the bot's hands will pass through it. Strikes won't bother the bot, and it will only start shooting harder, so attempting to knock it down is not worth it. If you stun an enemy, you can't do anything to them except shout to drop the weapon. While you shout and hope for their surrender, they'll just start shooting at you. There's a lack of a knife/additional taser that you can use in direct contact with an opponent. If you approach a bot with a weapon, your character will simply lower the weapon (similar to walking with space), and you won't be able to shoot while the bot can. You also cannot use anything other than a pistol while playing with a shield.

9. And lastly, the most amusing part is penalties during mission progression related to hostages and criminals. If you start shooting at an enemy who aimed at you and suddenly runs away - penalty. If you neutralize an enemy from a distance - penalty. If you strike out of anger during their prefires - penalty. If a hostage (with 5 lasers on them) doesn't kneel on the 5th demand, and you decide to hit them - penalty. If a hostage starts reaching into their pocket for a phone (as it turns out later) and begins taking pictures of you ((WHO CAME UP WITH THIS ANIMATION AND BEHAVIOR FROM THE DEVELOPERS)) and you hit them for the stupidity (better to forget about the developer of this nonsense) - penalty. This is a potential threat to an employee. In the USA, police usually shoot someone for such behavior on the street, but here the special forces during the arrest of armed criminals who shoot at them throughout the mission.

The only thing enjoyable in this game is shooting at african-american partners and the opportunity to play cooperatively without renting any servers or doing any server dance.",1705460764,1705460764,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

I loved SWAT 4 and its mods and truly thought that this game was a true successor to that golden classic. With the release of 1.0, I no longer hold that belief. I thought the early level design had deep storytelling, inconsistent but interesting AI, and a great tactical feel to it. I even got S rank on all the early levels before some of the latest were added so I really got to explore each level (because I died a lot). This 1.0 release felt really rushed. So many levels were completely transformed out of nowhere and many things that I thought would be ironed out (like the ridiculously unfair AI) have either been kept or made worse. I've completed the singleplayer commander mode and I just feel kinda empty. It was a real meh experience with an emphasis on flashiness and over the top shock value in level design (The back of Hokan Port is ridiculous I mean come on) rather than deep gameplay mechanics. The fact they made a giant police station acting as a really clunky and inconvenient menu (you can't restart a singleplayer level without two loading screens, a countdown, and a short walk) kinda shows me they value looks over functionality. Managing a squad feels pointless, they die all the time and the only penalty is possibly losing an acquired ability which is next to worthless. Judge, the main character, and his squad have no personality or banter other than a few lines at the end of the game. So much could have been learned from SWAT 4. Level design there had subtlety and handled sensitive topics extremely well. Your squad had good quips to really flesh each of their personalities. AI was differentiated and reacted like real people in that situation. I'm just really disappointed and it hurts to write this review. I would only recommend this game if you have friends to play with or enjoy coop with strangers. I just can't recommend the base singleplayer experience and really hope this game goes in a better direction. I'm going to stick with SWAT 4 on GOG with the Elite Force and First Responders mods.

OLD REVIEW: Even though it is currently unfinished, I can say that Ready or Not is a solid experience and truly the successor to SWAT 4 we needed. I applaud the development team for the progress they've made since this project's conception.

The new A.I is really good and the perk system is cool but doesn't feel all that impactful tbh, I like the fact that after you clear a level you can command them to search it for anything you left behind which is a really good feature. A lot of my early access review still stands about the fact trying to get people to surrender is way harder than just gunning them down, although if you are close enough and pointing at the back of their head they will usually actually get down now, but if I pump 2 buckshots into you body armor or not you should surrender. The fact that they will just trace you through walls after breaking line of sight is also incredibly annoying because not very often but sometimes if they know you exist, NOT Where you are just simply that you exist, they will wall bang you, feels very unsatisfying and angering. Nearly impossible if it's just you and a friend, they should allow you to bring A.I depending on how many players there are, just ONE would be helpful enough, it's all I ask for. Overall a solid game I would still recommend buying it if you are gonna play solo or have more than one friend willing to play it. still an 8.8/10


Early access review:
Very good tactical shooter, I'd say wait till it's on sale although I think its worth the price. I've played this game a bit more and I have to say that this game is insanely fun ESPECIALLY with friends, but it has a huge problem, this game is honestly harder taking it tactically and trying to make people surrender than just run and gunning with flashbangs. When I'm pointing a gun at the back of their head and tell them to get down they shouldn't 180 on the drop of a dime and insta-kill me. Limit the rate of how fast the bots can turn to an actual human degree because its so dumb to get 360 no-scoped by some methhead.

I have played the game for nearly 2 years now, hopping on and off every so often. Since 1.0, I’ve put in about 50 hours. I’ve completed every level on S rank. I have seen everything 1.0 has to offer, and it is not enough.

It is not nearly enough to be a “final release”. Because that’s what 1.0 is intended to be: the final working product capable of standing on its own without content updates. It is not that. The developers have not only removed content from pre-1.0 (which reduced replayability massively), they have not even finished the game. There are voice lines that are clearly placeholders, story is barely there, they used crappy AI to write their subtitles for them (“George M.” for “door jam”, “talk” for “TOC”, etc.), they generated half the images in their game with AI (hyperbole, yes, but it’s still a ridiculous amount), and they haven’t even made an enjoyable enemy experience. They kill you through walls, they’ll shoot you if they see a pixel, they’ve shot me through objects even my armor piercing rounds don’t go through, and it’s generally unfair. 

Not only that, but every AI is identical. No matter the context of the level, every AI behaves the same. There is a level where some kids were making automatic weapons to pay for their elderly parents’ medical treatment. I have seen them take their own mother, who is still in a hospital gown and recovering from some illness or surgery, hostage. I have seen terrorists shoot themselves in the head without provocation (in the replay recordings). The AI is fundamentally garbage, and all of them function identically like they’re Ex-Delta Force operatives with 500 confirmed kills regardless of if they’re a drugged up teen at a robbery, a methhead in his house, or a private military security guard. Every suspect is the same.

Levels are oversized as well. How often would a 5 man SWAT team clear a multi-floor hospital that’s been taken over by terrorists all on their own? How often would they take on a school campus with multiple active shooters and bombs on their own with 5 people? How often would a five man team be sent in to clear an entire port? 

On top of all the content and general gameplay issues, the performance is now abysmal. I have a 3080, 64 gbs of RAM, a 13600k, and this game is on an SSD. Before 1.0, this game ran perfectly. I had 0 stutters or frame drops below 144 (my cap). Now, I get 60 half the time. The other half, I get 40 or less. Something the devs did fundamentally broke the performance, and I have no idea what. Everything looks just as it did before, but now I get crap performance.

Edit: Have to add on another complaint now: Suspects and civilians will sometimes spawn in areas that cannot be reached or will cease to exist. Three times now, when I've replayed the Voll House mission with friends, suspects shot in the basement will just pop out of existence. This can softlock the game and forces you to restart the level as you cannot Bring Order to Chaos or, in some cases, the guy you're there to arrest will sometimes disappear while in there. In addition, on the post office level, Voll House, and hospital, I have had civilians spawn inside of solid objects in such a way that they cannot be arrested, preventing completion of the levels. 
The developers promised to release hotfixes throughout the first week after launch. They stopped 2 days later, on December 17th, and went on vacation. Since then, we have gotten ZERO updates from them about anything.

cons: When playing with friends we often experience FPS issues, even with powerful machines. Game is not optimized perfectly (yet). I’m expecting in upcoming weeks/months we might get update for this and it won’t be issue anymore.

Tip for developers: I think there should be game-mechanics, that once all bad guys are dead/ arrested, and you’re just running around trying to collect evidence and civilians - in that point f button for yelling should be changed to something like “police here, make a sound, anyone here?” or anything, that would trigger civilians to speak up, so you can find them. Because the amount of time we spent running around on empty map, looking for that ONE last civilian hidden somewhere is annoying. :D",1705445652,1705445652,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I'm keeping the review as a positive as the core gun-play is still the best out there, and the dev team is limited in personnel, it's just EVERYTHING around it has been messed with in some way.

Loading times are egregious, there's a mandatory 30 second wait when starting a mission (not including walking to the briefing room from the other side of the police station due to bad spawns locations, or the score count after a death which takes the same amount of time as a successful mission, or watching the squad have a little cry after their lead gets killed execution style as they couldn't be arsed to handcuff a guy you asked 3 times to cuff)
Add all that in, you can spent over a minute in loading, only to get domed 15 seconds into a mission

Suspect AI are all clones of the T-800 terminator, only way to catch them off guard is to use stealth exploits (peak door then body push it open), they hardly surrender when caught from behind they instead spinbot you, they have pinpoint accuracy in their ""aware phase"", they can wallbang though every surface with pistol calibre weapons, they are immune to stingers/flashes 60% of the time, they can see through exterior glass (you can't), if you don't wedge every door on the map they start roaming at the first sound of intrusion, they can pixel peak. Every suspect will get back up at least once, most will twice and pull arsenals out their arse. And worst of all, every suspect whether battle-hardened vet or scared teens fucking up a gas station robbery will have the morale of the most suicidal jihadi on earth

Squad AI are simultaneously smarter and yet tarded, they have better execution of commands. If they want to follow them, often they stand still frozen. Don't trust them to throw a nade in a room in a competent way, if the room is a corridor and you're attacking it on the long side, that nade will be thrown straight ahead instead of down the corridor affecting 0 people. If you're attempting the hell known as the non lethal run, don't give them shotguns as they will just kill people but then again they'll magdump with the pepperball, miss 75% of the shots, let the suspect run away, leave 1 ball in the magazine, start the next fight and get killed when they THEN have to reload.
They are fucking DETERMINED to path through wherever you're stood, there could be a gap the size of the Titanic, but if you are in front of that straight line they chose get used to hearing that you're in their spot. 

The fact that every map is meant to be tied into a greater narrative is detrimental, the new streamer map was teased as a tutorial mission to not go in guns blazing as it turns out to be a swatting incident and nothing more. But now this streamer has his own deathly loyal private army and it's turned into a siege like every other map all because every mission must have 5+ bad guys. 

The games lighting feels off, idk how to describe it.

Multiple entry points are bugged on Ides of March (fire exit only)

Launchers are bugged, if you equip your team with team with them, they can only be used once (not per launcher equipped, ONCE)

Evidence often clips through the floor

Traps are sometimes invisible due to clipping

Reflections are bugged

Whether you can disarm traps is a lottery, you have to be stood at the perfect angle to get the multi-tool prompt (even slightly touch the door and you die)

I haven't seen the advertised trailers units ONCE

Customisation is disappointingly limited, but nice its been included

Most gun descriptions don't list the calibre (I guess this is obvious to most, me included, but I feel it should be listed)

AI - Friendly AI has 0 self preservation and will not restrain enemies at times when clearing a room resulting in them getting shot in the back or you getting gunned down. 
Enemy AI is cracked as all fuck. The low level gas station robbing punk has the accuracy of a 20 year marine vet.
There's also the issue of there's times when you can put 6 rounds in the chest of a guy with no armor on and he'll tank it like a champ but a single shot to you and you'll be flailing around and bleeding out

Quality of life - So you die, mission failed we'll get them next time, but there's no menu to rework your squad and loadout and then hitting restart. Nope, you'll be brought back to the police station hub, have to open your tablet thing, rework your squad for their mental health or if they've died, then still walk to the armory area to change yours/their loadout. Then you still need to go back to the desk, pick the mission you failed and then retry. On missions where you are getting your ass handed to you thanks to the AI this gets beyond annoying and tedious.

Performance - Im running on a 3060, and there's occasional frame drops, running the game on directx 12 does help but there are still dips.

Bugs - main bug ive noticed is the skinning of the characters, so a lot NPCs will have their skin clip through their clothing when arresting them.
Otherwise its minor things like telling your AI to block the door and they stare at you like what do you mean?

Game is good but needs some balancing - there are mods you can download with integrated mod support (which is great) but it shouldnt fall to the modding community to fix things like AI balancing 

Side note - You cant see the stats of weapons so you literally have to go through the process of playing a level with a gun to figure out of its any good or not",1641317523,1705425587,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

☑ $1000+ Build - The game is very well optimized for what it is both in performance and size (i.e. In early access, the game was 98gb, yet has released at only ~50gb with nearly twice the content), however, the sheer complexity of the AI and Command systems in lieu of the hand-crafted detail of each area require a PC built for the gaming experience (Definitely can be determined within the Steam 2-hour refund limit if you would like to test your PC's capabilities).

Not to mention the devs are pretty terrible at communication recently, like changing the recent update from being available for all players, to being pushed back, only to then be made for supporters first all without a word. Bad business practice.

The slightest LOS makes the AI lose their mind and shoots on sight. No taking cover, no looking ways to flank you. Straight just bum rushes and it feels like you're being hunted by John Wick.

At 1.0 the only real issues many people(including me) have is Mod.IO being the modding platform for this game and the AI being absolutely cracked no matter if they're tweakers or spec ops commandos. This second point can be fixed with mods and while Mod.IO works it's extremely clunky and feature-desolate compared to the Steam Workshop, Thunderstore, or Nexus.

In pretty much every way this game surpasses SWAT 4 in any meaningful metrics it just needs it's AI officially retuned and it will be a solid purchase for anyone in the ""hardcore"" shooter sphere",1705386184,1705386184,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

When I played it earlier in 2023 during early access, it had some cool pieces but largely felt like an incomplete thought. Now it feels more like a complete thought. There are some minor gripes, but overall this is a solid game if you're going in solo and I would imagine is even more fun with friends.

PROS:
- Commander mode is cool and gives you a sense of progression
- New maps are great and very challenging
- New weapons (always a plus)
- Enemies seem...smarter, more aggressive on certain maps, and less predictable
- More character customization 

CONS:
- The SWAT roster system is a little flat. Losing team members doesn't really mean much
- Frame rate drops on certain missions in certain rooms/areas of the map
- Can't see what rating you got on completed missions

No idea what drugs the devs are on to think 100ms reaction time from AI is acceptable. There are articles looking through the suspect AI code and, yes, it's literally 100ms if they're alerted. 200ms if they're not. The fact they can sometimes ignore CS gas and see you through it, which is essential to S rank all the missions is also so fun with their aimbot accuracy. Crazy how old women can pick you off from 70m away because they seen a pixel of your body through some boarded window. I could never fathom the reason why 9/10 suspects fake surrender to only pull out something every time you go to cuff them; the devs must have watched video compilations of the craziest criminals for their inspiration.
It should be a crime for devs to make games where AI gun you down in a blink of an eye while you have to yell at them, or suffer the negative ""unauthorized use of force"" punishment.
How fast these suspects can move in comparison to you is also insane. They can basically run around the level and come strafing across a door, with no gun collision, gunning you down so easily. They can also see you perfectly fine in complete darkness. Not sure if it's incompetency, negligence, or lack of knowledge from the devs to not have zones on the map that lower AI accuracy if they're standing in certain light levels or see a player in those zones.
It makes the game a chore to play. However, mods do alleviate the frustration but at the cost of not counting the score legitimately at the end of missions.

I have no idea why they don't have a difficulty scale based on how many players you have in a party, and the type of suspect they are to stop every suspect feeling like some ex-military solider.

Enough with the bad talk of the game, here's some good stuff:
When the optimization isn't pissing the bed, the game is fun. The level designs, briefing, weapons, uniform customization, and some audio is well done. The non-lethal weapons, pepperspray, and riotshield are underwhelming because of the reasons above but it is a fun challenge to get those nice S ranks.

Regardless of the huge negative of the AI being way overtuned. I do really enjoy this game and what it offers for the most part.",1705384268,1705384631,True,1,0,0.507575750350952148,0,True,False,False

PROS
-customization of character and voice
-Nail-biting slow paced action with hectic firefights
-Extensive weapon customization
-Gorgeous Graphics, animations and sound design
-Fairly optimized for older hardware consistently above 30 fps on a 5500xt
-Fantastic environmental storytelling 
-More content to come
-Mods and Custom content

CONS
-Character customization is exclusive to MP
-AI can be too responsive and you'll die many times without knowing where the enemy is
-Slower paced combat isn't for everyone and you'll be missing a lot of shots in an engagement.
-Shoot house locked behind progression in SP
-Sound design will make you jump once or twice leading to death (especially if you run speakers)
-Most weapons provide little variety (mostly reskins)
-Dev's can take awhile due to their small size
