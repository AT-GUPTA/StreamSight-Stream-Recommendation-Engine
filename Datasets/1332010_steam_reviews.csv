i like the games story i like the fact that your a cat and the robots

what i dont like:

the zurks  it's not that they are hard its that they are a okay attempt at making a challenging part the levels which contain them are kind of and if i lower the resolution to 2nd to lowest  it's easy to avoid. and i font really feel like a ct playing this game

my computer isn't strong enough for it to run on high resolution  and no i'm not a competitive player 

i have watched full game play and it doesn't impress me  please don't try and say anything stupid like ""oh you have to play it more to have fun"" 


i'm still going to play it because of the robots, and the story and even then the zurks are still a decent amount of fun

The robot characters with their personalities and funny dialogue and all the details around the Walled City were enhancing. The story where the dark truth was revealed little by little kept me playing even through the parts where the bit clumsy gameplay and lack of savepoints made me repeat the same part a bit too many times. Overall the game was not too difficult nor too easy, but if you are looking for a good action game this is probably not the best match. But if you are looking for a cool and interesting story, well built atmosphere and a game where you can jump around as a cat (and do other random cat like stuff like dropping mugs, destroying sofas and just sleeping on random pillows), this is definitely worth using the 10 to 15 hours it will take to finish the game.

I also want to mention how each moment of the game seemed to have designed with a lot of care and passion - the game mechanics, though relatively straightforward and not-too-challenging, never got old because each action section, along with its environment, was so uniquely and immersively designed.

Without spoiling the story, the robots exude a warm humanity lacking in many humans. The plot was intriguing, unique, and poignant. There is a beauty here that is rare in video games. The cuteness of your character is a welcome presense in a dark world. Playing a cat offers interesting gameplay elements that allow access to places denied to humans or human sized robots.

The pacing is brilliant with the story advancing often enough to remain engaging throughout, but without feeling rushed. This is primarily an experience about exploration, characters, and narrative, although it does sometimes offer some well justified moments of tension.

I just wish it was a good game as well. Also, it's too short even for the price. I'm definitely interested in a squeal though.

THE GOOD

- I can't think of another game that makes you feel as much like a cat as this game does

- The art direction and general world is outstanding. It always feels like a mystical adventure because of it's good atmosphere 

- The story is actually surprisingly decent. It's not Charles Dickens and it's stunted by it's short length, but it's fine.

- Dedicated meow button

THE MEH

- The Assassin's Creed style for parkour is, like Assassin's Creed, easy most of the time but frustrating when it doesn't work properly as there's no plan B. It worked most of the time for me, but occasionally I had to fiddle about to get where I wanted to.

THE BAD

- It's very short. One of the game's achievements states that you can complete it in 2 hours. It will probably take you more like 5-7, but that's still at least 10 hours shorter than I would like for this price.

- It's crying out for some RPG style quality of life improvements as it slightly leans into an RPG discovery style of play. Things like a quest menu, a quest pointer. different cat skins, a consistent currency, fast travel, etc. XP for doing things (like scratching stuff) could unlock some of these things.

- I would like to see more ways of interacting with the robots such as more dialogue options or using characters in more scenarios. Some of the robots feel 2D.

- More side quests please

- Could be more difficult or at least have the option of harder difficulties

- I would love to have the opportunity to use my claws to properly destroy things, but maybe for the cost that's a bit much to ask for",1708802475,1708802475,True,1,0,0.507462680339813232,0,True,False,False

The best thing about Stray is its cat-like movement and camera. They feel very well done with only the occasional unnecessarily jarring camera switches in isolated cases. It is fun just walking around in an environment being a cat. Unfortunately, this part of the experience is short lived as the game force-drags you through a lot of muddled scenery, with unclear and obtusely delivered objectives and design language that make you second guess where to go. It is a short game, and I had to consult a walkthrough multiple times because I was at a loss for what to do next.

The narrative is full of convoluted logic and magical realism that seems to have been born from the necessity of creating a framework for a game about a cat like experience. This unfortunately makes for both a less believable world and a worse overall experience. There's also a certain narrative dissonance implied by a cat somehow having a stake and intent to participate in a robot (but not really) rebellion. A real shame since it takes away from the simple elegance of the cat experience by forcing it to be in the center of some contrived plot that in the end doesn't serve the protagonist cat as a character whatsoever.

it may be worth talking about the environments as well. It is very well done, and in the best of cases provides an ample playground for being a cat. If the game had been more free form and without forcing the player to be dragged through the narrative, it would have been a great place to explore - especially through the eyes of a cat. Sadly, because of the narrative and level design, it is often the case that optional paths are shut down in favor of following the exact thoughts that the designer had in mind, which again contrasts heavily with the nature of a cat.

For the length of its gameplay and its various flaws, I can't recommend it at full price, but I'd say it's worth at a discount. For me, the standout experience was being a cat in the environment, and had that been the entire game without the narrative being shoehorned in, it would have been an excellent game.",1708778369,1708778369,True,1,0,0.527559041976928711,0,True,False,False

You’re a cute hyper intelligent cat that falls into the sewers and tries to get out. The gameplay is a mishmash of platforming, puzzle solving, inventory style adventure gaming, and mild combat. Most of that gameplay is pretty restrictive since you can’t platform or even without a button prompt. Every logic puzzle is just x->y->z (but at least it makes sense), and the mild combat is basically strafing and running which never gets complex. Really the gameplay is there to just support the story and the world building which was good. There's an initial mystery of what’s going on, why the [spoiler]robots[/spoiler] are where they are and what’s outside. That sense of discovery and meeting various [spoiler]robots[/spoiler] really characterizes them and makes you understand the city and how folks live. I think the ending was rushed a bit and the themes it was going for could have been better displayed in the first parts of the game but the world building was really good. Plus, the pacing of having tension separated by open areas to explore the world was welcomed. Also, the visuals and atmospheric music are really good and really help drive the anxiety/sadness in the game.

That being said, its super jank feeling and basic movement and camera movement feels rough. It’s super linear and the gameplay never gets past “go forward”. The plot kinda rushes and runs out of steam a bit by the end. The last city especially felt like more was planned with its gorgeous visuals but just kinda gave up.

Lost, alone and separated from family, a stray cat must untangle an ancient mystery to escape a long-forgotten city. Beautiful game about a lonely cat with excellent story and graphic design. The only issue is that game is quite short and I would love to play this game for many many hours. It is a pleasure just to look at this game and listen to ur cat.

It's quite easy to max, u will need to find some collectibles and secrets, u will probably find most of them while exploring this beautiful world. The one problem is that u will need two playthroughs (Speedrun below 2 hours, which isn't actually hard, u should easily go through the whole game after about 1,5h). Check the guide if you missed something ( game has chapter select ):

I’d kept an eye on Stray for some time, unsure whether or not a horror lover like me should invest in this semi-open world, neon-colored and cyberpunk-themed cat game. But when it was released with everyone being so hyped about it, I had no other choice but join the community. And I have zero regrets.

Visually, Stray is like eye candy; the vibrant cityscapes are so beautiful that you’ll find yourself lost in the details. Owing to an excellent audio, cat-chy tunes and exploration-heavy game play, you’ll get immersed in a bleak future where robots live like humans in an underground city, perfected with a few simple puzzles and survival sequences to keep things interesting. Nevertheless, Stray is nothing too demanding for an overall relaxing experience. The narrative putting a heavy emphasis on non-verbal cues, I like how simply and understandably social and environmental issues are presented in a game that looks more superficial and unimpactful than it actually is.

If you like cats, you should buy this - it’s a good enough reason. Think about it: you can meow, scratch, climb, sleep, make a mess, nuzzle and do cute cat things as an adorable little furball that is, in my humble opinion, a well-animated representation of a humanized real-life cat. There’s nothing better than getting to be a small four-legged creature in a large and curious world, right?

From the moment I stepped into its beautifully crafted world, I was captivated by the stunning visuals and immersive atmosphere. The gameplay mechanics are innovative and refreshing, allowing you to navigate the bustling city streets with ease.

But what truly sets Stray apart is its heartwarming narrative. As a lost cat, you embark on a journey of self-discovery and friendship, forming unexpected bonds with the diverse cast of characters you meet along the way. The emotional depth of the story took me by surprise, and I found myself genuinely invested in the struggles and triumphs of my feline protagonist.

Moreover, the attention to detail in Stray is unparalleled. From the intricate alleyways to the bustling marketplaces, every corner of the city feels alive and brimming with personality. And let's not forget about the adorable protagonist – the animations and expressions of the cat are so lifelike that I couldn't help but feel a deep connection to my virtual companion.

In addition to its captivating story and world-building, Stray also offers plenty of engaging puzzles and challenges to keep you entertained for hours on end. Whether you're navigating treacherous rooftops or solving clever environmental puzzles, there's never a dull moment in this enchanting adventure.

Overall, Stray is a masterpiece of game design that deserves all the praise it can get. With its charming characters, stunning visuals, and heartfelt story, it's a must-play experience for gamers of all ages.

Gotta say, it was quite the experience, visually the game is beautiful, the story of the world is quite intriguing, (although the ending was kinda lacking) and the protagonist is really charming, a simple cat. 

Gameplay wise, its pretty simple, largely focused on exploration, puzzle solving and some stealth/run sections, its a good game for those looking for something relaxing.

Its a pretty short game, took me around 6 hours to complete while trying to explore everything, there isnt really much replay value im afraid, with most of it relying on getting achievements and collectibles. 

The highlight is obviously the protagonist, our little fur ball, they did a good job at replicating cat behavior, one interaction that gave me chuckle is when you first get the backpack, cat owners will most likely know why ;) you can mess around quite a bit, throwing items into the floor, messing up with people, scratching everything you see, sleeping, etc, if you wanna be a cat, this is the game. 

A few complains though, the game could really use some optimization, the FPS would sometimes really drop on certain areas, and in my case i ran into an issue with my controls not working which essentially locked my game until i managed a way around it, so, might be better to wait a few days for some patches to fix those issues, but its possible to play the game.

Not really cyberpunk dystopia, but rather Kowloon Hong Kong with weathered robots. 
Puzzles are simple, interactions are very limited (robots have only 1 or 2 things to say, everybody is giving you fetch quests). The cat controls are very basic and restricted. No free jumping for example.
The 'enemies' are very basic, but break up the chill exploration. In my opinion, they were not needed and I'd rather have more exploration and lore.
Quite early in you already know where the story is going and why the 'world' is what it is. After that, there is no more mystery. 
The end felt rushed (also short game time doesn't help) and left too many simple open questions on what happens with the characters in that world and with the cat.
Even as a cat-person I really don't understand why everyone is so impressed by this upscaled demo.

You are better off just watching someone's playthrough online (can be done within 2 hours, not rushed). It is in my opinion not worth more than 5-10 Euro.",1708201609,1708201609,False,9,0,0.551937401294708252,0,True,False,False

When I first became a cat in the game, it was amazing, the ability to make the cat meow, act as a normal cat, solve puzzles and more, including hiding like a cat.
[h2] Final thoughts: [/h2]
If you want to find out what happens next in the game, I suggest you buy the game, it is available on Steam, Xbox and Playstation.

1. fixed lens to cat distance, with 3D graphics, darker scenes, and more close-ups, it tends to lead to visual fatigue and vertigo, which reduces the gaming experience, so I hope I can freely adjust the distance between the lens and the cat;
2. The process is short. I hope that in the next generation of works to grow the main plot, and add some subplots.

At the end of the story, the cat walks out of the city without explaining whether the cat is reunited with its 3 companions; B-12 does not completely destroy itself, is there a possibility of resurrection; the out-of-control bacteria dies under daylight, but does this mean that it still survives in the sewers without daylight and spreads to the outside shaded areas due to the opening of the dome; does the authoritarian force in the middle zone continue to rule in another way and if it is overthrown, does a new totalitarian force emerge? Does all this suspense mean that Stray II is being planned? I look forward to Stray II.

Tells the tale of a cat that falls from the surface to the lower levels of an abandoned facility and its journey back to the surface. Along the way, the cat meets various inhabitants including robots that have gained sentience, a strange lifeform that has evolved from simply eating garbage and a peculiar robot companion that guides you along your journey. 

Run time if you're trying to collect everything on your 1st go should be around 7-8 hours. If you replay chapters to find the stuff you've missed you can expect roughly 10 hours. There were some performance issues that a quick trip to the Discussion board solved. The game runs better in DirectX12 with ray tracing disabled. Even with that though I still noticed that although I was running at >100fps that the game would hitch from time to time and that the frame rate would tank down to 30fps in dimly lit areas. Not a deal breaker as the experience was still immersive. 

This is a pretty game to look at with a formulaic story, low key atmospheric music and good execution on the gameplay front.

By doing that, they almost broke the story. It’s not telegraphed in any way in the story, it does not feel justified by conditions of the final episode, it does not work as an ending point to any of the topics of the story.

I'd highly recommended this for casual gamers or beginners as the movement mechanics are very simple (the cat doesn't allow itself to fall off things for example) and there are only a few parts of the game which involve more than basic skill with a controller, and that is usually just sprinting past enemies.

For hardcore gamers, this game is easy but still enjoyable if you're the sort of person to read the dialogue and be interested in the story and sights.

Because of its retractable claws it is adapted to killing small prey like mice and rats. It has a strong flexible body, quick reflexes, sharp teeth, and its night vision and sense of smell are well developed. It is a social species, but a solitary hunter and a crepuscular predator. Cat communication includes vocalizations like meowing, purring, trilling, hissing, growling, and grunting as well as cat body language.

This is only one game made by BlueTwelve Studio and definitely every part of the game: locations, personalities, the story made by heart. The story that you discovery during your journey on the game, which is basically postapocalyptic closed city. Basically combining game experience and watching movies.  
The game itself doesn't looke like some other games, it is really different experience. Playing as a cat, jumping on tables, walking on roofs even you can scratch claws and do meowing! really leaving the cat live. The game recommends to use gamepad, that is true, definitely  for comfortable game and to really enjoy the process you need to have some joystick, even simple one.

It’s a fairly short but sweet story set in a dystopian future where humanity is missing with its legacy left behind, which you explore as a little orange cat who has been separated from its family. I am already biased with regards to this being a huge cat lover, so my heartstrings were well and truly tugged with every obstacle this little cat faced throughout the game. It’s really clear that the developers know cats well, as you can do all manner of cat behaviours, such as tearing up carpets, yowling and climbing effortlessly.

It’s a real joy to play, the movement feels good and tight and emulates the agility you would expect from playing as a cat. The storytelling is wholly told through exposition, until you reach the first hub of the game. The atmosphere is great, with neon signage and plant-life breaking through the industrial subterranean setting.

The only major negative I feel like I should bring up are the Zurks. Essentially they act as the main antagonist in the game, though they act without reason or malice – they’re basically evolved bacteria that I assume want to eat you. The problem lies in the fact that whenever they appear in the game, the chilled out aspect quickly changes to you rushing through those sections and sometimes getting overwhelmed – but it can get quite frustrating sometimes. Overall I think this detracts from the overall positive feeling of the game, and I feel as though the game would be better without those sections altogether.

There are also stealth sections which can get annoying; I’m no stranger to games like Metal Gear, but when it hit the fan at least in games like that you have the backup plan of going in guns blazing – instead you just have to try again.

[b]Pros:[/b]
Excellent gameplay.
Simple at its core.
Heartfelt storyline; haven’t rooted for a protagonists success as much as this for a while.
Loveable characters.

You play as a cat who falls into a city inhabited by robots, and you must find your way out. You do this by helping the robots and exploring.

My biggest complaint is that the game is pretty short for the asking price. In 6 hours I beat the game, got almost all of the achievements, as well as most of the in game collectibles. It would have been really nice to see a few more levels, but I also understand that sometimes adding more just to have more leads to games that feel padded out and makes them worse.

I probably should also mention that there is one level that was bugged to the point where I could not complete it on my PC.

Embodying a stray cat navigating the bustling streets of a futuristic city, the game offers a unique and charming perspective on exploration and puzzle-solving.

Living my best cat life in Stray feels like an absolute joy. The fluid animations and expressive movements of the cat protagonist add a delightful touch to the gameplay.

The subtle storytelling and ambient sounds immerse players in a world where the charm of being a stray cat takes center stage.

Stray offers a refreshing departure from traditional gaming experiences, allowing players to temporarily escape the human perspective and embrace the whimsical, carefree life of a wandering cat.

Stray, left me spellbound with its mesmerizing visuals and innovative gameplay. Navigating the neon-lit city as a lost cat was a charming and unique experience. The only letdown? It's over too soon. While the game's brevity left me craving more, the captivating world and inventive mechanics make Stray an unforgettable journey well worth taking.

I've been looking forward to Stray ever since it was first announced over a year ago, and I am happy to say that I wasn't disappointed. The main things that you do in stray is solve traversal and ""story"" puzzles, the latter of which are similar to that of point and click games without the frustration that is associated with such games. While doing such activities you'll find yourself exploring a neon lit city populated primarily by human-like robots. All of these robots are oozing with charm making your time on this adventure an absolute pleasure. However, Stray is a very short game, especially if you do not seek out any side content. Despite this, I didn't mind the price tag as I felt that the quality of the game made up for the length. The game is gorgeous and there is very little bloat.

I've been following Stray since its first trailer over two years ago, and my god was it worth the wait in every way possible. The game has some of the best scenery and lighting I've seen to date, everything was vivid and real. The environments rival Portal 2 in terms of conveying an overgrown dystopia (In the areas that are an overgrown dystopia that is). The cities are full of life and color that is all packed into such tight and cramped spaces. The quality of the animations on the robot residents play a big role in showing their body language and mood, and I went through the entire game watching every movement they made. The game has a very self contained story and doesn't play with anything big, you are a lost cat that winds up saving a society of robots that take after their fallen humans. You meet a human turned robot and he helps you on your way to escape the city. He translates the locals, hacks doors, and sacrifices himself a lot. The ending of this game invoked an emotional response in me worse than Red Dead Redemption 2. I must admit the game is extremely bleak, and even in the end left a pang of sadness in me with minimal satisfaction. Almost like they did it on purpose. I'm just silently hoping that after all those loose ends and a single cliffhanger that they planned to make a DLC of sorts, because the ending is just damn depressing. You don't reunite with your original cat family, you don't stay with the robots that you befriended during your journey, and B12 is left dead in the Control Room (with a tiny chance that he's alive thanks to the small cliffhanger at the end). The game builds the world and the history of Walled City 99 through dialogue and secrets found throughout the game, and once you've pieced together the puzzle the game is over and you're left with less than when you started. Was this the point of the game? To tell a depressing story in an already depressing world?
Maybe I'm just looking too far into it and should've taken it at face value, ""the cute cat saved the nice robots and got out alive""
Or maybe I'm just too upset about B12. His story was oddly heartfelt to me, and in the end he didn't get anything he wanted.

For a final summary, grief aside.
I'm going to review the game for what it gave to me rather than what I took from it. The game visually is a work of art that is well optimized and extremely atmospheric. The story is told directly and people looking for more can explore the world to learn new information. The parkour/movement aspects of the game are fluid and liberating, and the puzzles are simple but satisfying. The sound design in the music and ambiance is unique, going very well with the visual aesthetics of the dystopian and vibrant city parts of the game. There is a small amount of replayability in things like the Memory system and collectathon fetch-quests.

Overall my unbiased rating of the game is 9/10, a memorable and near perfect experience that leaves a lot up to you in terms of deciding what you make of it. I wont be forgetting Stray.",1658400931,1705472900,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The gameplay is very, very, *very* basic, there is little to no challenge, no new - or interesting - mechanics, so, as a game, it's clearly subpar.

But if you enjoy the thematic / topic, you want a semi-interesting story but that doesn't go to deep topics, enjoy watching cute cats and animations and in general are okay with visuals being like 90% of the entire game, then it's a solid purchase.

About 6-8 hours to complete, about 10 for 100%, so do consider that together with the lack of actual gameplay.

As the credits rolled, the anticipation for the sequel was palpable. Stray is not just a game; it's a fun and unforgettable experience that will leave you eagerly awaiting the next adventure in this remarkable world.",1705206526,1705206526,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

I did not expect the lore depth, and i really liked it!, I'm curious what will happen. 

8.5/10 ,  a few bugs during the first chapter and drops, but later it gets smooth, It took me aprox. 5h, I've almost found everything, maybe another 2h/3h of archivement hunting. to get 100%, over all it's a relaxed and fun game... thanks for the Mac Port!, I hope to see more games from the dev team.",1705204401,1705204920,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Even tho the game suggests a controller, I didn't have much issues with mouse-keyboard because you can choose to hold/one tap/multiple tap some of the keys. I appreciated this SO much since I don't have a controller and I was struggling A LOT with the default settings.

This aside, the story was really good, I loved it and I wish I could play it again like it was my first time. The game is relatively short if you just follow the main quest and you don't try to get some collectibles but it's still worth it imo. The last chapters felt shorter compared to the first ones because the main quest was more linear.

The game-play is a bit odd, you play as a detective solving some minor puzzles and searching for locations and people. Aside to that there are action scenes with where you are chased or need to stealth your way through.

So keep in mind if you want to play Stray (and I think you should definitely do) that it is a pretty relaxing game where you explore this strange world/city with a cat.

It is not a difficult game and it is easy to pick up.

Pros:
 - Wonderful art direction
 - Nice story
 - Good game-play loop
 - Overall just fun to play

Cons: 
 - Relatively short (less then 10 hours to see everything)
 - Mods really make the game shine (no Ray-tracing out of the box, missing some aliasing etc)
 - Pacing is a bit odd at times and ending feels a bit rushed. (although this is nitpicky.)
 - Auto-save is frequent but sometimes at odd places. 

Conclusion:
Really original and fun game, definitely recommend this game. Nice to play for 15 minutes and pick it up later too. I can only hope for a Stray 2.

Solve puzzle to progress the storyline which focus on sy-fy elements. There are moments of horror  in the first half the game, but afterwards, it loses those horror.

The game itself feels incomplete however only in its storytelling aspects. It has a great start, but after the first area, the chapters soon quickly feel rushed and incomplete lacking in as many interesting characters, side quests, etc. There feels like their  should be more story, but either didn't have time or money or both to do such things. But, a good story should always leave you with some questions and answer the main one, which in this case it does. After all the main goal is to get back to surface. 

The gameplay is smooth, and pretty straightforward. Only a few times did I get stuck on puzzles and had to go and revisit locations again to see if I missed anything. Even through a second play-through this is true. Only once or twice I had to pause to rethink what the game was trying to introduce without actually throwing a tutorial in your face. 

I recommend doing all the memory side quest. There is no quest log, but each zone or new area has at least one, and that will really bring out the story telling in the area. Do not move forward from that area until you complete those side quest though. You can't go back.",1659968290,1705090073,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

You soon discover that you're not alone.  The city is inhabited by humanoid robots who have long forgotten their purpose, and it's up to you to figure out where to go next.

Stray is a unique spin on the third-person game genre.  You play as a cat, but you're not completely alone.  You encounter a robotic companion that helps guide you through your journey and interact with the world, while you also help this companion recover its lost memories.  There are platforming and puzzle elements, some combat, questing, and plenty of exploration.  Visually rich with a unique aesthetic, charming characters, and intuitive game play, Stray will keep you immersed in a subterranean mystery for hours on end.

Pros:

Intuitive controls.  All you need is a keyboard and mouse.  Gamepad is supported and recommended by the devs.
Excellent graphics and great performance, even on older hardware.
Interesting and unique characters and envirnoments.
Great storytelling.  A simple premise that is well executed.
Cut scenes are letterboxed so you know it's a cut scene but you're still ""in the world"" with very smooth transitions.
It's about a cat.  You like cats, don't you?  Who doesn't like cats?

Cons:

Sometimes the third-person camera movement can be a little disorienting for some.  If you're sensitive to motion keep this in mind.
Occasionally the jump interaction icon can be hard to get into focus in some places, making a necessary jump difficult.  This isn't game breaking and it only happens a few specific times during the game.
Some of the action sequences can have strange difficulty ramping, going from absurdly easy to instant death depending on  where you are in the game.  Not game breaking but it can be frustrating in certain points.
If you die during an action sequence sometimes the checkpoint makes you backtrack a little father than should be necessary.

Bugs Encountered:

None.  Game ran flawlessly for me.

""Stray"" has a button dedicated to meow and that is all you need to know if you are a casual gamer who is looking to get a taste of what is currently making noise.

Apart from that, this is a very atmospheric experience, half a walking simulator on four legs, half a mysterious adventure game that presents a very endearing story through a masterfully built setting.
There is an inspiring mix of sci-fi and post-apocalyptic nature retaking its own world that makes for an excellent emphasis on our furry main character. If there are no humans to lead the way, might as well leave the task to a cat.
And that might just be the social comment that the writer of the plot is trying to get through. By inhabiting its world with just robots that imitate human beings and fall short of feeling really human, we may have to be reminded here that humanity sometimes comes from non-human beings. A cat represents all that is human and leads a bunch of ""only faint reminders of human beings"" to the right direction in life.

There are two excelling positives in this game:
- It is very well polished, every detail has been taken care of and the environmental storytelling is always there to set for a great story with a healthy dose of mystery. Very well infused with an amazing soundtrack and perfectly measured chapters.
- The developers have seen cats before and it's easy to tell. Not only in the obvious additions like pushing things off the edge but also through the whole mechanic of the game that implicitly forces you to think like a cat and very strongly sets in the player a cat mentality right from the start of the game.

The only downside:
- The content of the game gives for around 10 hours, sitting back to enjoy the scenery on many occasions, hunting for an extra here and there, and maybe some of the achievements. That is it though, a short experience with a few brilliant ideas put together. I strongly hope the developers will come back with a second part of the game in the future.

Overall ""Stray"" presents us with a unique feeling and many original ideas from developers who clearly have a great love for the art of video game making. This is another strong statement for single-player story-focused experiences.

Although on the shorter side, one can definitely spend hours upon hours exploring this world.

This is easily a 10/10. I want there to be more, I want more time to talk to my friends. I want to be a cat longer.

My girlfriend feels the same way, and this is her first actual video game. She wants more. She's actively trying to find out if there will be a sequel. 

If this game is on sale, buy it. If it is full price, buy it. This studio deserves the money. They have made a fantastic game and deserve everything.

I thought this wasn't a serious game, in fact at first it just for the meme, like ""OMG THERE'S A CAT LET'S BUY IT""
Now that I finished the game, I can say that it's much more than a ""game with a cat as the main character"".
After playing this game for a while, you realize that the plot is much deeper than it seems (I don't want to mention it for obvious reasons).
Maybe it's not a super mega complex plot, but I really think it's worth a try.

Not because the game is bad if you’re not, but because I don’t think it’s made for non-cat-lovers, and so it’d be wrong to judge this game from the perspective of its unintended audience.

By this I only mean to highlight the fact that this game is - fundamentally - a walking simulator. Most of the fun I had was just from simple things you can do like abusing the meow button and feeling this warm fuzzy feeling inside while controlling our tiny little feline hero. If that’s not your thing then you’d probably be playing a very different game than what I’m about to describe and in all honesty I feel I lack both the perspective and the objectivity to judge whether this alternative experience is worth recommending.

That said, Stray offers (to cat lovers) a unique and immersive experience in a BEAUTIFULLY animated world full of personalities and intrigue. I love how the story remains as cute as its protagonist throughout except a couple moments of ingenious Lovecraftian horror. It ties up really well and feels surprisingly (in a good way) emotional. Also I’m surprised to find out the cat was entirely animated and there wasn’t any mo-cap involved - that it captures the quintessence of our perception of feline movement in the end is a testament to the tremendous talent the team must have for this game to be this good. Also the score is one of the best I’ve heard yet, really makes the world come to life and adds to the wholesome tone of the game.

All in all just a fantastically made game and I hope it gets enough fanfare to spawn another sequel, or at least a spiritual successor? A dog game, a spider game…you name it.",1704785927,1704785927,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

1) Story
     a) Nice concept of being a cat in a post-human android world
     b) Few but good characters like Momo, B-12 and Clementine.
     c) The game is very short and none of the set-ups actually pays off. 
     d) Because of its brevity, a lot of potential (like the dystopian sentinels or the plague) is squandered (or set for a sequel)
     e) Because of that, all the answers the game provides feel rushed and somewhat underwhelming

2) Gameplay
     a) Mostly a puzzle platformer with some chase action and some stealth sections
     b) The jumping is scripted. That is good at platforming (so you won't fall down) but terrible at chases (if you miss the prompt, you're dead)
     c) The zurk chases are awful and the deathray useless
     d) Stealth is ok, but hastely cramped into the last section of the game
     e) Could use a bit more variety at puzzle platforming (The camera ""mission"" was a nice windowdressing to the mechanic)

3) Environment & Collectibles
     a) Small areas packed with character. Great variety of environment
     b) Slums and Midcity are great! Small, fun and full with things to interact. This is how it SHOULD be done.
     c) There are collectibles (memories and badges) BUT while they are relatively interwoven with the main story in the first part, they are completely buried in the second part. 

4) Visuals
     a) Great graphics, utilized properly. 
     b) Great art direction that enhances the world-building. The game is the EPITOME of visual storytelling.
     c) Kudos to the ""Open city"" scene. If the game took the time with the rest of the world, that would be the most impactful scene in recent gaming history.  

There you go. The game's only fault is being 4 hours long. If it were twice or triple that time (e.g like Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice or A Plague Tale: Innocence) and let you connect with the world, the characters and the plot this would be hailed as a masterpiece of AA gaming history.",1704632559,1704632618,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The puzzles, platforming and chase scenes are at a nice difficulty level. Not a total cakewalk, but not tricky enough to be stuck on for ages. The world building is interesting, the story is enjoyable and even the NPCs have a bit of personality (despite being robots).
Also, playing as this remarkably intelligent cat was just so delightful.

Fun premise - a stray cat gets lost and meets a bunch of robots while trying to get back to his family.   No human voices the entire game is unusual and surprisingly refreshing change of pace.  If you like point and click adventure RPG, then this is right up your alley.  A game pad or joystick is helpful, but not required.  

A nice touch that you can turn off ""Show cat death"" in settings if you are playing with younger and/or more sensitive gamers.  

(Mild Spoiler ahead)

Other than a few scenes mid-game in a sewer with some scary-looking baddies, the violence was pretty minor.  I thought my kids (who are sensitive gamers) would be more frightened of the ""eyeballs"" and the little scampering baddies who my son dubbed ""potatoes"" since they look like potatoes with limbs and mouths.

You play as an unnamed ginger tabby (cat) that (within the first 5-10 minutes) gets separated from all your cat buddies after you fall into a large sewer drain. The over-arching story is just you trying to get back to the surface and mingle with your feline friends again.. As you continue your adventure you soon realise there is much more under the surface (literally and figuratively) than meets the eye. The whole gameplay experience was very relaxing and relatively easy to 100% (the one exception being the ""[spoiler]Can't Cat-ch Me[/spoiler]"" achievement which seems to require a lot more luck than skill to achieve). Overall though, my experience was brilliant, really hoping they make a sequel.

The world itself is beautiful and the sense of immersion in this post-apocalyptic cyberpunk city is excellent. Many critics of the game have complained that it is too simple, that the puzzles are too easy, and that the story is only mediocre. I don't think it's a bad thing that this game employs simple mechanics and easy puzzles and I would say that the story is one that's been told before, but is charming and heartfelt. This is a casual adventure with intuitive and linear platforming for the most part, but with a few stops along the way that are more open for exploration.

From the initial moments of guiding this virtual feline, players find themselves immersed in a fascinating and enigmatic universe, full of intricacies and revelations that mirror the innate curiosity of cats.

The first standout feature is the meticulous detailing in replicating cat movements and idiosyncrasies. Every motion exudes fluidity and authenticity, be it the gentle purring or the nimble, graceful leaps. It's so adorable!

The game's setting serves as a spectacle in its own right. The cyberpunk city, replete with narrow alleys, accessible rooftops, and concealed nooks, offers an enthralling terrain for exploration. The graphics are breathtaking, showcasing an extraordinary devotion to detail, from sunlight filtering through buildings to reflections on glass surfaces. Each shadowy alley and rooftop beckons exploration, fostering an environment conducive to continuous discovery.

The accompanying soundtrack also merits acclaim. Combining melodic undertones with urban ambiance, it seamlessly integrates with the game's atmosphere. Distant meows, soft footfalls, and even the rustling of the wind during alleyway traversals contribute layers of immersion, genuinely conveying the sensation of prowling the streets as a cat.

The narrative, centered around a lost cat navigating a society of robots, is both intriguing and well-crafted. Interactions with other characters human and robotic alike are conveyed uniquely through non-verbal communication and contextual cues. This innovative approach aligns with the silent disposition of cats, introducing an additional layer of complexity to understanding the unfolding storyline.

Yet, the game transcends mere narrative, incorporating a myriad of side missions and optional tasks that enrich the gameplay. This encourages players to delve into every nook and cranny of the city, engaging with its inhabitants. These supplementary missions offer substantial rewards, prolonging the overall experience and providing additional hours of entertainment.

In essence, the game emerges as a feast for cat enthusiasts, seamlessly blending a faithful portrayal of feline behavior with a distinctive perspective on exploring the world through a cat's eyes.",1663025928,1704505952,True,25,0,0.693635523319244385,3,True,False,False

An absolute masterpiece.

This game is absolutely phenomenal, everything from the goofy lil characters to the adventures your little guy goes through is so well crafted that it leaves the player hooked, at least thats what it did to me. The story got me so immersed that i was at the final chapter before i knew it. Yeah, the game is really not that long but i would not have it any other way. For what it is, the length of the story seems to be made just right, and now im begging for a sequel. The graphics and general style of the game made me check the requirements again because (coming from someone with not much knowledge of computers) the game is really well optimised. The environment looks so rich with colour and that ending -- ooh that ending, beautiful in looks and way more.

[u]Story and Setting:[/u]

Players control a [b]stray cat[/b] who must navigate a neon-lit cyberpunk city inhabited by robots.
The [i]world is beautifully crafted[/i], with towering skyscrapers, bustling alleyways, and hidden secrets to discover.
The game's atmosphere is a unique blend of cyberpunk grit and feline whimsy, making it a joy to explore.

[h2]Gameplay:[/h2]

Gameplay is focused on exploration, puzzle-solving, and platforming.
Players can [strike]jump, climb, scratch, and meow[/strike] their way through the environment.
The [b]controls are tight and responsive[/b], making it a pleasure to control the agile cat.
The [i]puzzles are clever and varied[/i], but never too challenging.

[h2]Purrfect Imperfections:[/h2]

The game's biggest flaw is its [strike]short length[/strike]. The main story can be completed in around four hours.
It [i]lacks some of the depth and complexity[/i] found in other adventure games.
The story is relatively light on character development and emotional impact.

[h2]Overall:[/h2]

Stray is a charming and atmospheric adventure game with innovative cat-like gameplay. However, its short length, lack of depth, and limited story prevent it from being a truly great game.

[h3]Recommendation:[/h3]

If you're looking for a short, relaxing, and visually stunning adventure game, Stray is definitely worth checking out. However, if you're looking for a deep and complex story-driven experience, you may be disappointed.

[hr]

Notable points:

The game's soundtrack is excellent, with a blend of cyberpunk and ambient music that perfectly complements the atmosphere.
The game features a number of collectibles, including Zurks (small, annoying creatures) and memories of the cat's past.
There is no photo mode in the game, which is a surprising omission given the game's beautiful visuals.

my absolute favourite part about the game was all the little details that tailor to the needs of the everyday cat owner, obviously there will be an influx of cat owners playing this game and the small touches added to the game that showcase all the small things that cats get up to that only cat owners would know about really added an element of personality to the game.

Jumping around, scratching things for no reason, taking catnaps in implausible places, meowing randomly, cuddling up to strange robots, and doing other cat stuff for the sake of doing cat stuff was quite fun.  The puzzles were not particularly difficult to solve but hard enough to be satisfying (and no need to look up answers from the streamers which was nice).   The visuals, music and sound were  very rich and appropriate for the mood the game was setting.  The action sequences were also quite challenging without being over the top difficult.   Using elusiveness as the main way to overcome overwhelming odds was quite fun.  

 There are parts of the game that are downright terrifying (being chased and hunted by the ravenous enemy critters in particular), so maybe this game would not be the best choice for small children who might otherwise find playing a game as a cat to be appealing.  There is also some really  creepy environmental imagery at parts that I found cool, but would probably be to too intense for the youngest players.

My only beef with the game was that it was over in just under 15 hours, and with my mediocre gaming skills I had to replay some of the more twitchy parts of the game four or five times to get through them.

   Summary:
I cannot recommend this game enough. If you are reading reviews before diving in, I beg you to please just give this game a try so noting gets spoiled for you. Wait for a sale if you must, but a 100% blind play through is an absolute must.

   Review:
I cannot bring myself to call this a game. While it literally is by definition, I wish to only call it an experience.

The atmosphere and environments are carefully crafted in a way that I haven't seen ""triple a"" titles replicate in a long time. While most titles are half baked, this is well made and had plenty of time in the oven.

I think I can easily explain the gameplay as ""parkour"" just with a cat. Moving from one ledge to another is fluid, clean, and consistent. If you're a speed runner this is your kind of game. In regards to controls, I used a mouse and keyboard and did not experience difficulty. However, the game does recommend a controller if you have one. It is up to you.

Animations and details that you see from the cat models are things that you could only notice if you have lived with cats for a period of time.

In regards to story I refuse to talk about it. Please experience it for yourself. It's short but sweet. Nothing about it over stays it's welcome.",1704229803,1704229803,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

But avoid if you're not comfortable with:
- no voiceover in dialogs. Cat does it's meows and robots make some electronic gibberish. That's all.
- this game is STRICTLY linear - to a point that most of the time there are no other routes to climb even a simpliest places.
- It's very short - it's doable in less than 2 hours for an achievement and it seems most of the players beat it in 4 - 6 hours. That's not a bad thing itself, but I am a person who likes to recieve a good ammount of fun for my hard earned cash and so I strictly recommend not to buy this game at any point for a full price - it's fun, it's nice, but definitely not worth anything more than 15-20 € in my book and I am inclined to say even less than that.

I would consider this an adventure/exploration game with a focus on the storytelling. You play as an orange tabby who gets separated from his fellow felines and accidentally falls into an undercity of sorts. Set in a cyberpunk future where there are seemingly no humans left, just humanoid robots and other wildlife. You soon realize that the place where this cat finds himself is very dangerous and getting back to the surface will be a difficult task. It leads you on a journey where you discover the history of this city and how everything came to be the way that is in the game. I found the setting to be very interesting and I wanted to learn and understand more about this world.

The game only takes about 8-10 hours to complete, more or less. Obviously, it can be done faster if you are just rushing to the end of the game. I chose to take my time and enjoy the scenery and search for collectibles and other pieces of lore scattered about the map. I think the game is definitely worth it for $25-$30, but if you can get it at deeper discount, then that would be even better- it's a deal for $20 or less.

I thought that the graphics looked beautiful, it's built using unreal engine 4 but it still runs really well. I played a good portion of the game on my Steam Deck at well above 30fps (not sure about getting 60fps though). They recently released a Mac port of the game for newer Apple computers using Apple Silicon. I have a 2020 13"" MacBook Pro with M1 processor and only 8GB of RAM and the game still ran very well. It features MetalFX upscaling, which is Apple's answer to FSR/DLSS. My primary 4070 desktop ran the game at over 100fps with highest settings at 3840x1600 resolution. It basically runs great on all platforms and is very scalable in terms of performance.

I think this is a really cool indie game that doesn't compromise on visual fidelity. I love pixel art/retro 2D games as well, but it's nice to see an indie game that can match AAA games in terms of graphics/fidelity. I wish more indie developers were making games like this. Also, we need more games where you play as a cat, there are so few of them. I have always had a cat as pet, ever since I was a small child, so I really appreciate a game that is an appreciation/celebration of cats.",1704059429,1704059429,True,1,0,0.520547926425933838,0,True,False,False

When the game was brand new, I found it a little expensive, and so I waited for it to go on sale to finally make the purchase.  And after playing it the recommendation is still in the same ""maybe to definitely"" category.

There should be no bones about the amount of content in this game.  What's there is certainly beautiful and charming, but it lasts, in my case, a little under five hours.  The game is decidedly wonderful and the cyberpunk aesthetic and story is something up my alley so I found it easy to connect with.  It's an Action/Adventure game with some light puzzles and stealth here and there with what's in between something akin to a cat walking simulator.

I can safely say that TLC was put into this game and it will shine through as you play it.  Though the monotony of dark underground cyberpunk slums may wear a little thin, none of the environments feel cookie-cutter and there are times where the beauty of the game is striking.

Also playing as a cat feels seamless and enjoyable.  It feels like a parkour Mirror's Edge type experience through a cat's perspective.  When the game is over you'll definitely wish there was more.

The game is quite linear and the replay value isn't particularly high, maybe good for 2 playthroughs.  There are no additional endings, and the side content isn't too dense or rewarding.  I definitely recommend the game but I also would push to wait for a sale or a discount.  Though the price of entry for such a cinematic experience that lasts longer than a full length feature will definitely be of value for many of you.  Especially if you love those fuzzy little bastards.

linear, 0 logical puzzles, you just seek through the litter for items and interact with anything you can.

I know there were some glitches and bugs that were happening on release, but honestly that doesn't detract from the story and world-building here. I just wrote a review on ""Firmament"", and this is a polar opposite to it - In a good way.

I really like the cohesiveness of the world, the locations unfold in a way that all sticks together. It made you want to play to the end, just to see all of it. The lighting is top-notch. Well done. When I find myself making snapshots just to set as my wallpaper, you know you've done a great job.

I won't reveal much about the story, the exploration is what makes this work after all - I'll just say that when this team rests and decides to possibly do another project, I'll be waiting, because you guys know how to make a great game.

Good job, it was very rewarding to play and experience.",1703954440,1703954440,True,1,0,0.511952221393585205,0,True,False,False

The good: graphics, story, level design, exploring, unique protagonist, collectibles that actually add to the story
The bad: Some checkpoints are way too far apart (8 minutes) with lots of tedious work in between. You can easily miss collectibles and then have to replay the whole chapter, cutscenes and all. For me, this creates a tension that sometimes leads to me not enjoying the level and disturbs the immersion.

Now it looks like it's more bad than good, but far from it. I'd love if there were more levels, especially the ending could have been more detailed. Like having to [spoiler]manually open the roof[/spoiler] would have made for a great sequence. Maybe more sidequests as well. But that's the difference between a triple A and an independent game.

+ Great atmosphere
+ Runs well on steam deck
+ Good puzzles
+ Story is OK maybe a little shallow

+ Controls very easy 

Negatives
- Story could have done with a little more depth, maybe more so with B-12 especially
- A little on the short side, could have done with another 1-2 hours of game play
- Would have been better to include other weapons like the UV light thingy to give a bit more depth

Edit: After restarting the chapter from scratch, I was able to proceed with the weapon working. However, I lost all my inventory that I had collected in the previous chapter. It took me quite a while to research and find the solution.

It's the best game to play as a cat; nothing more needs to be said.

However, I have to point out the great level of detail given to the movements and details, such as the tail and ears and the different meowing. 
It has a great story, told not only by the written words but also by the scenery.
The level of control of the feline character is more than enough to be enjoyable!

(this review is a bit spoiler-y :) )

PROS:
- Plug-and-play: just sit down with your controller and play, no need to fiddle around with options.
- Superb technical realisation: QA have done their job right. I had no glitches in my playthrough.
- Graphically pleasing
- Cats. You can meow at people.
- Lore is fun to explore, the little jokes and cultural references make it funny.
- Simple control scheme makes it easy to pick up for beginners
- Creepy/eerie vibe really well done.
- It is very clear when you have to move and when you can explore freely
- Music syncs perfectly with moment-to-moment actions.
- Doing the 100% seems easy: I have not really tried and I found ~85% of memories.

CONS (nit-picking....):
- Sometimes it is not clear when you get out of a zone and you don't have time to finish the sidequests, you're already thrown in the next.
- Camera positioning could use a little work. It is very good, don't get me wrong but sometimes it is a little difficult to look around, especially when close to a wall.
- ""Gamey"" feeling near the end: first 1-2 chapters hooked me in, on the last 2-3 some puzzles reminded me I was playin a videogame: Big, convienient levers, (too) simple puzzles, etc.
- Inconsistent logic :
#1: Clementine lifts you over a fence but 5 min later she has to drive a truck near a similar fence to get you over it.
#2: Doc says ""only this generator can power this light"" and then fits this same light in a tiny robot the size of a cat's head.
- Unclear time frame : some robots say they have lived for 500 + years, some say they have 700+ years remaining. I get they live long. But it does not feel like it.

Overall a great game, might play it once again in a year or so, once I forget most of the puzzles.
Would recommend for beginners and pro gamers alike (a little rest is well earned). Just don't let children play this game alone as it can get very scary sometimes.",1703841948,1703841948,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The concept and world that has been created is fascinating, and whilst the gameplay is not the most challenging, it was rewarding to discover the story and the world behind the game, which was deeper and more emotive than I expected. I thought it would be a fun, lighthearted game solving puzzles as a cat, and was hit with a heartfelt story about pets, humanity, and AI.

The length of the game does leave something to be desired - not so much the story, it's compact and well-told, but there could be more to explore, as whilst there are some collectables it does feel like a slight missed opportunity not to be able to see more of the intriguing world that's been created.

Achievements are fun and don't feel like chores - I'm just not sure how much replay value it has because there is only one linear way to play it, which links back to the limited exploration, and there's an achievement to beat it in under two hours which speaks to the amount you can actually do.

-The game is totally worth it. Ill summarize it, you are a cat, you get separate from the rest of other cats and you have to get back, not gonna say more, this story was amazing and beautiful, will get you a teary eye.

-For the Gameplay, there isn't much to talk about, this aint no shooter or anything, so the control are very easy to learn.

-For the graphics, they are some of the best I've seen, not just talking about realism, more like the art style, the lighting, the colors and the tone, the mood it gives, some of the best I seen.

-For the sound?.. just check your pants if you didn't came in them, trust me, the best part was the ambient sound and music.

The game's immersive atmosphere and unique concept immediately draw you in, making it a standout experience in the gaming world.

From the moment you start playing, you're captivated by the stunning visuals and the attention to detail in the world-building. The gameplay mechanics, such as parkour-style movement and interacting with the environment as a feline, are incredibly innovative and add depth to the overall immersion.

However, one aspect that might not resonate with everyone is the choice of the cat's appearance. Some players might have preferences for different types or colors of cats, and the specific choice of a ranga cat might not align with their personal tastes.

Nonetheless, despite personal preferences, the game's brilliance shines through. Its storytelling, unique gameplay, and the sheer joy of exploring the world from a cat's perspective outweigh any minor concerns about the cat's appearance. Stray is a masterpiece that captures the essence of adventure and wonder, offering an unforgettable gaming experience.

The, what i call ""head crabs"" being from the half life generation were the point where we had to swtich back over to stumble guys.  They scared the crap out of her.

Its a real shame I found three points in the game where the mouse stopped working and I had to switch to traversing with keyboard only.

Also I really wanted to complete the game without any help but in the end at any point I found searching for stuff tediuas and distracting from having fun I did use some guides.  for me the game wasn't in finding stuff so I allowed myself that and once I did I found the game enjoyable again.

Overall its a real work of art,  fresh as well as familiar.  **spoiler:  I had a little moment when my buddy died and I clicked expecting to pick him up but instead I fell asleep next him at the top of the world.  I almost wished that momnet had been the end of the game.  quite beautiful.

If you love cats this is purr-fect for you! Overall a great game, yes it can be limited in movements from time to time. On the other hand, was I bothered by it? No, absolutely not. You could move around in the cities and explore all the hidden easter eggs (and napping places). There were several occasions I stopped and took in the stunning scenery! Such a beautiful game, and it had personality. Every robot had their own traits, and some even had their own story to tell.

In my opinion, most video games do not have compelling stories or characters and I find it harder and harder immerse my self in video games because of this. That is why I was thrown off to find that I was unable to put my controller down when playing Stray. Every objective I did just pulled me further into the plot, and I found my self emotionally connected to what I was doing, wanting to help the characters by completing every little puzzle or action.

The world of Stray is immaculate, fully lived in. If there was another game made around the same exact map, I would be more than satisfied to roam the city again.

Now some folks may find the gameplay lackluster, as it is mostly casual, but I think it's appropriate for this sort of storytelling. Not only is it fitting, but they do provide more variety of game play as you progress, keeping things from going stale.

As someone is finding it trickier finding games that speak to me, at this stage in my life, I think this is the sort of game I can see me playing more of: short, strong narrative, and with great attention to visual details.",1703603379,1703603379,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

honestly though, it was a beautiful game; puzzles were a bit difficult but i think its just cause im a bit slow to figure stuff out lol.
the mechanics are a bit frustrating on pc, with the cat sometimes jumping in the opposite direction than intended. also, it took me way to long to realize that you cant sprint and jump at the same time (you have to stop running, then jump, then run again).
the sentinels also sometimes glitched, where if you got in the sentinels eyesight but hid, the sentinels wouldnt return back to its normal movement pattern but instead spin around constantly or jiggle back and forth in one spot very quickly (this forces you to restart to your last checkpoint to fix it).",1703563043,1703563043,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Story is interesting. City is immersive. Gameplay is exciting and intuitive.
Cat animations are very well detailed. There can be seen some flaws, but it's pretty rare occurrence.

The only thing maybe can be considered as disliked is game longevity. I hope this game would be a bit longer. Average time to complete this game is 4-5 hours.

There also some kind of high fps physics bug and your cat can be set flying (rarely, in 1-2 places) if fps is not locked on 60. Looks funny tho. Just know that you need to turn on v-sync/lock fps for a moment If you are stuck. Checkpoint is right there so this bug is not a major problem.

Rebind the key related to shaking off the enemy so that one press does the job instead of you requiring repeated shaking.  Without that I found it too difficult and frustrating.

Pros: Good graphics, good story well told, no crashes or freezes.

I was forced to play at 60 FPS as I had encountered many bugs when playing at uncapped FPS. Many of these bugs were game-breaking: cat jumped through walls multiple times and glitching out of the world, bugged terrain, and glitched dialogues. Playing at 60 FPS ruined the experience even more by how choppy it felt. The world itself felt barren and characters felt dull. Even with everything maxed out, the game still looks dated and different how it seemed in the trailer. The game is really short too and I was really taking my own sweet time to clear and didn't even hit 10 hours.

I'm honestly baffled by how high of a rating it has been getting from most people.

I must applaud the developers for choosing easy kitty-leaping over tricky timed, pixel perfect jumps. I appreciate the excellent level design and the opportunities it provides for exploration. The character interactions, and the story (at least as much as I've been able to experience_I'm currently up to ""Dead End"") are very good if not great. The feline behaviors are spot-on. With so much going for it, why can I not recommend Stray?

Given the thoughtfulness and consideration for the player's experience clearly in evidence in all other aspects, I'm baffled as to why they couldn't also at least provide a variety of difficulty settings for the head crabs, er, I mean zurks,. I get that some folks enjoy dexterity/reflex challenges.  But as it is, I absolutely dread and detest the zurk levels. I derive zero sense of satisfaction/accomplishment for (finally) getting past them. Watching the kitty succumb time-after-time to the zurk hordes is horrifying (yes, I know there is a setting to disable seeing the cat's death--but we still all _know_ what happens). 

Call me crazy, but I do believe that one should look forward to one's next gaming session. With Stray my feeling is more akin to dread than pleasurable anticipation. Knowing that in order to progress in the game I must first get past the next zurk level is a HUGE disincentive to play. That I'm writing a review rather than playing ought to speak volumes.

Is this a game _you._ would enjoy? I don't know. But, I would not recommend it if your play-style preferences align with my own. I truly hope the devs read this review and respond by adding an option for slower, less aggressive zurks.

i found this unique game in the random internet and it was unique for the first time i saw that and decide to buy it when sale. here is my review.

pros
- i think the story was simple, we cat got separated with our colonies and we should get back to them. it was simple but has a good deep meaning
- gameplay was awesome, just like cat in the real life. we can walk fast, sneaky in the small area, run from rats, paw everything, drink water and drop item out of knowhere. this was all impresive
- the world himself was small but feels more alive with robot ai and villain rats in the under city
- we destroy rats with lamp it was unique
- graphic was gorgeous with cyberpunk under city was awesome, the light, the sewers, the tree combine with high future tech was incredible
- the robot has back story of each of them and it was good
- good and easy puzzle
- perfect gameplay hour between 7 hours. it was fit not short and long
- we can miauw :)

cons 
- terible ending, is just go outside with none good explanation. the cats just go outside thats it
- at the moment i hate with rats because i cant fight them but through time we can
- side mission was little boring
- at some point puzzle it was unpredictable
- no minimap
- less dialog with robot

conclusion
this game very fresh and unique, i never play any of kind these game. i respect indie games because they bring something new and this is fresh and i love it. i am looking foward annapurna for make this such a unique games in the future

1. I know it shouldn't matter, but like, why is the cat so smart? Like of course it's just a game blah blah blah, but I just feel like with other stuff being relatively grounded it's weird to me that the cat is intelligent enough to understand B-12 and know what to do and stuff.
2. The cats hit uncanny valley fairly often. I know it's hard to get that stuff right, but when the cat is the main character it's really important to nail it.
3. The biggest one to me, a lot of the meowing sounds sound awful, and they vary so wildly that a lot of them don't even sound like the same cat. I'm not sure if it's some procedural or AI thing, but that kind of stuff took me out of it

Other than those, it's a great little game. A bit expensive at full price, but if you want to 100% you'll get your time's worth. Absolutely worth it on sale.",1703319369,1703319369,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I think its a very experimental game but definitely overrated, I would just get bored after like 30 minutes of playing it each time. Not only that but it's basically just puzzle solving, and the instructions are very unclear at times. The game takes around 4 hours to beat and the lore goes from good to dead with the NPCs. The game hypes up the lore at the start and then when you beat it, you realize it didn't really mean that much. The fact that you can accidentally beat this game on day 1 because the game hypes it up to be this long interesting story, recovering memories and escaping the city just for it to be done in a flash. The ending is also very dry and makes you just say to yourself ""oh okay, its over?"". The main reason I do not recommend it is because its $30 when it should be a $15-$20 game. If it was in that price range I would honestly be fine with the short and dry story.

1332010,154180846,76561199229564332,0,2,1381,0,1381,1703295486,"     I had been debating on getting this game for a while. I had heard various reviews from people, most of which had been positive. One of my concerns was that it would be a 'childish' game. Needless to say, I decided to take the plunge. The story of the game is just...wow. I had expected a light-hearted story about cats and robots (a pretty cool combination to begin with) and left with questions about humanity and society itself. The pure depth of this game is within the top compared to other games that I have played, and the game left me feeling a variety of emotions at the end.
     Another concern that I had was the length of the game. I was worried that it would be too short, especially after seeing people say it was only 5 hours. One of the best aspects of the game is that it can be as long or as short as you want it to be. If you insist on exploring every nook and cranny like me, you could easily reach the 16 hours that I had for my first playthrough. This is not to even mention the additional time that collecting achievements can grant you. When speedrunning the game afterwards, I was amazed at how areas that had taken me multiple days to complete could be finished in a mere 20 minutes.
     It was when going achievement hunting that I noticed the optional difficulty of the game. The game has only one difficulty setting but even that is unlikely to present frustration for the average player. At the same time, however, some skill is definitely needed in certain areas. I found that the game offered a nice balance between skill and story. The strategy sections did not occupy too much of the game, but they also felt intentional. Achievement hunting is a whole other beast. There were times when I felt real frustration as well as spent time planning my next move. I really enjoyed this aspect of the game, especially after having finished the game already. It honestly felt like a whole new game, and I imagine self-made challenges could increase the play time exponentially.
     One of the biggest selling points (for me at least) was that the protagonist was a cat. I can assure you that the developers fully utilized this gameplay choice. I was worried that the fact that you are a literal cat would be forgotten later in the game but every step of the way you see how being a cat both influences gameplay mechanics (get ready to get into some mischief), as well as the story at large.
     The game ran well on my non-gaming computer that I used for school, though I did have to turn the graphics down. Ran on a gaming PC, the graphics look stunning. They are obviously not as nice on lower settings, but I was still able to appreciate the beauty of it all.
     In conclusion, if you are interested in this game, I highly encourage you to at least give it a try. I imagine that within the first two hours you will be hooked. I encourage you to really enjoy the story your first playthrough and explore all that you can. Finally, allow yourself to look beyond the surface of this game and read into the analogies. You might just find yourself changed by the end of it.",1703302430,1703302430,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Story is incredible, super immersive and honestly really emotional. It isn't a long game, I completed it in one sitting however I did miss some things and there are little side quests you can do so it's definitely replayable.

You can definitely tell a controller was the intended mode of play, because some of the default keybindings are a little wild and make the game pretty difficult at times, but I played around and rebound some keys and that did the trick. Setting is beautiful, your character is adorable, you make some really sweet lil robot friends along the way, all in all this is the best game I have purchased and played in a while, and I highly recommend it.

After waiting excitedly for months for the game to be released on Mac, I was beyond disappointed to realize that the game is unplayable on Mac systems. Besides the game being really laggy and the game mechanics being nearly impossible to navigate on a PC, I cannot play the game for more than two minutes at a time now without it crashing. After having to restart the Dead End chapter due to a bug that many other users reported having, I was relieved when I was able to progress beyond the previous point I was stuck at. However, that relief was short lived as all of my inventory and side quest progress was effectively erased. Besides that, the game started crashing every few minutes to the point where I have spent nearly 3 hours trying to restart my computer/ steam/ stray/ tried every suggestion online to fix the issue. Nothing works. I have now given up and come to the conclusion that the game is beyond hope and unplayable.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and we adopted our son together. Both are now 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I felt lost and unhappy. I was self-destructive. One day, I was so angry with everything spiraling out of control that I punched a concrete wall in a moment of overwhelming emotion. This resulted in breaking my fifth metacarpal in my right hand—the hand I worked with, played games with, and used to carry my children to bed—the hand I desperately needed to ensure I could continue providing.

Upon learning the severity of the self-inflicted damage, I became almost suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man, with no history of depression or anxiety. I had never experienced anger outbursts, nor was I the type to break down and cry, but I was in a tough situation that truly prevented me from seeing the light on the other side.

With nothing better to do, I looked for a game I could play WITH ONE HAND while recovering. Somehow, I stumbled upon this game and read some of the comments. I decided it was worth a try... I must admit I didn't beat the game, nor did I play as much as some of you. In fact, I may have played this game for only a day or two. That being said, after doing so, I had a new joy and hope for life. I managed to leave behind the pain and suffering that had been thrust upon me. I could experience the joy and happiness of other people. I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ minutes listening to this music, long enough to realize that I would be okay.

After realizing this, I turned off the game and went back to work. My hand hurt a lot, but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so sorry for myself and became the father I needed to be at that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving like.

Today, I am close friends with the mother of my children. We don't fight, argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents and friends.

Now I have 3 children. My third child is, wait, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my separation, and we just unexpectedly stumbled into each other's lives. We have been dating for a year and are very happy together.

Moral of the story: you never know what life has in store for you, and if I had given up when all odds were against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you.",1671584400,1703152371,True,1,0,0.482352942228317261,0,True,False,False

Many will find the game worth it just for this. Movements are not quite as free as I had hoped, so I can't just run around jumping for no reason. Similar is true for how the game and playability is structured; you can feel that your are just performing actions and solving puzzles in a set order, which can leave you feeling a little less engaged. The game is not a vast world, but they do a lot with what they created, which allows for a good ability to explore, and interact with your surroundings. I think the game was framed quite well to fit a cat-like view of the world, with the game seeming to be based more on thought, curiosity, and caution than action and violence. The game can be a little tricky at times for those playing without a game pad (on a related note, the game also had a glitch, so I was forced to download a mod and cheat in order to continue, but they may have fixed this). I felt like the end was ever so slightly anti-climactic, and could have both tied up a few loose ends and left room for revisiting previous areas without starting over. The re-playability factor is also unfortunately low. I would like to play again, and did try, but it seems too much of a repetition to enjoy (unless I waited a few years).",1702257223,1703029959,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

As for the game-play I wished for more freedom controlling the cat. This could have been easily a movement focused game in the veins of [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/17410/Mirrors_Edge/]Mirrors Edge[/url]. Especially since cats are so agile. But almost never the movement flows and a lot of times traversal just feels downright clunky. Then there are the Zorg/tick/facehugger hybrid enemies. Why? At one point you start to fight them since you get a weapon. So everything that was special about a cat character is gone. 
Unfortunately also the story is pretty bland and the npcs aren't very memorable.
Visuals and atmosphere are spectacular most of the time. but then there's this meat-growth at some places in the game; and boy is it badly made.

I must admit, I encountered the infamous No More Lives achievement (Die 9 times) within my first 5 hours of gameplay, thanks to those cunning Zurks! Those little rascals certainly know how to keep you on your toes.

If you're a fan of puzzle-oriented games and have a soft spot for feline companions, this game is tailor-made for you. The freedom to explore, the visually stunning world, and the delightful puzzles make it a standout choice for anyone seeking a charming and engaging gaming experience.",1702771756,1702771756,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Good level design. This game does a great job of directing the player were to go without quest markers. In the rare instances i felt lost i did not feel lost for long because the game does such a good job guiding the player with the environment. 

Slightly underwhelming story unfortunately. There are a handful of points in the story were they were going for a big emotional impact that did not land on me as strong as i believe they were hoping for.

After getting a job at my local humane society working with the cats, I needed a distraction. While I love my job, we can't save everyone, it hurts the most when the ones you can't save are so small and helpless. So I finally let myself play Stray, and after witnessing what I have with my job, it made me appreciate the game all the more. We had an outbreak of panluek (kinda like the cat version of parvo) at my work, we lost some little ones. Watching them pass one by one whilst stuck in a cage left me deep in a dark pit, akin to what the cat fell into in the beginning. And again like I said before, we can't save them all, but being able to see the lucky ones break free of their cages; it makes our job worth it. I wish they could all find their own way home, but until they do I'll be their B12. Helping them along the way till they reach the outside.

Which you will have forgotten about completely after meeting the robot friend.

+ Graphics are quite pretty, if kind of standard UE5
+ Sound design is excellent, from great (and weird) music to little tippy taps of cat-paws on surfaces.
+ World-building is beautiful, with the robots being very cute.
+ Puzzles are fine. They mostly make sense. And the sneaking was fun.

- The jumping mechanic feels very unfluid and stilted to use. They should have looked at Mirror's Edge.
- Quite a lot of subtle and less subtle clipping issues.
- There are two different buttons for continuing/closing conversations. Why?!?
- You need a flashlight to see in low light. As a cat.
- I managed to soft-lock myself and had to replay a chapter.
- It's very easy to accidentally miss things and not be able to go back without replaying a whole chapter.

at the start, you get separated from your cat friends and fall down into the city. at the end you leave the city but you never see your cat friends again....couldn't throw in like a 5 second shot of the cat friends/family reuniting?

at time of writing this, its been 3 hours and im in a depressed funk.

The gameplay is purely linear, there is not much skill involved since you can only jump to defined positions. The puzzles are not much of a challenge and quite boring. The story is meh. But where it only gets worse when you get to race those Zurk things. Racing them and blowing them up is not so much a question of skill but merely a matter of pure luck.
More often than not the camera pans to nowhere and you completely loose orientation which immediately means that you are dead. It takes an eternity to load the last checkpoint and you can wage another run. This is just so stupid and boring; it adds exatly nothing to the gameplay or atmosphere.

The cat leaps from spot to spot with precision and it is functionally impossible to mess it up. The puzzles are pretty easy as well.

- pretty linear path (does not mean it's boring though)
- game predetermines whether you interact with objects or not (if an object can be picked up, you are supposed to use it; 
  you can't jump on objects which haven't been programmed to be able to be jumped on etc. - though latter is not 
  problematic at all, since it's very clear where you can and cannot jump on)

1. Graphics. While there are certain things like partially floating on stairs the graphics is still amazing.
2. Storyline. The storyline is excellent and it makes you want more so let’s say you are doing chores. What will you be thinking about? Stray. Going to school? STRAY. Playing stray? STRAY.
3. Movie like game. While it is just a video game it was made by a company that makes movies. You may know them from creating the movie nimona earlier this year so they know how to get the lighting PERFECTLY. 

The only downsides are:

1. Addiction. The game is so good you just want more.
2. Getting stuck. In certain areas even though to do parkour you just click a button, there are still parts where you run away from ‘zurks’. (Enemy robots.)
3. Ligma. You can get several side effects from this game including Ligma, Bing chills and getting tped through the backrooms into John cenas mouth into your mother and then back to where you were before. This can take hours or daysor months or even years. Most people call these comas but they shouldn’t be called that. So yea bing chill.

1332010,152965980,76561198358077275,0,3,129,0,129,1701832693,"So I did indeed read the reviews on this game before purchasing it and the ones everyone was ""complaining"" about had other people just stating that it was pretty much a skill issue. I can confirm that the main enemy ""The Zurks"" is the most Aids infested enemy that I have ever seen. I've been playing games for a long time included in those games is Elden Ring so I am no stranger to difficult game play I do understand that they are like the entire story of this game. However the chase events are in my opinion are very sloppy and poorly made the game does give a disclaimer on the title screen that the game is better on a controller which I will address in a second, The chase ""mechanic"" is completely broken essentially your not only expected to run from these creatures which come at you from in front in most cases so you'll have to run through a crowd of them which is pretty much a intsa-death and the only way to live through this encounter is to spam a certain button on your choice of controls, on keyboard and mouse it's the left alt key seeing how this game is literally on steam the majority of the players are going to play on keyboard and mouse, which this game was clearly not made for either way you have to not only run with WASD and the left shift but if you stop spamming the left alt key and these creatures get onto you (which they will) they will kill you in a matter of seconds, on top of all that its not a straight shot nor does the camera change its view point for you so you have to juggle all those key inputs and somehow use your mouse so you can see where your running to or just run into a crowd of these things that are literally placed around every corner. and in some areas of this game you also have to jump onto platforms to continue the area, so in some cases that's a minimum of 3 different keys and a mouse input and the majority of the chase events its 7 key inputs because you have to use WASD, left shift and left alt and a mouse input.

 *SPOILER AHEAD*




 The major tipping point for me to uninstall the game and request a refund wasn't even in the first zurks chase which was aggravating to say the least, it was the elevator spot where you have to wait for the worlds slowest elevator and run in circles yes i said CIRCLES and either pray that none of them hop on you at all or again try and juggle the key combos and use the mouse so you can see if the elevator is there and to make sure you don't get stuck on the abysmal terrain. Not to mention they are insanely fast and if one grabs you, you pretty much stop moving (you don't but your so slow that you might as well have) and then you get gang banged by about 40-50 of them. This game is a horrible port of a console game that was subpar at best to begin with based off the game play I experienced so far. The only upsides I experienced of this game was the visuals and the core cat mechanics I.E. climbing, meowing, scratching walls and carpets and knocking stuff off of shelves. There are as few clever mechanics that implement the core cat mechanics like in the beginning meowing will trigger lights that direct you in the direction your supposed to be heading which is completely dropped once you get B-12 which he just re-iterates what you where told in the first place which can be helpful if you put the game down for a while and come back. So I do NOT recommend that you purchase this game if you value your sanity or time even remotely I bought the game last night December 5th 2023 @ around 1-2 am I played an hour roughly before logging off and going to sleep and in that whole hour or so I dumped into the game I still had no idea what the plot of the story was I only started to get key info on what happened in the slums about 2 ish hours in which based off of other reviews and community threads a good portion of people didn't even get to experience. In other words don't buy this game if your expecting a chill play through as a cat and just learn about the story of the game because you'll have to get more sweaty that most COD lobbies this game was designed for try hards and the pretty much psycho cat people that defend this game like its the second coming of Jesus or some crap will tell you that you just suck at the game and its a skill issue, a good portion of the community are extremely toxic for this game being A LITERAL CAT SIMULATOR and gives off the impression that it is a sight seeing game with a good story but it is neither of those things.",1701836136,1701836136,False,4,0,0.391878813505172729,0,True,False,False

It's the kinda game to leave you a bit stuck on what to do when you finish it, as you can't stop thinking about it for a bit lol. The graphics are incredible and there's an impeccable attention to detail in the game. The story being told from a cats perspective is even more interesting and well done.
It's well optimised and my pc was quiet as a mouse running it, and i experienced next to no lag running it.
It's extremely fun to climb around and cause mayhem, and the game is almost completely void of bugs (i only encountered one small one through the whole game).
Each environment though overall similar has it's own completely unique and stunning environment and atmosphere. Setting the mood very well for each and every scene. Small scenes, atmospheres, difference in music, and other small details create diverse feels as you explore the game.
And of course, the game is a real emotional one (especially if your'e someone like me who cries at any mildly emotional animal-themed game anyway XD).
Honestly my only complaint and one that others may find a make or break on whether or not to get it: it's crazy short. Loved it, but I'm honestly disappointed that i paid 17 pounds (on sale) for a game that took me barely 6 hours to finish (and i took my time too).

The puzzles in Stray are a highlight, offering a good balance between challenge and entertainment. The game keeps players engaged with a variety of puzzles that cleverly integrate the feline perspective. From navigating tight spaces to using the cat's agility to solve environmental challenges, the puzzles contribute significantly to the game's appeal.

While ""Stray"" isn't exactly a casual game, it has its moments of simplicity and accessibility. The controls are intuitive, allowing players to focus on the story and puzzles rather than grappling with complex mechanics. However, there are instances where the difficulty spikes, demanding a bit more concentration from players.

The storyline of ""Stray"" is undeniably interesting, weaving a tale of mystery and discovery. The narrative, however, leaves something to be desired, especially in the conclusion. While the story is refreshing and introduces new elements to the gaming landscape, the ending falls short of the expectations it builds throughout the game. It's not that the ending is bad, but it feels somewhat abrupt and leaves players wanting more closure.

The emotional resonance of the ending is commendable, but I couldn't shake the feeling that the potential for a more impactful conclusion was missed. I expected a bit more depth and development in the finale, considering the investment in the narrative up to that point.

""Stray"" is a worthwhile purchase, particularly if you can snag it on sale. The game's unique concept, charming visuals, and engaging puzzles make it a standout title in the indie gaming scene. While it has its flaws, especially in the conclusion of the story, the overall experience is enjoyable enough to warrant a playthrough, especially for fans of puzzle-adventure games.",1701260658,1701260658,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Such mixed feelings for this game... Don't get me wrong I loved the gameplay and atmosphere in this game but I definitely expected a little more. The ending especially left me feeling empty and with many questions. I was on the last chapter of the game and it didn't even know I was based on how the story was going... Also I hate how this cat never had a reunion with his family, his friend died, and how we didnt get to see the robots reactions for seeing the world being open and in their face essentially. I will say the game is stunning and I loved exploring the different parts of the cities and interacting with the other robot citizens. Would I recommend this?

i followed this game from the very beginning, where it was announced as an obstacle game within a robotic world. simple but caught alot of attention! early videos of the demo are very hard to find - but i was happy to find the official game announced. at first, it was in the dark with no spoken word for a long time. i had faith in what distinct game design it was, and it came true. we need more games like these! but this one, very particular. a cat's pov? in an apocalyptic world? with robots? that transferred their well-beings into metal and tech, due to the downfall of mankind? which also, in turn gives me insight of animals that served as message-delivers in the past, or even, as saviours in the real world.

Sometimes i felt lost trying to find out where to go. The game dosnt make it too easy for you. >_>

Let me ellaborate:

This is a great game in many ways.  It's atmospheric and relaxing to play (for the most part); it has some adventure, platforming and puzzle elements, but it's mainly a walking simulator where the fun is in exploring the world and interacting with the characters.

With that comes it's one real downside though: it's short (I  spent about 11h on a completionist first-time playthrough where I got all of the collectibles and most of the achievements. The ""main"" storyline missions would  take 4-5h on a first play by my estimate, and can easily  be done in under 2 if you've already finished the game and want to rush for the achievement.

Speed- and other challenge runs would have been a great way to enhance replayability (and other games in the genre definitely pulled that off well), but the devs made sure you need to be a complete masochist to do those with Stray, since 90% of your time will be spent watching the same cutscenes over and over again.

Overall, I don't regret buying the game and I don't necessarily recommend you don't buy it. I've posted my review as thumbs down because as of now the game has a stellar rating and at a glance looks like it's going to have enjoyable post-game content, but it doesn't.

If you buy this, assume you will play it once, have a great time for up to 12h and then forget you own it.",1700969079,1700969079,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It certainly appears to be made by a passionate creative team who had fun working on this.

The playthrough time is short and sweet, and I look forward to replaying this game--not just for missed collectibles and achievements, but for the story itself and any tidbits that I may have missed during my first run.

For anyone who might be new-ish to gaming (young or young at heart) that may be intimidated by overwhelming controls or menu interfaces, have limited time to invest, or regularly have an audience at home who enjoys watching the story unfold and solving puzzles with you, then Stray might be perfect for you. 

Not to mention, it's reasonably priced for what it is and a steal when it goes on sale. If purchasing for younger kids, I'm sure that they'll get a lot more playtime mileage (compared to an experienced teen/adult gamer) and enjoy exploring in the different settlements and cityscape levels.

The environments are visually stunning and very detailed, the characters are also pretty nice and interesting both visually and through their dialogue/backstory. There are both insightful and funny quotes told by characters to keep you entertained. 

The cat feels real, both by his gait, little moves and the action you can do with him.

The whole story of the game is creative and original, without having peeked at any trailers before hand, because I wanted to keep the surprise, I was indeed very surprised with how the story went. That's not exactly how I pictured a story about a stray cat to goes. I was very pleased with how it turned out!

The controls are easy to learn and the mechanics to jump from platform to platform is clumsy proof, you can't fall down by accident, so you can focus on solving the puzzle or escaping the enemy without any worry about missing a move because of a lack of dexterity. Which was much appreciated.

The only cons I found in this game is that once you finish a section, you can't go back to an ulterior savepoint, you can only restart a whole chapter, so if you miss a side quest and realize it only after completing the main one, you can't really go back a little to do it, you have to redo a pretty big chunk of the story. But it's only a minor irritant, I will probably replay the whole thing again just for fun anyways, so no big deal!

Stray, the latest game from [Developer], invites players to embark on a captivating journey through a visually stunning and immersive cybernetic world. Released for [Platforms], this indie gem stands out for its unique premise and execution.

The first thing that strikes players is the breathtakingly detailed and atmospheric cityscape. The neon-lit streets and towering skyscrapers create a cyberpunk aesthetic that feels both familiar and mysterious. The attention to detail in the environment design is commendable, making exploration a delightful experience.

At the heart of Stray is its protagonist, a stray cat navigating the intricate alleyways of a futuristic city. This unconventional choice for a main character adds a fresh perspective to the gameplay. Controlling a nimble feline offers a unique blend of stealth and agility, providing a welcome departure from traditional protagonists.

The narrative unfolds gradually as the cat encounters various robotic denizens of the city. The absence of traditional dialogue doesn't hinder the storytelling; instead, it adds to the enigma of the world. The player is left to piece together the narrative through environmental cues and the actions of the mechanical inhabitants.

Puzzles in Stray are cleverly integrated into the environment, requiring players to think like a cat to navigate the challenges. Whether it's leaping across rooftops, squeezing through tight spaces, or interacting with the city's machinery, the puzzles are intuitive and satisfying.

One of Stray's standout features is its dynamic soundtrack. The music seamlessly adapts to the player's actions, enhancing the overall immersive experience. The subtle melodies during exploration and the tension-building beats during intense moments add layers to the emotional connection with the game.

While Stray excels in many aspects, it's not without a few minor flaws. Some players might find the controls a bit finicky, especially when executing precise movements. Additionally, the camera angles in tight spaces occasionally hinder the otherwise smooth navigation of our feline protagonist.

In conclusion, Stray is a remarkable addition to the indie gaming scene, offering a fresh perspective on storytelling and gameplay. Its beautiful visuals, unique protagonist, and engaging puzzles make it a standout experience for those seeking something beyond the mainstream. Stray is not just a game; it's a whisker away into an enigmatic and unforgettable journey.

Game of the Year, I suppose

But seriously, it turned out to be a wonderful and very soulful game. An indie game with nice visuals that skillfully hides the low development budget. A short running time, a plot that doesn’t really claim anything special and not the most complex gameplay in other circumstances could be disadvantages, but this game even suits. This makes it quite accessible, an intimate adventure for several hours that leaves a pleasant aftertaste. I even wanted to replay it right away to get all the achievements and see all the missing content.

'Miaw!' I.F*cking.Love.This.Game.So.Much. Its a 'meow' MASTERPIECE and it has bumped my until now favourite game of all time Alien Isolation off the list and 'meow' replaced it with Stray. I loved every second of it, the 'meooow' visuals, the sounds, the story, the 'miaw meow!' control scheme and how u 'meow' steer in the game is SO 'meow meeeooow' sastifying and I just want to log in and run around in midtown just because. Im not even a cat person, im a dog person, but I almost went out and got a 'MEOW' cat after this haha. It makes u happy 'miavmiav', it makes u sad and it makes u feel. I dont know 'meow' what to 'meow' do with myself after I finished 'meowmeooow' this game and I need more in my life from this world, style and gameplay. 
I would love, no I demand, a sequel, or a prequel, or even a game similar 'meow' in design, visuals and controls just with a dog instead, or anything really. The 'MIAV!' 'puurrrrr' cyberpunk sci fi style was so well 'meow' made and its the best game to date that I have ever played. I only miss the speedrun achievement now, but I fully plan to go for it, if nothing else then' miow meow' just to hang around in this world.
I regret complaining for a year about 'miav' never seing this game on a big sale so I could get it cheaper' but I finally gave in and bought it when it only had a 10% discount, and I take it back, this game deserve full price and no discount, it is worth it and deserves it. Ty for this xperience!
I had 0 bugs in the game so far, apart from the Sneakitty achievement, which u just need to change ur max FPS settings in game to 30, instead of 60, and then it triggered for me.

Stray, developed by BlueTwelve Studio and published by Annapurna Interactive, takes players on a captivating journey through the neon-soaked alleyways of a futuristic cityscape, where players assume the role of a stray cat navigating a world filled with mystery and intrigue.

One of the most striking aspects of Stray is its unique premise. Playing as a stray cat provides a fresh perspective on the game world, as players explore environments from a low vantage point, pouncing through alleys and rooftops. The developers have successfully captured the essence of feline movement, creating an immersive experience that feels authentic and fluid.

Visually, Stray is a feast for the eyes. The game's cyberpunk-inspired city is brought to life with stunning detail, featuring intricate alleyways, towering skyscrapers, and dazzling neon lights that create a visually arresting atmosphere. The attention to detail extends to the character designs, with both the stray cat and the various robotic inhabitants exuding personality through their animations and expressions.

The gameplay in Stray strikes a balance between exploration, puzzle-solving, and occasional stealth elements. As a cat, players can interact with the environment, solving puzzles and navigating obstacles to progress through the story. The integration of the cat's abilities, such as squeezing through tight spaces or climbing walls, adds a layer of depth to the gameplay that keeps it engaging throughout.

The narrative in Stray unfolds through environmental storytelling, allowing players to piece together the world's lore through subtle clues and observations. The absence of direct dialogue or exposition may not be for everyone, but it adds a layer of mystery and discovery that aligns with the overall theme of the game.

The sound design in Stray deserves special mention. The ambient sounds of the city, the cat's echoing footsteps, and the machinery's hum all contribute to the game's immersive atmosphere. The music, composed by Vivian Lien, complements the cyberpunk aesthetic perfectly, enhancing the emotional impact of key moments in the story.

While Stray offers a unique and captivating experience, it is not without its minor flaws. Some may find the controls a bit finicky, especially during precision-based platforming sections. Additionally, the lack of a clear objective marker might leave players occasionally wandering in search of their next goal.

In addition to its captivating features, Stray enriches the gaming experience with a myriad of [url=https://stray.fandom.com/wiki/References]references[/url] to movies, series, and even other games, adding an extra layer of enjoyment to an already enthralling adventure!

In conclusion, Stray is a visually stunning and emotionally resonant journey that successfully blends an innovative premise with engaging gameplay.

On the surface, it looks like a game about being a cute cat -- and while it is that, it's also an epic sci-fi story about a post-apocalyptic city inhabited by robots. The storytelling, atmosphere, and soundtrack are excellent. The gameplay is varied and generally engaging.

Technically speaking, the game looks beautiful and is very well optimized. The environments and characters are rich with detail even on the lower settings, though the game remains relatively undemanding. Make no mistake, you won't be running this on a potato, but you don't need the latest and greatest hardware to get 60 FPS out of it either.

The environment oozes with charm and demands to be explored, and while I usually am not the most prone to exploring, I really checked every nook and cranny of the environment. The story is very charming and a little sad, but ends on a very beautiful and hopeful note. 

However, while I really enjoyed this experience, I would recommend waiting for a steam sale before purchasing this game. Like I said, I explored a lot and found about 75% of the secrets, and the game still only took me 5 hours to complete. There isn't a ton that's drawing me in to replay it, either--while there is room to explore, it is quite a linear game that feels more like a walking sim at times than anything else.

Ok, battling through.  It now found a new way to kill my cat.  NOOO, but I'm soldiering on!

It's beautiful, I love lots about it.  Shame there are some crushingly poor game design choices.  Usually works out as .  Exploring looking for something, you suddenly zone somewhere else and can't go back.  I've been got by this 3 times now.  Pisspoor, quite annoyed.

Some really bad checkpointing also makes this worse.  Checkpoints exist to ensure enough 'unfun' in a game. To ensure that people are irritated at redoing sections enough to satisfy some weird need.  Grr.

The game's great when it's just focusing on character and environment and simple puzzles (map would have been nice thx).  But its charm is frequently obliterated by poor game design choices.  NO, I'm NOT doing that level again to get a badge.   Kinda takes the edge off the joy.

Still, very beautiful and with a really lovely feel apart from the points mentioned above.

Simple gameplay, although it can be challenging at times for new or younger players. But the real selling point, of course, is that you play as a cat.

The cat movements and idle animations are life-like and fun to watch (and I say this as someone who has spent a lot of time around cats). You can do many things a cat normally does: knock things off of tables and ledges, meow at people, scratch the furniture, wriggle into small spaces, abscond with small objects, sleep in odd places, and steal everyone's hearts.

As far as combat or ""action"" there's not a ton to it, you pretty much run away from or vaporize the disgusting tick-like (or headcrab-like) Zurks. This game is primarily an adventure game with some puzzle and point-and-click elements. It also has some stealthy sections, but I was not expecting the horror elements to be so... Terrifying. It triggered something deep and dreadful in me and while it was only a short segment of the game it left a lasting and horrifying impression on me. The main character, Cat, and his little companion, B12, are some of the cutest protagonists of any game I've ever played, and all the robot NPC's are so well fleshed out and enjoyable. I found myself caring about every single (non-evil) character in this game to the point that I was constantly worried about them and wanting them to be okay.
The game is short (about 6-ish hours according to my in-game playtime, but Steam clocked me at 13 to beat it fully) but it's short and sweet. It's absolutely gorgeous, every single area is so well fleshed out. The robots feel more alive than some human characters in games, and the Cat is a wonderful character to play as. Not only is he(?) faithfully cat, but you connect with him on such a deep level, and you will feel for him. With this said it is possible to die in the game from Zurks, an the deaths feel horrible, but they're supposed to feel horrible and they work.
All-in-all I adored this game. It's so well-done. I loved all the characters, Main, Supporting, and NPC, and the story is one of hope, despair, happiness, and deep, deep sorrow. Play this game if you love cats, robots, humanity in the non-human, a deep, engaging story, or a fun, thought-provoking adventure.
If you scare easily, be prepared to be chilled to the bone. And if you are very emotional, be prepared to cry a lot. I did both.",1699848455,1699848455,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Visually, ""Stray"" is a masterpiece. The game's futuristic cityscape is a breathtaking amalgamation of neon lights, intricate details, and a lived-in atmosphere that truly immerses players in its cyberpunk world. The attention to detail in the environments is remarkable, with every alley, rooftop, and hidden corner telling a story of the city's past and present. The dynamic lighting and weather effects add a layer of realism that enhances the overall immersion.

The protagonist, a stray cat equipped with a small backpack, serves as an unlikely but endearing guide through this sprawling urban jungle.

Gameplay mechanics in ""Stray"" are intuitive and accessible, making it easy for players to navigate the vast city and solve puzzles without feeling overwhelmed. The game cleverly integrates the cat's abilities, such as climbing and interacting with the environment, into the challenges, making for a seamless and enjoyable experience.

One of the standout features of ""Stray"" is its exceptional sound design. The ambient sounds of the city, combined with a hauntingly beautiful musical score, contribute significantly to the overall atmosphere. The attention to detail extends to the lively and diverse soundtrack that adapts to the player's actions, enhancing the emotional impact of key moments.

While ""Stray"" is not without its minor flaws, such as occasional camera angles that may require adjustment, these are overshadowed by the game's overall brilliance. The developers have created a unique and memorable experience that sets ""Stray"" apart in the world of indie games. It's a testament to the potential of video games as an art form and a reminder that a well-crafted world and story can elevate a game to a truly extraordinary level.

I overall love atmosphere of this game, the attention to detail, the soundtrack, ease of play, and the ability to adventure as an adorable orange cat. I can finally be a cat and knock random objects off from counters for my own amusement!

""Stray"" is the purr-fect blend of adventure and charm, where you navigate a dystopian world not as a grizzled hero, but as a cat. Yes, a four-legged, fur-covered, meowing protagonist. It's like if ""Blade Runner"" had a pet-friendly policy.

Graphically, the game is a neon-lit feast for the eyes, with environments so detailed you can almost feel the dampness of the alleyways and the rust on the robots. The attention to detail is so meticulous that you might find yourself stopping just to knock over a few bottles (because, well, you're a cat).

Gameplay is a delightful mix of exploration, puzzle-solving, and feline shenanigans. You leap, scamper, and meow your way through the city, unraveling mysteries and making friends with the less-furry inhabitants. The controls are fluid, capturing the grace of a cat with surprising accuracy, until you accidentally leap into a chasm because you were distracted by a flying insect.

The story is a heartwarming tale, set against a backdrop of a world where humans are history and robots are running the show. It's as if someone wrote a sci-fi epic and then let a cat walk all over the keyboard – in the best way possible.

The soundtrack deserves a special mention, perfectly complementing the mood with its atmospheric tunes. It's like a soothing serenade for your alleyway adventures, with the occasional upbeat rhythm to match your feline frolics.

In terms of challenge, ""Stray"" is more of a gentle stroll than a frantic sprint. The puzzles are engaging without being hair-pullingly difficult, making it accessible to gamers of all skill levels.

But the real star of the show is, of course, the cat. The way it moves, interacts with the environment, and meows with a sense of feline authenticity will resonate with cat lovers and even convert a few dog people.

""Stray"" is a unique gem in the gaming world, offering an experience that's both relaxing and engaging. It's a must-play for anyone who's ever wondered what it's like to see the world through the eyes of a cat – complete with all the napping and mischief that entails.",1699716544,1699716544,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

From the moment I stepped into the neon-lit streets of this cyberpunk metropolis, I knew I was in for something special.

The first thing that struck me was the game's visually stunning world. The attention to detail in the bustling cityscape, illuminated by vibrant neon lights, is nothing short of mesmerizing. The developers have successfully created a living, breathing environment that feels both futuristic and lived-in. Navigating the city as a stray cat brought an unexpected charm to the gameplay, allowing for a fresh perspective on the world around me.

The narrative is equally compelling. Stray weaves a mysterious tale that kept me engaged from start to finish. As a stray cat equipped with a backpack-mounted drone, I found myself uncovering the secrets of the city and forming unexpected alliances with other sentient robots. The emotional depth and subtle storytelling are commendable, creating a bond between the player and the characters that goes beyond the typical gaming experience.

One of the standout features of Stray is the innovative puzzle-solving elements. The integration of the drone as a tool for exploration and interaction adds a layer of complexity to the puzzles, making them both challenging and satisfying to solve. The seamless transition between cat and drone gameplay kept the experience diverse and prevented any sense of monotony.

While the controls took a bit of getting used to, especially in cat form, they eventually became second nature, allowing for smooth and intuitive navigation. The occasional camera angles were a minor hiccup, but they didn't significantly detract from the overall enjoyment of the game.

In conclusion, Stray is a masterpiece that pushes the boundaries of storytelling and gameplay. It's a must-play for anyone looking for a fresh, immersive experience in a cyberpunk world. The fusion of captivating visuals, a compelling narrative, and innovative gameplay make Stray a standout title that will leave a lasting impression on players. Don't miss out on this feline adventure through the dazzling streets of Stray.",1699696462,1699696462,True,1,0,0.442028999328613281,0,True,False,False

While there are action levels in Stray, it is mostly a contemplative game. You are meant to explore the world, meet its robot inhabitants and learn its culture and history.

The atmosphere has a sort of nostalgia to it, with robots not remembering humans but still keeping their mannerisms. The cities are beautiful, and you are fully immersed in this strange neon world from the get go.

The cat is incredibly well done and you get attached to it from the first cinematic onwards. He moves like a cat, emotes like a cat, and you can do a lot of things people love cats for, such as pushing things off shelves and rubbing against people. The interactions between the cat and the robots were very wholesome, it was very easy to feel empathy for everyone and feeling involved in the game.

It was easy to get emotionally invested in the story and the success and well-being of different characters. There are a few plot twists you definitely see coming, but it takes nothing away from the emotional impact.

There aren't many mechanics and the game isn't very difficult ; for me it was about discovering another world and living adventures with a lovely cat.",1681069444,1699216491,True,1,0,0.525862038135528564,0,True,False,False

However, the environments are beautiful, the characters are charming, and the sound design is amazing. I have heard people rag on the fixed jumping; however, being able to freely jump around rooftops in a chapter like The Slums would become incredibly frustrating after unintentionally falling to the ground for the 18th time. Also, the movement would look less natural. My gripes stem from the game being somewhat short and lacking in areas to explore. A big city like Midtown feels like it should have more to interact with but ends up feeling smaller and emptier than The Slums. This is not a difficult game to get through and the only part I had trouble with was in the Jail. I believe the game is meant to be treated more as an experience and that's fine with me. However, it significantly reduces the replayability and makes a lot of collectables a headache to find in a level you have circled around 15 times. The challenge lies in finding the collectables tucked away somewhere instead of testing your movement or deviating from a path. I appreciated the silent storytelling at the beginning of the game and I feel like it could have been interesting to keep it for the rest. On the flip side, I also liked interacting with the robot characters. I enjoyed the game very much and I do recommend others to play it, if only to play it once and experience all the charm the developers put in it.",1659414895,1699131939,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The visuals are jaw-dropping, and the dystopian world is a masterpiece of creativity. But the real star here? Our feline hero – you can't help but fall in love!

The game struggles to define itself; it's a mix of platformer, puzzle, and walking simulator, but doesn't excel in any. However, its strength lies in the ironically lively and warm dead city and its robots. Interacting with robots and engaging in side quests adds a fun element to the experience.

Getting separated from your family is already a tough break. On top of that, being dropped into an strange new world unlike any you've seen before just makes things so much worse. Luckily, there are many friendly faces to lend a helping hand.

These new friends may be of the hard and clunky type, but they are kind enough to show us the way home. Besides, they are much better than those nasty bugs. Nasty or not, they wont stand in the way of our long adventure home, and along the way we might as well get some scratches and nap time in, as well. It's the cat thing to do.

[b] Pros [/b] 
[list]
    [*]Beautifully designed levels that creates an exceptional dystopian cyberpunk feel
    [*]Lots of verticality opens up exploration and helps capture the feel of being a feline
    [*]Great way of story telling through the zones and characters you meet
[/list] 

[b] Cons[/b] 
[list]
    [*]Game isn't very lengthy, which is sad as I'd love to explore a lot more time with our kitty friend

There's that, of course, but there's also a heck of a lot of a lot of stilted biohorror action platforming and janky light stealth. When trying it's best to be a ""vidya game,"" Stray is just a tedious exercise relatively easy trial and error. Should have just stuck to the adventure game core.

What it really is for the most part is a screen shot generator. I was expecting that this game would light my RTX 3060 up, but it only stirred the slightest purr from the case fans. The graphics tech on display here is mostly pre-baked textures and excellent art, but they punch way above their weight, delivering gobs of character, mood, and atmosphere. You get about 80 percent of the Ghostwire Tokyo feel without the space heater effect in your computer room.

The animation is, of course, excellent. Star of the show. Come for the cat; stay for the cat; make the can sleep, scratch stuff, and jump in and out of boxes. SOOOOOO CUTE.

The story is... OK. Post-post-apocalyptic future. Futility of survivalism. Corpofascism is bad. Lots of Noble Sacrifice. The art and animation sell it more than the writing. It's a kid's game. Don't expect too much profundity. 

Stray is a nice, day-long romp for when you have time to kill. Its high quality visuals, charming animation, and brisk pace more than outweigh its diffuse focus or weak story.",1698615739,1698615739,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
In the sprawling metropolis of Stray, developer BlueTwelve Studio has managed to create an atmosphere that is both breathtaking and deeply evocative. Yet, beneath the futuristic facades and neon-lit streets lies a palpable sense of isolation that resonates with our own lives in a profound way.

Stray, at its core, is a game that captures the essence of loneliness. As you step into the role of a stray cat, you are immediately struck by the solitude that pervades every corner of the city. The world feels vast, and you, a solitary feline, are left to navigate its labyrinthine alleyways, devoid of human companionship.

The game's visuals are a haunting testament to the art of isolation. The dilapidated buildings, flickering holograms, and the rain-soaked streets create a sense of desolation that mirrors the loneliness we can all feel at times. The cats you encounter in this digital realm, while visually intriguing, never quite manage to fill the emotional void left by the absent human presence.

The sound design further intensifies this feeling of isolation. The distant hum of machinery, the echoes of your own footsteps, and the eerie silence of a city without people all contribute to the sense of solitude. It's a reminder of the stark reality that many individuals face in the real world, especially in bustling urban environments.

As you traverse the city, solving puzzles and interacting with your robotic companions, you're acutely aware of the absence of meaningful connections. While there are fleeting moments of connection with the robots, they serve as a stark contrast to the depth of human relationships. This loneliness hits particularly close to home in a world where human interactions are increasingly mediated by technology.

Stray beautifully underscores the importance of human connection and the emotional impact of isolation. It's a reflection of how loneliness can be a powerful and often overlooked aspect of our lives. The game serves as a reminder to cherish the connections we have and to strive to reach out to those who may be feeling adrift in their own urban jungles.

In Stray, the profound sense of loneliness experienced by the protagonist feline mirrors the loneliness we can all encounter in our lives. It serves as a poignant reminder of the importance of human connection, urging us to cherish the relationships we have and to seek out those who may be struggling with the isolation of the modern world.

This Game teaches us what it is like to own friends who would trust you with their lives to help you. This Game is not just a game but also a story that makes your heart heavy as you progress through the storyline...",1695756378,1698605691,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The opening sequence made me burst out in tears because the black cat looked exactly like one of the cats I grew up with which has been with me since 1999 but has died 13 years ago. At the end I also almost cried because the cat snuggled to the robot. This game was an emotional ride. I had to restart the slums part 1 because my notebooks disappeared after I showed them to elliot which really frustrated me in a way because I had to find all the music sheets and energy cans again on only to miss one badge somewhere and not getting the achievement to get all badges because I forgot to talk to the guy in the factory before obatining the keys after restarting the sthealth section yet anoth hundred times. 
Stray is a beautiful and wonderful game in visuals and story but it can also get frustrating. Especially when going for achievements. 
The Zurk chases are extremely frustrating when using mouse and keyboard btw so make sure to have a controller on hand. 
Also there might be bugs like the notebooks mentioned earlier but also you can randomly get catapulted under the map when interacting with something on a wall (especially when you meet one of the sons of a missing robot) and the cat jumps. 
However it's a cute game and if you love cats, great world building that's not in your face and the cyberpunk genre It's the game for you. 
I needed 12 hours to beat it but only because I took all the sights in and because I sadly had to restart chapters due to bugs. 
I give it a solid 7/10

1) Adorable main character.
2) Pretty good controls and mechanics, 95% of the time (trying to jump into box, but wind up on a structure)

4) Nice overall story that worked well and finished with the thought ""nice, I like it"".
5) Easter Eggs and refs that I got gave me a chuckle or a smile.

What I did not like was the save point system.
Like returning the keys to the robot in the factory, took a bit to find them, and by the time I'd noticed I still had them and my progress left no way back, but escape and can't reenter like most places.
Losing the Zurk zapper: some parts had too many, which was the point, but you could point it down at the Stray vs meowing, which was easier to me.

This game is also incredibly short, so unless you REALLY like playing as a cat, I wouldn't recommend paying full price for this.

Hands down the best this game has to offer is its atmosphere and environmental design. Every level is pretty damn beautiful and on par with some AAA games that came out the past 5 years, but there's not much you can do in them. Best thing I remember from the environments in this was entirely in the first level, where you had at least 3 unique side objectives if you want to be a completionist, but the other levels seem to ditch this mentality in favor of strictly following the story.

Gameplay wise, the game is extremely bare bones in terms of controls, but it does work quite nicely. Although, some ""puzzles"" are quite infuriating and you'll often be left asking yourself ""What do I do now?""
There's a complete lack of a direction system or a hint system that helps you know where you need to go, so unless you remember the location of EVERYTHING, it's mostly up to luck or your patience to see how long it takes for you to find where you actually need to go with the occasional context clues that might help you along the way.

The story is mediocre. None of the major events in the story felt really noteworthy, and the protagonist being a cat does not help in that regard. They tried to add a sentimental story to this game but I really didn't feel it towards the end, and I'm afraid there's really not much else to be said about it without spoiling it completely (not that there's much).

TL;DR, this is a 3 hour long game (depending on how much you like exploring and being a completionist) with a pretty mediocre story and occasionally frustrating puzzles and level design. It's visually beautiful and occasionally has its entertaining moments, but doesn't really earn anything other than being a cute cat game.

It could even be a great gift for a loved one or friend who you know likes cats and video games. I'm not fond of cats but I couldn't pass up this game with how unique it looked and it was a fun ten hours to get all of the achievements. I enjoyed jumping on tables and other places that I need not be and knocking everything off, meowing incessantly at any sleeping robots, etc. 

Graphically, the game is beautiful. Its setting is urban and many of the areas are rather linear but there's plenty to explore in the bigger parts of the game such as the cities, where the beloved feline is dexterous enough to explore verticality. There's a few 'collectibles' that you can hunt for, such as these cool little badges that can be pinned onto the cat's vest to accessorize it. Climbing and jumping onto platforms is simple enough, you just press one button while looking into its direction and the cat will do its jump animation. The game recommends the usage of a controller but my keyboard and mouse worked perfectly fine. I just had to rebind the 'meow' key, which was left-ALT by default, to another button as it became apparent how integral this command was when dealing with the hostile creatures (more on that next). 

To make the game less of a walking simulator, in the first phase of the game you'll often encounter these giant tick looking creatures (zurks) that will chase you. The second game features flying robots (sentinels) that you'll have to sneak around in order to complete your goals. In general, the game is not at all too challenging and is very much more of a casual experience. Most of the puzzles I had solved inadvertently before realizing it was even part of a puzzle.  

Given that you can beat the game in less than 5 hours, or around 10 to 12 hours for getting all of the achievements, it can be argued that $30 USD is a bit too pricey for how short the video game is. But if this particular team developed this video game as a sort of experiment then there certainly should be a sequel or prequel that hopefully has more features to it.",1698105156,1698105253,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

But unlike the majority, I didn't think it qualified as a great game. There were too many questionable design choices. Too many little annoyances and too many missed opportunities to really qualify it as gem. I always felt like there was something missing that I couldn't quite put my finger on. On two separate occasions I started playing it, got through several hours of gameplay and then drifted away to something else - the first time for so long that I had to boot it up from scratch to remember the story. 

Stray couldn't decide what it wanted to be: a narrative adventure, a 3D platformer, a puzzler... It added elements of all these  genres but never quite excelled at any of them. Stray did two things phenomenally: it created a world that was truly fascinating and it made that world absolutely gorgeous. But with the gameplay, it didn't quite do that beautiful world justice and that feels like a shame. I am still glad I experienced it but I can't see myself ever replaying it.

+++ Environment / Graphics - Very well done
+++ World Building - Absolutely gorgeous... the exploration was by far the best part of the game
+/- Storytelling - A lot of missed opportunities here. Overall structure of the story was great but the storytelling not so much
+/- Audio - Soundtrack was fantastic but the game was begging for voice-acting. Even if it was just the main character translating what the NPCs were saying
+/- Puzzles - The puzzles were just okay. A few were decent but most were overly simplistic. Also, way too much reuse.

Stray, an indie gem that whiskers its way into the gaming world, delivers a truly unique and mesmerizing experience. After 6.2 hours spent exploring the mysterious and cybernetic world of a lost cat, it's evident that this game offers something truly special.

Stray thrusts players into a beautifully realized, dystopian cityscape where humans have vanished, and robots and holograms now roam the streets. You play as a stray cat with a small backpack and a piece of duct tape stuck to your back, which makes for an unusual and endearing protagonist. The game's exploration-focused gameplay gives you the freedom to navigate this mysterious world as a feline, offering a fresh and immersive perspective.

The atmosphere and world-building in Stray are its undeniable strengths. The city is a marvel of cyberpunk aesthetics, a curious blend of neon lights, holographic advertisements, and overgrown vegetation reclaiming the urban sprawl. The attention to detail is exquisite, immersing you in a world that feels both familiar and alien.

The core of Stray's gameplay revolves around exploration, platforming, and puzzle-solving. As a cat, you'll have to leap across rooftops, crawl through tight spaces, and use your agility to solve environmental challenges. The game's puzzles are inventive and often require a blend of observation and lateral thinking, making them satisfying to solve.

The interactions with the robotic inhabitants of the city add depth to the gameplay. You'll find both helpful and not-so-friendly robots, each with their unique quirks and behaviors. These interactions, often non-verbal, enrich the narrative of the world and your place within it.

One of the standout features of Stray is its storytelling approach. The game adopts a minimalist, wordless narrative style that allows players to interpret the story's nuances and emotions through their own perspective. The cryptic nature of the narrative may leave some players wanting more explicit explanations, while others will appreciate the freedom to draw their conclusions.

The ambiance and audio design in Stray are soothing and captivating. The sounds of a bustling city, combined with the solitude of the streets, create an enchanting and immersive audio experience that complements the game's visual aesthetics.

However, with its 6.2 hours of gameplay, Stray can feel somewhat short for some players. The game's open-ended and exploratory nature may leave some desiring a more structured narrative or additional content.

In conclusion, Stray is a remarkable and unconventional gaming experience. As a whiskered wanderer in a cybernetic world, the game captures the heart and imagination, offering a unique perspective and an adventure that feels both peaceful and enigmatic. The game's stunning aesthetics, minimalist storytelling, and the charm of its protagonist make Stray a standout title for those looking for something different and emotionally resonant in the world of gaming. It's a journey that speaks to the soul in subtle and beautiful ways, despite its relatively brief duration.",1697716990,1697716990,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[*] Beautiful graphics and art direction

[*] Very short, was able to finish in 4 hours with some exploration
[*] personally I found the ending to be unsatisfying, not awful just didn't hit the mark for me
[*] Limited repeatability 
[*] Generally a little easy

Overall Stray is just a really wonderful game, it's beautiful and IMO who doesn't love cats? The graphics are really awesome, and the perspective of a cat's view is just really cool and unique. It's one of the few games that was actually able to make me emotional and it really is just beautiful.

Sadly, it's a little short and with an ending that to me was a little unsatisfying and somewhat disappointing really hold it back from it's full potential. It was never going to truly be a game that blew anyone out of the water, but it's so unique and engrossing, I definitely think it's one of those games you just have to play and enjoy for yourself..or at least watch a playthrough.",1697681123,1697681123,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

the first time, i was impressed by the level of detail in the city.
the zurks were a nasty introduction, and one time i thought the game would be better of without them.
but once you find out how to swerve around these nasty all-eters, they actually fit well in the game.
same could not be said of the sentinels, wich are introduced in the second half of the story.
while the zurks can be shaken of in the case you make a wrong move, with the sentinels, its simply game over, and that happened a lot :(
still, both the story and the game are realy well made, and sometimes i simply ignored the story and went on exploring the city, enjoying the streets and looking for easter eggs.

however, after seeing those controlboxes glowing up in the last scene were the cat walks away... i wonder if:
- B12 s firmware somehow survived too, but only needs a new body to rejoin the cat

This game has GREAT graphics, but that's not the only thing that defines a game. First off, the game is pretty short. I finished my first playthrough in about 3.5 hours and then took another 3 hours getting all achievements excluding 'I Am Speed' achievement which is beating the game in <2 hours and the stupid 'Can't Cat-ch Me' achievement, which everyone hates and is basically rng which took another 3 hours or so. Besides this though, I would give the game a 8/10 overall due to it's graphics, music track, story, and environment. The -2 points comes from the ""Can't Cat-ch Me' achievement, short gameplay, not having freedom of jumping, and not directly being able to fight. 'Can't Cat-ch Me' could be much more enjoyable if it was a timed achievement. Gameplay, jumping, and fighting cannot be fixed atm, but maybe could be changed in a sequel through increasing the story, allowing players to jump on command, and allowing to cat to bite or scratch at enemies for attacking. That is my opinion though, and it doesn't change the fact that this was an enjoyable game.",1671753183,1697593970,True,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

I thought this was just going to be a fun little game where you can play as a cat and do cat stuff, but the devs went above and beyond with this release. The puzzles are clever, the storyline is captivating as well as emotional, and the gameplay is well thought out. There's very few games I'd pay full price for (especially when the main quest isn't crazy long), but this is a game you shouldn't sleep on. Even when you've completed it, there's enough juice left in this lemon to be squeezed for a Costco sized jug of lemonade. I did have a qualm about a certain RNG based achievement, but did it ever feel good to finally have that one under my belt; so I guess I can't be too salty.

It's short (20hrs or 2-3 days) and there's nothing like it. The world-building is incredibly strong, and you get to see it established throughout each level. The attention to detail and the nuance of every location, character, and story-line made me addicted. The mechanics (a lot of climbing!) are fun and easy to pick up on. There are many ways to interact with your environments, and optional things to explore outside of the main plot progression. This game is great at making you want to linger in chapters, which you can conveniently replay anytime after completing them without losing any progress. This is super useful if you want to return for things you've missed. Not to mention that the lighting, sound, and graphics in general are amazing.

Also, there's a Meow button. 

The characters are all complex in their own regards. Each place is firmly established, and the plot was a tear-jerker for me. If you like cats, the cyberpunk genre, robots, or good games in general, you might like this one. For those who don't play games often: If you are good enough at using your keyboard, you can easily pick it up.

SPOILER WARNING - SPOILERS AHEAD
______________________________________
SPOILER WARNING - SPOILERS AHEAD

There are some minor issues I noted. I tried to keep it vague:

1) When collecting the notebooks at the start, they can disappear from your inventory before you interact with the important character to continue the plot. Some people have found that reloading from your last checkpoint (which auto-saves, and will do so if you complete specific optional tasks) helps, but this did not work for me. I simply replayed the chapter and sort of speed-ran it since I remembered all the key locations.

2) Once, a character was not in the required place for a cutscene to look correct. They were interacting with an item but hadn't teleported to the proper location, making the motions in the air while facing away.

3) Once, a character did not continue its animation (outside of cutscene) to allow us to progress further. Reloading from the last checkpoint (mere seconds before) fixed this easily.

4) Stray enemies may fail to run towards you with others and simply freeze and die wherever they end up. This doesn't happen with all of them but it is common for one or two to get left behind this way. This does not necessarily impact gameplay asides from helping a tiny bit sometimes. 

5) You can occasionally make your character glitch out at very specific surfaces / spots. No clipping, just a vibrating character model as you keep walking into whatever it is. Does not impact gameplay at all as you can easily stop and continue. 

6) Not necessarily a glitch, just adds a little tedium -- if you replay a chapter to get one of the optional collectibles for your companion robot, you have to finish that chapter after interacting and getting the maker filled blue. If you do not do so, it will not save it. Thankfully, the chapters are short and rather easy if you've gotten the hang of it. 

Overall not anything that made it impossible to progress, though the first issue made me think so. If you're reading this, consider trying what I did and it may work.",1697271820,1697271870,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

OK, the graphic and sound are all right.
The game looks pretty good, although the animations of the main character look a little off to someone who knows how cats move. At some point, I was struck by an intense feeling that I'm looking at a very young cat which didn't entirely mastered walking yet and I think this is a good summary of what is wrong with it. It's all just a little stiff. But I get that animating fluent movements of a cat is really hard and this is nowhere near of being a deal breaker.

What is a deal breaker then? The dialogs, or rather monologs because the main character doesn't talk. They are the main focus of the game and I cannot remember a single line that would be clever, funny or well-written. All the characters have as plain one-dimmensional personalites as you can get. Thankfully, the conversations are mercifully short.

The plot is rather basic but it could work if it was supported by good characters.
As it is right now, it main purpose seems to be to break my immersion. You are supposed to be a normal cat, right? Well yes... but you also understand human speech and you are able to perform complicated tasks and go to long missions where you're able to reason logically, keeping your goal in mind, without much instructions. So you're like human in cat's body, except no because you're supposed to be a normal cat. Actually, as a cat you're more competent than all other characters. Most of them is just sitting in one place for years, twiddling their fingers and waiting for some dumb animal to send it for a mission and giving weak excuses why they won't do it themselves, even if the task is to walk a hundred meters to get some book.

Not much to comment on gameplay. This is just walking simulator with scripted pseudo-platforming elements and puzzles that mostly require to just find the interactive elements. In a few cases, you actually have to think for three seconds.
There are also fight sequences where you have to fight/avoid enemies and glitches both. I was spoted through a wall a couple times. This are still the most/only engaging elements of the game, although, they are sometimes annoying because they depend on luck too much.

For someone who doesn't know the language of cats the game may be cute. For someone who does, it's mostly funny because the main character is speaking gibberish. The meow are varied and they are definitly sounds that a real cat would make but they are played at random and they are mostly sounds of a happy cat. It's rather silly looking when the cat falls from too big a height and in response it makes a meow of content. The funnier example is when there is this big scene of bittersweet victory and the cat does a face that can be described only as ""extremely surprised in a very silly way"".
I have much more examples but I just realised I've wasted half an hour to write a review of a game I'm rather indifferent about.",1697227990,1697227990,False,3,0,0.463157922029495239,4,True,False,False

The music is amazing, I would love to listen to the soundtrack for background music while studying or reading.

But in more seriousness:
- The controls are fluent (I've only played with a controller so far and it's even encouraged by the game).
- Graphics are delicious.
- I've grown up with cats and can confirm that a lot of true-to-cats-stuff is happening (like, when you make them wear something how they start to kind of crawl or just lay down flat on the ground).
- Haven't experienced much from the story so far but seems very intriguing (coming from a person who hasn't looked up much about Stray).
- And the game, to my pleasant surprise, runs really, really well! I honestly expected more of a rollercoaster and am generally rather cautious before I spent money (for new games), but this here is a smooth ride so far. It's rather relaxed and it appears like you can't miss a jump. By standard, you push ""a"" to jump and can only do so when the game gives you that option. The game kind of does most of the targeting in that regard for you, though not at all in a way where it would seem like it's babysitting you (not to me at least).
It's a smooth experience, lot's of interactables and things to discover, I'm impressed and don't regret a cent I've spent for this game. The developers seem to have poured A LOT of love into this work of art. Truly a gem.

Really, if you like cats, it's a no-brainer. There is even a button for meowing. I mean I've only played for roughly an hour so far (when I first wrote the review) and noticed the love that the game got in a lot of details already (walking on keyboards/piano strings, pushing stuff over the edge with the paw...). Should you own cats, you'll probably see their funny behaviour reflected in a lot of situations in this game (and that's somehow a really worthwhile experience). :D
So, if you're unsure, you are still able to return it after said hour (as long as you don't exceed a playtime of 2 hours or possession of the game for more than 2 weeks (exceptions can apply) if I'm not mistaken).
So what are you waiting for?

Playing as a cat, knocking stuff off tables for no reason, befriending cute robots? It sounds like the perfect game. But the controls are so clunky that I can't enjoy it, and the hints are so vague that sometimes I have no idea what I'm supposed to be doing.

I have to hit a button for every single jump, and considering this is partly a parkour-type game, that gets really tedious. Sometimes the game selects the wrong thing to jump on (something below instead of above, for instance), and I end up aimlessly jumping back and forth between the same objects trying to select the correct one. 

I constantly get lost -- I wish that the little robot buddy that helps me would give better hints than ""go to the building with the orange sign."" I'm there, but how exactly do I get in!? It took me waaaay too long to find the tiny window I was meant to jump through. I just played for an hour and most of that was helpless wandering around.

I often have the option to show things I've collected to the robots. I usually don't know what to show them, or what I've already shown them. 

The mice enemies (Zurks) are too fast, and sometimes I'm struggling to shake them off while also trying to figure out where on earth I'm supposed to be going. It's hard to complete an escape scene when you're too busy shaking off enemies to know where to escape to!

10/10

In all seriousness though, stray is a short fun and different type of game.
Its rather unique in that.. You wont believe this.. You can control a cat!
What is arguably even more fun is the fact that you can experience/see a lot of mannerisms of a real cat.
The story, whilst not groundbreaking is interesting and the graphics are quite pretty.
I can see a world where this game could start getting boring, but the developers took the route of keeping the game rather concise - which I think was a good decision seeing as the gameplay is relatively basic.

Overall, fun little game, wont break the bank and will satisfy your indie gaming urge.

Gameplay is extremely polished- moving around feels genuinely nimble and catlike. The story is really well put together, yet terse enough to get through in an afternoon if you're in a hurry.

- Visually it's quite good and would even say occasionally very good.
- Music is fine. Breaks the silence but nothing unbelievable.
- Gameplay is fun. Not really challenging or brainteasing, but still not a walking simulator either. I'd say that that would suit even for a bit younger audience. Only couple moments where you need to go stealthy or escapy.
- Story. Well, it was interesting. Kept me invested and not hard to follow. Though not much is explained in great details because... well, cat and language can be hard to meet up.

In the end, the game made me smile and giggle several times, as you can truly be a cat in many ways. Just some silly moments in the game if you look for them and know the common quirks of a cat.",1696449318,1696449318,True,13,0,0.655041933059692383,0,True,False,False

This game blew me away! one of the best games i have ever played and probably the most immersive experience i have ever had with any game.  I'm not a big fan of very many games would't consider myself a gamer but this game is outstanding.  I saw an advertisement for this game on you-tube and it showed how they actually used real cats with motion suits to get the quality graphics and realistic fluid motions of the cat as the main character.  I thought that was amazing and I instantly bought the game.  I rarely buy things because of advertisements but this one got me interested immediately. I am so glad I got it because it was an outstanding game with an outstanding story.  The story was beautiful as well, as the game play in this game is truly a work of art.  The game isn't very fast paced or filled with action but still has a lot of stressful moments that keep you on the edge of your seat.  I can see how this game might not be as liked by gamers who are used to extremely fast paced action but for me the slower pace was perfect.  DO NOT RUSH THIS GAME! Take your time enjoy the moment! explore and knock things over. Act like a cat scratch the rugs and knock over the pots. Getting into character truly deepens the experience of the game play.  my suggestion is to refrain from looking online when you get stuck its challenging but not impossible like a lot of other games.  If your used to games you could probably breeze through it but if you don't play puzzle games very often like me it might take some time but it is truly rewarding when you figure out what needs to be done.  The game has a good balance it is an adventure game and a relaxing game. It is a puzzle game at times and it is a bit of a horror game at others.  I feel like the game has a pretty big world and not having a map and the perspective of being small helps add to the effect.  This game is amazing and I am so blessed to have experienced it.  I want to thank the people who made this game and i hope development teems make more games like this in a similar style.  a lot of people like me have always been craving a game that fits this more relaxing and beautiful style and this game delivers.",1696205093,1696205093,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Only gripes are the [spoiler]anti-climatic yet bittersweet ending[/spoiler] and 2 of the achievements that require you to have godlike patience and/or skill to get, one requires you to [spoiler] evade said ticks without getting glomped on once when you first encounter them [/spoiler] and the other requires you to [spoiler] avoid detection by all 15(!!) sentries in factory/midtown area [/spoiler].  You make one mistake, you have to try ALL over again.  Yeah, those hidden achievements are gonna stay hidden, no thank you.

While I know this game may have a reputation of ""funny cat meme game"" that appeals to easy internet humor where cats are just naturally delighted and charming, but that spell still worked on me. I thought the idea of playing as a cute little cat was pretty funny the whole way through, and the bits of personality and control I had in this protagonist was adorable.

I thought the premise and the world was entertaining, I liked the science fiction world you are thrown into, even if I couldn't figure out all of the lore, I thought it was unique and chill enough to hook my attention. I never felt annoyed or dower exploring the areas and taking in the vistas and music. The characters were straightforward but endearing to me, and I actually really did enjoy interacting with everything I could find.

The puzzles and quests were all pretty easy for me to figure out and helped keep the game at an appropriate playtime in my opinion. If this game had been any longer I probably would have gotten annoyed with it sooner or later, and if it were any shorter I would have chided it for not feeling like a full game. Though, since it does still lean on the shorter side, maybe waiting for a sale is more beneficial.

Overall, I don't have much else to say without spoiling the whole experience, I really enjoyed playing as a cat and exploring this underground world. I recommend Stray, it felt different and I enjoyed all of my time with it.",1696006933,1696006933,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

My only complaint about the game involves the sudden, abrupt shift in narrative about half-way through the game. There's some amazing build up of the aforementioned creepy stuff but then the story just abandons that in favor of a police state dystopia narrative. In spite of that, there's plenty in this game that will tug at your heartstrings from realistic cat interactions at the beginning, endearing NPCs you want to make happy, and more.

That’s not true, and this review is my attempt to properly inform you. 

[h1]Overview[/h1]
Stray focuses on doing one thing very well: roaming a sci-fi world as an ordinary cat. It accomplishes this with flying colours. Although one or two things are partially sacrificed in pursuit of that vision, the overall experience is well-crafted and all of its parts fit together perfectly.

Two common misconceptions I’d like to debunk right here:
- While playing as a cat shapes many aspects of the game, the incredible world around you is the true point. The cat is the viewpoint you explore that world with.
- Yes, there’s a meow button. But this feature actually has a few gameplay functions on top of its cuteness factor.

[b]Playtime[/b]: 8-9 hours (I took my time and went back to get some things I missed)
[b]Specs[/b]: AMD Ryzen 2700X 8-Core processor, 16GB of RAM, NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 6GB. No overclocking. Played at 2560x1440 with a DualShock 4.
[b]Performance[/b]: Almost perfect. The controller auto-detection worked great. I experienced only one bug (make sure to collect everything you want before you proceed the story). Taking screenshots with the Steam Overlay in rapid succession would sometimes freeze the game for a few seconds. 
[b]Options[/b]: Limited, but they get the job done. Would like to see some accessibility options in a future patch. 

[h1]Warnings[/h1]
In general, please take the age rating of 10+ into account if you want to buy this for your child or play it with them. While every child is different, the rating is there for a reason. One chapter has a creepy environment. 
This is [b]not[/b] a game without a fail-state. Enemies will attempt to hurt the cat and you can get a game over from it. 
If you’re someone who can’t handle the sight of a cat getting hurt in any way, shape or form, consider checking some footage before purchasing. None of it is graphic, nor does it last long, but it’s there.
Although the cat can’t fall during gameplay, there are a small number of scripted instances where it does. 

[h1]Story & Characters[/h1]
The story is simple and won't surprise anyone, but it's well-paced and is effectively told despite the short script. There's no voice acting, but the sounds that simulate speech are pleasant and never became grating.
The last third of the game could’ve used either one extra chapter, or a longer version of existing content. As it is, it can feel a bit rushed compared to the early/midgame.
The ending is also pretty brief and purposefully leaves some things open-ended. This does fit the minimalistic style of the narrative, but it may not be to your taste. 

There are two main characters in Stray: the titular stray cat you play as, and B-12, a drone whose memories were corrupted. They aren’t standout characters on their own, but the bond that forms between them is pretty wholesome: a tale of hope set against the backdrop of a dilapidated city.
The other characters you meet also fall into that heart-warming category. Their dialogue (and the dialogue in general) is kept concise, so I never felt like I was being monologued at and never got tired of meeting new people. 

Having said that, it’s my opinion that the characters are the weakest element of Stray. The bond between the cat and B-12 is understated and elegant, but I would’ve liked a bit more interaction between them. For example, whenever B-12 gives its opinions on things, the cat can often only meow in response to certain sentences. 
I think it would’ve helped if there were a few more moments where they could show camaraderie to each other, like they sometimes do in the big cutscenes.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
Stray is a third-person adventure game that’s equal parts exploration and puzzle platformer. It has both linear levels (accomplishing a story-related objective), and hub levels (where you can freely explore and listen to NPCs). There are optional collectibles hidden in every chapter, and there’s a chapter selection feature if you’ve missed anything.

Most of your time is spent running, climbing or sometimes hiding. Gameplay is basic, but the intuitiveness and smoothness of it creates a pleasant flow. Running feels great. Climbing is done by pressing X near climbable surfaces, but you can turn these off if you want. Climbing favours the direction of your camera, so correct camera usage should prevent most unintentional jumps.  

The puzzles are simple but ask enough of you to prevent them from feeling brain-dead. Jumps can never be missed, so the challenge comes from figuring out how to proceed and where you can jump to. Occasionally, you’ll also use an item or two to proceed. While your ability kit remains unchanged for the entire game, I nevertheless felt like not a single puzzle mechanic outstayed its welcome. 

One criticism: There’s a single chapter where you’re using a tool to fight back with. This chapter is much lighter on platforming and puzzle-solving, and I found it to be less enjoyable than the rest of the game. Fortunately, it’s contained to that chapter.

You also have the option of doing several cat things. This includes sharpening your claws, drinking water, napping, etcetera. 

[h1]World & Sound[/h1]
Stray might as well be a motion picture next to the word ‘atmosphere’ in a dictionary. 

The cat is animated beautifully. Occasionally the budget shows itself as, for example, the cat turns and its tail clips through a wall, but the animations on both cat and non-cat feel very believable.

The world you explore is gorgeously-crafted and incredibly immersive. The game deftly uses colour, light and environmental guiding lines to direct you. Most notably, it avoids using artificial markers as much as possible. I consciously noticed three instances where there was something on a wall that had no reason to be there from an in-universe standpoint.

Every aspect of the gameplay feeds into the purpose of exploration. Everything is tuned just right to eliminate friction and frustration. Yes, this makes the game easier and that’s a downside for some players. But the effect is that there’s nothing in the way of your eyeballs taking in the world. 

The attention to detail is also superb; there’s a lot of environmental storytelling going on. 

Sound design is great; every sound felt natural and nothing pulled me out of the experience. 

The soundtrack is, in my humble opinion, perfect. Every track sets the stage for every scene incredibly well, and it does so without any bombast. It’s as carefully restrained as the rest of the experience, but it’s exactly what’s needed to round it out.

[h1]Ending thoughts[/h1]
I think the developers have done an excellent job with this title. It thoroughly delivers on its core objective and does its damnedest to be more than a cute walking simulator with a cat. 
Don’t get me wrong: the cat is definitely part of the charm and it defines many facets of the game. But Stray comes together so well that it oozes dedication.

And it isn't just a surface level aesthetic, like some AAA titles do, the themes the game presents fit the setting very well. The story is really well done, as are the characters. And it's all shown from the perspective of a very curious, smart, and cute little cat!

The gameplay is like a platformer meeting a simple adventure game. It's very easy to pick up and learn and fun to play. Though some achievements (if you're the type that cares) will require a few restarts.

And that's it, what are you waiting for? Get the game. It's like half the price of most AAA games and has way more value and memorable moments than any of those. AND YOU CONTROL A CAT THAT DOES CAT THINGS!",1695671178,1695737215,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Two of my favorite themes at once - cyberpunk and kittens. To be more exact, a cat is the main character of Stray. However, the game is not about the cat, although he is certainly the key figure of the whole interesting story.
From location to location we are gradually revealed the plot, which keeps us in suspense throughout the game. The adventure itself evokes a whole range of emotions - sadness, emotion, tension and laughter.
Walking on the roofs here is especially delightful. The protagonist climbs higher and higher, and we get breathtaking views of different parts of the city. An unusual city, the main inhabitants of which are robots.
The game turned out to be very ""warm"" also because the robots here are not clear and logically designed machines, but capable of feeling and experiencing emotions inherent in any person. In many of them, literally a couple of lines can reveal the character, it's cool! How our furry hero ended up here, and where all the people are, we will learn as we go through the game.
Some locations deserve to be desktop wallpapers. The atmosphere of the city abandoned by people, transferred perfectly.
The most that I liked is the music. I added every track to my playlist and sometimes listen to it.

First the good stuff - the cat is really cute.  The other cats are really cute too. The little flying bot was cute, but well, enough about that. The transmogrified robot people is a very cool idea and the environment they live in is one of the most innovative game concepts I've seen. Some of the enemies were rather disturbing, especially since as a little cat I couldn't splat them.

Now the not so good stuff. Who ever heard of a game where you can't dodge, roll or otherwise avoid danger other than running away at a not very fast speed? You can't even jump wherever and whenever you want. My cat is smart enough to figure out where he wants to jump without anyone planning it for him so I'm not sure why this cat couldn't do that as well. The keyboard/mouse play is, let's say, challenging. I played with a PC controller for part of the game like whenever the camera got locked into dead-ahead-only mode for I have no idea why.

However, I will say it was worth the price of admission since A) I like cats, B) the cat was cute and C) it had it's fun moments during the few hours of riding the rails. All in all, I would buy it again and will buy the sequel the day it goes on sale.  But I still hope they make it work better for PC players and ramp up the game play dynamics.

Do you want to play as a cat and go on an adventure where a tiny robot becomes your ally and companion? If you answered yes to all the above, then give this game a shot. 

A short story but it was fun playing the game. I spent some time getting lost in some areas as I was not sure where to find everything but in the end I enjoyed this game more than I initially thought. Playing as a cat as athletic as Lebron James but also sneaking past enemies like in Hitman was pretty satisfying.

Pros:
-Short but cute game play
-You are a cat that can jump insanely high and have the zoomies at the same time
-Visuals are atmospheric and the music is great as well
-Core game play mechanics are simple yet satisfying

Cons:
-You can die in this game (someone call PETA on these bots) but you can respawn
-Graphics: My God, I had insane lag and low FPS when I first booted this game and started playing the early levels. Looks like this game is meant for higher end PC specs to run smoothly at higher settings (sorry potato pc users)
-Story didn't seem quite as complete.... hinting at Stray 2?? (please devs make a Stray 2)

The world itself is very nicely designed and the cat animations looks really great, but its ultimately its just linear ""corridors"" and some puzzles. 

Perhaps it doesn't deserve a negative but this game certainly doesn't deserve overwhelmingly positive either, maybe a 7/10.  

I'd absolutely play a game like this with proper danger and platforming, that would be fun. I also played this in VR btw (mod), that of course makes heights look more scary and it's nice to see everything in real-life scale, but it didn't really help it gameplay-wise, it still felt too safe.

When I first embarked on my journey through the mesmerizing world of ""Stray,"" I had no inkling of the profound impact it would have on my life. Little did I know that this game would be the catalyst for a shift in my perception of life, evoking emotions that I never thought a video game could. The game's ending was a tearful culmination of an experience that has indelibly altered my perspective on existence itself.

""Stray,"" developed by BlueTwelve Studio, plunges players into a meticulously crafted dystopian cyberpunk world where you assume the role of a lost cat navigating the bleak streets of a decaying metropolis inhabited solely by robots. From the outset, the game's atmosphere envelops you, immersing you in a hauntingly beautiful, post-human landscape that serves as the backdrop for your feline adventure.

The brilliance of ""Stray"" lies in its ability to weave an emotionally resonant narrative without a single word of dialogue. Through the eyes of our furry protagonist, we witness the loneliness, isolation, and fragility of existence in a world devoid of humanity. The game's masterful storytelling unfolds gradually, and each interaction with the enigmatic robots or environmental clues deepens the sense of melancholy and wonder.

As I progressed through the game, I found myself connecting with the cat's struggle for survival and longing for connection. The sense of vulnerability that permeates every moment was a stark reminder of our shared vulnerability in the real world, and this resonated deeply within me. ""Stray"" prompted me to reflect on the beauty and fragility of life itself, a theme that became increasingly poignant as the narrative approached its climax.

However, it was the game's ending that truly moved me to tears. Without giving away any spoilers, it suffices to say that the conclusion was both heart-wrenching and uplifting. ""Stray"" managed to deliver a message of hope and connection in the face of adversity, leaving me profoundly touched and emotionally raw. It was a testament to the power of storytelling and the impact that video games can have on our lives.

In the weeks that followed my completion of ""Stray,"" I found myself pondering the game's themes and messages constantly. I began to view my own life through a different lens, appreciating the moments of connection and the beauty in everyday existence that I had previously taken for granted. ""Stray"" had opened my eyes to the importance of empathy, resilience, and the pursuit of meaning in an often tumultuous world.

In conclusion, ""Stray"" is not just a video game; it's an emotional odyssey that transcends the boundaries of the medium. Its hauntingly beautiful world, captivating narrative, and emotional depth have left an indelible mark on my soul. It reminded me that even in the darkest of times, there is light to be found, and that life's struggles are what make it all the more precious. ""Stray"" is a masterpiece that has changed my life, and I will forever carry its lessons and emotions with me.",1695172916,1695172916,True,2,0,0.54356849193572998,0,True,False,False

It started off fairly strong but quickly fell apart and it almost felt like the developers wanted to do something more with the story but didn't know how or were too scared to pull it off. 

Spoilers ahead:

[spoiler] It really annoys me how depressing and hopeless this whole game is. It's supposed to be, or at least I thought it was supposed to be about hope for the future and finding your family, yet every single person you meet, you end up abandoning for next to no reason. Hell, I figured the whole point of the game was to get back to our cat family and the devs even bungled that. This game would have been an easy recommend, despite my other problems, had the devs just had the Stray reunite with his family. It could have been so easy.

My other problem with this game is the wasted potential. Our main companion throughout the whole game turns out to be the last human who uploaded his consciousness. But as you explore the game you are told that for some unknown reason, the robots all evolved to be more human over time, I thought it would have been REALLY cool if the entire human population of the dome uploaded themselves to the robots due to scarcity of supplies or y'know the virus that was hinted to be going around or were using them as some sort of surrogates while they remained in hyper-sleep or something but because it had happened so long ago, they all forgot. The ending of the game could have been us opening the dome and also solving the puzzle of where all the people went. Honestly I feel like this was originally part of the plot with how much foreshadowing there was. [/spoiler]",1695097865,1695097865,False,4,0,0.437012076377868652,0,True,False,False

	Do you want to know how it is to be a cat in a post-apocalyptic cyberpunk world? In this game made by BlueTwelve Studio, we are a cat that got separated from our family and now needs to find a way home while trying to escape the dangers in every corner of a mysterious cyber city.
	I find the aesthetics of this game stunning, and it follows the traditional cyberpunks style. Consequently it has a lot of neon colors, raining places, and retro-futuristic tech. Additionally, the cat is cute as it should be, and there are places in the game where you can just relax and enjoy the view as a cat.
	The gameplay, where every game feels the necessity to be big, is small and well made. Moreover, everything in this game feels great to do, from walking to even just scratching random doors as a cat has a good feeling to it.
	For people that like cats and cyberpunk, I absolutely recommend this game. On the other hand, if you do not have a soul and hate cats, you should get treatment.",1695080930,1695080930,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

I'm not especially into platformers and this one is not even a very good one, generally you are using the right stick to look around and find things with an ""X"" which means you can press ""X"" to jump there. So it's more like ""find the next thing to jump to"" than, well, parkour. 

Every interaction with anything in the world has to be ""translated"" so the cat can understand it, which involves pushing the square button, waiting 3 seconds, pushing the square button again, and then finally when the last line of dialog/info is delivered you press the CIRCLE button. 

So, understand this game is going to be very, VERY simple puzzles, very easy platforming, a lot of ""square, square, square, circle"" interactions, and the occasional ""run really fast and don't let those enemies touch you"" sections.

I won't go into spoilers but this was not what I expect basically at all. It's a relatively short game, taking me about 7.5 hours. I only earned 10 of the 24 achievements but I do feel like I explored and took my time.

Visually, this is a cool game and I like the overall concepts. I did run into a bugged mission that I had to look up because characters weren't where they were supposed to be. Otherwise, there were times when it was unclear what was expected of me but nothing too serious to be frustrating or annoying.

The Story was cool. I enjoyed the characters but I want more of an epilogue.

I played on Steam Deck and highly recommend adjusting the graphics settings. My standard settings were getting 60-90 minutes of play time but after adjustments to some recommendations, I was getting at least double that time if not more.

The controls are too limited, it is too linear, and despite a very casual veneer it is a bit try-hard for no apparent reason. It isn't really a game that you ought to git gud at, but these moments of weird difficulty spike exist for very mysterious goals.

In the end, the gameplay is too poorly defined and inconsistent in tone. The writing is charming, the cat is fun when you can actually be cat like.

 As a game its not innovative, platformer and stealth with a bunch of interactive physics is all your gonna get, but the Narrative, Sound Design, and especially the details, animation included are amazing, since they went out of their way to get motion capture on cats.

 The Art Direction chosen and how lighting is utilized makes this game a sci-fi eye candy, neon lights, poverty, trash everywhere, brutalist architecture, now i am a little bias since i highly appreciate brutal city landscapes but all of those make for a memorable sight everywhere you look, the shaders/lighting is just my favorite part of the graphics, then again, Artstyle > Graphics.

The Story can be basic on the surface but if you just start scrutinizing and questioning things, you might find that this game potentially talks about a lot of things, with numerous messages able to be interpreted but i won't get into that, 

Its definitly worth its price even as a short game. Its not meant to be played, but it must be experienced and immersed into, the gameplay is challenging enough and the story and lore leave a lot of questions to be answered even after the end. This follows the kind of story you get from Journey or ABZU, though not as intensive in the mystery part of those game, Stray still answers a lot. So if you are into those kinds of games where you are told the story of a fallen civilization through an outside perspection with strong Art direction, visuals and a well written narrative then these three games are for you, Stray being the star in this review.",1694817038,1694817283,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It is a very touching story with emotions in the vein of a Pixar movie (not to the same grandeur of effect but that is the style it is chasing) that, if you let it, can open the conversation about sentience in the same way a good, deep sci fi story can.

...no matter how pretty the game looks or how fun it is to play as a cat. 

And that truly is the only thing about this game that makes it stand out over other indie games (which I truly don't think it deserves.) It's very fun to play as a cat and some of the level designs are very clever, allowing you to do certain things because you're an agile little kitty. It's good stuff. But, honestly, half way through the game I forgot that I really was a cat, because you get to communicate with the other robots using your robot buddy. Other than the novelty, being a cat doesn't mean anything in this game. 

Also, the story is thin, relying on a fairly standard post-apocalyptic sci-fi narrative and world design that kind of tricked me into thinking I was loving the game at first, because it kept reminding me of other games that I really wanted to play that had more depth and a more original story.

This game suffers from making you feel like it's going to be 3-4 times the size and scope that it actually is. I think the world design and aesthetics contribute to that. It's pretty short, around 5-6 hours and not as full as it could be. It's definitely not worth $30. 

Part of the reason that the world feels small is because you don't get to know most of the characters deeply because they only say 1-2 lines total, some NPCs say the exact same thing, so it feels kind of hollow and doesn't feel like you're in a real city. Also, since you're a cat, you don't actually speak with anyone for the whole game. You play as a cat but feel like you're basically no one and there's no way to know who this cat is. Since I didn't know who I was, I didn't have any emotional connection to the one companion you're supposed to care about. It's a one-sided relationship. 

I don't hate this game. It's a fun little romp and I love being a cat. But it's a deeply forgettable game beyond that with a weak emotional core.",1694400075,1694400075,False,1,0,0.452784508466720581,0,True,False,False

Amazing game. The ambiance and style mesh perfectly with the story and game design and playing as a cat just fits for some reason. Super creative, level design that rivals FromSoftware in its compactness and complexity, and every time you enter a new area you're sure to get blown away by the beauty and creativity.

The fact that this game is only 6-10 hours doesn't hold it back from telling a great story in an amazing format in a super creative world. Easy 8/10.

You could call it a Plattformer or Jump & Run, but since you can't miss-jump that doesnt really fit.

If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead, murdered by my brother-in-law Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, Hank came to me with a rather, shocking proposition. He asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using his connections in the drug world. Connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded, I... I always thought that Hank was a very moral man and I was... thrown, confused, but I was also particularly vulnerable at the time, something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me on a ride along, and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin so I agreed. Every day, I think back at that moment with regret. I quickly realized that I was in way over my head, and Hank had a partner, a man named Gustavo Fring, a businessman. Hank essentially sold me into servitude to this man, and when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn. Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling out. From what I can gather, Hank was always pushing for a greater share of the business, to which Fring flatly refused to give him, and things escalated. Fring was able to arrange, uh I guess I guess you call it a ""hit"" on my brother-in-law, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured, and I wound up paying his medical bills which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge, working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring, and did so. In fact, the bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen in the ranks to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA, and about that time, to keep me in line, he took my children from me. For 3 months he kept them. My wife, who up until that point, had no idea of my criminal activities, was horrified to learn what I had done, why Hank had taken our children. We were scared. I was in Hell, I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, to end this nightmare, and in response, he gave me this. I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. I... All I could think to do was to make this video in hope that the world will finally see this man, for what he really is.",1658256956,1694343387,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

What's not to like about role playing a super intelligent cat in a cyberpunk world? 

Story line is linear, but doesn't take away from the experience. Side quests include knocking random things off counters, scratching the couch, and finding nooks to nap in. While not absolutely necessary to knock over every pile of books in the room, it's absolutely necessary to knock over every pile of books in the room.

Fun and immersive.

EDIT
I WAS enjoying this game. It brought me joy. But these running dashes from the zurks were built for console, not PC. Mouse control is disabled, making it not only frustrating, but near impossible. I'm old. I have arthritis. I can't do all the finger controls on a keyboard.

It has everything what I expected from it.
+ Linear interesting story (with quite lot side missions).

+/- Open ending. There is happy end (what is probably expected). But is very open. I hope that there will be some DLC or whole new game which show to us how everything ends into details. But I don't feel robbed as some players in negative reviews.
+/- Zurks are quite easy to prevent. But if there is lot of them then there is possibility to die. And all Zurks in location are respawned. And that respawn of all Zurks is little bit annoying.
+/- Little bit short. If I didn't stuck in one location for 1.5 hour and have little strugglle with Zorks. I will finish it in 5 hours.

I think it's interesting they're going to make a TV show about this, I think it COULD work really well, but knowing Hollywood, it'll get botched.

There is no challenge here -- the puzzles are easy and the hardest part is the traversal (remembering where to go).

Boring gameplay, stupid puzzle,story boring as Fuxk, poorly designed quests(go A find B help C get D then do it over and over again),bad map design(little stuff to point directions),all it has is just an Orange pu$$y

I guess TGA now only cares about graphics and pu$$y to give this the indi game of the year.

People also only cares about this orange pu$$y so it can even win a Steam award.

Nobody cares about gameplay so they decide to give Tunic, Neon White and Sifu nothing.

Nice one people! Lets just keep making games like brown pu$$y and green pu$$y so we can win every award and turn this planet to a pu$$y planet,nice!

The story is bland and every single character is just about as 1 dimensional as it gets. I think this game fits more into the category of an 'experience' rather than an actual game, but it fails at that, as I don't feel I gained anything from the experience at all. 
The only positive I can give this game is the world design and graphics. Its a beautiful setting and one that really appeals to me in particular. However, I don't think these alone can make for a good experience with a game; there needs to be something else, be it gameplay, story, characters, etc. Without any of these I felt I lacked any motivation to continue. If you only want good graphics and atmosphere, this is for you, but don't expect the rest of the game to live up to that standard.",1680884640,1694033969,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Cute factor aside and the adorable character design and setting, this game is really special and unique. Playing from any small POV in a game can be very exciting because it is a foreign viewpoint; however, the cat being able to move around and explore small places in the city is awesome. The setting and design of the world/characters/homes/etc was phenominaly done and really pretty to look at. It felt like a well designed and pretty place to get lost in.

While the story was just okay and the difficulty was very easy, I appreciated this run through an underground world and interesting background. I would love to see more of this style, with just a bit more difficulty in puzzles.",1694015864,1694015864,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False
