This is probably my favorite Battlefield by far. From the fundamental mechanical enhancements like the infantry movement overhaul (once you climb a chest-high hurdle you can never go back to any other battlefield I'm tellin ya), to the feel and aesthetics of the game, it's a Battlefield game down to the very core.

You wanna know what Battlefield is? Queue up a Breakthrough match. Get on a real good one, and then you're on defense, and you're holding the last point, the enemy pushing hard as your entire team manages to hold on, keeping every tank back with artillery strikes, thousands falling as the medics scramble to keep them alive amidst walls of smoke, their reinforcements falling, and their tactics get more desperate, as they slowly crack an opening through your defenses, and Johan Soderqvist's epic soundtrack roars through, bringing tension and adrenaline rushing down your veins.

And then you manage. You and your comrades empty their reinforcements to none and win. Then Johan Soderqvist's ""Triumph"" plays, as you finally let go of the tension of the battle, and that sense of glory washes in like a tidal wave.

That right there? That's fucking Battlefield, man. It's the kinda feeling that gives you goosebumps when you remember it. You can't really put it into words, but those who felt it, know. This game deserved more. Much more.",1708696760,1708696760,True,2,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False

First the price tag is horribly wrong wait for a sale or if you are into giving your money away and never own anything just get gamepass; The game won't launch unless you install the ea app and if that thing decides that you don't own the game, you NEED to REDOWNLOAD THE FUCKING game and then give admin privileges to the battlefield v exe and then if you are lucky it will launch.

Now to the review:
I am a battlefield veteran since the first one and this is not thaaaat bad but the teamwork is just lost, I can't say I completely like the game as yeah it scratches the old battlefield itch a bit but feels very far from what the core game is supposed to be, it has conquest, but you will have 0 fun when you notice the extreme and absurd amount of hackers.
What do they get from downloading software and to just get kills? Nothing but to ruin everyone elses game because dice and ea do not give a damn about you.
If you are lucky to find a server without hackers you will have a good time but as soon as one comes along the servers just go empty.
Is it better than the new bs like the state of halo and cod? Yes, yes it is, but the amount of hackers is just plain ridiculous.
It does look beautiful and you can get lost in the scenery but if you expect action like BF BAD COMPANY 2, BF3 OR BF4, no, it is a very very sad no.
It has a campaign...or something that exists there but nothing memorable.
What gets on my nerves is that yeah it's from 2018 but if you go to the original people still play it and feels more solid than what Battlefield has become.
It honestly hurts to leave a good review because the game will work only when it wants to do so during your first install, then the hackers, mostly kids jerking off to their power fantasy of just feeling better than anyone else because they can see you through walls or DDoS everyone and win with 170 ping 1st place while being lvl 1.
I am biased, I love battlefield, as in I could spend 8-12 hours straight playing the game...but not this one.
The weapons feel nice but again the damage system feels weird, someone can kill you from say the other side of a bridge with an assault rifle, valid, but if you shoot that person back with an anti tank rifle in the chest and you don't kill that guy that is very veeeery fucked up.
Again weapons feel good, not excellent, just good and it does not have as many weapons as there were in WWII, I think it has to be the smallest weapon roster in any battlefield.
I myself try to play it alone instead of in a squad like in previous titles because, like I've said, teamwork is veeeery rare.
I remember I played it on xbox one first and wondered how it would feel on pc and it's just weird man.

Typical EA behavior that does not care for the customer at all 6.0/10

Get bf4 instead as people still play it or any other shooter like Squad, MCC.
For the price of this game you can get 2 or 3 even 4 better games like Dusk, Ultrakill, Turbo Overkill, Elden Ring, Hell Let Loose before it dies due to corporate issues, Armored Core, any other damn game that you really really want to feel immersed in and having fun with.

I guess I wanted to see if the cheating problem was real and yeah it is very real and they don't get anything from doing so, they just want to piss people off.

I guess it could be cool with friends...",1708584864,1708584864,True,1,0,0.525000035762786865,0,True,False,False

The attention to detail in the armaments and settings was outstanding, recalling our conflicts in the Pacific theatre. However, there were several parts that did not fit with reality. The methods used and the depiction of some historical events were oversimplified, lacking the subtlety of real fighting. Furthermore, some of the equipment and technology demonstrated appeared overdone and unrealistic.

I strongly recommend BOTH BF1 and BFV, if you're aiming to maximise your Battlefield experience. I tried BF4 but for some reason it's just not the same, presumably because on older BF games have a more experienced playerbase so things are much more difficult.

Well, here's some pros about BFV:

- The keybind system is AMAZING. This is the second game (First game being VALORANT) that actually bothered to make the keybind system FULLY FUNCTIONAL. What do I mean by that? Well, this means that if you want to bind multiple keybinds to the same key, YOU MOST LIKELY CAN. Here are some examples:

>>>Just like in VALORANT, I have my Reload and Inspect keys merged:
This just means that I have to reload before I can inspect my weapon. In most games, binds like these don't work. Good job DICE developers!

>>>I also have Sprint-Slide and Crouch Merged (without Sprint-Slide double-tap):
When you're sprinting, you can tap the crouch key ONCE for a slide, and you can hold it to go into a crouch after the slide. Admittedly, this isn't perfect, but you can still crouch-sprint with this for examle.

>>>I also have Sprint (Set to toggle), Auto-Sprint and Lean-Right merged into one key (My Left Alt):
Zero conflicts! Why? Simple. You can't lean while sprinting, and sprint/auto-sprint work very similarly, but with both bound to the same key, you can press the sprint key ONCE to start sprinting without having to hold any keys, or just use the sprint key like normal. Respectively, the lean left key you can bind anywhere to the left of your Left Alt, for example, CapsLock, LShift, CTRL, or even your Left Windows key. This is mostly up to preference and will depend on if you have any other particular keys that you like to have on one of these keys.

>>> There's the swap weapon / firing mode / zeroing distance keybind, I personally have it on my Middle Mouse Wheel Click, very convenient!

>>> By default, Jump/Vault/Parachute deploy are all merged together. This is great! 

>>> This one's probably crazy, but you can have your Interact, Enter/Exit Vehicle, Use Bandages keys all merged into one key! Pretty sure this works perfectly. On top of this, you MIGHT be able to do similar things with your Reload/Inspect key, however then a small issue will arise - if you were to merge reload with this interact key merge, you won't be able to reload inside/near vehicles, so exit/enter vehicle would have to be separate. This is where you could try binding it to your lean left key or something, THERE'S SO MANY POSSIBILITIES!

Maybe I have autism or something but the fact that you're able to essentially have Controller-level controls on a PC game is amazing to me. Presumably, all of this stuff works because of console. If so, don't be afraid to try out keybinds like STEADY SCOPE + ADS, something controller players do.

9/10 game. I can't really think of any cons outside of the occasional hackers (don't play official servers and you'll avoid them almost in entirety)

Similarly the mission script sometimes gets stuck and you then have to restart the whole mission in order for the story line to continue (e.g. happened in the Norway story when trying to progress into the ""bunker"" mission. Stood around in front of the bunker door and nothing happened since the game for some reason failed to register that I had reached the specified destination) Most annoyingly the damage detection logic sometimes stops to work, e.g. you head shot the same unit 5 times with the silenced sniper rifle (at fairly close range) and nothing happens (except for the unit starting to shoot back). You then have to walk away and come back for the glitch to recover. 

Sadly the stupidity of the game's AI is compensated by ""aim bot"" type cheating: It doesn't matter how often you circle around an AI opponent to sneak up on it. You may lie on your belly and as soon as your head peaks around the corner you get shot at (and hit) immediately. At the same time AI units are so stupid that you can snipe some unit that supposedly was in the middle of a conversation with the unit right next to it and the other unit will not show any reaction.

Developed by DICE and published by Electronic Arts, this highly anticipated title promised to deliver epic battles, stunning visuals, and innovative gameplay mechanics. As players don the uniforms of soldiers from various factions, they embark on a journey through some of the most iconic theaters of war. Let's dive deep into the trenches of Battlefield V and explore its every aspect.

Graphics and Visual Fidelity:
Visually, Battlefield V sets a new standard for the franchise. From the snowy landscapes of Norway to the sun-scorched deserts of North Africa, each environment is meticulously crafted and breathtakingly beautiful. The game's Frostbite engine truly shines, delivering stunningly realistic visuals, dynamic weather effects, and destructible environments that add a sense of chaos to every battle.

Character models are impressively detailed, with authentic uniforms, weapons, and equipment that evoke the spirit of the era. The attention to detail extends to every aspect of the game, from the intricate weapon animations to the immersive sound design that brings the battlefield to life.

Gameplay Mechanics and Immersion:
At its core, Battlefield V offers the signature large-scale warfare that the franchise is known for. Players engage in epic battles with up to 64 players, utilizing a diverse arsenal of weapons and vehicles to secure objectives and outmaneuver their opponents. The game introduces several new gameplay mechanics, such as the Fortifications system, which allows players to build defenses and fortify key positions on the battlefield.

The gunplay in Battlefield V is satisfyingly weighty and realistic, with each weapon handling differently and requiring skill and precision to master. The addition of Attrition mechanics adds a layer of strategy to gameplay, requiring players to scavenge for ammo and health supplies on the battlefield, further immersing them in the chaos of war.

The game's class system encourages teamwork and cooperation, with each class offering unique abilities and equipment that complement different playstyles. Whether you're providing support as a Medic, laying down suppressive fire as a Support, or leading the charge as an Assault, Battlefield V rewards players for working together to achieve victory.

Single-Player Campaign and War Stories:
In addition to its multiplayer mode, Battlefield V features a series of War Stories, standalone single-player missions that offer a more intimate look at the war from the perspective of different characters. While the stories themselves vary in quality, they provide a welcome change of pace from the frenetic multiplayer battles and showcase the human cost of war.

The War Stories feature impressive production values, with cinematic cutscenes, compelling storytelling, and memorable characters that tug at the heartstrings. While the campaign may be relatively short, it offers a poignant and immersive experience that adds depth to the overall narrative of the game.

Community and Support:
Since its release, Battlefield V has received regular updates and post-launch support from the developers, addressing player feedback and introducing new content and features. The game's community is active and engaged, with a dedicated player base that continues to support the game through forums, social media, and community events.

Conclusion:
Battlefield V is a triumph of immersive storytelling, stunning visuals, and exhilarating gameplay. With its epic battles, innovative mechanics, and attention to detail, it stands as a worthy addition to the Battlefield franchise. While it may not be without its flaws, the sheer scope and ambition of Battlefield V make it a must-play for fans of first-person shooters and military history alike. Whether you're storming the beaches of Normandy or duking it out in the streets of Rotterdam, Battlefield V delivers an unforgettable experience that captures the chaos and camaraderie of World War II.",1681273814,1708495788,True,2,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

**Here's the review:**

This game is basically historical reenactment with questionable fashion choices. You spend most of your time:

* **Dodging planes that fly lower than pigeons with vertigo.** Seriously, have these pilots ever heard of air traffic control?
* **Reviving your squadmates who think they're invincible because they have a katana.** News flash, katanas don't stop bullets, Karen.
* **Trying to decipher teammate chat that's a mix of 1337 speak and complaints about camping snipers.** I swear, some of these guys think they're in a ghillie suit convention.

**But hey, it's not all bad:**

* **The explosions are so realistic, I can practically smell the burnt toast.** 
* **The melee takedowns are brutal enough to make even PETA flinch.** Just don't try them in real life, unless you want to end up on a Darwin Award website.
* **The soundtrack is epic enough to make you feel like a war hero, even if you're just spending the entire match hiding in a ditch.**

**Overall:**

Battlefield V is like that crazy aunt at Thanksgiving dinner: loud, unpredictable, and occasionally throws something across the room. But you gotta admit, it's never boring.

**Would recommend?** Only if you enjoy controlled chaos, questionable history lessons, and the occasional existential crisis brought on by getting sniped by a grandma hiding behind a bush.

**P.S.** Don't forget to bring your running shoes. You'll need them to outrun all the grenades.

        [td]💾Graphics[/td]
        [td]Battlefield V is still absolutely stunning! Ranging from destroyed environments that give the scale of what WW2 was all about, to the gorgeous beaches from the Pacific Theatre. The animations are incredible. The way the weapon sways around and how your character moves across the battlefield gives a great feeling of momentum. The character models and weapon designs all look amazing. Even the vehicles can look so stunning and intimidating. I mean this game uses the Frostbite engine, so it’s really hard to make this game look bad.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]🎮Gameplay[/td]
        [td]Battlefield V is like many other Battlefield games. It’s basically the same formula with some minor tweaks to make it somewhat different. Some of the changes would be the fortifications. Being able to create sandbags, machine gun nests, reinforce destroyed buildings, and much more. This is a pretty cool feature, but does require communication to be effective. Attrition is also a new feature here. Your health will no longer regenerate to 100%. This gives medics a much bigger role in the battlefield. You can also revive your squadmates even if you are not a medic (only people in your squad). Spotting is also different. Recon class can only spot players in the game effectively. I’m not sure how I feel about this change. I guess it gives snipers a bigger role and does give some much needed support. You also have your standard Battlefield features. You have the four classes (Assault, Medic, Support, Recon). You even have tanks, light vehicles, and airplanes. Many classes have their own pro’s and con’s and each have their own important role. I’d say it’s overall pretty well balanced. I do wish that the assault class anti tank weapons were a bit stronger, but besides that it’s balanced really well. You also have customization in this game for your character, weapons, and vehicles. It’s all pretty well done and gives you a good amount of progression, especially when trying to complete assignments to unlock unique skins and weapons.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]📜Story[/td]
        [td]I actually really liked the story in this game. It’s not long by any means, but really fun to go through. War Stories are captured really well in terms of storytelling. I didn’t really care about the first one, but the other three were solid. I won’t spoil them or talk much about them since they are really short. I will say that before and after each story, the game gives you some interesting information about the war, even stuff I didn’t even know about. It’s educational, and that actually surprised me. I think that made the stories much more enjoyable. Yes it’s really short, but you can tell the Devs put some time into them and had some passion behind it.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]🎭Multiplayer[/td]
        [td]The multiplayer is pretty good. During the time of this review, the player base is still pretty high and still seeing new players coming into the game. Cheaters are a huge issue in this game and can get absolutely annoying. Being shot through walls, everyone getting killed at once, aim bot, etc. It's a shame many garbage players need to cheat, but not much you can do about it. Best bet is to join Non-Officials servers if you want that to not be an issue. Apparently Official servers are plagued with cheaters. Besides that you should have no problems with the multiplayer during the time of this review. It’s still alive and well.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]🕛Playtime[/td]
        [td]Playtime just depends on how much you enjoy this game. The story is probably around 6-8 hours to complete. You will spend most of your time in the multiplayer mode. It has an endless amount of replayability here. You have a ton of content here to mess with, for example great maps, many weapons to use, assignments to complete, etc.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]🎧Sound[/td]
        [td]Battlefield V has incredible sound design. The weapons sound impressive, hearing the airplanes pass by you is super immersive, and the overall ambiance is perfect! Battlefield always had good sound design, and this game does not disappoint! It’s immersive, intense, and really puts you into the experience.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]❗Bugs❗[/td]
        [td]I haven’t really had many bugs in the multiplayer. I had some odd AI bugs in the story mode, but nothing too serious. It’s mainly just minor bugs in the story and multiplayer, so nothing worth bringing up. [/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]🔅Performance[/td]
        [td]Performance is amazing! I’m able to play on high settings with no problems. I do play on low online just to see a little better. The shadows can really make it hard to see in this game. I’d recommend turning off Ambient Occlusion so you can see so much better![/td]

[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]🔗Conclusion[/td]
        [td]Battlefield V is a fantastic Battlefield game! I would have rated it much higher if this game didn’t have a cheater and if the game felt more complete. I wish DICE added Russia, maybe even France and Italy as a faction. The game had so much promise. It kinda feels like Battlefront 2 where it just didn’t feel complete (no Star Wars Sequel and Prequel maps). For what it is, it’s a fantastic shooter that is still kicking hard after 6 years of release. I’d wait for a sale and give this game a try, especially if you love WW2 shooters.[/td]

I'm not the only one to have these problems- there are various solutions posted online and in trying them I 
spent far too long watching the unskippable interactive intro to see if the changes I'd made had any effect, which they didn't.

I never saw the multiplayer because it constantly dropped the internet connection.

On top of this- Steam refused my application for a refund because I'd ""played it for more than two hours"".
The software was running for that long because I'd been forced to waste that amount of time trying to get it to work. I wasn't playing it!

It is similar to Battlefield 1 because there are different stories which are all set in the same war. All 4 stories/missions are well designed. The battle takes place in Sahara desert, Norwegian mountains, rural France and a large European city. I only played the game as Single Player. Some stories are much more impactful than others. 

The graphics are breathtaking even on High settings of GTX 1650. There was no crash during any of my sessions and no noticeable glitch. Frame rates were smooth, any drop in FPS was for only a few seconds and didn't impact gameplay experience. There is no dubbing of foreign language characters so sometimes I couldn't follow the subtitles when trying to kill the enemy or run away from their bullets and bombs.",1708237640,1708237640,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game itself is really good, but don’t expect the people playing it to be competitive and that kind of stuff. Sometimes, you’ll get frustrated with your teammates because they keep flocking to a single capture point or just outside a capture point.

The immersiveness is great, really great. This game is truly made to be fun and to be played as a squad/team, no lone wolf gameplay.

Making strategies to capture flags and being smarter than the enemy team feels great overall.

TL;DR

Great game, even for those who don’t like FPS like me 
Great immersiveness 
Great multiplayer experience (overall) 
Didn’t see many hackers (14.2h of gameplay)

Bad “team balancing” 
No ranked tiers 
High price (I’d only buy it when on sale)

I'm thankful that I got this during a steam sale, only paying £3.59, because the game is mostly unplayable.

Downloading the bloatware dog$hit EA games launcher - what? - just to play the game that is downloaded and installed through steam. Then, when I view my other EA games, including Battlefield 1 & 4, it tells me to download them through steam.

I've logged into the EA account, but the game still refuses to connect to online services. I'm not using any sort of proxy or VPN. Not a big deal, you might think - but progress isn't saved apparently so every time I start the game up I've got to do the intro cutscenes.. it soon gets boring.

Then when it comes to the sections I could play - the War Stories - the AI on this game is dreadful. Enemies firing into nothing, and through solid objects, meanwhile my shots don't register if they're on a static MG.. was fun for the first playthrough but becomes tedious quickly.

Graphics are what I would expect from a game 10 years ago. Oddly, seems worse in comparison to Battlefield 1.

I'll uninstall and come back to this another time - it's not worth the 120GB file size on my SDD.

The only way I would recommend this is to buy it during a 80-90% off sale - and maintain a vain hope that the game is somewhat improved.",1707919692,1707919692,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I always felt like this game got way more hate than it deserved. I didn't really start playing it until its Year 2 update, so I can't speak to it's quality before that, but it's always felt amazing to me. Smooth gunplay, polished animations, fantastic audio design and high attention to environmental detail and visual fidelity. I'm glad this game is more populated than 2042. 2042 is soulless mediocre slop, BFV will always be the superior Battlefield experience. It also has multiple single player campaigns unlike 2042. It's definitely worth picking up if on sale, which it is very often. Unfortunately, there is a cheater problem since DICE and EA have basically abandoned it to focus on 2042.

It is nothing like Battlefield 3, Battlefield 1942, Battlefield 2, Battlefield 2142, Battlefield 4, Battlefield Hardline, Battlefield 1. The introduction screen was very laggy like call of duty modern warfare 2019 and call of duty cold war even when it was installed on a pcie gen 4 ssd. I can't believe the developers never fixed the bugs and problems with this game to make it a real Battlefield game. 

This game looks like and feels like a wannabe call of duty game because of the very misplaced perk system and different class specializations and extra gun aim down sight animations and movement animations and movement speed in the game.

Every time you try to complete an Assignment in this game, it doesn't register progress unless you specifically activate it to progress in it.

The voice acting and art design is very poor in this game as well. It feels like a robot talking with no enthusiasm or anything. Battlefield 4 and Battlefield 1 also had these same issues as well. The colors of the objectives look too light with gamma levels that are very difficult to see. The weapon icons are very over-simplified. All of the dog tags are very over simplified and almost all of them look the same.

This game brought back spectating from Battlefield 4 but also removed the server favorite option and started hiding the server browser options for joining games.

This game does not allow you to take out needed items like a healing medical pouch or healing medical box any time it is needed like in Battlefield 3, Battlefield 4, Battlefield Hardline, Battlefield 1, Battlefield 2, etc. Every action and equipment is context based so you are required to look at something in particular to change equipment and take out useful items to help the team in battle.

This is not a real Battlefield game. This game is too over-simplified to cater to the call of duty players that don't know how to operate a server browser to find a multiplayer server to play.

Though ""The Last Tiger"" campaign has a pretty good story to it. It is rare to see the Wermacht soldiers to be humanized in the media. (Yet they were still too afraid to add swastikas to the game, due to modern German laws, I guess)

Now this might not seem like a big deal (or a problem at all), but DICE's servers do not have any system to kick (or vote kick) any bad actors from matches, which means that cheaters reign free in this game. Besides the usual cheats you see in FPS games (aimbots, wallhacks, etc.), cheaters can also execute a command that kills EVERYONE in the server in an instant. Despite the game having a premium price tag here on Steam, DICE seems to have zero interest on fixing or even mitigating this problem.

It's a shame because I really like this game. I actually think it's a lot better than Battlefield 1. The gameplay is just superior in every sense. Experiencing this game's gunplay, where actual skill is required and the bullets go where you aim unlike in BF1 felt like night and day. Suppression is effectively gone for good, so instead of having your accuracy obliterated, you'll only be spotted. The fortification system is also a great solution to the problem of losing cover when a building is destroyed. The reinforcements are also a genius way of incentivizing squad play. There's a lot less BS to deal with, such as fewer grenades, no gas grenades, no ridiculously overpowered battle pickups, no mortars. The game just feels more satisfying to play.

When you play BFV without a cheater in the server, it's a great experience. The problem is that this is a rare experience. For 50 dollars, this is deeply unacceptable.

Bought it on a sale for single player because i wanted smth like the very first CoD. I remember those years i really fell into the stories and epic battles, etc. 
So i started Battlefield V and immediately i felt LOST. I have no idea what am i supposed to do. As soon as i shoot, everyone jumps on me and i die. I completed a few missions being stealthy, but the stealthy stuff i dont care for. Didnt get the war-like feeling, you are always alone, always running around, poking around, trying to find the way they want you to use to complete the mission. Always out of ammo, because for some reason those people dont die when shot, you need to pump em full of led for them to die. 
For, what apparently, is a stealth game, the shooting is clumsy, bullets go all over the place, dont kill anyone even when hit, ammo ends, then you look for another weapon but what made me feel the worst is the fact that many times i dont know what am i supposed to do. Repel tanks. Ok... How? With what? Yea, there are those machine guns and stuff but i cant remember where they were, so you just run around like a headless chicken from one anti-tank gun, to anti-aircraft gun, back and forth. Idk, really felt lost all the time and probably will not play again. I like the idea of more open-world, but a bit more explamantion on a mission, or a map, or some target points would be really needed.

I am not the most experienced player or gamer, so maybe its just me, but it just seems too ""open world"" if you give such brief explanation on missions and no tactic or target points on how am i supposed to go and where.

This is not fair.

They should start banning people again OR close down the store and don't pay attention to the game anymore, like they want to.

Now it's just them benefitting while players get nothing back.

------- Review from ~2021 ----------

This game is not much more than a dying simulator.

The only great thing I are the graphics, the gameplay is closer to garbage than good. Matchmaker is also very bad. How is a new player supposed to learn the game if most enemy's are a very high level. There is absolutely no balance between players.

The weapons are not historicly accurate.

Story mode is a decent 5/10. The stories are not really special, and there should be more of them.

Too much garbage to buy with real money.",1625769648,1706731680,False,3,0,0.549488067626953125,0,True,False,False

Rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

I recently dove into the immersive world of Battlefield 5, and what an exhilarating experience it has been! From the moment I stepped onto the battlefield, I was captivated by the stunning graphics and attention to detail that truly brought World War II to life.

The game's dynamic environments and realistic sound effects create an atmosphere that keeps you on the edge of your seat. The diverse landscapes, ranging from snow-covered mountains to dense urban areas, add an extra layer of strategy to the already intense gameplay.

One of the standout features for me was the extensive customization options. The ability to personalize my soldier, weapons, and vehicles allowed me to tailor my gameplay experience to suit my style. This level of customization not only enhances immersion but also adds a sense of ownership to the overall gaming experience.

Battlefield 5's commitment to historical accuracy is commendable. The attention to detail in recreating iconic battles and weapons of World War II is both educational and entertaining. It's clear that the developers put in the effort to balance authenticity with enjoyable gameplay, resulting in an experience that feels both respectful to history and engaging for players.

Teamwork plays a crucial role in Battlefield 5, and the squad-based mechanics encourage collaboration. Whether coordinating attacks or providing support, the sense of camaraderie forged on the battlefield adds a social element that elevates the overall enjoyment of the game.

Despite the chaos of war, the controls feel intuitive, and the learning curve is manageable. The inclusion of different game modes ensures that players of all skill levels can find something that suits their preferences, whether it's the strategic Grand Operations or the fast-paced Conquest.

In conclusion, Battlefield 5 is a triumph in the first-person shooter genre. Its combination of stunning visuals, historical authenticity, and engaging gameplay make it a standout title. If you're looking for an immersive and action-packed gaming experience that pays homage to history, Battlefield 5 is the game for you.

First Chapter - The intro but has good transitions 
Second - Good story and gameplay! Very satisfying too. Although some parts are hard its still fun!
Third - ""Stealth is optional"" I basically did no stealth here. Its not that good gameplay but a fine story.
Fourth - Good story! I also love the gameplay because it reminds me of D-Day! Second best story for me.
Fifth - THE BEST, Best story, and a very good gameplay. Although the gameplay is all tank its really good! The only story that made me think about after playing it.

Multiplayer
Good multiplayer! At first I was very laggy but after a month I solved the problem.

最他妈的差劲的游戏啊。 设计瞄准系统如同shi一般。 所有在重机枪后面的敌人都没法正常瞄准，20%左右可以被正确几种，其余的80%你就眼睁睁看着你的瞄准镜对准对方开抢 然后TMD跟什么事都没发生一样. 射击头部附近的空气缺有几率击杀。 整TM的离谱他妈给离谱开门---离谱到家了",1706349925,1706349925,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Every single game on a DICE server has a hacker or 2 or more on it!!

So you go back to the forum, post about it again, and EA shut down your post and mark their spam post as the solution to your post, even though they haven't answered anything properly - They then tell you they do not allow posts about anti-cheats or cheating on teh AHQ FOrum - Really? Is that because you know you are useless at stopping it EA??

When I first tried this game in 2022, I was unimpressed by the campaign and was underwhelmed by the amount of multiplayer servers (2 at the time).

Now, in 2024, I decided to give it a try again.

Multiplayer is fun. Campaigns are fine too.
Gunplay is good, medics have been nerfed when compared to the insta-revive of BF1 medics with a balance tradeoff of being revived by squadmates.
Another generic WW2 shooter, which is fine. More servers nowadays (usually 6, almost all are full but not a long wait).
People used to complain about hackers in the game, I haven't seen any so that may be fixed or they've all moved on.

The combat still feels janky at times, but without having to deal with cheaters every game it could be a blast. Sadly I think the franchise is coming to an end with all the woke nonsense they are starting to push along with in-game censorship.
Luckily I got it for $1 from prime gaming, so don't really give a ****.

I am really not someone that throws the word cheater around the moment someome has a good k/d or is doing some strange kills. That being said, I'm not exaggerating when I say I encounter a very obvious cheater (mostly aimbot & with vehicle spawn hacks) every couple of rounds at this point. In some cases, they literally make matches unplayable by frequently killing everyone with some sort of force redeploy cheat. 

There are ways to avoid them for the most part, by joining for community servers & avoid certain gamemmodes where they seem more frequent. Still, this game become the worst game when it comes to the cheater situation.

At this point, having to deal with cheaters on a daily bases is seriously impacting the amount of fun I have in this game. And since it has become obvious that EA is not interested in dealing with it them in their ""older"" games anymore, I cannot recommend anyone pumping more money into it.

Don't f****** waste your money, maybe if its 95% off, but even then your actually paying with mental health. This is game is garbage and recent reviewers troll you into getting it. Praises of this game are misleading. if you latency is not super low, don't bother. high possibility of cheaters, seeing as you get sniped with a auto behind a mound, or tank kills you from across the map. immersion sucks, (women?), no real forward momentum cause cover sucks. rural areas and urban are ok, but no suitable cover if your trying to sneak in some rocky terrain maps, aerial vehicles are still OP, automatics are broken at a distant. sniping is no point unless you got amazing latency and crack head reflexes. stalking is pointless. no hardvore mode for realism lovers of sort.

the developers have raped lovers and fans of the franchises since BF4. #metoo at this point of the BF life. dont give them your money until they bring something back similar to the winning titles. its seriously a drain on your mental health playing such a s*** game compared to BF1 and older. IF the servers of the BF1 and BF4 are still active invest in those, but beware the developers might sabotage the franchise further. 

utter garbage, and if others say the opposite, they are most likely trolling you, or part of some monetary gain, or maybe for s**** and giggles.

Just like Battlefield 1, this game also focuses on war, and the impact of it on people. It feels like a cinematic movie, a million different things happening in just a contested point, or off in the distance on a flank fighting over a hill. This game is a step up from Battlefield 1 for sure, in every aspect.
Different stories, different perspectives and the impact of war that is portrayed from this game is just amazing. Very short campaign though, took me 6.3 hours to finish, but a good game nonetheless. The ending story was actually very depressing, realistic and outstanding.  Definitely succeeds to portray its message, so that’s a good thing.

The game looks beautiful and sounds phenomenal. I cannot express how good the sound design in this was. Everything from a sound distance, weapons sound and OST is exceptional. 
The gameplay can give you mixed feelings though:
In the story mode, I only liked 3rd one for the exposition and 4th one for the narrative. But in general, the story mode is the one to skip.
Multiplayer is why people are playing this game. You have access to all weapons/vehicles/characters etc. No need to grind them and you only need to upgrade the weapons individually. 
Maps are great both visually and structurally. There are a lot of modes but in general conquest and breakthrough are the most populated in 2024. 
At first, I wanted to give a negative review despite praising the game. The main problems are unmoderated DICE servers which you should avoid at all costs because of the hackers.

what exactly is the point of buying a steam game if they are going to force you to download another launcher + make another account just to play? super annoying, when i check it uses alot of background task even when not using, it takes longer to load into a game trying to open 2 programs, i always click remember me but it still makes me redo my details.. just a joke. good game for $4 though but we gotta quit this bs! not worth all the extra trouble for 1 single game.

Yeah, there is zero historical accuracy on this, but playing as a nazi japanese woman with a M1 Garand and a PIAT can be pretty fun. The sheer amount of different weapons and vehicles that are difficulty to see in other WW2 games allows you to turn your eye away from the game's lack of authenticity. When you get into a squad where everybody are either clones of M. Bison from Street Fighter or nazi women, things get so absurd it becomes an authenticity of it's own.

Also, singleplayer is also pretty cool, missions don`t feel railroaded like in previous games, and that they added campaigns that you can play as Germans and Senegalese Tirailleurs.

Interesting things to praise:
- They ceased with the pay to win bullsht, you start multiplayer with all weapons and attachments unlocked.
- It's pretty cool that they give away the game for almost free for the sake of keeping the servers healthy. I have no problem finding multiple full servers in very late hours of the night. Activision could learn with this (they still charging full price for CoD WW2 which is one year older than this and has 1% of the server population). This game peaked at 120k players on release, and still getting 60k players every day. This is absolutely insane, it's impressive. I have never seen in my life a game retain 50% of its player base after one year, let alone after 6 years. I feel like EA really cares about this game. 

This game gives me hope that someday EA might improve as a company.",1704430260,1704436908,True,13,3,0.634014248847961426,3,True,False,False

Battlefield 5, I decided to buy this game attracted to the WW2 gameplay, and it was worth it. The gameplay has a much more modern feel compared to other games like Hell Let Loose, which is more realistic. Battlefield 5 is a fun game to play as a squad and I like the quick spawning and instant action, compared to other games which take more than a couple minutes to get back into a fight.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.

Had matches where hackers were prevalent. this is a worldwide thing not just a US or Asia server thing because I tried both regions including EU

- I had a match with my friend where a guy was blatantly speed hacking and using aim bot to clear objectives. 

- Then also had another match where our team was holding an objective really well, and then we were all force redeployed and the enemy took the objective and kept doing this throughout the match,
this made the game unplayable, though, i think that he was mad because i was hitting clips on him from across the map. 

Regardless, this game should get bad reviews because the Anti cheat needs to be updated. I consistently play BF1 and there is little to no hackers on there, probably because they all got banned or moved on to the newer games. 

If you're reading this and you're a hacker then you seriously need to look in the mirror and get some pimple ointment, shave your neck beard off and shower for once, you're trying so hard that you have to hack a game so you can feel better about yourself which is the most pathetic thing you can do.

Firstly, it offers a unique multiplayer experience that is both challenging and rewarding. With a variety of maps and game modes to choose from, players can always find something new and exciting to explore. The game's graphics and sound design are also top-notch, immersing players in a realistic and thrilling world of war.

Another reason why Battlefield V is a great game is its attention to historical accuracy. From the weapons and vehicles used in the game to the uniforms worn by the soldiers, everything has been meticulously researched and recreated to provide players with an authentic World War II experience. This level of detail not only adds to the game's realism but also enhances the player's understanding and appreciation of history.

Finally, Battlefield V's single-player campaign is another standout feature of the game. Unlike many other first-person shooters, the campaign offers a compelling storyline that follows a group of soldiers as they fight their way through various battles and missions. The campaign is well-written, with memorable characters and plenty of action-packed set pieces that keep players engaged and invested in the story.

In conclusion, Battlefield V is a great game that offers a unique and immersive multiplayer experience, historical accuracy, and a compelling single-player campaign.

Visually, the game is a masterpiece, with meticulously crafted environments that vividly capture the brutality and beauty of the era. Historical accuracy is a highlight, showcasing lesser-known theaters of war and providing an immersive journey through the conflicts that defined the 20th century.

The gameplay is both intense and strategic, fostering teamwork and coordination in large-scale battles. The addition of the War Stories single-player mode offers a compelling narrative-driven experience, further enriching the overall package. DICE's commitment to a live service model with Tides of War ensures a continuous stream of content, keeping the game dynamic and engaging.

Despite a somewhat turbulent start marked by bugs and balancing issues, DICE's responsiveness to player feedback has been commendable. Regular updates and patches have addressed concerns, polishing the gaming experience and solidifying Battlefield V's place as a top-tier title.

The sound design deserves special mention, with immersive audio elements that enhance the authenticity of the battlefield. The orchestral score complements the on-screen action, elevating the emotional impact of each encounter.

In conclusion, Battlefield V not only meets but exceeds the expectations set by its predecessors. With its captivating visuals, historical depth, engaging gameplay, and ongoing support, it establishes itself as a definitive World War II gaming experience. Whether you're a longtime fan or a newcomer to the series, Battlefield V is a triumph that sets a new standard for the genre.",1704020220,1704020220,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Dice... where to begin. Dice created a beautiful diamond. Really epic game. Battlefield 1. Story is cool, multiplayer is cool. I can't really say anything bad, aside these cheaters. Dedicated servers would solve it, but well, nobody cares about QoL addition, right? PC will always have cheaters, right? Consoles are better anyway, right? Yeah...

However then we got Battlefield 5. At the beginning I wasn't hyped. But recently I got interested. I bought the game this month. You know, it's been a while since BF5 came out, so I was almost sure all the bugs, glitches were fixed by now. At least most of them. But I was wrong.

At very least BF1 has story placed at the end of the war, while BF5... STG-44 in 1940? Tiger in german desert campaign? Like, come on. Dice, have you ever read any history book? Or is it some marketing move of ""if we place Tiger in desert and StG-44 in 1940-1941, people will buy it, 100%""?
Then we have this Chauchat in french campaign... not like French didn't use their MAS smgs and french rifles, you can look up on wikipedia or military websites, it doesn't require paying. But, well, let's give them Chauchats and Lee Enfields. I don't deny that french soldiers didn't use these, but it would really make the campaign look better. French soldier with french weapon.

And then these bugs.
You swap to secondary weapon with mouse wheel, but since wheel is a bit overreactive, it swaps to primary immediately and it bugs out swapping, getting you stuck, you can't swap, can't shoot, until you change weapons from the ground. Why isn't it fixed, Dice? It's still in the game, even if it's in campaign. That is STILL your game.

Also shooting with sniper rifle into someone's head.
If there is a tree in like 5 cm next to enemy's head - no kill
If there's some other obstacle slightly covering soldier - no kill
And you can't even test, because if you fire, it's done, you alerted everyone!
And MGs are the worst of them all. Literally hitbox of these is like a concrete, rectangle shield covering entire soldier. No sniper rifle shot got them, I had to shoot with SMG or MG at them. I tried 20 times, in different scenarios. Yes, I've counted them. Headshot doesn't work. Shot in the chest doesn't work. Nothing. And shooting with sniper rifle is a real joy, but seems like Dice was like ""Eh, Jimmy, let's go for a drink, you can work after some party!"" and then Jimmy finished these hitboxes drunk as hell.

I don't mind the whole female part of campaign, I really like it. It's really cool, I don't care about these crying people ""bcs it's a female story, boohoo"". Grow some balls. Females in these campaigns in these games have bigger balls than most of these crybabies.
But one mission is bugged in Nordlys. After destroying two power stations, you gotta randezvous at the bridge, but then you find out your comrade is 800m away from you, so you come back only to see they are stuck on the desk. I don't know. Are Dice workers or developers underpaid or something? Should I even blame them? Maybe it's upper management that doesn't test their stuff and just blindly sends flawed games on the market. Mein Gott.

No, I will not recommend this game. It's not worth the price. Buy something else, something cooler, something actually fun. I guess I will come back to BF1. I already wasted too much time in this game.

Great game - technically absolutely impressive, very well optimized.
Very good grafics even at lowest details and runs with 70 fps on 10 year old GPU!
On newer system (Ryzen 5 5600x /1070ti) this runs on high-highest with 100+ fps

Best sound of any game ever
Shooting, animations , action feels great

BUT

Lots of cheaters, every few matches u will face one.
(no doubt about the cheats, very obvious cheating like speedhacks, shooting through terrain, KD of 50:1 and more - they r steamrolling almost every match)

The start of singleplayer is mindblowingly stupid- the constant switching of characters every minute? Are we playing a game here or watching a stupid movie?
The first mission where u can finally play freely - as the british guy sneaking up on the airfield - when u take a second primary weapon instead of the pistol, the game ignores all player inputs apart from walking - only way to resolve this is to restart from checkpoint!
This is the very first interaction of the player with the environment and right of the bat it doesnt work... SERIOUSLY? (on the second weapon from the guard it works - but when u walk back and take up ur original primary again as second primary, it bugs out again)
Its supposed to be a stealth mission - one bonus sideobjective is to reach the hangar undetected - so fine so good. SECOND side objective though is - blow up all explosive barrels - äh??? Really?
Also when a guard shoots at u it should alert the whole damn valley - surprise surprise it doesnt. U can start a major war at the airfield - the guards 300m away dont care - they r deaf. U can als run away and hide - 1 minute later no one cares anmyore...
Gameplay on rails for kids ... although this is nothing kids should play in the first place

After finishing the laughably bad (story and logic  alos on kindergarden level) and short singleplayer ""campaign"" the game FAILS to properly go back to menu - had to alt-f4

Top notch quality there EA :steamfacepalm: Said it already a few times and il say it again - im glad i bought this through steam for a few euros - i will NEVER EVER spend money on ur stupid platform EA if u do things like this!",1702198418,1703339889,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I am also a programmer. There are many people who want to play with AI (bots) for the same reasons. You already implemented good AI for BF2042 with portal mode: it would be nice to implement the same for BF1 and BF5. You can sell it as extras for these games and earn more money.

Generally, I'd recommend something I enjoyed as much as this but there's a huge caveat mentioned below.

The progression/unlock system for the Steam version is broken. You're supposed to get coins to unlock things (new gear, new vehicles, and new specializations/upgrades for both) and at the end of the match it will say that you got it, or it will pop up mid-match, but you go back to your main screen and it's not there most of the time; also, as you progress you will get these unlocks less and less due it taking longer to level up or the challenges becoming more difficult, which really delays being able to unlock and be competitive with the people who have been playing longer and already have their setups worked out. I contacted their customer support about it and they gave me the run around and never helped and credited my account with what I screenshot that I was supposed to get but never received through the automated system in the game, but they were glad to take my money and that system works perfectly if you want to buy something in-game.

EA does not care to fix the progression/unlock problem in this game, it seems. This was a problem after Battlefield was brought back to Steam and I've not tried in a year or so but I noticed I never left a review stating this.

Edit on 11DEC2023: Yep, the progression system is still broken on the Steam version. Still a fun game, it's a shame really. Thankfully, I apparently just brought the unlock bundle when I was frustrated at some point and now it's not quite as much of a pain; I can just spend the points on upgrades rather than having to spend them on gear or a vehicle unlock AND THEN upgrades for what I've unlocked.",1701317575,1702286555,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

- Not being able to send invites
- Squad invite functions literally f#cking grayed out so I can't click on it to invite my friends
- Game overwrites Nvidia Control Panel settings everytime I boot it
... And many much more exciting problems if you do want to buy this game.

""Battlefield V"", the second latest installment in the iconic Battlefield franchise, is a symphony of chaos and camaraderie that thrusts players into the tumultuous battlegrounds of World War II. Developed by DICE and published by Electronic Arts, this game stands as a testament to the series' dedication to delivering heart-pounding action, strategic depth, and an immersive historical experience.

From the moment you dive into the action, ""Battlefield V"" sweeps you off your feet with its stunning visuals and attention to detail. The environments are nothing short of breathtaking, capturing the diverse landscapes of WWII conflict zones in all their gritty glory. Whether you're dodging through the ruins of Rotterdam or sniping from the dense Norwegian forests, each location feels like a painstakingly crafted work of art.

But beyond the visual splendor lies a game-play experience that is as exhilarating as it is challenging. ""Battlefield V"" boasts a refined combat system that strikes a balance between accessibility and realism. The gun-play is crisp and satisfying, demanding both precision and adaptability. Every weapon feels unique, influencing your play-style and encouraging experimentation as you navigate through an arsenal of historically accurate firearms.

What truly sets ""Battlefield V"" apart is its commitment to teamwork. The game rewards cooperation and coordination in ways that few other titles achieve. Whether you're in a squad pushing towards an objective, calling out enemy positions, or providing vital support as a medic or engineer, the sense of interdependence is palpable. The ""Squad Reinforcements"" system adds another layer to this camaraderie, enabling squads to summon powerful assets like V-1 rockets or supply drops for a strategic edge.

Grand Operations, a hallmark of ""Battlefield V"", encapsulates the game's essence flawlessly. This multi-day mode strings together a series of connected battles, incorporating dynamic weather changes and resource management, all while narrating a gripping historical context. Each encounter feels consequential, making victory taste sweet and defeat genuinely disheartening. This mode stands as a pinnacle of game design, offering an epic narrative that unfolds through player actions.

The journey through ""Battlefield V's"" World War II is enriched by its single-player War Stories. While not exhaustive in number, these vignettes deliver emotional and thought-provoking tales that shed light on lesser-known aspects of the war. They immerse you in diverse perspectives, from the Norwegian resistance to a French colonial soldier's struggle for recognition. These stories remind us that the war was not a singular experience but a tapestry of stories waiting to be told.

However, Battlefield V is not without its minor battle scars. Some fans might miss the iconic narratives of previous Battlefield titles, and the initial content launch was lean compared to expectations. But DICE's commitment to regular updates and the introduction of the Tides of War system, providing a steady stream of new content, gradually assuaged these concerns.

Overall, ""Battlefield V"" is a triumph that melds historical authenticity with heart-pounding game-play. It captures the essence of World War II while delivering a modern gaming experience that rewards teamwork, strategy, and individual skill. Its breathtaking visuals, intense combat, and emphasis on camaraderie cement it as a worthy addition to the Battlefield legacy. Whether you're storming the beaches of Normandy, engaging in dogfights over the skies of Rotterdam, or battling in the shadow of a V-1 rocket, ""Battlefield V"" ensures that history's untold stories resonate through the chaos of war.",1693080047,1701899262,True,9,3,0.556736171245574951,0,True,False,False

The entire game is beautiful and aesthetically pleasing, but that's about it for the positives.

Apart from the very cringe and sjw trailer that tanked the game's launch, there are many other bad things about this game and very few good.

For the singleplayer, 4 war stories, all copied the formula of the last war story ''Nothing is Written'' from Battlefield 1.

''Nordlys'' being one of the prettiest but also the worst because it disrespectfully retold a real life operation to pander to a certain group of people, that don't even care about this type of game until it doesn't align with their stupid views.

Several Norwegians assisted by the british were sent to destroy the German heavy water factory and supply, they had to endure harsh conditions and were successful in the end, it was a very important operation in which they stopped the Germans from being able to produce weapons of mass destruction.

EA managed to turn this perfect opportunity for a CoD-style ''All Ghillied Up'' war story/campaign with more than 2 protagonists, into a lame disney-ahh story about a mother and daughter, single-handedly doing all of that and thwarting the Germans and their heavy water weapons.

If they wanted to include more female soldiers included in WW2 in the game, they had plenty of opportunities to do that with the Soviet front, because from what I recall they were the only ones who let women into war, as snipers.

Oh right, THE SOVIET FACTION DOESN'T EXIST IN BATTLEFIELD 5, A WW2 GAME.

The only two Axis factions are Germany and Japan, the only two Allied factions are America and Britain.
We just gonna ignore the French, the Italians and the fore-mentioned Soviets?
They literally had a campaign set in Norway and only like 2 snow maps exist in multiplayer, without any Nordic faction.
Same with the desert maps and no Italy.

Basically, the final war story ''The Last Tiger'' was the only decent story, even making me feel sorry for the driver and commander in the end.

As for the multiplayer, while it has a very bad anti-cheat system you can definitely have fun on CERTAIN maps.
Some other maps are just one side camping and destroying the other

So long as you have a tank and you are capable of having it be repaired a lot, the game will be fun, or if you just wanna mess around with friends or funny weapons such as the katana on Japanese maps.

Tanks are too easy to kill, like 2 soldiers with full anti-tank gear can destroy 1 tank and a half.
AA tanks are worthless when you're using them and are overpowered when you're in a plane.
Planes are aids and should be ashamed for existing.
Ships don't exist at all.

The downed system is stupid, annoying and repetitive.
I'd rather a button in settings that just automatically keeps me dead than let others be able to revive me from damage sustained by 2000 pounds of bombs or literal AP and HE tank shells.

Or just bring the revive system from BF1, which WASN'T aids.

The community is horrible, they can go to Hell.

The major issue with this game is the lack of campaign (really dropped the ball with that one.)

Battlefield V, at time of review, has reach player peak on Steam. It's currently the most popular WW2 shooter besides Hell Let Loose.

Campaign/War Stories are generic as usual for a Battlefield game (BF1 and BF3 being exceptions). No additional content with Year 2 or Definitive Edition.

Multiplayer isn't as amazing as previous Battlefield but at it's core is still Battlefield (Battlefield 2042 is a hero shooter, not a Battlefield game), from the weapons (still limited to WW2, a benefit and a detriment like BF1), to the maps (not bad) and the utility (elite skins make this confusing).

Definitive Edition includes all elite skins, shortcut kits, etc. so that will make getting into multiplayer way easier than before.

Recently the game was on sale for $4 and I thought it might be worth it just to mess around, but now I realize that I've completely wasted $4. 

The single player campaign was even more bluepilled than I could imagine. White male characters are either dumb or cold, and non-white characters are the ultimate victims trying their darnedest to survive white supremacy. The developers have forced players to watch cut scenes of the most cringe liberal propaganda wherein Africans are lauded as the saviors of the french war machine. Not to mention a teenage girl who single handedly kills a battalion of Germans while experiencing hypothermia. 

In the old days with battlefield 1942, the developers tried much harder to accurately portray the conditions of ww2. Men were developing the games and they thought ww2 was cool in itself. Now women are developing the games and they want to make ww2 like themselves, so they glorify it with foolishness. This is what ww2 would look like in the brain of an 11 year old girl. 

Online gameplay is okay but not as good as battlefield 1942, 2, or 2142. It's like a sad re-skin of battlefront 2

To be fair this review is 5 years removed from the official launch so many of my issue stem from that fact. Such as its almost a guarantee, as a new player to this game, any lobby you join will be filled with sweatlords who have played nothing but this game since launch and know every spawn and angle, effectively making the learning curve vertical. Good luck learning and getting used to the goofy ass weapon handling.... in 50 hours. Additionally on the weapons, why do they all feel about as effective as a spit ball? I'll consistently get 3 headshots on someone and they'll still be fully functioning, effectively making people bullet sponges. This is most apparent with the support class which has been nerfed to shit and hollowed out into obsolesence.  Wanna get it close? good luck with the spread, wanna sit back and use an LMG as it is supposed to be used? You're sniper bait, really any class can outperform you at any range. Overall the game feels like its trying to be something it's not. Trying to appeal to a larger base than it can. 

Interesting addition is a chat filter that cannot be disabled and will censor not just swear words but other random words that are no no's. Sure you can incinerate people and blow them up with mines, but don't you DARE say crap or doodoo

At least its a good looking game and the sound design, while a step down from the previous entry, is still serviceable to the immersion.

BF5 excels at that feeling of absolute chaotic warfare or a large scale, the sound design is TOP TIER, the visuals are stunning even 5 years after release this game is pure ear and eye candy, every battle is a spectacle to behold. 
The guns feel punchy and satisfying to shoot, the destruction is done so well that a picturesque town by the end of the match will be a ruined crater filled hellscape.

BF5 is very very rare EA W, (DICE carried hard) IMO it is by far the best battlefield we've gotten so far, it mixes all the best parts of BF1 and previous battlefields and puts it all into a WW2 package that is a joy to play.

The game is currently suffering from a cheater problem but its easy to avoid by just switching servers don't let that stop you from experiencing this gem.

You have your casual run, jump, crouch, and prone, but added into the mix are crouch running to stay covered in shallow trenches, rolls that you can use to break your fall from tall heights, and sliding, all of which flows incredibly well. I clocked over six hundred hours on console, and when I saw this game was on sale for only a few bucks on Steam, I couldn't resist picking it up again.
However, the biggest gripe that I have with the game that immediately became apparent as I started playing again is the TTK. It feels a lot like COD at certain points with how fast you get gunned down once your opponent aims faster than you, and I wouldn't have such a problem with it if dying wasn't such a coin toss between being very punishing or a minor inconvenience depending on your vicinity to a competent medic. Assuming you're not (which is about 60% of the time), you have to wait to bleed out, then wait in the menu, then spawn on a point that deploys you half a kilometer behind it if it's under attack. If you're on a team with tons of medics, dying is a non-issue as long as you stay together and don't get ambushed, but if there's only a few of them, you're doing that whole process over and over again. Spawn, run at objective, die by Type 2A, wait, repeat.
When you have a good team and it's a tug of war between some really decent players though, the game really shines. I've had some super fun moments doing guerilla raids on enemy objectives with the squads I've been in with everyone playing their roles and keeping each other in the fight when one would go down. I find that the best squad cohesion happens when one of us has a tank, using it as a source of cover and keeping it healed when it gets into fights with other ones. Once you work together with your squad, the game transforms from a dying and waiting simulator to an epic fight for survival. What really sucks about it though is that, despite how much emphasis there is on squad play in this game, people typically just use members of them as spawn points.
I really want to recommend this game, but with how imbalanced the systems in it are, the community's love for abusing broken weapons, and the fact that the devs just gave up on it and dropped it in the most pathetic failure of a live service I've ever seen, I can't. It's still more fun than 2042 and more active than Battlefield 1 though, so if you've got an itch for a decent World War 2 shooter, top notch environmental destruction, and some buddies to play with, go for it.

No idea how people can enjoy this.  Vehicle spam vs infantry.  Tanks dont do their jobs.  Any infantry antitank is lousy.  Sight lines are ridiculous, which is only good if you can actually make out players at a distance which you cant.  Point an click sniping even at long ranges.  Joyriding fighter pilots not actually providing air support anywhere helpful.  Typical ""newbs get pwned"" progression system.
Spotting is garbage unless youre recon.  No one marks anything anyways.
Maybe I'm in the wrong mode or with a lot of newbs.
In about 15 matches 1 was close, 2 were fun, and the rest were gigantically lopsided (usually involving vehicle spam).
There are way better shooters than this.  This just gives you big wide open maps.. so you can be sniped.  Or obliterated by roaming vehicles.  If this game gets fun at some point once Ive unlocked better sights or skills or perks or something... no way am I investing the time it takes to even be competently competitive here.

Battlefield 1942 came out long ago, the wait was finally over for veterans of the franchise who have been craving a new WW2 Battlefield game.

It had a rocky launch. 

It was the first ""Live Service"" Battlefield game to come out. It was also released back when Dice had shown their ""true"" colors as a company, and I don't mean that as a compliment. Everything from cut content, to microtransactions, woke censorship, bugs, you name it. 

Development progress was extremely slow. I'm still baffled they managed to release the Pacific Theater, which was amazing. Unfortunately, thats where development had ended for Battlefield V. 

Despite all that, graphics are good, sound design is good, features the best FPS mechanics in the series, map design is good, gameplay is good, destruction is good, and had all the bits and bobs for settings to customize.

I've read reviews that's say there are lots of hackers?
I have around 350-400 hours off steam for this game,  and have only encountered 1 or 2 since launch. You can't really run and gun very well in this game. Vets who know the maps, the tactics and the guns, can steam roll entire teams of newbies with ease. That's where I believe most of the concerns are coming from about hackers. Just get some hours under your belt, play slower, and you'll be fine.

If only Dice had continued thier work and gave us the Russian Front, I would have been satisfied as a long time fan.

Its still a banger game and is one of, if not, my favorite Battlefield game to date.",1701305172,1701309954,True,10,0,0.643882811069488525,0,True,False,False

The Gunplay felt fine, Vehicles like tanks and aircraft are fun to pilot especially with teammates and the sheer chaos they introduce into the battlefield keeps the games feeling fresh every time.

All that said the game does have issues, mainly with campers hiding out in some corner with sniper rifles shooting you dead from halfway across the map. I wish they introduced a kick mechanism like the newer CoD games to incentivize moving around and prevent camping. It gets even worse when the campers are also hacking, shooting you dead through walls from impossible angles.

I got 23.2 hours of entertainment out of the single player campaign on hard running through them one time. I did not get all the challenges associated with the campaign, so if I go back for that I'm thinking maybe 35 hours of single player.

Running on a 3.5GH i9 with a GTX 3080 

I have not played any multiplayer, so add the infinite replay ability of that if it isn't a hackers paradise (not holding my breath).
FYI - The single player is in the same theme of the BF1 campaign, different charaers in different scenarios with different goals.

Graphics - 7.5 Good - The game played smooth, but cut scenes gave me some stutter, I assume from rendering issues. Made the story less than it could have been.
Sound - 8 Very good - If you have your headphones on right enemies are right where they sound like they are.
Scenarios - 8.5 - great - The only part of single player that was a let down was the last scenario in the Tiger tank.
I was short
The most monumental moment happen outside the tank
Was kindof lazy, there was nohing there that advanced the story or wrapped up the story... it just kindof is.

Overall my rating is 8.5
Game play overall 7.75
Replayability 7
Bang for Buck - $4 - 24+ hours of fun game play  10

The developers have hit the sweet spot between chaos and strategy, turning what felt like a chaotic battlefield into a tactical masterpiece. It's like they've sprinkled magic pixie dust over the game, and now it's finally living up to its futuristic promise.

First off, kudos to the team for the visual feast that is the new maps. The vibrant landscapes and attention to detail are so captivating that I often find myself taking a moment to appreciate the view—right before being obliterated by a well-placed sniper shot, of course. The Season 6 update injected fresh life into the game, introducing exciting weapons and gadgets that make every firefight a unique experience.

While I'm loving the direction the game is heading, there are still a couple of glitches that stubbornly refuse to retire. Occasionally, I find myself glitching through a wall like a ghost trying to haunt the battlefield, and the occasional server hiccups can make me want to pull my hair out. It's like taking one step forward and half a step back, but the overall journey is still worth the occasional hiccup.

In conclusion, Battlefield 2042 has evolved from a rocky start into a game that now makes me cancel weekend plans just to dive into its immersive chaos. The Season 6 update has injected life into the veins of this title, turning it into the futuristic epic it was meant to be. There may be a few glitches in the matrix, but the sheer joy of playing overshadows these occasional bumps in the digital road.

That said, Battlefield V has one of the saddest campaigns out there.
The very first mission makes the campaign feel like it'll have big 'battlefield moments' and this never happens in play.
Campaign 1 was by far the weakest being just very weak stealth sections with a challenge that made me realize the keyboard controls for the planes is probably the worst KB+M flight controls ever made.
Campaign 2's missions dragged almost as much as Campaign 1's and makes me wonder why they decided to front load two campaigns of generic stealth segments and wide open three objective maps.
Campaign 3 was actually enjoyable and felt like an actual battlefield campaign.
Campaign 4 was the most interesting deciding to be nearly strictly in a tank with only two brief on foot section. It also had the most interesting character dynamics and moral questions raised. Had the previous three campaigns been remade to that quality it probably would have lead to a better experience.
I got it on sale for 5.86 CDN and honestly I think the campaign is just BARELY worth that price.

+ Amazing Graphic --- Speaking will be redundant, it is Battlefield, Battlefield never having a game with mediocre graphic.
+ Good hitfeel with weapons.
+ Weapon with relatively historical correct --- I didn't trolling with another WW2 FPS game, BFV did making a game with immersive WW2.
+ Good physical feedback and expression --- Many things u see can be destroyed, including the buildings, it is one of the characteristic of Battlefield series.

+Incredibly beautiful. The game looks amazing, I'm not sure I've ever seen anything like this in a shooter. I had a very strong desire to set the settings to ultra and just walk around the maps on empty servers to look at this beauty. The developers' attention to detail has always been at a high level.
+Specializations. The mechanics have been updated and the perks are now immediately available, but the game is still most effective in a squad, which is a plus as it's fun. The classes have been redesigned and are now better and more balanced.
+Minor new mechanics and reworked old mechanics. First aid kits, ammo, supply boxes, the ability to revive a squad member, and rewards for squad points are done very well and fit into the gameplay. The absence of an actual wallhack when spotting, as in BF4, is also a big plus.
+Official servers. No more sh!tty rules from stupid admins, no more permanent bans for politely telling the admins why their rules are sh!tty. It's amazing that there are no class restrictions, no nukes, no rebalancing and other idiotic things. We can just play the way we like.
=Squad. Playing in a squad with friends is just as damn fun and highly effective as playing with random people in your squad is boring and unproductive.
+/-Recon class. This has become much more useful. You can now spot enemies in an area with the Flare Gun and when hit. Why isn't this a real plus? The fact is that the Battlefield games have a recon class and no sniper class, which does not give us the opportunity to get the classic sniper experience. Killсam will always shows your position when you kill somebody and your rifle will never kill with a single shot on a body.
+/-Maps. As I said earlier, appearance is amazing. But there are few of them and many of them are unbalanced and boring.
+/-HUD settings. It's just as customizable as in BF4, but now we're finally spared from the disgusting battlelog, and we can directly join a friend without any problems. This should be in games by default so it is not a really plus and in this case DICE fixed their mistakes.
-Cheaters. The official servers have only one problem - the lack of human moderation and/or a kick voting system. The anti-cheat system does not work here at all, and a couple of years ago EA initiated the free giveaway of an unlimited number of copies of the game through Amazon. As a result, even if the cheaters is banned, they can easily buy a new account on third-party sites for a very small price, or perhaps they have already created a dozen accounts for himself during that giveaway. This is a huge problem, in about half of all matches you will encounter a cheater. If you suspect cheating, but you are not sure whether to send a report, I recommend checking the player's nickname on the bfvhackers website.
-Balance. Unfortunately, traditionally everything is very bad. Incredible high rate of fire + good control of some types of weapons (Type 2A, etc.), automatic shotguns (several oneshots per second), DMR, prone playstyle with a machine gun - huge advantages. The aircraft have been made even more powerful and you will die from them a lot, the situation is much worse than in BF4, because here they mainly attack infantry. DICE don't know what balance is and this game is no exception. The biggest cons.
-Gadget keys. At critical moments, they may simply not work literally up to a minute. This doesn't happen often, but it's very frustrating because the game simply won't let you use your first kit.
-Unlocking. Not only are newcomers forced to compete with more experienced players, but they don’t even have specializations for weapons from the start and they have to unlock them. The stupidest trend and I have no idea why all shooters have this annoying thing.
-No test range. BF4 had a great test range where you could set up settings and adjust your classes. The test range in BF5 is terrible. You can't set up classes and test them, and there aren't enough interactions to fine-tune HUD and other things.
-Community. It's disgusting here too. The developers deliberately added imbalanced weapons to retain the casual audience, but the garbage community here plays almost with such weapons only.
-Censorship. EA suppresses free speech all the time but this is truly a new level, I have never seen anything like this. Now the chat has a censor and some of your words will be replaced with ""***"". FC U EA. You are trash.
-Support. DICE and EA don't care about their products. There is no chance that any of the above will be fixed.

I must admit that this is quite an entertaining product. If you have even one person willing to share multiplayer gameplay with you, I highly recommend it. BF5 is vastly superior to BF4 in almost every way. But the fact is that both of these games have common cons that are most important to the gameplay. A good gaming experience is a consequence of playing cooperatively with friends, and not the merit of the game itself. Therefore, playing alone is very uninteresting, boring and annoying due to the imbalance.

Verdict. Objectively the game is very bad. Terrible balance and community, lots of cheaters - are the main cons that make the game unplayable. However, playing in a squad can keep you here for a while. I'd like the game to get a few patches, but since no one cares about it, I wish it dead.

The ""Not Recommended"" was given because the game doesn't deserve the 70% positive reviews it has on Steam. I think the % should be <40.

p.s. The review has been updated as I have changed my mind on some aspects of the game.

I dedicate these GIFs to EA:

the only major downside when playing multiplayer is the cheaters. you'll find them basically every other game, but what I've noticed is that sometimes there's one or two on each team so they balance themselves out lol. also, they don't always have insane cheats so it still remains fairly fun if you don't run into them. playing community games makes it easy to avoid cheaters.

𝐏𝐑𝐎𝐒:
1. Amazing graphics
2. Destructible walls and barriers
3. You can build sandbag walls, turrets and other heavy weapons as a support, barbed wire, and a few more.
4. Amazing guns
5. Good customizations for the guns
6. Great variety of vehicles for the Japanese, American, British, and German sides
7. Destruction is very rarely randomized by AI. Most of what you see is made by a player and looks randomized. The only randomized destruction you'll see it outside of the battlefield which you barely notice.
8. Easter eggs!
9. Revival mechanics that allow you to ask for help or skip the revive. Unlike Battlefield 1, you aren't just a limp corpse, you actually have an animation and can look around with your hand outstretched while asking for help. You also have different lines depending on whether you are fighting for the Germans, British, American, or Japanese.

+Incredibly beautiful. The game looks amazing, I'm not sure I've ever seen anything like this in a shooter. I had a very strong desire to set the settings to ultra and just walk around the maps on empty servers to look at this beauty. The developers' attention to detail has always been at a high level.
+Specializations. The mechanics have been updated and the perks are now immediately available, but the game is still most effective in a squad, which is a plus as it's fun. The classes have been redesigned and are now better and more balanced.
+Minor new mechanics and reworked old mechanics. First aid kits, ammo, supply boxes, the ability to revive a squad member, and rewards for squad points are done very well and fit into the gameplay. The absence of an actual wallhack when spotting, as in BF4, is also a big plus.
+Official servers. No more sh!tty rules from stupid admins, no more permanent bans for politely telling the admins why their rules are sh!tty. It's amazing that there are no class restrictions, no nukes, no rebalancing and other idiotic things. We can just play the way we like.
=Squad. Playing in a squad with friends is just as damn fun and highly effective as playing with random people in your squad is boring and unproductive.
+/-Recon class. This has become much more useful. You can now spot enemies in an area with the Flare Gun and when hit. Why isn't this a real plus? The fact is that the Battlefield games have a recon class and no sniper class, which does not give us the opportunity to get the classic sniper experience. Killсam will always shows your position when you kill somebody and your rifle will never kill with a single shot on a body.
+/-Maps. As I said earlier, appearance is amazing. But there are few of them and many of them are unbalanced and boring.
+/-HUD settings. It's just as customizable as in BF4, but now we're finally spared from the disgusting battlelog, and we can directly join a friend without any problems. This should be in games by default so it is not a really plus and in this case DICE fixed their mistakes.
-Cheaters. The official servers have only one problem - the lack of human moderation and/or a kick voting system. The anti-cheat system does not work here at all, and a couple of years ago EA initiated the free giveaway of an unlimited number of copies of the game through Amazon. As a result, even if the cheaters is banned, they can easily buy a new account on third-party sites for a very small price, or perhaps they have already created a dozen accounts for himself during that giveaway. This is a huge problem, in about half of all matches you will encounter a cheater. If you suspect cheating, but you are not sure whether to send a report, I recommend checking the player's nickname on the bfvhackers website.
-Balance. Unfortunately, traditionally everything is very bad. Incredible high rate of fire + good control of some types of weapons (Type 2A, etc.), automatic shotguns (several oneshots per second), DMR, prone playstyle with a machine gun - huge advantages. The aircraft have been made even more powerful and you will die from them a lot, the situation is much worse than in BF4, because here they mainly attack infantry. DICE don't know what balance is and this game is no exception. The biggest cons.
-Gadget keys. At critical moments, they may simply not work literally up to a minute. This doesn't happen often, but it's very frustrating because the game simply won't let you use your first kit.
-Unlocking. Not only are newcomers forced to compete with more experienced players, but they don’t even have specializations for weapons from the start and they have to unlock them. The stupidest trend and I have no idea why all shooters have this annoying thing.
-No test range. BF4 had a great test range where you could set up settings and adjust your classes. The test range in BF5 is terrible. You can't set up classes and test them, and there aren't enough interactions to fine-tune HUD and other things.
-Community. It's disgusting here too. The developers deliberately added imbalanced weapons to retain the casual audience, but the garbage community here plays almost with such weapons only.
-Censorship. EA suppresses free speech all the time but this is truly a new level, I have never seen anything like this. Now the chat has a censor and some of your words will be replaced with ""***"". FC U EA. You are trash.
-Support. DICE and EA don't care about their products. There is no chance that any of the above will be fixed.

I must admit that this is quite an entertaining product. If you have even one person willing to share multiplayer gameplay with you, I highly recommend it. BF5 is vastly superior to BF4 in almost every way. But the fact is that both of these games have common cons that are most important to the gameplay. A good gaming experience is a consequence of playing cooperatively with friends, and not the merit of the game itself. Therefore, playing alone is very uninteresting, boring and annoying due to the imbalance.

Verdict. Objectively the game is very bad. Terrible balance and community, lots of cheaters - are the main cons that make the game unplayable. However, playing in a squad can keep you here for a while. I'd like the game to get a few patches, but since no one cares about it, I wish it dead.

The ""Not Recommended"" was given because the game doesn't deserve the 70% positive reviews it has on Steam. I think the % should be <40.",1700233864,1700233864,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

From the detailed landscapes to the intense, adrenaline-pumping action, this game captivates from the moment you start playing.

One of the most impressive aspects of Battlefield™ V is its attention to detail. The graphics are stunning, bringing to life the battlegrounds of World War II with an incredible level of realism. Whether you're navigating through dense forests, storming through war-torn cities, or engaging in epic battles across vast landscapes, the visual fidelity is nothing short of breathtaking.

The gameplay itself is where Battlefield™ V truly shines. The combination of infantry combat, vehicular warfare, and destructible environments creates an incredibly dynamic and immersive experience. Every match feels different, offering a variety of strategic options and approaches to achieve victory. Whether you prefer the fast-paced chaos of close-quarter combat or the tactical maneuvering required for long-range engagements, there's something for every type of player.

The attention to historical accuracy is commendable, with authentic weaponry, vehicles, and environments that truly transport players back to the era. The game also introduces new gameplay mechanics, such as fortifications and attrition, which add depth and realism to the overall experience.

Moreover, the game's multiplayer mode is where Battlefield™ V truly excels. The large-scale battles with up to 64 players create an intense and exhilarating atmosphere that keeps you on the edge of your seat. The teamwork and coordination required to secure objectives and emerge victorious foster a sense of camaraderie among players, making each victory feel earned and rewarding.

The post-launch support and updates for Battlefield™ V have been impressive, continuously introducing new content, maps, and modes, keeping the gameplay fresh and exciting for veterans and newcomers alike.

In conclusion, Battlefield™ V is a masterpiece that successfully combines stunning visuals, engaging gameplay, historical authenticity, and a thriving community. It's a must-play for any fan of first-person shooters or anyone looking for an immersive gaming experience that delivers on all fronts.",1674487789,1699979272,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

If anything, I think this games tale is unfortunate. It had some neat innovation regarding gameplay, like Squad-leader reinforcements and that infamous V-1, movement mechanics that not many people know about, like pressing crouch before hitting the ground when falling a moderate distance to do a combat roll to nullify fall damage, the fact that if you string sniper headshots, your characters starts counting past the third kill, the interesting weapon upgrade tree and tons more, yet it still was mostly a fart in the wind.

The bar was already high in the wake of BF1 with this game, and due to terrible marketing among other blatant factors, they shit the bed since that infamous day the horrid trailer released.
People on twitter can twist it any way they like, the 'diversity' inclusion of women in ALL factions is more insulting to the role of women during the Second World war then totally leaving them out.

They could have had women during a 1945 Germany as Volksturm or the multiple woman battalions the Red Army had, even maybe be creative with a Resistance faction (and not just the French).
Speaking of which, the fact they cut out the Red Army in development when they ceased game support, (Evident by the fact that they once accidentally had an experimental soviet machine gun in the shooting range, the LAD, 2 years ago) was the biggest missed opportunity ever. Especially because the dedicated '''''''''''DEVELOPMENT''''''''''' time for BF2042 was practically for nothing.

How fun would it have been to run around with a PPsh-41 in this game? Blast people with a T-34? Play with a Panther on the Wehrmacht on a map like Kursk? Have one of the Squad-leader reinforcements be a Nebelwerfer/Katyusha strike? Have the Special tank for the soviets be a KV-2? Dogfight Bf109s with Yak-9s? Have the Red Army scream their iconic war cry when they advance as attackers during Breakthrough? A Battle of Stalingrad? Moscow? An Operation with these? Maybe even lesser known fronts like the Lapland Pocket or the Siege of Königsberg? Even the Battle of Berlin with King Tigers and IS-2s? It could have been the greatest shit ever!

Instead we got a launch with stupid politics, a director that said a line of utter meme worthy proportions, who got himself fired within two months of launch, a hacker problem of mythical scale with bugger all offical regulation, the LATE inclusion of community servers and the IDIOTIC decision to make them free, inclusion of Women in the Wehrmacht, the US Army, the Royal Army as well as the the Imperial Japanese Army, that is historically inaccurate and during a time when gamers were getting sick of identity-politics and a later Battlefield game that only recently got player-numbers back because they put the game down to 10 bucks. 

Let this be a cautionary tale and hope for better things. Thanks for coming to my TET talk.

Finished the match and exited the game and uninstalled. Absolute shame.

The Singleplayer  is short   it took me   about 5.5 h to finish  all the 4 singleplayer missions   I must say they are all very cool and a lot of fun with great cutscenes and not to much  repetitive gameplay

But the main part of this game is the multiplayer  and here the game just dissapoint me 
The multiplayer is fun at first but it has just too many problems 

Starting with cheaters there are too many  in almost every game   i haven,t played a lot but in my about 13 h of multiplayer * at the time i write this* i have already seen  a lot of speed hacker and aimbotter   and the best is that YOU CAN,T REPORT PEOPLE

There are no fair matches since there is no skill ranking system at all  so  it's like veterans vs newcomers that on team completely destroys the other team because there are always that 1-2 guys who have like 100kills/2deaths and the other  teams top 3 players with like 10/30 kills/death 

And mostly annoying is that you always get randomly killed trough walls , houses , rocks , barricades , or you just get killed trough the ground from below it feels like there is no cover at all bullets go trough everything  game ignores all logic  example im behind a solid House and get killed by an smg from a guy on the other side of the house  trough the house * no windows where there * This just happend non stop in every game non stop and its so annoying

Servers are also not good Package loss  is standard while having  20-40 pings sometimes you also just get randomly redeployed or kicked out of the game because  EA servers  are a.s.s   

Could have been a great game but EA they don,t care about the problems

Good But to short single player
Good graphics,effects,sounds,maps 

Cheaters in most matches

The multiplayer is 90% cheaters, as EA Games doesn't have an effective cheat-prevention module.  Channels on YouTube highlight cheaters who can show all enemies on their screen, alter the movement/speed of their own character to supernatural levels, shoot through walls and buildings, and even kick people off the servers to reduce the opposing team to half or quarter capacity, thus ensuring their win.  I've recorded some ""spectator"" mode footage myself, and noted that players flying planes were bots: they had 0 bombs on their planes, and yet still were able to drop 8 - 12 bombs per pass.  I've also recorded gameplay of the cheaters' health being replenished from 10% back to full 100% in 3 seconds, unlimited ammunition, and some type of script they run on their server connection that enhances the lethality of shots to the point that they don't even need to be firing close to you in order to kill you.  Additionally, on their mini map, the cheaters have MW3-style full UAV mode, seeing where you are at all times on the map.

This is really unfortunate, that a wonderfully-made game has such a short shelf-life.  This game answers my prayers for a war game with great aesthetics & interplay; is not suffocated by activity and ""paranormal"" attributes given to soldiers, such as the COD/Modern Warfare dynasty -- except for one thing: the ""teleportation"" element of Snipers' radios allowing any players to enter at that point.  I'm so over the ""supernatural"" realm entering into otherwise ""realistic"" games.  Battlefield has a very clever & realistic attention to sound (utilizing echo and reverb), realistic object spacing & realistic timing, but the movement -- the distance a character can cover at running speed -- is a little stretched.  The story lines that are intriguing.  I played the solo missions in Norway as my first experience; the lush environment and character freewill was hypnotizing.

It ain't no run and gun game, so if you're looking for that kind of BF game, check out BF1 and BF2042.

Battlefield 5 plays fairly more tactical and you're going to use covers a lot. Unlike games that take an aracade-ish approach, in BF5, a .22 caliber to the head from half a mile sends you back to the deployment screen.

Although, Team Deathmatch takes a different approach and encourages aggressive playstyles, as well as Firestorm (Battle Royale) which unfortunately is dead and almost impossible to find a lobby in. You're likely to wait 20 minutes to find a solo game and the lobby still wouldn't be full. That's a shame cause Firestorm is really fun. 

The campaign is probably one of the best I've ever played and it's immersion could mark my words. Instead of playing mission after mission as most campaigns force you to, in BF5, the missions are an open world battleground in which you decide in what order you should get your tasks done. The storyline itself also is one of the best out there.

Last but not least, there are no pay to win bundles. I was surprised to see that an EA game isn't based on microtransactions.

The game is fun and worth buying even in 2023.

Battlefield 5 is an exciting game full of dynamics and epic battles. The graphics in the game are incredibly realistic, the world is recreated with stunning detail, and every detail is worked out to perfection.

One of the most impressive features of Battlefield 5 is the scale of the battles. You can fight on huge maps, including destructible surrounding objects, which gives the game the feeling of a real war. Battles unfold in various theatres of war, such as Europe, Asia and Africa, allowing players to immerse themselves in a diverse history.

A huge selection of weapons and equipment also adds variety to the game. You can choose between different classes, each with unique skills and capabilities. Various types of weapons are available, from rifles and pistols to tanks and aeroplanes. The availability of different modes of transport allows players to choose the appropriate tactics and strategy in battle.

The multiplayer component in Battlefield 5 also leaves a pleasant impression. It offers various modes and maps where players can fight with other players around the world. The progression system and various achievements give the game durability and increase motivation to continue the game.

However, some players may find some issues in the gameplay balance. Some weapons and classes may seem too strong or weak in comparison with others, which may cause some dissatisfaction among experienced players. Also, some players note some technical problems and errors in the game, although the developers are actively working to fix these problems.

In general, Battlefield 5 is an exciting and serious game that allows you to plunge into the atmosphere of war and fight epic battles. Despite some problems, the game has great potential and is sure to please fans of the series and fans of shooters in general.",1698571902,1698571902,True,2,0,0.5,0,True,False,False

I would say half (feels like more than half though) of community servers that I've tried are allowing cheaters. As for the cheating, I've seen plenty of people speed hacking. I think thats the more common (and obvious to spot) cheat. I found 2 players in a match which were suspiciously consistent and fast at hitting shots. One of them was using a sniper and was headshotting people instantly. The other was using a machine gun and was also killing me before I had the chance to even spot him after peeking out of cover. Both of them had an irregularly high score compared to most other players. Both of them were also hitting me behind walls/through terrain every once in a while. 

I bought the game on sale for 12 bucks, and I would say its not worth any more than that in its current state. Absolutely do not recommend spending full price on this.

One of the most impressive features of Battlefield 5 is the scale of the battles. You can fight on huge maps, including destructible surrounding objects, which gives the game the feeling of a real war. Battles unfold in various theaters of war, such as Europe, Asia and Africa, allowing players to immerse themselves in a diverse history.

A huge selection of weapons and equipment also adds variety to the game. You can choose between different classes, each with unique skills and capabilities. Various types of weapons are available, from rifles and pistols to tanks and airplanes. The availability of different modes of transport allows players to choose the appropriate tactics and strategy in battle.

The multiplayer component in Battlefield 5 also leaves a pleasant impression. It offers various modes and maps where players can fight with other players around the world. The progression system and various achievements give the game durability and increase motivation to continue the game.

However, some players may find some issues in the gameplay balance. Some weapons and classes may seem too strong or weak in comparison with others, which may cause some dissatisfaction among experienced players. Also, some players note some technical problems and errors in the game, although the developers are actively working to fix these problems.

In general, Battlefield 5 is an exciting and serious game that allows you to plunge into the atmosphere of war and fight epic battles. Despite some problems, the game has great potential and is sure to please fans of the series and fans of shooters in general.",1697995172,1697995172,True,1,1,0.518518567085266113,0,True,False,False

Battlefield V, in many aspects, is far-and-away an improvement over it's predecessor, Battlefield 1. Movement, gun-play, and the overall game-play loop sees greatly appreciated changes and updates, that give players more freedom and options in the Battlefield sandbox. Additions like crouch-running offers flexibility in a player's tactical toolkit, and the Fortifications system allow individual squads and players to better contribute to the entire team's success, and provides more ability and incentive to defend objectives. The Reinforcements system further promotes team-play and cohesiveness within squads, by giving squad leaders strong rewards for setting and completing orders, and allowing them to turn the tide of an engagement. There are an innumerable other changes I could mention; in essence, Battlefield V is utterly, an unequivocal technical and game-play improvement over Battlefield 1. For that reason I recommend BFV to people to have played and enjoyed Battlefield 1; though for all the improvements of BFV, in it's current state it is somewhat buggy, and has a serious issue with blatant cheaters in many servers.",1697938174,1697938174,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

With all respect to the Ladies, when You see (or hear) women soldiers on all WWII battlefields, You know the game was made in Sweden. Sorry to other none-woke Swedish developers :) but same bs is fed to Gamers in new Wolfenstein releases. 
There is this old comedy about future World taken over by women, quote: ""Copernicus was a woman too!"". Dice is really going this way with a straight face. 

I`m sure women and man like to watch man`s soccer and You don`t have to change Player`s sex, so it fits some political agenda, doesn`t ""hurt"" fragile ego`s or pump extra income. It`s offensive to intelligent viewers. Don`t pretend to tell real war stories when You sell Your Vision of history.
Instead of ""forcing"" women characters on battlefields of WWII or WWI and pretend, tell real stories of women which, I`m sure, are as interesting as man`s - it would be much smarter and respectful to everyone.

The game is beautiful but pretentious and woke like hell.

By far the biggest issue though is the number of cheaters. Out of every 10 games you will run into cheaters at least twice. The worst part is these guys are blatant and it takes days for them to get banned. They will get mass reported for aimbotting you 200 meters away in a tank turret or speed hacking straight to you and killing you 10 seconds after spawning and then will follow you into the next game for about 2 hours.

They are pretty brief but absolutely amazing. The immersive and destructible environments are praiseworthy!

DICE has once again managed to deliver an immersive World War II experience that takes gamers on a thrilling journey through some of the most iconic battles in history.

The graphics in Battlefield V are nothing short of spectacular. The attention to detail in the game's environments, weapons, and character models is awe-inspiring. Every battlefield feels alive and filled with an impressive level of destruction, adding to the realism of the game. The Frostbite engine truly shines in this iteration.

The gameplay in Battlefield V maintains the series' signature large-scale battles and destructible environments. Whether you're assaulting a fortified enemy position or defending it, the game offers a variety of maps and modes that cater to different playstyles. The addition of Grand Operations is a highlight, providing epic multi-day battles with unique objectives.

One of the major changes in Battlefield V is the removal of the traditional class system, replaced by the more flexible ""Combat Roles."" While this change might not sit well with everyone, it adds a layer of adaptability to the gameplay, allowing players to customize their loadout and role more freely.

The sound design in Battlefield V is extraordinary. The roar of tanks, the ping of bullets, and the screams of soldiers all contribute to an immersive experience. It's clear that DICE has spared no effort in making the auditory elements as authentic as possible.

However, it's worth noting that Battlefield V had its share of issues, particularly at launch, such as balance problems and missing content. But DICE actively listened to the community and provided numerous updates and patches to address these concerns. As a result, the game has evolved and improved significantly since its release.

The single-player War Stories are engaging, providing a fresh perspective on World War II through various short campaigns. They may not be as memorable as some other single-player titles, but they offer a nice change of pace from the multiplayer action.

In summary, Battlefield V is an outstanding addition to the Battlefield series, offering breathtaking visuals, intense gameplay, and a compelling take on World War II. It's a must-play for fans of the franchise and anyone looking for an immersive and action-packed multiplayer shooter. Despite its rocky start, DICE's ongoing support and improvements have made it a worthy contender in the genre.

With the addition of the Pacific Theater and other content updates, Battlefield V has only become more captivating over time. Whether you're a seasoned veteran or a newcomer to the series, this game is well worth your time and attention.",1693148216,1697391465,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

People with access to the games source code have been non stop cheating in the game since 2020, to the point of which one person could join the server and within minutes the server will barren and empty, if there was even a minute amount of anti-cheat to save this game it would be one of the best battlefield games period. The campaign is great its way of story telling is similar to that of BF1 where you follow characters in their theaters of war, all of them have great stories and writing but the whole time the campaign is teaching you how to play. The multiplayer is great, metas are not rock solid and can be beat by other guns, it just requires a little getting use to the pros and cons of every weapon,  the gunplay feels smooth and fun, armored vehicles fit this perfect balance of being killable but requiring braincells and teamwork to do so, planes are a bit dumb, if they are equipped with rockets they can hit the AA guns outside the AA's range, but nothing a fleigerfaust cant fix. Customization in this game is something that started the entire controversy of this game, with the paraplegics and people with bionic prosthesis, but after their fixes its actually really good, and you dont even need to spend money to get better ones too, this game was a bit before the heavy micro-transaction era and so most of the big cosmetic upgrade packs can be earned in game with company coins. 

Overall this game is pretty great, but it feels neglected for no good reason.

--- End Update
Normal matchmaking doesn't work on public servers thanks to cheaters en mass, so the first recommendation you will get, if you google this problem, is to go to community servers => search for servers with [ROBOT] in their name.

However, most of those don't really use anti cheat protection, you will commonly find people will 100 kills to 4 deaths or something of the sort. 

The server where you have that protection are still a solid gaming experience, however, according to the data they show you can still expect at least 1% of players to be cheaters - Just are reminder, those 1% of people playing are found out cheaters on community servers with extra protection, so you can imagine the amount of unreported or not found cases. And way, way more on the official server without any protection at all.

Since community servers are run by private persons, you can be banned for no reason at all at any time from that server. And some of them have, weirdly enough, strong ""Anti-China talk not allowed"" rules.

thats if you get a game without a cheater. if you do there is no question about it. ive had a few games where my bullets litteraly would hit someone they cock thier head back you get the blood animation and them continue to shoot at you. this is while im using a sniper. but didnt get a hit marker. either that or the lag gets to it and goes right through. but this is a base game issue that has to do more with how it handles lag. with 64 players in a lobby sometimes things happen and whatever no big deal. but when its like that the entire game it feels like youve been given a nerf gun in a gun fight against 8 people with real 240 bravos. when you get a cheater it makes that worse. everything from instant respawn. (they get ragdolled by a tank, then after thier body lands thier up again and still shooting. saw someone do this 6 times in a row) to people basically just having god mode/speed hacks, infinate ammo spamming snipers at 500rpm like an lmg its dumb. 

all that and there is an increasing likelyhood that you log on and thier is no games active. (nobody else in the world is playing) ive logged in to find this a few times lately. at one point the servers were dedicated based on region alone. now if your country shares a native language with another they lump those sometimes as much as 4 regions togeather and thats the coomon servers for that area. that and private games really are all ive seen active. you may get lucky durring the weekend and get to play a few actually decent games. but aside from that the game isnt worth it. its been long abandoned by ea, to include banning cheaters. i spent 7 dollars on this game and honestly it was fun while it lasted but it frustrates me how good this game could have still been let alone could be, if only ea stepped in and actually did thier part. i wouldnt spend 30-60 on this game in the current state its in. especially considering its not likely to change",1696637055,1696637055,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

okay, this is definitely the worst Battlefield ever. :'3
DICE, stop trying to copycat other FPS games.

1 - gun play is WW2 with Nerf Guns, because literally every gun in this game, every shot bullets drops like Nerf Darts.

2 - if you want decent weapons, you need coins to upgrade them, and you get too few of those coins per day. (yes, per day, plus, upgrades are stupidly expensive.)

3 - AA guns are too overpowered and their reach is pretty stupid like, almost all across the map.

4 - maps, there are only two category.
really tight places, or, absurdly large land of nothing. in addition, everything is blocks your projectiles.

5 - classes; 
assault - weak.
medic - took all the good guns.
support - can't shoot machine guns decently because bipod is dysfunctional.
scout / sniper - assault, but with Nerf Guns with longer range.

______________________

about this game, it is simultaneously good and bad.
BFV just doesn't feel like a Battlefield for me. it is so confusing that DICE wanted to make this game realistic(?), but it is and is not at same time. 

______________________

update: summarising... this game is just a Battlefield inspired FPS.
it is not an Battlefield game.

after playing BF4, BF1 and the latest BF2042, BFV always felt weird for me...
in suspicion, I compared their differences and realised that BFV is really different from all Battlefield series.

the most critical problems in this game:

- the perspective, the gun model.
I saw some complains about the visibility of this game, and, personally, I agree that this game's visibility is really bad. here is why:
・it is because they use a perspective called ""1-point perspective"", which is... everything that goes to the centre of the screen will become distant and smaller.
・the rendering of the character models, for some reason, becomes the same colour of brightness of ambient shadows. making literally everything ""invisible"", in full-camouflage because of the rendering.
・the gun perspective, in major Battlefield and other FPS games, the gun's muzzle (the tip), normally is ""distant"" by perspective. but, in BFV, it is more like a ""side-view"" of the gun, which makes the feeling that the gun is HUGE. 
・changing FOV will not help with the visibility.
・Nvidia game filters is an option to help you about the visibility issues. (helps just a bit.)

- the gunplay.
・bullet drop mechanics / physics are too exaggerated, all guns is this BFV is Nerf Guns. the bullets are just Nerf darts.
・the gun models are too big.
/ every gun in this game feels like the stationary machine gun / heavy machine gun from BF1. 
・the sighs are too big. 
/ you cannot change the magnifications like older Battlefields.
/ you have only 4 options of sighs in total. 

- leveling system.
・it is bad.
/ it takes too long to level up. 
/ some guns and vehicles with higher level, of course, will have their specialisations active, and that makes them really broken. it is unnecessary to make a leveling system that only makes the game unfair. 
/ because of this problem above, it is hard to level up everything in this game.

- some features.
/ AA guns hit reach is broken. it doesn't even make sense. they should have been like the AA guns of BF1.
/ AT guns are too weak.
/ high level vehicles are too unbalanced and unfair.
/ planes can reach the opponent's plane deploy base with no penalty.

best points of the game:

- the physics detail.
examples are, when you walk through a flower field, they will fall toward, explosives in the water will make the liquid emerge,  flags wave ""more-realistically"".

- the character models.
they are just beautiful and well detailed. you can choose their visuals and customise their outfits.

- the ""specialisation"" system.
you can unlock an ""equipment"" (perk) for your character that gives you advantages in game rounds.
such as, increase of suppression, it will mess your opponent's aim.
well, in BFV, it is already unlocked from the start!

- the ground.
they just fixed the buggy ground, the characters and vehicles doesn't stuck in nowhere anymore. (sometimes, rarely, they does tho. but, it is rare.)

- crafting mechanics.
it is the greatest feature to be added in this game, you can create a cover when it is necessary, great for big maps with no cover. (but, DICE did not added this feature to some places that should be added...)

______________________

neutral points of the game:

- the leveling up system.
well, it is a interesting decision of DICE about forcing the players to use the weapons.
the thing is, if you want customise those weapons, you need to level up each weapon to the level 4.
・the good point is, you can try a several different weapons.
・the bad thing is, to unlock the weapon's specialisations, you need to level up each weapon to the level 4 + to unlock the weapon specialisations, you need to pay in-game coins to unlock.

______________________

not good points of the game:

- the weapons, the shooting, the reload system. (disclaimer, the animation itself is great!) 

・about the weapons, the shooting. 
well, it may because they made it to be more realistic, more ""physics"", so, the projectiles just falls more ""realistically"".
but, seeing the projectiles falling, it just feels like you are using with airsofts in WWII.
for me, it felt like every single weapon in this game became a sniper rifle. 
・about the reload.
the reload cancels for no reason sometimes. 

- the immersibility of the voice acting. 

・for some reason, they removed the announcer and changed to a high patent military personnel that speaks English regardless of the nationality of soldier which you are playing with. 
it just felt weird and less-immersive. 
・when you got hit, and need a revive, the voice is out of sync. honestly, it is less realistic than BF1, which you can feel their agony and fear in each voice in various situations.
BFV agonising voices are more... ""soft""? 

- the enemy spotting / danger ping + ambient / model rendering, ambient lightning and colour palettes.  

・unlike the other Battlefields, you cannot spot and highlight enemies.
synced to this above, in meanings of colour, BFV is very, very bright. 
・the anti-aliasing is too strong at the point the soldiers become invisible. (regardless if they are moving or not.)
not even in Argonne Forest (BF1), soldiers were invisible like in BFV.

- some maps.

・some maps feels TOO BIG, or too small. 
a bit lifeless / ""plastic"" looking? 
some of them, just a big field with just colours and no cover.
some of them, just tight buildings. 

- vehicles

totally imbalanced when you are new to the game and you try to dogfight against an opponent with more play time. 
you cannot customise when all vehicles are all taken.
(they have way better specialisations.)

- the microtransaction system, the store. (and, probably this aspect is totally EA's fault.)

・well, this one in particular is the worst.
you can be a Japanese soldier while you are supposed to be The US Army's side, 
you can be an American soldier while you are supposed to be German Army's side, and also and obviously... 
you can use a German soldier while you are supposed to be The US Army's side... 
they should have locked specific skins to specific nationalities to keep the ""realism"", DICE wanted to reach.",1682734489,1695455999,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

[b]Worth a Buy?[/b]
No, if you're solely interested in playing singleplayer or you value historical accuracy. Yes, if you prefer multiplayer because there are still a lot of players playing it, but be aware that you will run into cheaters and that is why I don't recommend it. Additionally, the price is excessive, thereby purchasing during a sale is recommended. 

[b]The Good:[/b]
- Missions can be replayed.
- War stories can be played at any order.
- Skippable cutscenes.
- An Axis focused war story.
- War stories are in their native languages.
- HUD can be customised.
- The audio is outstanding and realistic.
- The soundtrack is excellent.
- Good destruction and levolution.
- Graphics and visuals are great
- Tutorial sandbox map.
- Gunplay feels good.
- Good stable performance.
- Fun multiplayer.
- Improved movement such as leaning and crouch sprinting.

[b]The Bad:[/b]
- EA app launcher is required.
- You can't pause cutscenes
- Many unneeded stealth sections.
- The campaign's stealth mechanics don't actually function well.
- Historical revisionism.
- Censorship of historical symbols and the chat filter.
- The campaign AI is very buggy and awful.
- Campaign can be buggy.
- The campaign has very bad writing and gameplay design.
- Cosmetic microtransactions.
- High Price tag.
- 90GB install size.
- Anti-Cheat is useless.
- Many Cheaters.
- Some gamemodes are inactive.
- Community servers have less features.
- Loading times can sometimes feel a bit too long.
- Very CPU intensive.

[b]The Neutral & Informational:[/b]
- Multiplayer is prioritised above single-player.
- A 100% achievement completion rate requires completion of multiplayer achievements.
- Some of the changes to the standard battlefield gameplay could be considered good or bad.
- Historical accuracy is god awful.
- Arcade shooter with a little bit of realism.
- Maps can be big or small.
- Accessibility options for colourblind users.
- Multiple protagonists.
- Multiple campaigns.
- 5–7 hour campaign.
- There's hardly much blood or gore.
- Player customisation.
- All weapon and equipment are unlocked.
- CO-OP missions.
- Doesn't really feel like a WW2 game.

[b]Performance:
Windows 11, 165hz 1080p Monitor, GPU: 8GB RTX 3060Ti, CPU: Intel i7-12700F, 16GB DDR4 3200MHz RAM, SSD [/b]
- Didn't experience any crashes or freezing.
- Stable performance at the highest settings.
- Very CPU intensive.

[b]Bugs & Glitches:[/b]
- Softlocked twice when using binoculars, unable to change weapons or complete any campaign objectives. During the Norway War Story, I had to restart to a checkpoint twice because the game softlocked and I couldn't continue the story. One of these was brought on the mother getting stuck on a desk. https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3030257441

[b]Difficulty:[/b]
- 4/5 rating. This was a significant step up in difficulty from earlier games when played in hardcore mode. At times, especially during the unplayable stealth sections which conclude in a gun and spray, it can feel unfair. You'll spend a lot of time prone after getting shot, waiting for your health to replenish. I also tried the hard setting, and it felt about the same as previous game's hard setting. Ammo is once again plentiful, and health recovery is still quick.

[b]Additional Information:[/b]
[b]- Historical Accuracy:[/b] It's horrible, really bad. In war stories, it also includes some offensive historical revisionism. No consideration is given to the distribution of weapons because occasionally you may find late-war weapons in an early-war situation. Censorship of historical emblems and flags undermines immersion and logic. Includes non-historical female soldiers in multiplayer. 

[b]- Campaign Stealth:[/b] Same stealth in Battlefield 1, basically. They didn't even make it better. In a battlefield game, stealth portions are completely unnecessary, but level designers adore them. The AI detection is flawed because I frequently saw instances of them finding me, such as on hardcore when they were able to see me through walls and such. Additionally, you can engage in a shootout with AI, and enemies who are merely nearby won't even react.

[b]- The Campaign:[/b] It was a horrendously awful experience that felt unnecessary. contains a lot of stealth sections as well. Only ""The Last Tiger"" is the story. I advise you to play considering it was  good. I'll now give a brief overview of my campaign experience.

[b]War Story 1: 3/10, D tier.[/b] A rather boring story: 1 man army situations; The dialogue is poor and artificial; The other two SBS members vanish and are not present; Using homemade explosives; A random plane appears and knows where you are; When you are unarmed, a German driving a jeep approaches you and points an mp40 at you; When the screen goes black, the German is in the trunk; Because an evacuation point was never planned for, you must rely on a German radio to request one. German in the trunk remains uninjured despite the vehicle being shot through multiple times; Despite not knowing where you are, a rescue team manages to save you at the ideal time.

[b]War Story 2: 2/10, E++ tier.[/b] Revisionist history the mission, such an offensive retelling of the actual operation; Had two softlocks as well; Skiing was enjoyable; 1 women army moments; The majority of the mission is stealth, and you can shoot searchlights but not regular lights; An 18-year-old girl can outmatch males of military age; Instead of shooting you, a German suddenly spawns and charges towards you; Mother teleports over to the bridge; You avoided harm despite being flung from a bridge and falling down a mountain; You plunge down a cliff into a lake in subfreezing weather; You live, and there is no damage to the documents; In a lake, a submarine; Stupid bunker ambush; In a shootout near the submarine, two Germans sneak up on you. Mother flees with a grenade, and the guy shoots her in the stomach rather than killing her. He then doesn't finish her off, and she then blows up the submarine.

[b]War Story 3: 4/10, D++ tier.[/b] A missed opportunity of a good story due to historical revisionism and inaccurate portrayals of the Tirailleur; Although there are big battles in the story stealth is still present; In one scene, you and your companions are defeated and killed, and you are knocked out. When you finally awaken, everything is fine.

[b]War Story 4: 7/10, B tier.[/b] The best story, though, suffers from being too short. Wish the campaign was run this way the entire time. The writing was decent but again suffers from being too short. Unfortunately, this mission contains a lot of censored imagery, notably the German flag. With little to no stealth, the mission is primarily carried out in a Tiger tank. Although it seems implausible that a single tank can easily wipe out a whole army. Even so, it was enjoyable. Also, the level destruction was excellent because to your use of the tank's weapon. The only good war story.",1694442688,1694442688,False,25,1,0.716916084289550781,0,True,False,False

The game crashes frequently. Cheaters are absolutely rampant, and the servers are mostly dead. You might find one or two games with low enough ping, and then they'll be filled with cheaters or squads of veteran players rolling through win after win. Save your money, Battlefield V is over. 

This game could be great, but cheaters ruin it consistently. There's apparently no anti-cheat system whatsoever because you'll have multiple games in a row where the same guy goes 150-0, headshotting everyone with an aimbot. If EA would actually try to prevent cheating and fix some of the annoying issues that still exist (getting stuck in place as if there's a wall in front of you), this game would be as good as Battlefield 1 was in its heyday. 

Another issue you'll run into frequently is lack of balancing. In Battlefield 1, teams would autobalance so you'd have a chance of winning. In Battlefield V, you'll lose multiple games in a row if the enemy team is particularly good. Now that there's few active servers,  this becomes very irritating.

Edit: It seems to be getting worse. Cheaters will openly brag about it in the in-game chat, and about how easy it is to just make a new account for free when they get banned. Not sure why DICE abandoned this game because its better than 2042.

Edit a few weeks later: Cheating is getting even worse and more blatant. I don't know why I keep playing, honestly, except that when you finally get a game without cheaters, it's SO good. Tied with BF1 in my opinion. Its insane that DICE abandoned it so quickly.

So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join.

Ingredients
For the crust
85g butter, plus extra for tin
140g digestive biscuits, made into fine crumbs (add 2 extra biscuits if you like a thicker base)
1 tbsp sugar, granulated or golden caster
For the cheesecake filling
900g Philadelphia cheese, or other full-fat soft cheese
250g golden caster sugar
3 tbsp plain flour
1 ½ tsp vanilla extract
finely grated zest of 1 lemon (about 2 tsp)
1 ½ tsp lemon juice
3 large eggs, plus 1 yolk
284ml carton soured cream
For the soured cream topping
142ml carton soured cream
1 tbsp golden caster sugar
2 tsp lemon juice
Method

STEP 1
Position an oven shelf in the middle of the oven. Heat the oven to 180C/ 160C fan/ gas 4.

STEP 2
Line the base of a 23cm springform cake tin by putting a square piece of parchment paper or foil on top of the tin base and then clipping the side on so the paper or foil is trapped and any excess sticks out of the bottom.

STEP 3
For the crust, melt 85g butter in a medium pan. Stir in 140g digestive biscuit crumbs and 1 tbsp golden caster or granulated sugar so the mixture is evenly moistened.

STEP 4
Press the mixture into the bottom of the pan and bake for 10 minutes. Cool on a wire rack while preparing the filling.

STEP 5
For the filling, increase the oven temperature to fan 220C/ 200C fan/ gas 7. In a table top mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat 900g full-fat soft cheese at medium-low speed until creamy, about 2 minutes.

STEP 6
With the mixer on low, gradually add 250g golden caster sugar, then 3 tbsp plain flour and a pinch of salt, scraping down the sides of the bowl and the paddle twice.

STEP 7
Swap the paddle attachment for the whisk. Continue by adding 1½ tsp vanilla extract, 2 tsp lemon zest and 1½ tsp lemon juice. Whisk in 3 large eggs and 1 yolk, one at a time, scraping the bowl and whisk at least twice.

STEP 8
Stir a 284ml carton of soured cream until smooth, then measure 200ml (just over ¾ of the carton). Continue on low speed as you add the measured soured cream (reserve the rest). Whisk to blend, but don't over-beat. The batter should be smooth, light and somewhat airy.

STEP 9
Brush the sides of the springform tin with melted butter and put on a baking sheet. Pour in the filling - if there are any lumps, sink them using a knife - the top should be as smooth as possible. Bake for 10 minutes.

STEP 10
Reduce oven temperature to 110C/ 90C fan/ gas ¼ and bake for 45 minutes more. If you gently shake the tin, the filling should have a slight wobble.

STEP 11
Turn off the oven and open the oven door for a cheesecake that's creamy in the centre, or leave it closed if you prefer a drier texture. Let cool in the oven for 2 hours. The cheesecake may get a slight crack on top as it cools.

STEP 12
Combine the reserved soured cream with a 142ml carton soured cream, 1 tbsp golden caster sugar and 2 tsp lemon juice for the topping. Spread over the cheesecake right to the edges. Cover loosely with foil and refrigerate for at least 8 hours or overnight.

STEP 13
Run a round-bladed knife around the sides of the tin to loosen any stuck edges. Unlock the side, slide the cheesecake off the bottom of the tin onto a plate, then slide the parchment paper out from underneath.

RECIPE TIPS
MIXING THE INGREDIENTS
The way you blend the ingredients is crucial: under-beating can lead to a lumpy mixture, over-beating can whip in too much air. This can result in uneven cooking, bubbles, and cracking.

KEEP EVERYTHING AT ROOM TEMPERATURE
Keep everything at room temperature.

To avoid lumps and ensure even mixing without over-beating, it is essential to have the soft cheese at room temperature before starting. Ideally, let it come to room temperature in its pack for 2 hours. If you're short of time, cut the soft cheese into chunks and leave to soften for 1 hour. It also helps to have a tabletop mixer with a powerful motor. But if you don't have one, a hand-held mixer works fine.

Even if you shoot first you WILL die because all the piggas that play this game either have aimbot or just dont have a life. You get killed by a weapon, but when you try it it is trash, and that leads me to another shitty part of this game, the weapon levels.
 When you level up a weapon you can upgrade it and make it better. Instead of unlocking new weapons you start with all and upgrade them. That makes it 1000 times harder for a person dumb enough to be new at this game (meaning that they bought it). 
When you level up a weapon you get cosmetics for it too. The same goes for player models, when you equip a cosmetis (with camo) and just lay it is basically impossible to spot you. So many times you just die of nothing. Of course Ea wanted maore money, so there is really OP cosmetics you can BUY that turns you into a literal bush.

I've been absent from the battlefield series since 2011 so here's a fresh look at Battlefield V:

[b] Campaign: [/b]
 While the campaign offers fresh and otherwise unknown perspectives of WWII, the singleplayer experience lacks depth. It's basically 5 ""episodes"" with a different protagonist in each one taking place in various fronts of WWII. It feels more like a tutorial rather than an actual story mode and if I'm not mistaken, BF 1 also had the same format. It can be fun for a while but the cinematic cutscenes and the stealth playstyle the campaign promotes most of the time ruins the fun imo and makes it feel like a knock-off Far Cry. FAR different approach in comparison with older story driven BF titles!

[b] Multiplayer: [/b]

The multiplayer is actually very fun, which makes me believe that BF5 development was multiplayer-centered. Fun weapons,balanced progression, great character and weapon customization, classic BF mechanics. The only issue someone will definitely encounter are the hackers, 4 out of 5 games have hackers on both teams, using speedhacks, aimbot and ruining the experience [u] but the solution is rather simple, [/u] don't play on DICE servers, play on community games and just like that *poof* hackers are gone.",1692370023,1692370023,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Graphics - 7/10
Gun Play - 8/10
Atmosphere - 7/10
Optimization - 9.5/10

This game is good if you're looking for a casual sandbox FPS that doesn't require you to sweat to have fun. The immersion is on point, the gun play is polished, the graphics are good, exactly the attributes you would want in an immersive FPS that you can actually enjoy. It doesn't quite have the atmosphere that Battlefield 1 does, as it's more, ""bright"" themed; lacking a gritty, war based atmosphere that makes battlefield, well, battlefield. Despite this unfortunate aspect, it still beats Battlefield 2042 in immersion and overall experience, which isn't really saying much, but at least its something. Movement feels a little clunky, especially when sliding and jumping, this provides a slower pace than most modern shooters. Due to Battlefields way of forcing clients to use anti-aliasing - which is an issue in numerous titles of the franchise - the graphics are a little more blurry on edges than i would prefer: this makes it hard to spot enemies in the distance. This game is very well optimized, especially if you compare it to Battlefield 2042. If you have an RTX GPU and would like to take advantage of DLSS, Battlefield V has the option, but they force you to turn on ray-tracing to use it, which is ludicrously stupid. Battlefield V has done a pretty decent job at fixing their bugs and glitches for the most part. I would say that the most annoying bug/glitch in Battlefield games are the rag doll physics after your character dies, feeling very unrealistic and sometimes glitching through the map, however Battlefield V is not the only entry in the franchise to fall victim to this specific issue.

My biggest con with this game is that the player base is dying, and it is sometimes hard to find a populated server in which to play on, as most of the player base are finally transitioning to battlefield 2042 after updates to the game. Because of this issue, I wouldn't recommend purchasing the game at full price at all, instead, waiting for a considerable sale is the best, ""bang for your buck"".",1692175991,1692175991,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

-shutdown the server.
-blur the chat.
-shoot through a walls.
-end the game anytime with defeat for the second team.
-see through smoke etc.

Ingredients:
1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:
1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes.

Rating: ★★★★☆

Battlefield V, released in 2018, brings players back to the tumultuous era of World War II, offering a visceral and immersive depiction of the conflict on both the grand scale and the personal level. With its detailed environments, strategic gameplay, and commitment to historical accuracy, the game delivers a captivating war experience that honors its roots while introducing new elements to the franchise.

The game's graphical prowess is immediately evident, with stunningly detailed maps that capture the devastation and chaos of the war. From the snow-covered landscapes of Norway to the urban battlegrounds of Rotterdam, each location feels authentically designed and meticulously crafted, immersing players in the gritty atmosphere of the conflict.

The single-player War Stories provide a series of poignant and diverse narratives that shed light on lesser-known aspects of World War II. These stories focus on individual soldiers and civilians, showcasing the personal sacrifices and challenges they faced during the war. While the narratives are engaging, some players may find them relatively short and yearn for more in-depth storytelling.

Multiplayer remains the heart of Battlefield V, offering large-scale battles and strategic gameplay that the series is known for. The ""Attrition"" system, where players have limited ammo and health, encourages teamwork and careful resource management. This shift adds depth to the gameplay, fostering a greater reliance on squad cooperation and strategic decision-making.

The ""Fortifications"" mechanic is a noteworthy addition, allowing players to construct defensive structures and fortify positions. This mechanic adds a layer of strategy and creativity to the gameplay, as players can adapt their surroundings to suit their playstyle and team objectives.

The class-based system returns with tweaks, offering distinct roles that contribute to the team's success. The addition of the ""Grand Operations"" mode, spanning multiple days and matches, provides an epic and evolving battle experience that showcases the ebb and flow of a war campaign.

Battlefield V's live service model ensures a consistent stream of content updates, introducing new maps, weapons, vehicles, and modes over time. This approach keeps the experience fresh and engaging, encouraging players to return for new challenges and experiences.

The game's commitment to historical accuracy is commendable, aiming to depict the weaponry, vehicles, and uniforms of the era authentically. However, some players may still find occasional historical inaccuracies or creative liberties taken for gameplay balance.

On the downside, the game faced criticism at launch for its initial lack of content and technical issues. While these concerns have been addressed through post-launch updates, they did impact the game's reputation during its early days.

In conclusion, Battlefield V offers an immersive and authentic World War II experience that successfully captures the intensity and scale of the conflict. With its stunning visuals, strategic gameplay, and commitment to historical accuracy, the game stands as a strong entry in the Battlefield series that will appeal to fans of both the franchise and historical shooters.

If you're a fan of realistic and tactical multiplayer shooters or have an interest in the historical events of World War II, Battlefield V is worth exploring as it provides a gripping and visceral depiction of the era's chaos and heroism.",1691440149,1691441084,True,0,1,0,1,True,False,False

Battlefield 5 started already good: The feministic move to add females on the front line was unacceptable. But that's not even what bothers me anymore, I unfortunately learned to live with it. No, what really bothers me are the cheaters in this game, using cheat engines, to enhance their chance on survival, and capabilities. Each match you enter, there will be someone in the chat say there is a cheater, and yep, a couple of seconds, after jumping in the field, you indeed get this confirmed. This is awful, and it makes me mad. 

There is absolutely nothing what we can do about it either, since the report system is not connected to an active staff that can deal with these reports, or because the anti-cheat is simply turned off. Because of these cheaters, the game became unplayable. You know when there is a cheater! With out a cheater, you will die, sure, but you will have kills. But as soon as there is a cheater, your ""skill"" is gone, and you will die, each time you spawn in, with out being able to kill someone. because you're pinned down always. 

I can imagine the game with out cheaters, and it is a fantastic game, minus the feminist flavor in it. IF I could sue Dice, or even those that creates these cheat engine I would've. There should be also a law that prevents cheating: Those that cheat must pay a high financial sum of money out of their own pocket, and even a year of prison. 

Many people on the internet however are rejecting that idea, and even dare to ask which punishment would be right, blablabla. These are probably the cheaters talking! I hate the game cheater, not the game. And I blame Dice, even though they don't see it that way. I feel powerless, and that fuels my anger. It is so unfair, and it is very rampant and obnoxious. I demand the developers to turn on anti cheat, I DEMAND it. I am a loyal BF-player, and I and all my mates playing this with out cheats, deserve such change!! It's the only thing we want, 

I personally don't care anymore that the females are there, you can overlook it. But cheaters are a big no no, and you MUST change that. YOU MUST! We haven't destroyed the game, you did, by allowing cheaters to thrive. With out that BS I would totally give you 3 points! But you are 0.5 points now. 

This game feels like a psychological attack on the gamer it self. The people that make these games are our enemies. They enforce things with out our consent, add and delete things we never asked for, and pushes an agenda we don't care for, and allow the biggest moral crime you can do to a player in game, using no cheats. the cheater, dominates the map, and bring them players in derision: allowing cheaters, was the foulest  thing you've done, after insulting our intelligence with this feminist move to add females at the front line. These females are an Stolen Valor issue, these females never ever seen combat on these battlefields, in these uniforms!

[b] Overall [/b] : 7/10

BFV is all of what you expect from a battlefield game. 4 classes. Huge maps. Combined arms (air, land) and superb graphics. Yet, I still feel that this game is a stepdown from BF1, in pretty much all aspects. The Gunplay feels cluncky, the graphics show more of low res textures and the map designs are questionable. A nice addition if you find it on sales.

[b] Gameplay [/b] : 7/10

Very classic, nothing fancy here. The nice addition is the fact that as a Squad commander, you earn some requisition points that you can turn into perks, like artillery strike.
My biggest grip is with the gunplay, that somewhat feels cluncky. And the weapon balancing is just horrible in this game.

[b] Graphics [/b]: 7/10

Overall, some very nice scenery, especially in HDR. However, texture wise, the game seems to use some low res texture, and there is quite a bit of clipping as well.

[b] Story [/b] : 5/10

For the campaign, the game reiterate its concept introduced in BF1, with different war stories. They are short but nicely done. But really not memorable.

[b] Achievements [/b] : 7/10

For the hunters out there, this game is rather pleasant to 100%. Most of the trophies actually require you to play well the game. 1 (or 2) will be particularly challenging (the death from above one), but it just requires you to master the air game (and a bit of luck).",1686846057,1691011022,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

You've probably heard it before that that this game has a massive cheater problem, but outside of that, Battlefield V has fallen victim to the usual fate that most games of more than four years old face. The only people that are left playing are one of three types of people:

1: Sweats who play BF games for K/D instead of team play and don't play the objective
2: Tank mains who sit in one spot (usually in their spawn) the entire game and get close, if not, over 100 kills and no deaths
3: Hackers who use aimbot, ESP, literal unreleased weapons found in the game files and every other cheat known to man

It's worth mentioning that, contrary to popular belief, Battlefield V [i]does[/i] have an anti-cheat, but it is ridiculously slow. Someone can go weeks, sometimes months hacking and not get noticed by the AC. Even then, they'll just buy another $6 copy of the game and use it on another account. Funnily enough, Battlefield 2042 uses Easy Anti Cheat and I'm yet to encounter a single hacker in that game.

I will also say that, much like its predecessor, Battlefield V has always had a bit of a ""meta"" problem. In Battlefield 4 and 2042, you can use pretty much any gun and still be able to stand your own against the competition. But in Battlefield V? If you're not using the STG44 as an assault, Type 2A as a medic, KE7 as support, or ZH-29 as a scout, you're not going to stand much of a chance. The HMGs (MG-42, Browning 1919, etc.) are a joke in this game because they're the only guns that overheat, have long reload times due to being belt-fed, and the worst part: Can only be hip-fired when not prone/mounted with a bipod. A pretty funny contrast to Battlefield 1 where you could full sprint and ADS with a Browning M1917— which weighs over 100 pounds. I feel like this alone is probably the biggest problem that Battlefield V has at its core that just never got ""fixed"" or ironed out.

I feel like the player/vehicle balancing is pretty well-done, too. It's just that the way people play tanks in this game (as previously mentioned) makes them often unbearable. The tanks/planes themselves aren't unbalanced in the slightest (unlike other Battlefields) and it's very fun to play from both sides.

A lot of the maps are good, but some of them are abysmally horrible. Panzerstorm is a vehicle main's paradise (as you can probably tell from the name). It's a flat, open field with hardly any cover between objectives. It's like a taste of what the 2042 maps would be like in the near future. Two of the Pacific maps are some of the worst maps I've seen in the whole franchise. I'm of the belief that, when it comes to map design, Battlefield (and most first-person shooters, for that matter) is at its best when they're in an urban setting— because let me tell you. The urban maps in this game are oh-so good. Rotterdam, Provence, Operation Underground, Arras, Devastation, and Marita are all incredibly designed, balanced, fun to play on maps.

The gunplay and movement is, in my opinion, the best that the franchise has seen yet. It's jarring playing 2042 and then playing this because this game feels so much much more fluid compared to the latest installment. Crouch running, very satisfying vaulting/mantling, breaking your fall, sliding, proning on your back, everything feels great.

But the game just really isn't what it used to be. I haven't lost my touch, I just want to be able to do different things in the game like try a different gun or play slightly different from how I always play— but if you're not playing the exact same way that everyone else is (sweating your ass off and using meta guns/gadgets), you're up the creek.

The cheater problem is just the massive shit on the cake.

Official servers that are marked with [DICE] are likely going to be riddled with cheaters. These servers have outdated anti-cheat, and this is how cheaters are able to thrive in these matches.

Go to community servers, and join a high pop one. It will most likely have anti-cheat (because it has high pop) but if you want to be extra sure, servers tagged with [BFV ROBOT] in their title means they have the BFV ROBOT custom anticheat (which is very effective, ive spent 60+ hours on their servers and not encountered a single cheater)

If cheaters are the deal breaker for you here, community servers are the way.

!! And yes, progression is allowed on community servers so don't worry about that, though some server hosts may have it disabled.",1690242539,1690242539,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

However, the large and open maps make it challenging to play with vehicles as they can be easily targeted and destroyed. 

If you prefer playing as a casual infantry soldier, you'll find it difficult to eliminate enemies with 250+ HP, especially with inferior guns. 

Spotting enemies can also be problematic due to complex terrain and fortifications. Transmitting information to teammates can be challenging as well, particularly without a weapon with a good scope.

I've heard numerous allegations about cheaters in Battlefield V, and it's quite ""strange"" to face opponents with scoreboards like 176/1 or 115/3 and consider them completely legitimate.

The campaign was somewhat okay, but it lacks the quality that previous BF games' campaigns had.

Contrary to popular belief, this game dont have lesbian nazi unlike cod vanguard. 
 -Dont expect historical accuracy, the campaign is political pandering. But who tf play battlefield for campaign?
 -It had a pacific theater, something battlefield haven't make in 13 years. It is a mediocre game but you definitely gonna have fun charging (((amerika))) tank with lunge mine. 
 -It dont have the immersion and wow aspect of bf1 but the gunplay is 10x better, weapons actually had a recoil pattern, you can slide, crouch sprint....etc
 -If you want to avoid cheater then play on community server(usually named bfv robot), it's not rocket science
 -Get it on sales, for 5 bucks definitely more than worth it. Also the version on steam is the definitive edition so u dont need to grind for 1000 hours like bf4 lol.
 -Dice honestly fix your franchise, fcking bfv and bf1 had more player than bf 2042. As of July 2023, BF5 is the most played battlefield game on steam.

OH BOI i was wrong list of reasons why

-enemy visibility is god awful an enemy can easily hide in a pile of rubble, grass/foliage or corner and become more invisible then solid snakes cardboard box

-aircraft controls are possibly designed by a guy who thinks a dog is a cat.
like why is the steering so sensitive at 20% when using 400 dpi

-the amount of bugs are just god awful, graphics setting some reason wont save, cant toggle on dlss (faded out), cant change mouse bindings while in a game have to go back to main menu

-the optimisation is wtf basically, like the render distance is awful (no option too increase it) literally pixelated hills and textures on high settings.


pros:

-sniping is improved since battlefield 1. meaning by the shots travel faster finally

[b] Campaign [/b] - The missions suffer from Battlefield 1's designs where it's structured half war zone then sudden stealth section. The length per story is very short, around 30 minutes to an hour short. With that in mind, I recommend the following War Stories: 

+ Tirailleur - Black French soldier & his brothers recapturing parts of France.
+ The Last Tiger - Wermacht perspective on the war.

[b] Multiplayer [/b] - If you want to experience this 5 year old product, be warned there are cheaters in official/community servers. It's possible to play without them but it's quite a hassle finding a cheater free server. The next step is to find a server not located in Germany for good ping unless you're a lucky European.

EA has long since stopped caring about this game, evidenced by all the hackers and the fewer and fewer servers they allocate to the game. Honestly, that would be bad enough it they weren't still actively trying to sell a game they have no intention of supporting. Do not support EA and DICE with your hard earned money, they're no better than the hackers that populate their games.",1688356961,1688356961,False,3,0,0.53837960958480835,0,True,False,False

if you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding Creamy courgette lasagne recipe you've come to the right place,

Ingredients

9 dried lasagne sheets
1 tbsp sunflower oil
1 onion, finely chopped
700g courgette (about 6), coarsely grated
2 garlic cloves, crushed
250g tub ricotta
50g cheddar
350g jar tomato sauce for pasta

Directions

STEP 1
Heat oven to 220C/fan 200C/gas 7. Put a pan of water on to boil, then cook the lasagne sheets for about 5 mins until softened, but not cooked through. Rinse in cold water, then drizzle with a little oil to stop them sticking together.

STEP 2
Meanwhile, heat the oil in a large frying pan, then fry the onion. After 3 mins, add the courgettes and garlic and continue to fry until the courgette has softened and turned bright green. Stir in 2/3 of both the ricotta and the cheddar, then season to taste. Heat the tomato sauce in the microwave for 2 mins on High until hot.

STEP 3
In a large baking dish, layer up the lasagne, starting with half the courgette mix, then pasta, then tomato sauce. Repeat, top with blobs of the remaining ricotta, then scatter with the rest of the cheddar. Bake on the top shelf for about 10 mins until the pasta is tender and the cheese is golden.",1630579281,1688042690,True,3,0,0.555837571620941162,0,True,False,False

The developers have chosen to force players to be exposed to blood and traumatic cries for help during death scenes. I wholeheartedly agree that war is hell, and everyone in society should be reminded of that. But is it healing or enlightening to actually spend your time for hours on end, virtually on the ground, virtually bleeding out, listening to a voice actor authentically voicing their humanity as they die, and for a player to experience that repeatedly?

I'm glad that experience exists in this game. The better choice, however, could have been to optionally turn off traumatic content after a certain threshold/level is achieved in the game. At a certain point, you as the player get those lessons.

Imagine the players of this game who get depressed, anxious, and nihilistic from playing it. The totality of the music, pained voices, and repeatedly passing into oblivion... I read the usernames of some people in the game, and without knowing them, I felt pain for them. Just pain and cringe in their usernames.

What if after experiencing war is hell, you as the user unlocked interviews with veterans discussing trauma, death, and PTSD? What if you could turn off trauma/blood/gore/graphic content after watching those interviews? Wouldn't that kind of experience do just as much, if not more to honor and respect the human beings we as players are intended to honor, respect, and understand?

This game was released 5 years ago. The state of it saddens me, and I wish this well-funded franchise chose a better path.",1688001427,1688001427,False,0,3,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

But there isn't everything sunshine, historical inaccuracies are common in this game, stealth is almost impossible in singleplayer, and multipayer (for me) wasn't really attractive.

Certainly a crafted experience by at least some developers, indeed, it is undeniable that this piece of software exists.

In Battlefield 5 you will find things like:
1- Wheraboo copaganda (IT TOOK 10000 SHERMANS TO DEFEAT A TIGER 1!!!!)
2- Tiger 1s in Norway during 1940, in true history channel after 12PM fashion, showing the german wunderwaffen use of time machines.
3- STG 44s all over europe and the pacific, proving that Battlefield 5 happens in the Red Allert setting.
4- ""Large"" Maps with ""big"" teams where both teams only get 1 tank each, no other useful ground vehicle, and you can get bombed constantly by the 5 bombers in the air, showing the capabilities of Battlefield 5 to have worse big team battles than the insipid an anemic Halo Infinity.


There's more but to be completely honest i'm already bored of this joke and this game doesn't deserves the effort. Battlefield 5 looks and feels like a shitpost, it's painfully obvious the people that wrote and designed it have no idea of what the hell they were doing and cared little to learn about the history they were portraying.

Battlefield games can be a hit or miss, you got half of their games being utter crap and the other pretty solid multiplayer shooter. I usually don’t like this type of game but im a sucker for world war 1 and 2 stuff. Initially a lot of people lost interest due to a variety of political and gameplay aspects of this game. I got it for free some time on origin and was actually surprised that its actually not a bad game, or at least for battlefield standards. But there are definitely some issues and a reason why you shouldn’t buy this game.

[u]Gameplay[/u]
The gameplay of the campaign is now focusing much more on open areas you can sneak through, scavenge weapons and ,mark enemies while doing objectives. This is aside for challenges completely optional and the stories that go along with this are quite enjoyble, having their own focus on a variety of gameplay aspects, one character as an example has skis and drives with snowmobiles around, or another one is a completely tank mission where you sometimes have to proceed on foot. Neat stuff, although still not a reason to get the game on full price solely.

The multiplayer now got rid off a couple of things that I disliked about 1, mainly the amount of inventory clutter you have with a lot of weapons that are either just skins or having attachments on them. Here you have way much less weapons, but can customize them a lot. Although its still weird that you can use a mp40 as a Japanese soldier, the game is just taking the world war 2 setting, or its assets, and mashes them together in the multiplayer. Im fine with this to a certain extent, its still silly to see Japanese soldiers helping attacking the Netherlands.

The combat is slightly improved over battlefield 1, you have less weapons due to reason I mentioned earlier and can tune them around with some scopes and for some reason literal red dot sights. Weapons can level and unlock challenges, although you can only activate 3 at a time, while you quickly get a variety of challenges unlocked. This is unnecessary, there is a lot of grind nonetheless here if you into unlocking stuff like that, as luckily the edition sold now unlocks all weapons from the get go. Since there are weapons that are just better than others you can directly use them.

Also the campaign esque mode is back, giving you a sort of narrative that involves a mix of objective types on the same map area, being a pretty neat idea. Its not played that often but I tend to find matches sometimes. Otherwise its just mostly the same, aside that you can now build fortifications on specific points that reward some points. Can sometimes help, depends on the area. Its ok.

That aside it doesn’t improve that much over battlefield 1, there is a reason why I still play it, as the setting got rid off some of the more unique aspects that game had and replaced them barely, you can still bayonet attack with a few weapons but its rather rare to see. Gas is obviously gone. New is a squad system where you can get points and order specific rewards, like artillery strikes or a vehicle as the squad leader. Bonus points are there when you follow /give orders and reviving squadmates without being a medic is now possible, in a slower animation. Good improvement.

There is a major issue in the multiplayer and that is the amount of hackers it got. And I am not saying just fishy wallhack maybes but rather fully fledged thermal scope 100-0 aimbotting guys. There is no way to kick them and I discovered a lot of them. This can ruin absolutely the experience. This is just straight unacceptable for a flagship title, especially even more since Dices last game completely flopped.

Also the core gameplay issue is still there, for being a videogame the kill time is way too low, or atleast for my preference. I don’t want to always die solely because someone saw me first, this is in world war 2 games due to the weapons low accuracy usually not a problem, but here all weapons function just like battlefield 1 with pin point accuracy. There is also an abundance of vehicles again, which are super hard to counter as always.

Compared to the previous game you never fight in a giant battle or airship or anything the like, the previous game does feel a lot more impressive.
[u]Story[/u]
The main storyline is just like in Battlefield 1 set in a variety of mini stories. I found this a lot more enjoyable than a long lasting story as these are more impactful and don’t tend to drag on a lot. Especially unique is the fact that you can play as a German which is rare in this type of shooter. The stories felt pretty neat, had each their own narrative that I actually enjoyed playing through. My only issue is that there isn't enough, its too short, I wanted more.

Also the controversial stuff, like having a lot of women etc. around is just mostly in the multiplayer. The single player story is pretty credible and doesn't paint a false picture like that. The opposite, you play as either a french foreign black soldier in France, which in itself is a credible story, or as a Norwegian female guerrilla warrior. Thats ok i think.

[u]Sound[/u]
My favourite aspect was the fact that people talk in their native language and have various calls and comment way much more often on the current events. You can give a variety of orders or commands that the characters will shout out. Additionally the guns sound very neat, bombs impactful (especially mortar fire) and the various vehicle sounds while being in them make immersion very easily.

[u]Graphics[/u]
Things aside the game runs pretty well and looks very good, not only are the textures pretty neat, but also the effects this game has. Especially when being under mortar fire. Your character can catch mud on his clothes and while laying in the dirt and looking around you can see your whole body taking up space and also moving around. Quite immersive.

[u]Conclusion/TL;DR[/u]
 While despite not really being my type of genre this game is pretty fun, especially considering how it improved some aspects of the previous game I disliked or liked. Campaign is short lived fun and multiplayer is still very active. The main reason to not get this game is because of the non existent anti cheat systems, the problem is too widespread to be in any way possible to overlook.

Above average multiplayer fps that is completely held back by the amount of hacks present in the game.",1676268706,1687361095,False,4,0,0.549565315246582031,0,True,False,False

lets say you have a clean room without hackers, here comes the NICE thing. THE imbalance level in the match will completely ruin the new comers.

It quickly became one of my favorite Battlefield games of all time. The gameplay is highly addictive, and it is not uncommon to spend over 100 hours immersed in this game. The weapon sounds are particularly impressive, although I am not sure if they accurately represent the real thing. The music also adds to the experience, perfectly capturing the WWII theme.

One of the standout features of Battlefield 5 is its stunning graphics and meticulous attention to detail. The visuals are truly impressive, effectively depicting both the horrors and grandeur of war. The meticulously designed environments and dynamic weather effects further enhance the immersion. The sound design is equally impressive, with realistic weapon sounds and explosions that contribute to the overall atmosphere.

However, the campaign mode in Battlefield 5 is not particularly good, and the game is primarily worth playing for its multiplayer experience.

I've also played Battlefield 1 and Battlefield 2042, and I must say that Battlefield 1 is my favorite, with Battlefield 5 coming in second place. Battlefield 1 offers a more challenging experience since it takes place in WWI with less advanced technology, requiring more effort to aim accurately. On the other hand, Battlefield 5 is set in WWII, where the technology and machinery are more modern. I highly recommend giving Battlefield 1 a try; it's definitely worth it.

In conclusion, Battlefield 5 is a good game, thanks to its stunning graphics, diverse gameplay options, and engaging multiplayer experience. Although the single-player component falls short, the multiplayer battles provide thrilling moments of intensity and cooperation. If you come across a discounted price for Battlefield 5, it's definitely worth considering adding it to your gaming library. It offers hours of immersive and action-packed gameplay.

And then add the fact, that you HAVE to use Origin. EA's launcher, Also known as the worst Game launcher ever made. At least from what I've seen. 

That sucks, but that goes for all other Battlefield games too. So whatever lol.

Then, add the fact that DICE straight up abandoned this game, so they could focus on 2042. Which to me, is the biggest mistake they have ever made ever, and i really hope they pay for it. This game had a long life, but DICE/EA MURDERED IT. Straight up murdered.

Battlefield V builds upon the successful formula of the Battlefield series, offering large-scale battles that combine infantry combat, vehicle warfare, and strategic objectives. The game features a variety of modes, including the iconic Conquest and Operations, as well as the cooperative Combined Arms and the battle royale-inspired Firestorm.

The gameplay mechanics in Battlefield V are polished and refined. The gunplay is satisfying, with a wide range of authentic weapons that each handle differently. The addition of fortifications allows players to build defenses and create tactical advantages on the battlefield. The inclusion of vehicles, such as tanks, planes, and transport vehicles, adds depth and variety to the gameplay, allowing for epic battles and strategic maneuvers.

The squad-based mechanics are a highlight of Battlefield V. The game encourages teamwork and coordination, with the ability to revive fallen teammates, provide ammunition, and cooperate on objectives. The squad play fosters a sense of camaraderie and reinforces the importance of strategic teamwork in achieving victory.

Visuals and Audio:
Battlefield V showcases stunning visuals that bring the war-torn environments to life. The game's attention to detail is commendable, with realistic weapon models, detailed character animations, and destructible environments that react dynamically to the chaos of battle. The graphical fidelity, coupled with realistic lighting and weather effects, contributes to the immersive and cinematic nature of the game.

The audio design in Battlefield V is top-notch, capturing the chaos and intensity of war. The sound of gunfire, explosions, and the thunderous roar of tanks and aircraft create a visceral audio landscape. The inclusion of authentic World War II-era music and voice acting further enhances the immersion and adds to the historical atmosphere.

Historical Accuracy and Representation:
Battlefield V strives for historical accuracy while also offering a diverse representation of soldiers and combatants during World War II. The game's single-player War Stories mode presents different perspectives and narratives, shedding light on lesser-known aspects of the war. The multiplayer experience features a variety of playable factions, including the British, Germans, Americans, and more, providing a broad representation of the conflict.

It is worth noting that Battlefield V takes certain liberties with historical accuracy to accommodate gameplay balance and variety. While this may disappoint purists seeking a strictly authentic experience, the game manages to strike a balance between historical accuracy and enjoyable gameplay.

Conclusion:
Battlefield V delivers an immersive and action-packed World War II experience. With its refined gameplay mechanics, stunning visuals, and attention to historical detail, the game captures the epic scale and intensity of war. The cooperative squad-based gameplay, coupled with a variety of modes and an emphasis on teamwork, ensures a dynamic and engaging multiplayer experience.

While some historical liberties are taken, Battlefield V successfully balances authenticity with enjoyable gameplay. The game's dedication to representing different perspectives and lesser-known narratives of the war adds depth and meaning to the experience.

Overall, Battlefield V stands as a worthy addition to the Battlefield series, offering a grand and authentic World War II experience that is both visually stunning and immersive. For fans of first-person shooters and military history enthusiasts, Battlefield V is a must-play.",1680471433,1686083679,True,1,0,0.508928596973419189,0,True,False,False

This was my first BF game back into the series of the newer ones with the last being BF3 on 360 back in the 2010 era. The first two sessions we played a couple months ago over about 3 hours was just fully of so many hackers on each server so we dropped the game. 
Came back and ran through the campaigns on hardcore a few months later to get my dollar out of it and they were actually decent. Nothing super crazy story wise but the missions we still decent, the game looks great, and the sound design was fireee if not the best part. After that we jumped back in multiplayer and started getting games with minimal to no hacking and it was actually super dope. The game is well balanced and the multiplayer maps were solid with a good variety across them. Squad play has a huge advantage if you can communicate with everyone. Sniping is extremely satisfying and the CQB gun fight on objectives is awesome and I still will never care to use vehicles in the BF series outside of transportation lol. Each of the 4 classes has an equal contribution to the game which keeps the meta freedom to any one and I think almost all guns are like that too which brings it down to preference. The weapon and character customization felt overwhelming at first but its actually very minimal which I enjoy. There are just a few standard attachments and a couple of gun traits to choose from, but just a spew of cosmetic stuff which served zero interest. The only thing I wish I got to try was the battle royal game type just so I could see what a BF take on BR would play like but no one plays it. 
So at this point the game was being a full recommendation on my list until you just get dumped on by hackers. The maps are big enough that half the hacks do not affect the entire map but the list of hacks is fried. Invincibility, super speed hacks, aim/wall/bullet noclip hacks(and combo that with tanks), fingerrrrrrr guuuuuuun 1 shot hack, or the most annoying wiping the entire lobby individual score/xp and just instakilling the whole lobby. I still had fun playing it and its not bad for avoiding/finding new servers with out hackers but these guys do not give an f about their game so I cannot promote them getting more money off this one.",1686082669,1686083358,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Official servers are plagued with hackers and toxicity. No moderation at all.

Are all online shooters plagued with the same issue? Pretty much.

In a fierce battle that lasted for an hour, the 65th Infantry Division, which was responsible for the frontal attack, suffered heavy casualties, with a staggering reduction rate of 93%. According to the surviving German veteran, he only saw a floating gun in the air and didn't even see anyone, but in the midst of lightning, more than half of his team members were already dead or injured. Whether the secret genetic experiments in the Allied powers exist or not, rumors about the ""Captain America"" have long caused panic at the bottom of the German army. At present, the German Supreme Command is still discussing the issue of attacking the Netherlands. The Chief of Staff of the German Armed Forces Supreme Command, Kaitel, claimed that under his urging, German scientists have discovered that orphaned children who have lost their parents can easily be lured into a new generation of super warriors. They can tear apart tigers with their hands, and their eyes can see through grass and trees thousands of meters away, with a reaction power several hundred times that of ordinary people. In order to catch up with the progress of the war, the first batch of ""Aryan Supermans"" are being transported to the front line at full speed. We do not know whether Kettle's move was to appease the morale of the lower German army, or whether it was indeed the case. Perhaps in future battles, we can see Captain America fighting against Aryan Superman.
