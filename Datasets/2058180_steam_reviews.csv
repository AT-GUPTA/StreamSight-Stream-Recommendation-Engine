My issue with this game was that the story didnt start becoming interesting until chapter 11. I felt like I was tied to the back of a truck and dragged through the streets of Kamurochi against my will. I had to really fight through the story building. This feeling mainly stemmed from not having any connection to Tak, the protagonist. I felt more affinity to Kaito than Tak in early game. Because his backstory is left in the dark and we dont really seem much of it until late game, I was left wondering ""Why does he care this much?"". i felt like I was plopped into a drama that I had no business running in. For someone who spent much of his time doing odd jobs and such I didnt see why he felt so strongly about THIS case. Granted the story did end up becoming more interesting, by that time I was already exhausted by playing 18 hours of side missions and Keihin gang antics. I truly wish I could have enjoyed this game more. The combat was decent and the overall story was very well written , but for me the pacing was very off. I reached out to friends who loved the game to see if I was missing something and was told to just be patient but GYATDANG. For a 13 chapter story, to only really see the fruition of the plot in the last two chapters is mad. 

In the previous Yakuza games I played, what made me love them was the feeling of vengeance I was chasing all game. Whether it be a murder off rip or a betrayal, I would chase to the end of the game for my MC's retribution. I felt that this was missing for Tak. I didnt really care to see through the story UNTIL chapter 11 where more info is revealed. 

I will likely still continue to play through to Lost Judgement just to have all the Yakuza games complete but I am bummed that I seemed to have missed something of a gem here..",1709076343,1709076343,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Buy this if you enjoyed the action combat of any previous Ryu Ga Gotoku game

Reasons to consider not purchasing the game: 

Expecting any kind of lighthearted mini-game or pass time like in Yakuza 0

Running to and from objectives across town repeatedly, also repeatedly using Taxi's to get to and from specific places to get to another cutscene and have to take a taxi again to view another cutscene.

Combat quirks that aren't fixed since Kiwami 2, combat in general feeling weird or off. RT overheat shit is still in and annoying.

Ultimately if you like the story/music of the previous titles you might enjoy Judgement, but you might also buy this expecting more Yakuza and get disappointed.

Second half: A+

Seriously, this game isn't the best of the best when it comes to RGG Studio's output, with mechanics such as the tailing wearing out their welcome real quick, but Judgment benefits from a great cast of characters throughout, a truly loathsome villain, and a second half that takes the training wheels off and just goes freakin' nuts. 

It's got some of my favourite moments in any RGG game, and a lot of that has to do with the main pair of characters. Yagami and Kaito both bring their own great flavour to proceedings within the oh so familiar streets of Kamourocho, and though only Yagami is playable throughout the story, Kaito immediately takes a head seat within the council of ABSOLUTE HOMIES.

Great game, in spite of a few little issues. From chapter 8 onwards, I don't think the grin left my face for a second.

Amazing mystery plot, really amazing characters and their developments that even made me tear up in a couple of places and the fun combat. If you like doing side activities with a lot of dialogue  but with no voice acting, then you'll absolutely love this game. I personally can't get immersed if the side quests are not voiced. So mostly I skipped most of the side quests' dialogue. Now this game is not perfect , not the best yakuza game but it's at least top 5. Only if it didn't have those god awful tailing missions , could clearly tell that was for padding purposes as most of the time there needn't be any tailing required. even if you had to do it, you have a drone you can freely control. Why waste time hiding and following slowly. This is the most frustrating tailing mission in any game period. Also those god awful thumb lockpicking sections. hope they did a little more play testing with the controls as the sensitivity for the sticks were awful and no option to set the said sensitivity.

Everything is too segmented and the gameplay is not amusing.

Judgment, known as Judge Eyes in Japan, is a different look into the city that has enraptured me and so many others, through the eyes of Takayuki Yagami, a detective working in Kamurocho. 

A former attorney, circumstances have him working a different job. As he takes on a case involving the killings of yakuza members, all with their eyes gouged out, the mysteries only pile up from then on, into well, another government conspiracy. But this one is one of the good ones, just like how Judgment's story is on the higher end of RGG Studio's entries. The mystery is done in a nice manner, and the links to the people behind it all are done very well. Yagami's own past is also connected to the cases, and some interesting things are done there. A good detective story, for a first foray into something different from the norm, that does the story beats pretty well, even if some side cases are awkwardly fitted in between chapters to fill time.

While Yagami himself doesn't have the immediate appeal as Kiryu or Ichiban, he is a pretty decent protagonist, and the people he hangs around with are pretty interesting and funny too, in certain instances. It's also nice contrasting the 35 year old Yagami being more tech savvy than the inept Kiryu (at 50 around this time no less), incorporating more modern features in the game. Kaito, his former yakuza friend, is charming and they also have banter back and forth that is pretty believable. Substories are done as side cases, which often times are strictly professional, but can also lead to some befriending of people involved in these cases. Some of them can be pretty funny and a bit on the wild side, like the Twisted Trio saga, and the humour you'd expect from the series is still present in a good number of these ones, amongst others that are just business. There's even times where the client aren't who they appear to be.

As Yagami is a detective, he has to build rapport with other people to get reputation, and to get cases to get paid. The friends system from Kiwami 2 is integrated here, as befriending certain establishments will allow special EX actions. There is a good reason to get friends as they will be able to greet you on the street form small boosts to the EX gauge, and there is also a side case that ties a good chunk of the previous friendships together, which is pretty good for those that do these kinds of things.

The XP system relies on getting SP, and while the gain of these can be kind of underwhelming (especially checking the KamuroGo list, this game's completion list, for the effort needed to attain some of these), it can be alleviated somewhat with the Growth Extract (Items that provide temporary buffs, constituting this game's crafting system), as it gives a flat 10% increase to almost all SP gains, including main story and completing KamuroGo actions, something extremely crucial on the Legend run. Otherwise, it relies on getting Hug Bomb Omegas, which give the largest SP boost at a hefty cost of 140,000 yen after investing into it through Quickstarter, and getting money isn't quite as easy when there's no business rolling in.

Money is tight in this game, and you can really feel it if you invest into everything the game throws at you. Drone racing, Quickstarting projects (oddly enough they almost all give or do what they advertised), it can all feel very overwhelming. The way to make any kind of real money is through the VR board game, which I wasn't feeling at first, but after getting the skill that slows the dice rolls considerably, I did find myself having fun in them while grinding for money in the 2-5 million yen range, on the later courses.

Combat in this game is the best so far in the Dragon Engine games. A flat upgrade to 6's combat, where moves feel very good, as Yagami has a different approach to fighting than say, Kiryu. No stored weapons though, which is somewhat of a shame considering Kiwami 2's improvements on that front. Some of the unlockables in combat skills feels game changing, such as the Triple Finisher, while others conflict with other skills. The counter from 0 is an unlockable skill, but if used, doesn't stun the attacker. This can prove fatal if one is trying to use Tiger style trying to use the Tiger Drop (unlockable in this game from an in-game QR code), one can be left in the red if the timing isn't correct. The skill that requires 6 ""drunkenness"" is counter-intuitive when above 6, as it removes all stacks of it, and the damage is not that great anyways. It is still the best it has felt with the main engine of these games though, and it's still funny being able to destroy anything if you run into it long enough. The concept of Deadly Attacks leaving parts of the health bar locked if you are hit  unless you use a health kit, or go to get healed, is something I'm mixed about, especially since guns will do that easily when they show up later in the game.

Minigames are decent, the usual fare of darts and gambling games are here, with arcade games from Sega's heyday (although I'm really sick of having to do Virtua Fighter 2), alongside Drone Racing, and lock picking related ones (which is really hard on Legend for no reason) to progress in stories or side cases. No karaoke is tough, but I guess they couldn't get Takuya Kimura (the guy who plays Yagami) to do that in these games. There is no Puyo Puyo in here, and that is a good thing, because trying to do mahjong with the wareme rules was already wack in itself. They really love that stuff over there, and I'm glad it's a one-time thing in this game. Kamuro of the Dead is fun as it's a Dead Souls and a House of the Dead reference, and easier than the respective game it's based on too.

The completion of this game still has sour spots though, and the Amon fight in this game felt cheaper than usual, at least it felt that way trying to get him done. One good thing about these Sega games that get ported to PC after an initial console release, is that the DLC that was on that console now comes pre-packaged in. This includes drone parts, office customization, and even clothes for the girlfriends you can make in the game, alongside some top end reusable extracts. Some of those extracts can be powerful, but they do have a time limit so you can't completely cheese the game. Anything to make the Legend run easier, I'll take, and boy, that last stretch you have to do without saving brought back Kiwami memories...

Aside some middling detective parts (trailing missions are meh, and you're not really penalized for presenting wrong evidence), Judgment is a pretty nice look into a different aspect of Kamurocho, while still retaining its seedy vibes. It is kind of a Yakuza game, with detective clothes on, and that's not necessarily a bad thing. A pretty good entry into the Like a Dragon franchise, and I am eager to continue Yagami's story in Lost Judgment.",1707992726,1708076214,True,3,0,0.555555582046508789,0,True,False,False

Previously I've played 10+ hours of Yakuza (Japanese Mafia) 0, still a newbie of the franchise but I get familiar with how events are presented and what to expect. Judgement is a branch related to the Yakuza games, with standalone characters and standalone story. For me, it's a good 20 hours for the main story and I had a lot of fun.

Judgement is story-driven and just like the trailer introduced, ""playing this game is like watching a Japanese TV show"". I browsed Youtube to find that the cutscenes took 19 hours, enough to create a mini-series. It burns slowly at the beginning but gradually it gets interesting, every little thing that seems isolated will eventually all come together and make sense, so try to be a little bit more patient, and get to know Japanese culture and the way they think.

I found Judgement a relaxing game.

Beside story and cutscenes, it involves lots of fighting but rest assured, Judgement does not require a master skill like it is in Street Fighting to beat up enemies, but the visual is satisfying because every hit takes count and effect. Special attacks will be unlocked with progress and purchase, easy to trigger in both advantage and disadvantage situations, and with 2 style efficient to aim single or group enemies, the fights never bore me. And you can always avoid random street fights if paying attention on the mini-map, or switch to easy mode.

For the detective part, no need to search every corner or burn your brain to solve a case. Only 4-5 items are to be found in the crime scene and to be presented at the court, things are straightforward so you don't need IQ 120 to pick the right evidence for conclusion in serious detective games like Danganronpa or Ace Attorney. If you miss something or make a wrong speculation, no worries, you can always choose again without punishment.

Now comes character and story. The protagonist is Takayuki Yagami, once a lawyer now a detective, the main story unfolds on why he changes occupation and what haunts his mind, new challenges and risks await him for every choice as he gets closer to finding out the truth. Also, Judgement involves major characters with high place in both yakuza and government agencies, they either stand or are against Yagami so there's no absolute conclusion on which side is good or bad, but everyone gets benefits and makes sense. Judgement is not a dark game, at the end justice is brought, and the feeling of a real event is the highlight. My only thought is the original name 'Judge Eyes' fits in better.

I recommend this game. However, Judgement is not perfect. There are repeated missions about tailing people and flying a drone with camera to gain evidence and both could be painful. if they are skippable I'd rate it 9.5/10.

For the last part, heavy spoiler below. do NOT move the mouse here unless you want to read the story.

[spoiler]3 years ago, A truck driver/cleaning worker was accused of murderer at a pharmaceutical research and development building. This place develops new medicine to cure Alzheimer patients, evidence leads to one of the patients being murdered with a body found in the truck. The truck driver insists he's framed and defense lawyer Takayuki Yagami successfully gave him freedom but shortly after, this truck driver killed his girlfriend then burnt the house down. The media hyped the event and with self guilt, Yagami quit being a lawyer and became a private detective.
Back to now, yakuza members, a lawyer and a prosecutor have been found dead with both eyes gouged out (Why take the trouble? What happens to the eyeballs?). Yagami looked into the case, and with help from a corrupt police who delivers secret files, things are linked to this promising medicine development for a Alzheimer cure called AD-9, which is actually a failure but publicly states a near success. With the potential huge benefit of both fame and money, the head of a yakuza family and government agencies protect it.
Turns out the key developer for AD-9 illegally tested on humans and no one has survived. All the corpses are taken care of by the Head of Police dept Mitsuru Kuroiwa, who's also a fight master aka the Mole, kills whoever hinders the medicine's procedure and takes out tester's eyes since they became scary blue. He's the one who was the truck driver's girlfriend.
When AD-9's failure is known to the public, the benefit chain has broken and everyone's for themselves. Yagami and his buddies chased Kuroiwa who's after Shono, in the end, Yagami beat Kuroiwa and Kuroiwa is shot by several police officers, he had the delusion to see Shono made AD-9 and died seeing Shono injected himself with a dose he thought successful yet eventually killed himself.

Some Highlights are the body hidden in Yagami office's wardrobe, and the entire last mission to defeat Kuroiwa is exciting.I found Mitsuru Kuroiwa a cool dude and usually I uninstall a game right after I finished it, but I replayed the last mission using a mod to make Kuroiwa playable[/spoiler].",1706854103,1706894506,True,2,1,0.521422088146209717,0,True,False,False

An absolute emotional roller coaster ride that might honestly outshine the entire mainline Yakuza franchise up to this point.

Combat is a more refined version of Kiwami 2/Y6, still suffers from a slight bit of repetition and tends to be quite easy outside of Legend difficulty. Yagami also ends up a bit too powerful by the end of the game, regardless.

Side content is your usual Yakuza fare, tons of variety from batting cages, gambling, arcade games, etc. And you also get a ""free"" copy of Virtua Fighter 5 for PC if you install a 3rd party launcher! Thank you Sega, very cool.

Characters are memorable and lovable especially your close buddys, almost on par with Y: LAD characters. Story is one of the best in Y/LAD series, it's more serious then your avarage Yakuza. Side content was meh, lacking and repeatable, you have your funny and qurky side cases(substories) and standart side content like baseball, casino etc. New stuff; street rep(buddy system) that unlocks new events, side cases and allies that help you with street fights, girlfriends, money making ''Paradisu VR'' board game, and a very hard drone racing. Your MC, Yagami utilizes two fighting styles; Crane crowd control style which has no upgrade tree and powerfull Tiger for single enemy, but you can easly finish game using tiger only, Yagami can also leap over enemy and wall jump, the second one is crucial if you want to stop 'mortal wound' strike from boss type enemy, MC can also use extracts that e.g. gives him ability to break enemy guard or throw em around like they are nothing. Now the bad and ugly, lack of interesting  side content so you will be mainly doing main story and side cases, mortal wounds mechanic - it does not add anything, just makes you take a long trip to sewers so you can heal or buy medkit for a very expensive price, this exist only to waste time, Keihin gang - ''Majima everywhere'' system but 3x worse, atleast you can pull out your drone to reset random encounter spawn. Assassin's Creed style tailing missions that are slow and boring just horrible, especially the final one, it's like 15-20 minutes of walking in circle. Chases are not great either, at least they are quick, always funny when Yagami does some unnecessary goofy jump/dodge, still better then Y3 chases though.

judgement failed to really keep my interest in both its characters and its story. i was able to predict alot of the smaller twist and you often have to sit through what feels like hours of dialogue just to get a simple point across

the story and most side missions really failed to give me a reason to care for most of the characters, as i can’t really pinpoint how yagami or others have changed throughout the story. obviously yagami overcomes,, but i don’t feel any sort of connection to yagami in the slightest. [spoiler] hamura is a really good antagonist, he’s a huge reason i kept playing [/spoiler]

besides repetitive story relays, the pacing is really screwed over by forced minigame sequences that help further the plot. which doesn’t sound all so bad, however these modes are super slow and not even that well fleshed out.  investigation sequences are the best and most immersive part of the game, but it loses its charm. the other two forced minigames are drone investigations and tailing sequences,, these are super super slow and often made me put the game down once i was done. while they’re a better alternative and more immersive way of storytelling than just plain cutscenes, it’s hard to enjoy these segments. 

judgement—like most of the other yakuza games— have a stellar soundtrack with excellently animated cutscenes and voice acting

kamurochos friend/girlfriend system is one of the best additions of judgement, as more side content opens up and also really grounds you into the world. there are also a few real cameos from store owners, which really makes the world feel lived in. my only complaint with the girlfriend system is that it’s super bland, after they confess their love there is nothing to do with them further

the combat for this game had already been a bit spoiled for me, as i have already played The Man Who Sold His Name. However it’s still enjoyable for the most part. 

the game isn’t really balanced well around switching styles, as tiger style just does everything crane does, but better; as well as major upgrades to your fighting 99% of the time benefit tiger over crane. there are no specific upgrades for crane style, unlike tiger which has 3 specific upgrades that correlate with your damage boost.

non of the minigames kept my interest as well. i will admit i am spoiled, y7 and others set such a high bar for side content,, but the drone racing minigame and [something] clan/gang were both boring and annoying at times. besides their specific minigames, theres only really gambling, darts, majong, and batting cages. 

i probably would’ve loved the combat if i had played judgement right after yakuza 6

my thoughts on the ending: [spoiler] I was honestly just glad this was over, i knew somewhere down the line they were gonna pull an albert wesker and inflict themselves with adrenaline; the pacing of the final chapters is just awful too, no suspense for anything.[/spoiler]

the court cases really were lackluster as i’m a huge fan of lawyer shows, we didn’t get nearly enough time doing some of the most fun and interactive parts of the game.

the gimmicky incense system has its moments but ultimately just not a fun system to mess around with; id say it’s equivalent to the weapon searching family from yakuza 0

definitely one of my least favorite rgg games, compares to y3 in terms of engagement and story

this game makes me not look forward to lost judgement, so my playthrough on that will be put on hold,, i’ll refine this review later but it’s super late and im so tired nightynight 🤙🤙",1705060236,1705063379,False,3,0,0.472201883792877197,0,True,False,False

Fun combat and great side stories this time around with tons of interesting characters.

The pacing of this game is a bit slower than your standard Yakuza game so it can take some getting used to if you are coming from that series.

Overall, more of the same so if you liked Yakuzas this will not be a miss.

Action game with a lot of fighting, and a lot less detective/lawyer-work.
It is nice to see the studio try to branch into different game styles, but personally, I just found this to be more or less like the other Yakuza games.
There is a big overarching conspiracy that the protagonist is trying to solve, and the main way protagonist does that is through being a basically unstoppable fighter.
You would think they would tone it down with the protagonist being a lawyer/detective, but that does not seem to be the case as Yagami (the protagonist) is honestly comparable to Kiryu, and even learns one of his signature moves just like that.
Most of the answers Yagami has to beat out of others, yet the game tries to play his combat prowess off.
There are a few cases where Yagami tries to avoid danger by saying ""but they have an army in there"" or ""it's too dangerous"", despite having a proven track record of being basically unstoppable, and the game basically throwing you into such situations anyway.
Really, the only thing holding him back is the new mechanic of ""mortal wounds"" which is a type of permanent damage that requires a doctor or an actual medkit to heal (of which you get a very limited amount you can carry), but on a normal casual playthrough it does not seem to be a very limiting factor, so carrying a whole shop's worth of food is still a viable strat.
I guess on this note, I will also mention that I was not particularly sold on fighting in this game neither, it just felt janky.
Like one of your best attacks is a charged light attack, which tends to work at the start, but then bosses just shake it off, even if you can perfectly see that it should have connected.
Some skills and critically, dodging, are reliant on lock-on which honestly fucking sucks, as it seems to more lock your character's view than lock you onto an enemy.
I found myself walking back-first into the boss multiple times because I tried using the lock-on, so in the end, I would really rather not have to use it, but alas.

Detective/Lawyer side felt a lot weaker compared to the action.
Sure, there is evidence-gathering and such, but it feels kinda barebones, and there are like only 3 cases, which all get rolled into one by the end of the game, anyway.
Game labels a lot of things as ""cases"", but realistically, those are more information storage and fancier side quests than actual mysteries.
Some also get abruptly ""solved"" at some point, too, at least according to the UI.
I want to draw a parallel to Danganronpa here - in that game, there are clear cases, you go gather evidence for them as they occur, and with some effort it is even possible to put all the pieces together before the game tells you how it all actually went down.
Here, I found myself figuring out the first 2 cases easily enough, and the last one was basically the whole story that became clear like 1/2 or 2/3 into the story, with the rest of it going about trying to collect proof.

Gameplay-wise, this game feels and plays like any other RGG game.
Kamurocho is open for the player to explore, and has more activities than necessary with a touch of some Japanese bs.
There are great graphics and motion provided by the modern Dragon Engine.
Of note this time, I guess there are drone races that I completely skipped, but heard are really brutal, and the ""VR game"".
The latter is just a virtual Kamurocho that Yagami can plunge himself into to play a simple board game that puts him into various minigames depending on the tile he lands, of which more interesting are again, fights.
Those fights can, and will have challenges in them that can be actually challenging (like going against an enemy that has all its attacks count as ""mortal wounds"" and limit your HP bar) to fun spins like ""kill everything with a railgun"".
This VR thing also pays an absolutely stupid amount of money, playing it for like 5 times has given me more than enough funds to go through the rest of the game.
It also has an annoyingly catchy BGM.

To summarize, this is an okay spin on the usual formula RGG employs.
People who are already familiar with Kamurocho get another excuse to delve into it, and those who are not are in for an okay introduction into the franchise (though, probably Yakuza 0 is a better start).

Alright, folks, grab your magnifying glass and your sense of humor, because I'm about to take you on a whirlwind tour of ""Judgment,"" the game where you play a detective that's part Sherlock Holmes, part Jackie Chan, and all Yakuza.

First up, let's talk gameplay. You've got your standard Yakuza brawling, now with a side dish of detective work that's as challenging as choosing what to order at a fast-food joint. Lockpicking? More like a tutorial that never ends. Crime scene investigations? More like a game of 'find the object' with training wheels. And tailing suspects? Well, let’s just say it's a good time to catch up on your podcasts.

But wait, there's more! You're also playing a bit of Phoenix Wright here, minus the thrill of courtroom drama. Your dialogue choices during investigations? They matter as much as asking for no ice in your drink at a self-serve soda fountain. No real consequences, just the illusion of choice.

Now, let’s talk about the heart and soul of the game – the combat. Think of it as a dance, but you're dancing with street thugs and the occasional ninja. Yes, a ninja! You’ve got two fighting styles – one for the crowds, and one for those intimate one-on-one encounters. And let’s not forget the delightful absurdity of using hot sauce as a weapon. That’s right, hot sauce in the eyes, because why not?

But what really shines in ""Judgment"" is its story. It's a twisting, turning narrative that’ll keep you guessing more than a game of Clue in the dark. It’s the kind of story that makes the less exciting gameplay worth it, just to see what happens next.

The game's not without its quirks. Like, why do side characters in cutscenes move like they're in a school play? And speaking of side missions, they intertwine with the main story, but suddenly the characters forget how to talk. It's like going from a Broadway show to a silent film in seconds.

So, is ""Judgment"" a Yakuza game in disguise? Absolutely. But it's like wearing a vampire costume to go undercover – obvious, but somehow it works. It's a game that's not afraid to be a bit silly, a bit serious, and a lot of fun.

In conclusion, ""Judgment"" is for those who enjoy their detective stories with a side of street fighting, a dash of comedy, and a sprinkle of Yakuza magic. It might not be the perfect game, but it's a perfect way to spend a weekend solving crimes and doling out street justice, Yakuza-style.",1704788701,1704788733,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

The game was released for the PlayStation 4 in 2018 in Japan and June 2019 for the worldwide release. The PC version was released on Steam in September 2022 as part of the Judgment series bundle. Judgment is the first game of the Judgment series, a spin-off to the Yakuza/Like a Dragon franchise. The story takes place in 2018 and the player play as Takayuki Yagami, a former attorney turned private detective whose past events haunted him while a series of killings took place in Kamurocho. Yagami confronts his past and solve the killings with legal courtroom dramas, investigations, and martial arts. Judgment has similarities and differences to the Yakuza/Like a Dragon series. Does Sega’s and RGG Studio’s new IP spin-off series got your intrigue?

Like the main Yakuza franchise, Judgment has a strong story and voice acting. Judgment took the story element further and I found myself really invested on the story. Judgment is also more character driven and leans heavily on the acting performance. The protagonist, Takayuki Yagami, is played by Takuya Kimura. From what I read about the actor, he’s famous in Japan. The story in Judgment is interesting and has some neo-noir flair as the story is formatted like an TV mini-series. The gameplay is familiar to the mainline series, so I won’t review it further. However, there are some enhancements and subtle qualities of life.  

One of the major differences are the combat styles: the Crane and Tiger. Crane is suited for fighting against multiple opponents while Tiger focuses on one target. However, the different fighting styles are not too tied up so you can still use either style on any fighting scenarios. I do find the fighting techniques somewhat in reminisce to the older, Hong Kong martial arts films from the 1970s and 1980s. Feels like a Jackie Chan or Donnie Yen film at times. The dynamic intros are cinematic and well choreograph. The soundtrack for the combat styles is addicting to listen to. Furthermore, I found the overall soundtrack for Judgment to be very memorable, catchy, and straight banging. The composers for RGG Studio have done themselves an outstanding job.
 
The “side cases” are the same as substories, but the minor characters are involved in assisting the protagonist in certain situations. It’s like Yakuza Kiwami 2, but it’s expanded, and the minor characters are useful. Since the player is a private detective, there are investigation mechanics like trailing a suspected character, chasing, disguises, and search modes. In addition, there are new minigames like drone racing/customization and Dice & Cube courses at Paradise VR (an “VR” monopoly type game for the player to earn money).

Judgment’s strengths are noteworthy and commendable, but there are some imperfections. Yagami’s investigations mechanics feels light and an experiment that didn’t expand further. The skill points are hard to earn and takes a while to get all the points to unlock all skills. There’s a certain “exploit” by purchasing a specific drink, consume, and grind the Paradise VR minigame. It’s really a detachment and does hinder the game for those who want a perfectionist run, like me. Doing the minigames, activities, combat encounters, and food/drink consumptions are not enough.

Judgment is unique because there’s not a game where the player can play as a former attorney turned private detective who knows martial arts. There are some influences like Ace Attorney, various courtroom TV-drama series, and Hong Kong kung-fu films but RGG Studio puts a unique spin and learned the lessons on their experiences on the Yakuza/Like a Dragon series, applying on what can be considered as one of the unique games released. There are lots of established franchises in the video game industry and I commend the developers for doing something original. As the first title for the new spin-off series, I look forward on how future title(s) improve in Lost Judgment and possibly how it parallels the main series. The game has my recommendation for both newcomers and long-time fans.",1702611551,1704234634,True,22,1,0.685975253582000732,0,True,False,False

The story is nice and a welcome change from the main series. For once we don't have to worry about legendary yakuza clans and just play as someone else. Main story is great and side story (or side cases in this game) is hilarious and still as fun as ever.

The problem is the detective stuff is not as fun as it should be. Tailing is boring after a few times, and looking for evidence is annoying at best. 
And the worst part is combat. I'm quite surprise to see that they can make it worse than in Yakuza 6. Yagami attacks will bounce off enemies for no apparent reason with no guarding animation at all. And Every enemies is capable of this ""super armor"" even the lowest type of goons. This will disrupt your combo in the most annoying way, and stronger enemies will just counter with heavy damage. Simply unfair because if you attack unguarded enemies, they should flinch, not you.

Barely finish it because the story is good enough to keep me going, but combat is one of the worst, if not the worst in the entire series imo.",1704105737,1704105737,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Focusing on this specific game: I think ""sluggish"" sums it up well. It feels like the story has been spread as thin as could be, with constant interruptions after each small scene. Every small story progress we make is followed by either having to go home for the night, go visit our ex-boss to say hi, or some other excuse to have us run through the place again and again. And again. There are regular dopamine hits, but at the end of the play session we can realise how most of it was not super engaging.

The nail on the coffin: the protagonist is voiced by Takuya Kimura, whose acting range is close to being a single dot. The only thing he ever does is basically mumble and look bored. This might be enough when he can let his looks carry him, but as a voice actor in a video game this really pulls the game down imo.

For starters, I rue the fact that this game was brought up to me this late due to release cadence, it is important to note that at the time RGG studio games have a JP exclusive time window, that window is often spent on PS platforms only. For the same reason the series might be hard to continue from the side of the devs due to disagreements with the Actor's management group from Japan, thanks to the devs tho, playing on pc now is still a perfectly whole experience.
This game has the same basic legs of the main RGG yakuza games, only this game sees the Dragon Engine shine like never before (just don't be fooled because the wacky physics and confusing ragdolls are not gone). The story blows everything you've seen out of the water but closely resembles J-drama (in this genre some of the contemporary story lines borrow and refine from Agatha Christie novels, you'll see some of those here), although maybe the story relies a little bit too much on yakuza knowledge from the main series, but still can be enjoyed as the protagonist you play really is his own thing.
Combat wise this has lots of jank that would be fixed in the sequel Lost Judgement, there are skills you can pick up early on to sidestep the difficulty, but playing the game normally while you abuse your ability to release the fist of JUSTICE after bouncing from walls should make it a smooth and fun experience.
Be wary of the length, don't try to beat the it one go, and go play the next game when the amazing story is still in your brain.",1703752432,1703752432,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This is more of a list of complaints and things I liked as a Yakuza fan so it not going to cover story, graphics and others. 

This studio in all of their games reuse a lot of the same styles, characters, NPC's, mission types, side missions, and extra goodies. Now don't get me wrong, the city seeing it change over the Yakuza games is awesome, but the developer since they arent really tying much of the Yakuza series to it, then why bother? Its disappointing since they wanted to go to this new route but didnt really do much new stuff in a new city. Hell even Yakuza 3 went and brought in another city entirely, why couldnt it have been done here?

The fighting is new, and interesting and very stylistic, though the same 2-3 mobs keep coming at you all the time. This is really sad since even in previous games the makeup of the random mobs would at least look different, most of the time. Here its such a small pool of NPCs. The fighting is limited to two styles, the Crane being the most useless of the two. Upgrading the styles is grindy so I wouldnt say it is worth it. The encounter rate is nothing like, Like a Dragon, but there are a lot of random encounters in the game...wayyyyy too many!  Also, what in the hell, the stagger times when you get hit are way too long. Want to go for realism? Great. That would have clearly hurt but these guys are going to stand around and wait for me to get up from being staggered, yeah right. Also, whats up with the rag doll physics? Ive seen mens bodies do the same thing as bouncy balls and running into a bicycle can send it into the air? Lastly about fighting, I would have to say, the most annoying parts is while you are holding someone, the other NPC's can clearly just knock you out, which is completely dumb. I even got knocked out in a fight while holding and beating the guy down and the other NPCs whacked me, very very annoying. Again, going for realism is fine, but the line isnt very clear on how this was mapped out. 

I really enjoyed that they kept the environmental impacts when fighting. Nothing cooler then fighting and you throw or kick someone through the windows, or even using some of the verticality to use an EX move on the mobs. Speaking of which, the EX moves are just like all the other games, meaning the further you get into the game, the more of these you can spam, invalidating some bosses if not all, completely. For me, if you put in the time, and get the power ups, I feel great when I just own the crap out of a boss, as there EX moves just like in previous games become a real bummer to fight against, so the EX stuff is definitely cool. Plus the all new animations across the city are neat, especially the ones with friends. As well, different friends from cases around the city can lead to new items or tricks up Yagami's sleeve including extracts. Basically drinks from vending machines from previous games giving you a boost but there are some interesting elemental attacks that you gain which is super neat. Interestingly enough, all of them are made from little items you pick-up throughout the city. How does a fire element attack work, when you combine fish soup, cat food and some shabby wire! Who knows but it does!

Regarding the little items, it seems this is a borrowed effect from open world games, so its annoying but useful. Useful for extracts but also useful for one of the coolest parts of the game, Drone Racing! I would recommend trying this out to all players and getting through the whole thing, very much worth the time!

Going back to the city and the NPC's, this feels a lot more like, Like a Dragon then the Yakuza series as the side cases (side missions) this time around can and will lead to assistance in the city. You protect them, and they will help you when a mob tries to take you on. Its good stuff, albeit very very repetitive. It feels like you really are a hero to these people and them helping you while battling is just a nice touch. It is interesting, going back to the over used assets and numerous NPC's that look the same every where, once you get some help from certain people, they basically roam the city doing their ""city"" thing. Some even walk the street looking for fights to get in with you, to help you. With that said, they are every where, I mean the same NPC. There is no realism here at all. Im up and down the streets, from one end of the map to another and I see the same lady on both sides, just reappear. I feel this is lazy and dumb. 

The detective work, although fresh, really turns into, tail missions, camera missions and really boiled down to it, is really just side missions from the Yakuza games. Many of them are just as ridiculous with no real value to the stories but that was often the case with the Yakuza games so no real change here. Sure there are some tie-ins, but not much. The detective work is super repetitive, and there isnt really a fail, which is fine because in all actuality, by chapter 5-6, most players will have had enough of it. 

Speaking of the tailing missions, sometimes they go on for way too long and then my question, who thought it was a good idea for you to just run behind a corner real fast while the meter goes up and the NPC you are tailing is like, well I guess thats not strange at all! Dumb. 

I think one of my biggest gripes on the game is the studio is just lazy with assets, overusing them to the point that it was like, what in the hell were they thinking or just didnt care. Here's another Yakuza game, we know you'll grind away, and by the way, no quick load, and no Karaoke.",1703308614,1703440139,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Plot wise it was a nice tempo and really liked the chemistry between the various cast members, especially Yagami and Kaito, along with the rest of the new supporting cast.  The storytelling was superb as it was able to weave in back stories through out the narrative, whilst baking in various plot twists given it is a detective/mystery crime thriller.

Combat wise it was definitely a stark difference from mainline Yakuza/Like A Dragon as Yagami is more of a technical fighter rather than a combatant relying just solely on brute force.  The initial fights at the beginning were tough to master, however once more SP skills were unlocked, the combat got noticeably easier which was a relief and interesting growth experience on its own.

Particularly interesting and new are the observation and tailing missions.  I think it certainly fitted in well with the genre and as a first version in the first game I'm fine with it, though I hear from others it might be quite cumbersome.  Hopefully future renditions will fine tune this formula further, but was a good enough immersive experience for me.

Side cases are the sub stories equivalent and have been just as wacky and serious.  I also really like the nice music that complements the overall game play through out the main and side quests.

I also really enjoyed the uniquely new activities such as Drone Racing and Dice & Cube VR, which complemented the modern technology vibe brought about by a younger more tech savvy protagonist.

However, some of the pain points include grinding a fair bit for cash to use in the Kickstarter App and to support unlocking all the SP skills for completion.

I enjoyed this game, I'd rate it a solid 7/10, however the clear abundance of padding from trailing missions to worthless time filling mandatory ""side content"" lowers it to a 6. 

Consider the fact that there's a gamebreaking glitch that will consistently occur unless you have your settings preconfigured a certain way (softlocking you otherwise, and making you lose a good chunk of your time) and you'll understand why [b]my actual score is more like a 5/10[/b].

This is potentially one of RGG studios' best stories outside of Yakuza 2, but the clear need to fill playtime got in the way far too many times. Gone are the days of interesting side missions; in their place are the same trailing and chase missions with absolutely nothing to innovate or engage the player.

I could be persuaded into lowering this score even lower when you consider the fact that the drone mechanic is criminally underused (outside of a dedicated mini-game) despite, if you really thought about it, could invalidate 99% of the risk and challenge of trailing missions (or the fact that there's a disguise system that's ALSO incredibly underused, which is ALSO inaccessible during said trailing missions, where the entire point is to remain undetected and hidden)

If you are a completionist, give this one a miss because you will spend a lot of time if you want to 100% this.  I did all the sidequests/friendships things on normal with a walkthrough for what I couldn't figure out and I think it took me about 70+ hours.  A completionist can probably find another 40 hours. So maybe pick up the game if you are broke?

Other things worth mentioning is that the story is good.  Not as good as Yakuza, but still decent if somewhat predictable.  The mechanics are fun enough and if you liked yakuza kiwami you'll probably like this.  I might come back and do more minigames later, but probably not.

[spoiler] The story is extremely predictable and not interesting unlike the yakuza series. I didnt like the law and detective themes compared to organised crimes themes that presents in yakuza series. the yakuza themes are have a lot of interesting characters and the heavy conflicts between the multiple factions is what I like.
and the protagonist is one dimensional boring general ""good guy"", really made the interest in the story even less.
However, you play RGG games for the ""yakuza gameplay loop"", which is the real attractor for their games. You'll find most of the things you like about yakuza games here with many improvement over previous enteries like the combat, which is really better than 6 and 2 kiwami, and also others improvement and new gameplay segments  [/spoiler]

As soon as I saw the amazing anime style opening of this game, I immediately knew I was in for a ride for something truly special.
Side activities are really fun, the standard Dragon Engine minigames you expect, and more. [spoiler]Drone racing[/spoiler] is significantly more fun than Dragon Kart in Yakuza 7 for sure.
Combat feels very familiar, and at the same time very different from what you're used to by Kiryu in 6 and Kiwami 2. Crane style is not given enough love, but it's nice to see there's something else than Kiryu smash hard. I just wish there were less [spoiler]Kyorei invasions[/spoiler] pestering you for most of the game after a certain chapter.
Technical state of this game is all kinds of weird, textures look rougher in places than Yakuza 3 Remastered, and they also exhibit a lot of color compression banding for some reason. Also lock the game to 60 or 30 FPS max on powerful rigs unless you want to tear your hair out over the thumb tack bypass minigame. No complaints about performance.

The combat in Judge Eyes is very similar to its Yakuza counterparts. Yagami's two fighting styles are similar to Majima’s Breaker and Kiriyu’s Brawler or Dragon’s stances. The cinematics are smooth and filled with tons of action scenes that can get over the top at times, similar to other Yakuza games. When the story slows down, that is where the Ace Attorney-esque side of the game shows. In this part, Yagami has to do investigations, sometimes presenting evidence, or even going into the courtroom as a defense attorney. I only wished this portion was more difficult rather than making the tailing missions long, since they felt redundant at times. Furthermore, Aside from other Yakuza games, doing substories doesn't feel pointless because Yagami is a broke detective looking for work, whether it be for cash or for justice. Substories/side cases don’t feel like a drag to do because there is a sense of purpose behind them. I found this very refreshing for a Yakuza game, because Side Cases didn’t isolate you too much from the story, they were relevant most of the time. Lastly, the casts were very fun this time. While most of the characters have their charm, I really enjoyed seeing Higashi’s character build up since it was easy for me to relate to him.

The interaction is divided between some creative -but easy-, puzzles, and some pretty cool stalking and chase sequences, that never really got old, but when they did, it happened a few times, and it was because they would go on for too long, not because there was anything inherently wrong with them.

Completely separate from the main line titles makes this game easy to jump into for new players not immersed in the universe and the whole design premise of the style switching combat from Yakuza 0, in the funny and slick physics engine already had me sold.

Gameplay - In my opinion the previous entries within this new engine (Yakuza 6, and Kiwami 2) never really fully utilized the crazy tech you would be able to pull off in previous titles, and boiled down to spam punching combos till enemy dies. The previous games were carried by their funny wacky physics of punch guys into space and objects and watch them clip over the place (which not at all makes the those games bad, in fact I enjoyed 6 and its craziest physics). However, during Kiwami 2's collesium side content, some bosses would put me through the mix with unbreakable action moves happening in real time and I wondered how those moves would operate if they were actual techniques you could pull off yourself in game. Well, this game manages that, it gives you tech off the wazoo. You wanna throw yourself off a wall and swing on enemies like a monkey? You can do that. You wanna play hop scotch and reverse suplex enemies into the ground? You can do that. You wanna insta kill blast opponents with a simple open palm move that makes a funny bass noise? You can do that. Hell, remember me talking about those moves in kiwami 2 that bosses pulled on ya? You can actually deploy those moves from extraction potions that you craft and completely alter your fighting style. I haven't even talked about the two main styles you can switch to, and honestly I have already said too much. The best part about the two new styles (crane, and tiger), was figuring out what they do, and where to use them. So ill leave it off there.

Setting - For returning players we see the return of Kamurocho from the eyes of a disgraced lawyer turned small time detective. Now, even halfway through the game I knew that this was one of the best iterations of Kamurocho in the entire series (previous qualifiers were Yakuza 0's time switch, and Yakuza 4's verticality). What makes this Kamurocho so great is the friend's system. Its the best version of previous title's reputation grind, but its actually good this time cuz unlike previous titles where you would do a citizen's rep meter, and would never see them again or hear from them. In this game, you not only see them wandering the streets, you see them aiding you with crafting materials, boosting your EX meter, or aiding you in fights whether with ally heat animations, or tagging along in fights. The new northern part of Kamurocho being the ""Hills Garden"" area was really beautiful and the new areas within the city that makes it easy to traverse thanks to Yagami's parkour god skills, makes carving shortcuts through point A to B, fun. The story was also one of the best this series has to offer, and is carried by the cast of characters you that surround yourself with throughout the game. At the credit screen I was already wanting to jump back into that iconic detective's office that you come love by the end of the game. Its that good.

Mini games - Now I will admit, this is the weakest lineup of mini games within the series. Now does that mean the side content in this game is bad? No. You have your basic mini games that you've come to expect in previous titles like baseball, returning sega arcade games, mahjong, etc. Even with the returning mini games, they manage to spice things up, shogi now has a much needed mini feature of having checkmate problems to solve presented as ""puzzle shogi"" which to me was insanely addicting to solve, along with mahjong getting a whole new parlor named ""Tachibana"" which was mahjong on crack, which was high rated nuts to butts action with the ""wareme"" rule. This game had my favorite sega arcade lineup in awhile simply because of the amount of fun I had with ""Fighting Vipers"" which is now my definitive favorite fighting game ever. Unfortunately no karaoke, that seems to be specific to the mainline titles, but the brand new exclusive mini games to Judgment weren't exciting to me ON PAPER, but ended up being pretty damn fun. Drone racing was a blast, and in my opinion was better than Yakuza 7's dragon kart mini game. Simply because of the deep amount of customization you can apply to your drone and the 3D racing environment giving you more exhilarating, high octane, ball sack quenching moments maneuvering through tight corroders within cafes, and buildings. Finally, we have Paradise VR which is a single player mario party type game that has you avoiding black cats, conquering challenges, and scoring big. This was my main money maker throughout the game and though it did get a little bit boring near endgame with constantly running this mini game for cash it definitely was fresh air from the meta in previous titles which had you just go to the casino or gambling hall to win big and I am thankful nonetheless for the change in scenery.

I haven't had that much fun with a Yakuza game since the first one I played which was Yakuza 0. Def. a must have for people getting into the series or fans who have money to burn.",1701243846,1701467218,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Also, something something gamepad. You really should use one for this title. KB/M controls are fine, but the game is clearly designed with a gamepad in mind.

Judgement is beautiful, and there really is something to be said for RGG creating this entire world that spans multiple games. I am already familiar with Kamorocho from other entries in the Yakuza franchise, but the version of Kamorocho in Judgement is -while being entirely familiar - much larger and more detailed in scope.

I got to be honest with you guys. I would have never thought that this game or the Judgment series in general would ever come to PC (I'll exclude Google Stadia that no longer exist. RIP).

There were some rumors and speculation e.g.: ""Lost Judgment will be the last game in the series due to a disagreement between Sega and Johnny & Associates, the talent agency behind Takayuki Yagami actor Takuya Kimura. The fallout stems from Johnny & Associates not wanting the Judgment games to launch for PC, as it conflicts with its particularly strict likeness policy — essentially, the company doesn’t want Kimura’s face to be so readily accessible on the internet."" (quote from The Gamer, published on Aug 23, 2021).

When I read these articles, my hopes were shattered. Because the game was pretty good. And it would be a shame if the series becomes a lost medium in the future because it's tied to consoles and if the two big companies (Sony and Microsoft) don't support backwards compatibility, you're limited to old hardware. That's why I always write reviews in which I ask for new releases of old games. 

And then there was the day Sega casually dropped a trailer that Judgment and Lost Judgment (+ DLC) were available on Steam. 
You have no clue how happy I was. Just the fact that there's a game on PC that I'm interested in is a reason for me to buy it. 
Hell, even if it was released only on GOG I'd buy it on that platform, as long as it's not available on the Epic Games Store I'm good (EGS is still an empty Fortnite launcher for me).
And if you are complaining about Denuvo, then just wait until Sega remove it. I hope that they will not delist Judgment and Lost Judgment because of the quote (about those rumors and speculation) above. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now, with all that being said, let me tell you how the game was for me.
The gameplay, story mode, cutscenes, etc are great. Especially the action sequences. It feels like I'm watching a Hongkong martial arts movie with noir vibe. XD

I almost forgot that Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio is a AA studio and not AAA. They are well-known for recycling assets and using the same map again (except for the new games). 
As long as they tell good stories, I have no problem with that.

If you don't like Judgment, you can still play these arcade games: Virtua Fighter 5 Final Showdown, PuyoPuyo, Fantasy Zone, Fighting Vipers, Kamuro of the Dead (similar to House of the Dead), Motor Raid, Space Harrier and Outrun.  So there are many ways to enjoy this game.


Total and a message to Sega:
Sega, I want to thank you again from the bottom of my heart for releasing this game on Steam. This game is now one of my favorite games of all-time. ^^
I really hope that you will release more of your old games on Steam, especially Fist of the North Star: Lost Paradise and Skies of Arcadia. ^^",1699973720,1701154232,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

It works well and the style specific fight tracks make a triumphant return.

The main innovation to the rest of the gameplay is all the investigating you will have to do. While not a puzzle game, looking for clues and connections is satisfiyng - especially in side stories where the mechanic is explored more.

- The story was great, I found it very refreshing to play a detective/lawyer sort of role in the Yakuza/Like a Dragon universe. There were several thrilling moments, plot twists, and classic Yakuza/Like a Dragon humor that made playing this game very enjoyable. There is so much content in this game, despite having 55 hours at the time I completed the main story it still appears I have a lot left to complete in the game. I felt really connected to the characters in the game. 

- The soundtrack once again is amazing. This game has some of my favorite boss themes to date and its final boss theme is ranked as one of my top boss themes in all of the Yakuza/Like a Dragon games so far. The end credit songs were also bangers. 

- This is something that I haven't really commented on other game reviews I've done, but I very much liked the art style of Judgement, especially whatever font was used for chapter introductions and boss battle titles. 

- Combat was really cool as well, I really liked the QTE's that were included in battles and boss battles in this game, they do their job of making you feel cool. I liked the straightforwardness of having two fighting styles, one for controlling crowds and one for more one-on-one fights, and even then you can still branch out skills for each of the fighting styles. 

This is what is at the top of my mind for now, if I think of more to say as I let everything sink in for a bit I will edit the review.

It took a very long time for this to come to PC and it was worth the wait. A fantastic in deep story viewing Kamurocho from another perspective and a ridiculous amount of side content which continues the RGG trend of being incredibly creative and hilarious. 

The combats pretty good but having two styles instead of three from the Yakuza games means you might enjoy this less. I personally liked the two styles, one is for crowd control and the other for quicker movements focused on a single enemy. 

heat system is much better in this because you get six charges at once instead of one so you can trigger heat moves with objects or the environment a lot more often, the pc version also comes with a bunch of items to refill your heat and health also. 

The main cast works really well together, the villains are terrifying and excude pressure in any scene they are in, the mo cap actors smashed it out of the park with this, the tiny movements in the faces at times add more depth to the characters which is rare to see.

Only down side is the tailing missions, theres quite a lot of them to do and if you have played the old AC games you know what they are and hate them like everyone else.

Finally, the main story is not some over-the-top nonsense, but is very well written from the beginning to the end.
The new protagonist and the new cast is also very likeable, although some of them have less screentime than I would have liked.

Gameplay wise, it's a good old Yakuza game: Kamurocho, real time fighting, looney side quests (which are not just ""randomly"" pops up), LOTS of minigames, skill system, etc. Also, this time there is a dating ""minigame"", which is kinda OK, but their stories were the most interesting part for me.

There are only a few cons for me:
- The Keihin gang. It's a good way to gather SP/grind, but it's randomly triggers, while you're in the middle of something, and it's getting rather frustrating after a (short) while. Also, it's neverending, you gotta fight them till the very end of the game, you can never win, which also adds to its irritating nature.

[h3] The Combat [/h3]

I played this game straight after Yakuza 6 [i] (I completed Y:LAD) [/i], and despite the game releasing in the next 2 years [i] (1 Year when Kiwami 2 came out) [/i] it has a really polished combat system. Yakuza 6 suffered from the unpolished combat system, since it was a new engine; while, Yakuza Kiwami 2 suffered by making Kiryu a [b] GOD [/b] by making his Heat Actions deal damage equivalent to the power of a Sun. Judgement marks the return [i] (For now) [/i] of combat styles, and one of them is clearly superior than the other. The Tiger Style is supposed to be focused against one to one fights, and its many style specific abilities show that. The Tiger Style's Flux Fissure ability makes every enemy a joke because, Flux Fissure does a stupid amount of damage, and give around 2 heat bars. The Crane Style is an okay style since the only problem of Crane is that it does not have any style specific abilities. Both styles still have ""launchers"" to start juggling, and it usually is 4 light attacks followed by 1-2 heavy attacks. The juggling in Judgement is not that insane compared to Lost Judgement. Another thing that both styles have is the ability to perfect block, Tiger Style has a perfect block that can be followed by 3 options: Light Attack Launcher, Heavy Attack ""get off me"", and Flux Fissure; while the Crane Style has its perfect block become a dodge combined combined with a light attack. Extreme Heat is still here, and it is VERY BROKEN. Extreme Heat allows you to become fully invincible to ALL attacks, and gain access to EX-Heat Actions which can be broken. Tiger's EX Heat Action is focused on one target; whilst, Crane's EX Heat Action can hit multiple targets (Up to 3). Overall, Judgement's Combat is EXTREMELY good.

[h3] The Prologue (Spoiler-Free) [/h3]

Judgement's story follows Yagami, a Lawyer turned Private Investigator, and his friend Kaito, an ex-Yakuza turned Private Investigator. The game starts off with a flashback to a younger Yagami who is a Lawyer for the Genda Law office. Yagami had recently defended a client named Okubo in a murder case of a dementia ridden patient named Waku in the Advanced Drug Center (ADC). Okubo had a ton of evidence against him due to his job at the ADC (Laundry duty), his past violence due to being somewhat of an alcoholic, the fact that the body was dumped inside Okubo's truck, and the fact that he buried the body. Yagami won this case, and Okubo was set free; however, trouble returns since the Genda Law Office received a phone call about Okubo murdering Emi, a nurse who ""helped defend"" Okubo in the trial and his girlfriend; which Yagami does not believe is true. In this murder case, Okubo had a ton of evidence against him. Okubo, despite being sober for the past years, was intoxicated at the time of the murder, and his clothes were all bloody. The defense was not successful this time, and Okubo was sentenced to death and transferred to a detention center to be held until the day he will get executed. Yagami's reputation gets tarnished since he had defended a murder; and because of that, Yagami quits being a Lawyer. Yagami soon becomes a private investigator with his own office to escape from the guilt of defending a murder. This brief prologue sets up the story, and events of Judgement since pretty much everything is connected into a web of conspiracy. Yagami ventures out to seek the truth to find the true killer... to find the elusive Mole.

[h3] The ""not really good things"" [/h3]

This section is just a rant of a few things that I do not like in Judgement.
[list]
[*] [b] Tailing Missions [/b], these get old very quickly. Its just walking around the streets following a dude slowly for 5 minutes offering really nothing to value. Side cases are filled with these.
[*] [b] Some Investigations [/b], most investigations are fine; however, some investigations require you to look at a specific thing first before spotting an obvious clue.
[*] [b] Lockpicking sometimes [/b], sometimes the locks are very easy and have a decent window to get them correct, others don't, and I hate those.
[*] [b] Mandatory Side cases [/b], some are usually okay; however, it gets annoying really quickly when I want to focus on the main cases. 
[/list]

Overall, Judgement really goes above and beyond a regular old Yakuza game's story, and combat (Though, some Yakuza stories, and combat could be better). I really recommend this game to anyone since, it only takes the settings (Time period, Clans, etc) of the Yakuza Series. The combat is refined, and the story is very good.",1696029829,1698102048,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

It should also be advised that the user should have a pretty expensive/accurate game-pad to play with.

The constant negative talk on safe openings is VERY annoying and makes me hate it.
The creators also went WAY overboard on the number of encounters that one must face when walking down the street. As you can not run in the game, or even take more than 10 steps or so before you are bombarded with some 'gang' that never seems to vanish.

    [*]Very widespread cast of characters and factions that are all story distinct and have their own motives, main cast and supporting characters are all intertwined nicely into the events of the game
    [*]Story is very mysterious and although appears to be linear at first expands very quickly into many moving parts bringing context from other cases and shedding new light to the past to push the investigations forward
    [*]Side cases are substories but through a more formal channels and requests.  Its enjoyable to see side content tackled from a detective's perspective
    [*]New minigames such as drone racing and virtual reality are very enjoyable additions
    [*]Can display anime figures and gacha prizes in the office

    [*]Higashi screentime
    [*]This game loves Mahjong: 3 parlors, challenges, a secret high rate table; not necessarily a con but is it a grind
    [*]No way to disable tutorial/help popups
    [*]Keihin gang and threat levels can occur too frequently causing interference with the player's current task
    [*]Cannot wear disguises outside of investigations, wasted potential that could have been expanded on in premium adventure mode
    [*]So many EX actions (heat actions) but difficult to execute and enjoy them due to no weapon system or lack of weapon variety in the city
    [*]Would have wanted an ADDC drone race course, the map is very detailed and only gets use for the story

I have only played Yakuza – Like a Dragon, and the two games are similar in general, however, I would say Judgment is more mature with a more solid story line. Whereas Like a Dragon was goofier.

So in Judgment, you mostly spend your time in Kamurocho city working as a detective where you can do lots of things. Main story line, side quests, eat food at different restaurants which looks delicious, date girls, fly a drone and participate in competitions, play old Sega games and beat up some thugs.

There is no “leveling up“, but rather you can unlock skills, gain allies that roam the street which will help you beat up the bad guys, and some items/buffs that will help you along the way.

I was wondering how this would feel, without the strong personalities of the mainline games' protagonists. Instead, you play a pretty boy in skinny jeans, but Yagami feels like a natural fit in the setting, and is interesting for a totally different reason than Kiryu and company.

The narrative here almost feels like a throwback to the neo-noir of Yakuza 4, but, at least so far, the story hasn't taken a big wet turd on itself (if you know, you know). Instead, it's a broody, sometimes shocking story filled with tension, surprise, and intrigue. The investigation stuff is pretty linear, in the style of a Danganrompa or Ace Attorney game, but the linearity doesn't really matter once you let it sweep you up. And while the tailing missions are a chore (yeah, I get why every review complains about them), they're also a great way to slow down the pace, get you to focus in a different way. 

If you played any other Dragon Engine game set in Tokyo (Yakuza 6, Kiwami 2), then you know how the exploration is going to go, and you can guess what minigames from earlier in the series return (mahjong, shogi, casino stuff), and which ones are still gone (bowling, we miss you). 

Add to that familiar stuff the new experiences of piloting a drone around, a slightly more fleshed out friendship system, the revamping of heat into the not-quite-exactly-the-same EX system, and the whole new cast, main and supporting, and this is a great addition if you're a fan of RGG's other games, as well as a wonderful entry point into the cracked-mirror version of Kabukicho that RGG has been building for the last two decades. Thumbs way up. I'm only in chapter 5, and it's already captivating.

Edited to add: Oh, right, I forgot to mention the English dub, which RGG wasn't really doing prior to this (except Fist of the North Star). It's excellent. Sega and their subsidiaries tend to do great voice casting and direction, and this is no exception. So if the mainline Yakuza series' lack of English VA turned you off, this has that option (but also comes with the Japanese dub as well if you're a purist; the best of both worlds)",1696484718,1696711959,True,10,1,0.642641603946685791,1,True,False,False

+ Less jank than other Dragon Engine games 
+ Lots of AI up scaling option after the fact
+ A low-stake and personal story that's uncovering naturally 
+ A colorful cast that fits into the RGG universe well, very likeable ( Saori is literally wife)
+ Combat refinement from 6, Kiwami and Kiwami 2, and the only other franchise with 'old' combat (7 and 8 are RPG, idk The Man Who Erased His Name gonna be yet)
- If you are Kamuro-cho fatigued then this won't help- it's Kamuro-cho but a bit more and a bit less than other installments
- No Karaoke (VERY BAD)
- So far I can't date Saori nor Mafuyu in-game
- Yagami's detective garbs are dumb- I heard a lot of complaints about his choice of clothes but it could really should be more thoughts put into this
- The Keihin gang's notoriety system is rather monotonous and obtrusive at times
- There weren't any major side characters in the RGG universe mentioned- this is definitely more nit-picky.
- You get punished harder than other RGG games with the mortal wound mechanic and wall interactions are jank af. 
- Did I mentioned the fact that I can't date Saori yet?
- If you hate trailing missions then this won't help either
Overal I'm very satisfied that Judgement is pretty fun, despite being almost just RGG without Kiryu. The fact that I got this and Lost Judgement for only 40 bucks also helps a lot.

On the downside,there are not a lot to say but the tailing missions were really boring as you pretty much do nothing but walk and some times hide behind an object for 5 seconds.Lockpicking and thumbturning were also annoying.That doesnt hold the game back thought since all these detective mechanics rarely appear and you can buy some cheap upgrades with SP to make them a tiny bit better.Lastly as with most of the games in the franchise the completion can get tedious.

I would recommend Judgment to anyone especially to Yakuza,beat em up or crime / mystery fans , the devs keep evolving on every single game and totally delivered with this one.

It pulled me in as much as anime does, the game itself is anime, the intro is anime, and they pull out a bad ass anime style song too. The story is killer, all though it does get a bit slow at times, but it just had a way of pulling me back in. I have enjoyed only a few games this year, Starfield is great, but I also like the Bethesda style of game. Dead Island 2 was fantastic, but it was too short. I can't say, or even think of a better series of games in my life. At this point Ryu Ga Gotoku has become one of the worlds best development studios, They have mastered the entertainment of beat 'em up style games, they have great writing, and every game feels distinct, and different. The ""Twist"" is in the nature of a lot of their games, however they just keep getting better and better at hiding it, and allowing you to be surprised like you'd hope.

Cinematic 9.5 / 10 I think they could've done a bit more with the smoke, but it was so bad ass, probably one of the best, if not the best intro to a game I have ever played, and the best I have ever seen.

Story 8 / 10 it did get slow, but it wasn't slow enough to make me stop, in fact just when it got slow, just when I started to feel like it was bad, suddenly it ripped me back in, it pulled me into the story, the comedy, the writing, and the characters are great.

The Voice Acting 6 / 10 the voices don't really fit the character, and some people kind of make 0 sense speaking english, but it got a lot better as the game went on, to the point that I basically forgot that the voices were weird, the main weird one is the best friend Kaito, his voice is definitely too deep, and strange for the look of his character, however. The main character has to have literally the perfect voice for how he looks, and holds himself. Makes me think they may have even literally made the character after him.

Fighting 8 / 10 its a yakuza / Like a dragon game, of course the fighting is great at this point. The moves feel amazing, but the funnier thing is the extracts you get can kinda just remove fighting.",1695169161,1695670180,True,0,0,0.47826087474822998,0,True,False,False

Completely gripping story keeping you on your toes with great twists and complications. Without turning into some insanely convoluted (but fun) story like some of the mainline games.
After knowing Kiryu, Majima, Ichiban and so many others. It's impressive that the writers can make Yagami and everyone else in this game so lovable.

If you've never played a mainline Yakuza/LaD game, that's okay! You'll see many people compare this to Yakuza (naturally) but it's completely stand-alone with the characters and story. Might miss a reference or two there but nothing important. Also the game has a full English cast as well if Japanese isn't your thing.

It's a detective game with beat em up elements with some GTA-ness in the mix but the story, the story is amazing. It does mystery right by having just enough unknowns for the player to gauge the flow the story but not the details. The details and twists are so well done and very compelling. I love the story so much that I hated the mandatory side cases because I just wanted to know what was going to happen next. 

The mandatory side cases is probably the only issue I have with the game. Fortunately those side cases are short and sprinkled in the beginning to early middle. Theres nothing wrong with the side missions from a gameplay standpoint except they don't relate to the banger of the main story. 

The setting of the game is also high quality. I've been to Japan a couple times and city and atmosphere was very accurate to what I experienced. I loved the attention to detail to various shops, streets, and buildings. 

The minigames included are pretty sick as they are old school style arcade games, darts, casino games, shogi, and drone racing.

Still has that Yakuza flare, with substories (here called side cases) and a shit ton of minigames to try out.

It strikes a balance, delivering complexity and unexpected twists without veering into the labyrinthine territory of some mainline Yakuza titles.

The side quests, an integral part of the Yakuza experience, are also mostly very enjoyable. The sub-stories revolve around Yagami, taking on various detective cases and making you feel like a man with work to do rather than just being a local errand boy. 

While Judgment excels in many areas, it does stumble slightly in its boss fights. These encounters lack the dramatic flair that you might expect from a Yakuza game, and the accompanying soundtracks fail to leave a lasting impression. Nonetheless, it's important to note that Yagami's identity leans more towards that of a detective rather than a brawler, and this aspect is reflected in the gameplay. Sadly, the detective elements suffer from an excessive amount of hand-holding, making them feel less challenging than they could have been.

Overall Judgement is a game with great characters, a great story, and is an entry to the franchise that should not be missed.

Judgment, also known as Judge Eyes, and some other titles, is a spinoff to the yakuza series. If you haven't played the yakuza series, you really should, when I bought my first yakuza game years ago, I started basically non-stop playing more and more yakuza content for hundreds of hours until I ran out. This is that moment. I ran out. All of it was amazing, it reminded me of something that I almost forgot in the modern gaming industry: Games can be good, and full of passion and meaning, videogames can teach you something about life, and they can make you love people that don't even exist. The Judgment spinoff series does the same thing, but from a different perspective.
This game advertises itself as a detective game, just like the sequel ""Lost Judgment"" does. I played Lost Judgement first, for some reason. In Lost Judgment, I felt disappointed with how little thinking it really requires of the player, how many crutches it gives you and how it never, not even once, actually requires you to do any real investigating. Somehow, the first game does this far better. I really enjoyed immersing myself into it.
If you are interested in playing as a guy in a leather jacket who looks scary but has a good heart, and who is also a detective, you should buy this. You might just feel like I did when I started playing yakuza games, you might just get a new perspective on life, all while having a blast playing this game.
Once you're done, maybe you could give the Yakuza/Like a Dragon mainline series a go, too. 

Now, here's a small spoiler unless you've already played the sequel, something of a warning if you, like me, play this after already having played Lost Judgment:
The chase sequences are fucking garbage. Really, they are complete ass. Remember how in Lost Judgment you had these super cool, energetic chase sequences where you had to exhaust the guy you're chasing and then catch them? Well this game has chase sequences too, but it doesn't matter whether you fuck up and run into every single obstacle, or dodge them all. In this game, the guy running from you will slow down and even stop to wait for you if you fall behind, and if you're about to catch up to them, the guy you're chasing will simply speed up. They don't have a stamina bar, and you're not actually required to do anything. Almost every single chase sequence I had encountered during my 57 hours of playing, you didn't have to catch the target. Instead, the chase would just end once the guy you're chasing arrived at a certain position, the game would fade into a cutscene of you catching them. I saw the ""catch"" button prompt exactly once ingame and it didn't even work. Why the fuck??",1694014506,1694014506,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I kept hearing everyone praising this game but it just feels like a chore every time I launch this game now. Of similar games from this studio I only played Yakuza Zero and Kiwami. The combat here does not feel nowhere near as good as it did on those games. 

Side quests are slow and predictable. Then when I thought I could just ignore the boring side content and focus on main story, the main story itself forces me to do side quests. ""Oh X is not around, hey since you got time now do this side quest instead."" It just breaks the flow of the story by forcing you to engage in a far less interesting side story.

But the worst crime this game does right at the beginning is spamming screen wide text box tutorials for such simple things like answering the phone or choosing the right key for a door. How stupid are their play testers that they think these simple button prompts need such tutorials?

Furthest I got in the main story is around chapter 4 or 5. Reading other negative reviews here they all say story is still great. So I guess I'll just watch a youtube story recap instead.",1694014119,1694014119,False,12,1,0.634044051170349121,4,True,False,False

It is also a good place to start, because it is a stand-alone story that is fairly well written, modern and sophisticated. The cutscenes are plentyful and have great cinematography. I also find the voice acting to be very convincing and the overall localisation is top-notch.

This game has a lot of content in form of story missions, side quests and mini games. It is streamlined for those aiming for completion with its KamuroGo app. The missions you do can be very goofy but I believe this entire series of which this is a spin-off to manages its tonal shifts superply well.

Some things I don't think are particularly strong include the key chain, tailing missions, looking around to find hot spots, lockpicking, putting on costumes (but only if the story needs it) and minor stuff like that. I totally get that they enhance the notion of you being a detective and that they help with the overall pacing, but I don't find them very engaging.

The iteration of Kamurocho in this game is densely packed with detail and life, but somehow this micro-cosmos feels a little small. If only there were more locations. There's no rooftop or underground passage. To be honest, there isn't all that much you can do to screw around. Having played Yakuza 4 before as my introduction to the series, I'm missing several activities. You do have the opportunity to go to the arcades and enjoy some Sega classics, play Darts, Mahjong (in three different places), Shogi, traditional asian gambling (but only two), Poker, Black Jack, Drone Racing (which is a big one), go to the batting center and into VR (which is a recontextualization of everything you do otherwise). That list may seem extensive, but it is only half the stuff you could do in other games. Most of these things get introduced over time, so you need to advance the story considerbly to gain access to everything. But it's not like you ever run out of things to do. 

Also, I would have prefered if you had more to spend your items on. Once you are done with your drone and its upgrades, you only have brewing extracts left, which isn't all that useful, because this game isn't very difficult and the game grants you some overpowered ones that aren't consumed upon usage. At no point are you able to craft weapons or even have any outside combat unless an opponent brought one. It's good that you have no inventory restrictions, so no back and forth to move objects. But you also have no equipment whatsoever to adjust your playstyle.

Some things I, personally, had some gripes with are the controls, for one thing. I swear, half of the time I performed an EX action was by accident, because it's the same button as the strong attack. I constantly bumbed into walls because the prompt to open a door didn't show up in time. Doing the thumb turn bypass with the controller is next to impossible, unless it's brand new. I had to disconnect my controller in VR everytime I had to open a safe, which made me avoid those spaces. Same goes for baseball and darts. You need to play all that with a mouse. I also hate the fact, that you cannot reload from within the game and have to return to the title screen and then reconfirm everything multiple times. But I guess then it would be easier to cheat, because you can save almost anywhere at any time.

I don't think any one part of this whole game is bad. It just isn't perfect is all. The combat is still very satisfying, because of all that brutal stuff you can pull off. The graphics are great. The characters are well defined and memorable. The plot is a little hard to follow, but you can always look stuff up should you need to. This is a mature game with an intricate story and some dark themes, but it also has a cornucopia of ways to dissolve the tension and get you lost and immersed in this colorful world.",1693504178,1693520942,True,2,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False

If you've played the mainline games and have not played this yet, I think you would enjoy the familiar setting, but with a fresh take on the gameplay and story.
The gameplay is the usual beat-em-up/action/fighting from the main line series and if you enjoy that type of gameplay, I don't you would have a lot of problem with this game either. Also, the addition of new non-combat overworld gameplay(drones, lockpicking, tailing suspects, scene investigations, etc.) was very refreshing because you can see how a detective would approach problems in Kamurocho, unlike how our mainline protagonists solves their problems.

I haven't played 7 and Lost Judgment at the time of writing this review but, I think the story was by far one of the best in the series. Pacing of the story was a bit slow at the very beginning, but overall great. Not that I'm saying the others were bad but, I was probably engaged with the story the most in this game compared to the other previous games in the series. It is probably because of how they went full mystery/detective with the story and characters which allowed everything to fit in place considering the characters' limitation as people that not from the yakuza side.

Too bad the game that story is attached to is intensely irritating and only sporadically fun. The characters and plot make it worth slogging through, but it's tough recommending a 50+ hour game that pisses you off so regularly. 
The plot is easily the best part of this game, and it would be criminal to spoil any of it. Whereas the mainline series could be described as crime thrillers, Judgement is a hard-boiled detective mystery. The central murder mystery is well developed, the reveals expertly paced, and it's mostly free of the series' more wacky contrivances. Yagami is a fantastic main character, and he's surrounded by a supporting cast that play off him in ways that are almost always entertaining. The villains are equally great, and the game deftly achieves a rare balancing act of humanizing them without excusing their crimes. The game is very timely in its indictment of deluded glory seekers who betray their principles in the name of ""the greater good"". 
I wish I could leave it at that and give this one a solid recommend, but that would be ignoring all the ways this game disappointed and infuriated me. Lets start off with the game world: Kamurocho. That's it. That's all you get here. The same city I've explored top to bottom in over half a dozen games in the last fifteen years. If you were to ask me what has changed or been added since Kiwami 2, I couldn't tell you. Mainline games in this series usually add at least one additional location to at least give the appearance they aren't simply copy-pasting the same map over and over again, but Judgement dispenses with all pretense and does just that. It's a very nice city, and still one of the densest, most vibrant open worlds ever created, but it's not enough to carry an entire game anymore, especially when we've already seen every inch of it too many times before. It doesn't help that the amount of side content seems parred back as well. You can play Darts, a couple of arcade games, or participate in races with Yagami's drone. There is no karaoke, billiards, dancing, hostess clubs, or business management. Instead, Yagami takes on cases as a detective, which can involve two kinda neat lock picking minigames, a passable photo minigame, and easily the most godawful trailing missions I have ever experienced in a videogame. The trailing missions are easily the worst part of this game, and they unfortunately account for the majority of the detective work in side-cases. 
The core combat is interesting and kinda fun, but is completely undermined by bizarre and awful design decisions. Yagami has two fighting styles, tiger and crane, but you may as well go ahead and ignore crane, the developers pretty much did too. The overwhelming majority of upgrades and useful techniques only seem to apply to tiger stance, and by the halfway point crane just wasn't reliable or versatile enough to keep using. The fundamental move-set is cool, but the problem is Yagami's standard combo bounces right off of almost half the games enemies. In fact, enemies are extremely erratic in how they respond to your attacks. Sometimes they eat a full combo, other times they spin around 180 degrees in a fraction of a second to block your attacks, and yet other times still they will ice skate across the floor at warp speed to avoid a hit and circle around behind you. If you happen to commit to a combo and make it halfway through, the enemy can simply activate super armor, declare ""mom says it's my turn to combo"", and melt your health bar with a super-move Yagami isn't responsive enough to avoid. To be fair you are given a lot of tools to compensate for how unreliable basic brawling is in this game, but it doesn't do much to make the core experience more fun. It also doesn't help that the game rams combat down your throat with a chimney sweep brush due to the gang system. Are you enjoying hanging out in the world, completing side stories, playing arcade games, or doing literally anything else? Too bad, here's another text from Kim demanding you go beat up the same four gang leaders for the fifth time this chapter alone. You can ignore it, but you're gonna get jumped every 10 steps you take until you lower the ""threat level"". If I could have stuffed Kim in a dumpster and been done with these awful encounters for good, I would have done it without hesitation.
One thing I'm getting sick of more than everything else in this series is the bizarrely awful progression. Did anyone else play Like a Dragon Isshin this year? Remember the stupid chicken racing mini game, and how it was the only viable way to get the resources you needed to strengthen your character? This game does the same damn thing, only this time it's a VR board game. If the game is going to force me to fight random goon squads every five minutes, why do the majority of them reward me with 0 yen and barely any skill points when you win? Why do I have to grind a tedious mini-game for hours so I can afford the SP boosting items necessary to buy the ludicrously expensive core skill upgrades that make combat more bearable? And speaking of skill upgrades, why are so many essential abilities hidden in skill books that can only be found in arbitrary, nonsensical locations? Fail to investigate a particular mini game or side case completely? Hope you won't miss that essential ability that charges your heat gauge faster! I don't know why the developers balance things this way, but it's become a series trademark at this point, and I'm sad to say I'm finally getting fed up with it.
If you actually read all that, you're probably surprised I still recommend this game. Is the story that good? Yes, it is. But only just. Pick this one up on a sale or if you're new to the series. I was planning to play Yakuza 7 or Lost Judgement next, but I'm tapped out on this series for now. Maybe next year.",1692425712,1692425712,True,1,0,0.5,0,True,False,False

I haven't played any Yakuza game other than Like a Dragon - the only one dubbed in English, which due to my vision is a must for me. After experiencing this story, I know I'm missing out. Seriously a fantastic mystery involving organised crime, political intreague, conspiracies - multiple - and a genuine medical issue which is just as bad in game as in reality. There's good and bad, but there's also a ton of grey. Highly recommend for the story and characters, plus a really good dub for nearly the entire main story.


My only issues stem from just how much side content this game has - and that's very much a matter of opinion. over 100 sidequests - Friends, side cases and other activities mean you'll have a TON to do. I only completed a portion of the side content, which among Yakuza enthusiasts instantly makes this review a farce. It wasn't that the side stories weren't interesting. There were simply too many of them, and they often involved visiting a marker multiple times after enough time has passed, or slowly traversing the map - more on that later. They merely served as distractions from the fascinating main story. They also weren't voiced, which for me is always unfortunate. Still, if you like your serious stories with a heaping helping of bite sized narrative heavy distractions - as I usually do - you'll be happy.

My only other gripes are more nitpicky. There are taxis which you can use to fast travel, and more than enough drop off spots to make getting around a breeze. But there are only a handful of pickup spots which mean lots of walking. Granted it doesn't take a long time to get from one end of the map to another, but when you have to do it over and over like a blind bull in a busy street it really adds up. I caused more pretend property damage just wandering around than during all but the most hectic fights. Couple that with being able to collide with literally everything and it can make for an amuzing - though time consuming tour of the streets. A character even comments on it in a late portion of the game in a section which had me laughing out loud.

Finally, the tailing sections. I hope I never meet another one. I get their purpose - you're a detective after all - but it's so easy to get spotted, and just as easy to lose your mark when they turn down a side path or get lost in the crowd. If  they had kept the minimap at that point it would have really helped. Less immersive/realistic, but sometimes that's okay.

Story is set up really stupid. Not sure if we are to assume if he's stupid for believing the guy was innocent or is a bad person. They never reference the crime that he defended against I don't believe until the accused is titled a ""serial killer"" in present day. Two people isn't serial killer. Must mean he was one at the prosecution your character helped him with. Murder man is then referred as just a murdurer later prior to the prosecution. Yes, a murdurer is possible but he was still labeled serial killer. And don't bring that bullshit of Hamura trying to be a dick or he misspoke. 

The story then ends in present day where your character is a detective and then breaks so many laws by starting unwarranted fights and threatening people. But what do I know, I'm not a stupid lawyer. Laying a hand on someone or threatening violence allows them to fight with cause. 

Later they throw 18 years of exposution over and over in the most unnatural way. 

Oh and apparently the game logic is changing where Hamura is arrested because they just want to pin it on someone and are saying the other murders aren't connected. And then saying the only reason they can pin it on him because they are all connected.

-------------------------------------------------------------
I came to this game off of playing LaD Ishin, prioritising to play this game rather than the mainline yakuza games as its newer and the detective part of it intruiging me.
I have not been disappointed. The Story alone makes it worth as its actually movie level. Even If you really dont care about the gameplay I would recommend the game to you purely for the cutscenes and the story elements.
As for the gameplay, its decent and a good alternative to for example Yakuza 7 which took the combat in another direction. This game stays true to what yakuza normally is and improves upon it. There are only 2 stances you can have in the game but they're both really cool and as per usual very upgradeable.
The Side content is plentiful and varied. It wouldnt be a Yakuza game if it wasnt also a tiny bit unhinged in certain moments.
If youre a fan of the series and you havent given this game a chance I recommend you do and if you've been looking at the Yakuza series from the outside for a while I also recommend this to you as the story isnt at all connected to the mainline installations meaning you can play this game carefree and without the fear of missing anything.

The combat, while having its flaws, its enjoyable, and fun for the most part. Beating enemies while you style on them with flashy and powerful moves, while you break enviroments with their faces never gets old. The music is great, it immerses you into the situations that you are dealing with. From beating the ass of a yakuza on the street, to beating the ass of a prosecutor in court. The ""weakest"" aspect of the game would be the side stories. Some of them are hit or miss, depending on what you are looking for, and the game even forces some of said side stories, if you want to continue with the story, which kind of kills the pace if you ask me. The game also offers a lot of minigames, such as: Drone races, a Mario Party-like game, mahjong (idk why you would unironically want to play this), darts, and some others that I can't think of rn.

This game has a few major flaws that nearly spoil the entire experience for me. Compared to the mainline Yakuza games, I'd say it has some catching up to do. 

1. The biggest flaw is the God-awful ""wound"" system. Whoever cooked this nightmare up needs to be demoted to janitor. I cannot even begin to imagine what possessed RGS to ship this abomination into the main game. All it does is make the game a huge pain in the ass and makes you waste hundreds of thousands of yen. Which leads me to my second point...
2. Getting yen is very inconsistent in this game, and it's way too stingy with recovery items. 
3. Heat generation is way, way too slow unless you chug alcohol or spam Tiger Flux. Most random encounters for me now are me just spaming Tiger Flux or using Tiger Drop.
4. Pacing that whiplashes from ""holy shit I can barely keep up"" to ""I'm literally falling asleep at the wheel"". There's large chunks of filler interspersed with amazing story and combat, which is just barely enough to keep you going.
5. A lot of the minigames are under-utilized or over-utilized. I am so fucking sick of the trailing minigame. Why did there even have to be a minigame for finding the right key to unlock a door? What purpose does it serve? There's no penalty for getting the wrong key, and you can get a skill for cheap that makes the correct key glow anyway. What's the fuckin' point?
6. The drone is barely used outside of drone racing. 

Despite all that... The game still has that Yakuza charm that keeps bringing me back. I'll finish this game like the others. Apparently Lost Judgement fixes a lot of these issues, so fingers crossed.",1690583016,1690583016,True,0,0,0,0,True,True,False

+Gameplay feels good. Initially battles felt clunky, but as you get more skills, they turn more interesting and fluid. Battles weren't necessarily as good as in Yakuzas, but still really good, especially when most of the random ones can be finished pretty quickly.
+Just like Yakuza games, the characters look really good and the city feels lively. Animation and directing on main story are good, while on side quests they are often simple and low effort, but somehow it's kinda charming how comedic it looks at times.
+Interesting story.
+Alot to do from side quests to mini games, even dating.
+Investigations are fun, looking for clues and presenting evidence.
+Cats everywhere.

Downers
-Theres alot of filler in the main story. It felt that whenever theres some big movement in the main story, you need to spend as much time on completelly unrelated things to advance the story. Often this is for character development, which might have been better as side quests, but there are also points where you need to wait to hear from other characters and the filler is just something to make you feel like you are actually waiting.
-Most of the tailing sequences are pretty boring. There are some that are more interesting later on, but mostly they are a pretty dull. Points where you are able to hide are pretty specific, so how you handle the tailing feels pretty scripted.
-Chase sequences. All of them, and theres quite alot. Chases are basicly just QTE and they tend to follow same patterns, have a group on the right, followed by group on the left, finish with fallen bike, on to next segment, rinse and repeat. I personally feel QTE is lazy game design, and this is nothing but that.
-Kim. He is merely the harbinger of pain, but every single text message makes me hate him more.
-Side cases are locked behind community level, and to raise that, you need to make friends. The cases open every 5 levels, so you will be spending alot of time doing friend events, of which most are talk, go away, come back, type things or fetch quests. There are some fun and interesting ones, but most are pretty mundane, and few are downright grind (Ebisu, Batting center, Extract guy, Mahjong. Thank god shogi wasn't on the list). Worst part is spending an hour getting the community level up to unlock a new side case, which might take just 5 minutes to complete. Getting all 50 friends isn't huge undertaking in the end, especially if you use guide for the grindy ones, but still it feels kinda unbalanced what you get for the effort.
-Mortal wound system and guns. They are kinda cheap shots to chip away your max health, they don't take much, but it's annoying regardless.",1690224578,1690535748,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

While they are mostly known for the Yakuza series, you should highly consider playing it if you liked the Yakuzas. While there are similarities between the two IPs, such as Kamurocho or the presence of the Tojo clan, they are also very different, so you don't feel like you're playing another Yakuza.

The story was amazingly well-written, and got me hooked from the beginning to the very end. Rather easy to follow, while still being elaborate, but never far-fetched. It makes you truly feel like a detective trying to assemble puzzle pieces. All characters have a deep story that doesn't feel made up, making you appreciate how every single one of them is written.

The combat is very satisfying. It's smooth and diverse, with Yagami's two different battle styles. Sheer force has been traded for agility, which gives some spectacular street fighting. The heat actions are beautiful and there are plenty of them. Acquiring various skills will make it all the more satisfying.

The music is fantastic. It never feels repetitive, far from it. Everything got its own theme, and before you know, you get to listen to them even when not playing the game.

The game itself is very beautiful, and fluid, thanks to the FSR. Also, even if I played most of the game with JP voices, the English voices felt very ""natural"" and well done.

Outside the main story, we get to see more classic RGG content. The sides stories (friend events) are funny and silly, and the sides ""missions"" (side cases) involves different kinds of mechanics making them diverse. Minigames are cool as well, I really liked drone racing and dice&cube.

However, I did notice a couple of flaws, that altered the overall experience:
- The Keihin gang mechanic becomes more and more annoying in the long run. At some point, it feels like you just know they are going to spawn anytime soon. They also have some of the worst enemies in the game (in my opinion)
- The mortal wounds mechanic is interesting, but can be frustrating considering the punishment can be quite harsh if you just happen to be unprepared.

There are also some less noticeable things that, albeit not as infuriating/annoying as what I mentionned before, can still be a little disappointing. For instance, there were a little too many tailing missions while not so much for the other mechanics. While on the topic of tailing, I kind of wished that it could have offered a little more challenge.

Overall, it's an incredible game worth its price (although I bought in on sale), with a masterful main story and side content. On sale, it's a steal!",1690464496,1690464496,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

After getting to the point in the story where you unlock Essence Concoctions all Heat Actions have an extremely high chance of flat out crashing the game, and at worst making the Steam Deck restart itself. No amount of graphical settings seemed to make this problem less prominent. The Heat Action where you use it on an enemy on the ground to make Yagami kick them off the ground and into the air is the worst one which crashes 9/10 times, with the only times it doesn't seemingly have no logic to it. I use this Heat Action often in Judgement, so I can definitely say it was working fine up until that point where the game does a mini-tutorial on how Essences worked.

I know it's not anything to do with a corrupted saved game or anything on my end because I swapped over to my PC and ran it there and I spent an hour or so doing as many Heat Actions as possible and not a single one had any crashes or issues with the same save file and everything. Then I go back to it on Steam Deck and it goes back to crashing frequently on using Heat Actions, especially the basic kick one. So this makes Judgement on Steam Deck unplayable for me because even if I don't use any Heat Actions, boss battles that are required to fight in the story force you into scripted Heat Actions, and there's no guarantee if those will crash on me or not. That sucks a lot because I bought Judgement and its sequels specifically to play on my Steam Deck, and them having the Verified by Steam would mean they work.

Judgement might be an amazing game, but a massive Buyer Beware * on this game, especially if you are wanting to buy this specifically on a Steam Deck. Especially since this game-breaking bug was introduced to me 20 hours into the game which for other buyers translates to no easy refund. This game is by no means a safe ""Steam Deck Verified"" purchase, and if Valve happens to chance upon this review definitely change that at least until RGG patches stuff like this, because with stuff like this the game isn't even Playable status.

If RGG happens to fix this I'll happily change my review, but as of right now the game is unplayable to me on what I was advertised to it would work on.",1690411797,1690411797,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

I'm almost happy the series died due to licensing, because I really do feel like this series could not pick up the brawler crown from LAD6 after LAD7 went turn based.

You can really feel how uncomfortable RGG felt spinning multiple plates. It tries to mesh the usual serious yakuza story, the silly side stuff, the yakuza combat, and a detective game all into one. But because of the split vision, all the elements feel extremely lacking. Especially the detective elements. Maybe I just play way too many detective/puzzling games (play Paradise Killer btw), but I literally never presented a wrong piece of evidence, never asked a wrong question, and knew all of the games ""plot twists"" like 3 chapters before they were revealed. 

The combat in particular was a huge disappointment. Fatal wounds are stupid, and make guns/bosses more annoying than they already are. And I don't think I ever used Crane combat outside of the tutorial. Tiger is just better. And the usual yakuza side stuff is extremely lacking compared to even Dragon Engine games that came before it. Having to dress up the lawyer girl was fun, but that little section just REALLY made me want to replay Kiwami 2 or 0 again. 

If you want more of Kamurocho, this will suffice. But I'd rather just replay a mainline game. Hopefully Lost Judgement is better, (whenever it goes on good sale)

It didn't disappoint me. I certainly felt there was some weaknesses but there weren't numerous. 

For me, the Drone race was not interesting. It's not something I enjoyed. And so the OG SEGA arcade game or for me the arcade itself, which was a copy-paste of Yakuza felt lukewarm at best. Each game they produce have the 1 thing that helps you produce the much needs money. Casino is up there but in this game it's the VR Game which is essentially a game of cat and mice in with a parkour you ultimately wanna finish with as much rewards as possible which produces a ton of money. The investment app was a fun way to unlock unique abilities/side mission/ items. 

So overall those things makes it feels like a proper unique game from of my favourite studio. The same thing can be said to the structure of Friends and Side Cases which add unique side stories, good way to make money and add some helpers that helps you get aggro from the street gangs you fight. 

 The main story is basically related to the Fate of the Yagami. It's difficult to not give spoiler but it's a thriller drame with lot of amazing cutscene, good side characters that are rich in back stories and that you love to get to know. The vilains are never one dimensional and have complex layers of story to explain why they are acting like they are. They are never absolutely evil - at least for the most part. It does take a stand against corruption and how deep it sinks in Japanese culture. I thought this was very interesting 

I would recommend, I cleared it with much ease with some decent but not excessive grinding in just over 100 hours. I feel if you focus on unlocking the skills by chapter 6 it gets much easier to get bigger fights with higher Exp and the main story itself it nowhere close to be enough to unlock the skills within rushing the main story. I do feel it could add a much higher level of difficulty as you're much weaker. 

In the last chapter finale, I feel this studio has been mostly hit or miss with games I've played. E.I. a most boss have 2 phases where you'll clear the first 50% in zero effort. at first you're familiarising yourself with the combat engine, clearly a CC: of Yakuza, so you kind of get some cheeky tricks that breaks any level of difficulty- Increasing your Heat Gauge, Using a Special combo when your have something in your hand that activate a mini infight cutscene that inflicts massive damage.

So yeah, at the last fight, you get the boss fight pissed off, he goes hard on you, you run, pick up something and when close enough, juke him with zero effort, rinse and repeat and you clear the last fight with like almost getting untouched. 

One last thing I don't like from this game is that you need to grind a little if you're doing all the side quest, friend quest, drone races, gamba/shogi/other japanese traditional gamba to get some prices to unlock the good stuff ... you finish the game and you have the legendary difficulty and other new game adventure type you can play. I think it would be fun to have legendary difficulty unlock a lot more. You barely use healing during fight. It's so easy.",1690171867,1690171867,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

One minor thing that I really dislike is the tailing mechanic & mortal wounds get really tedious late game. Other than that, one of the best in the series.",1690084189,1690084452,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Just go and play Yakuza 0. 
It is still a game from RGG Studio, with interesting lively characters and stories. But I couldn't overcome a gameplay:
- it is still the same Kamurocho I've seen many times in Yakuza games.  It feels like you spend half of a game just running around town. And with a lot of running back and forth, it's a hell of a boring.
- fighting doesn't feel responsive and brutal. (It feels like Witcher 1 gameplay, you press 1 button and the character makes moves. It is a clicker gameplay, not a brawler)

- Tailing missions are VERY tedious and there's at least 30 of them (main story+side content)
- Keihin gang stuff gets really annoying in the endgame, especially if you're not going for the 100%. And defeating Koga (one of the most annoying bosses in the game) or any of the other gang bosses gets you as many rewards as beating some random thugs in the street 🤡.
- Crane Style is pretty much useless against bosses and very bad against normal enemies
- No Karaoke
- Mortal Wounds is a terrible mechanic

That being said, it's still a amazing game. Substories are hilarious and well done (for the most part), story is very well written (probably the best one RGG has made yet), doesnt have the usual dumb plot twists some of the Yakuza games have. OST is very, very good.
I didn't run into any bugs, crashes or stutters in 130ish hours of gameplay and it kept a steady framerate of 120 most of the time.

(just barely under Yakuza 0) The story is top notch featuring a very charming cast with memorable personalities and great moments. The combat has also been a step up in comparison to the previous dragon engine game before this one, that being Yakuza Kiwami 2. Despite having an amazing combat system as is, Judgment tops it by restoring styles, a feature that was sorely missed for me. Although the game houses only two styles, the mechanics they bring make up for it. Quality over Quantity as they say. Admittedly I wasn't the biggest fan at fist due to tiger styles slow attack speed and crane style bouncing off enemies if they block. However, I learned that this game is more technical then all out brawl like Yakuza, which I found to be more enjoyable that the series. (plus you can upgrade combo speed thank god) On top of that the game boasts a juggle system, which is always welcome as an avid action game fan. Besides the story and great combat, Judgment gives the player an enormous amount of side content as RGG is known for. My first playthrough took me 74 hours to complete as I got distracted by the many minigames and side cases.

However, personally I didn't like the money farming mechanic, where you need to either gain Play Passes to play Paradise VR or you need to make Free Pass which is cost a lot, in Yakuza 0 there were much better money farming situation, though Paradise VR as a mini-game itself is quite good, just needed to change this condition with Free Pass in my opinion.

Along the way, with the support of a large variety of characters and in typical RGG fashion, his sleuthing reveals that the reason behind the killings isn't as simple as originally thought.

The game is honestly a 10/10 in the body of an 8/10. The story is fantastic, characters are all equally as fantastic, and this is the best the city has looked so far. However, the game has several fundamental issues that drag the score down. Combat is a big mixed bag for me. When you first start the game, the combat is likely the second least enjoyable in the series just under Yakuza 3. It is significantly improved with upgrades to speed and EX moves, but that takes several hours to finally collect. OST wasn't as impactful as some from the prior games, but I did like a lot of the jazzy detective beats. 

The general story as a whole has some issues. Funny enough, it has the same issues Yakuza 3 had. The main story is very, very intriguing, but the devs have no scruples in completely veering you off course to force you to do some other side story out of the blue. Say, you’re trying to get ready to hunt a certain character down, but the devs randomly force you to figure out who ate the cake in the fridge first. These side stories are very well written, but it definitely puts the brakes on the main story’s momentum. And that happens many times throughout the game. Just like in Yakuza 3 with the orphanage sections -  being forced to do them is more tedious than anything. And it doesn't help that the game heavily reuses the tailing and chase sequences for these as well as other side cases. On their own, these sequences are pretty enjoyable. However, by the end of the game, you’ll likely end up doing them all together for dozens of times. By then, they became eye-rolling.

So, issues with combat, mission structure, and the pacing of the main plot sort of drag the overall experience down. Still, the game kicks a ton of ass.",1688872032,1688872032,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

God help me, I'm never buying another RGG game in my life. Every single time I go in with my expectations on the floor in terms of mechanics, and every time the game stomps them into the tiles to get them just a bit lower than I thought was possible. How is it that a studio that has been around this long has never made a beat-em-up system that's even half as good as something like the Batman or AC games? Those aren't even that good, they're just simple, but this is both SIMPLE and CLUNKY at the same time. 

If you want the combat to have weight and commitment, it needs to be consistent so the player can make good choices. If you want the combat to be skill-based, it needs to be responsive and feel good to use or else nobody is going to want to play it. These are simple ideas that nearly every game studio understands, but apparently not RGG.

Judgment's combat doesn't understand any of this. Yagami takes inputs more like suggestions half the time and his slow action speed paradoxically makes avoiding mashing very hard. Hitting the buttons too slowly will interrupt your combo, but hitting them too fast will end up queuing more attacks than you intended if you want to play technically, so the best option is just to mash and build your basic strategy around that. Worse still, Judgment eats inputs sometimes, killing the responsiveness. One of the first upgrades to cancel a combo with a dash barely functions at all because it only works at specific timings that are probably very tight based on what I experienced in my hour of play.

I get why Y0 was a bit clunky, the engine was old, but this is not an old engine. Yet, it's even worse than Y0, and I returned Y0 because the combat was bad. I dunno man, I want to like these games. On paper, they sound like games I would like. However in practice, every time I've played one of RGG's games my only takeaways have been shock at their mechanical incompetence and disappointment at the wasted potential.

I'm starting my review to say please do not skip Judgment. For some reason there's an idea out there that people would rather skip this game and play Lost Judgment immediately. You can do that but you'll be missing out on this unique experience that LJ cannot offer.
I played this and LJ on PS4 just 1 month before it was added to Steam (SEGA please announce this next time so I don't have to buy the game twice, since obviously I'd prefer to buy on Steam) and now I've played through Judgment again on here as I wait for LJ to have a smaller price.

Judgment's strong points are it's story, the new character you play as (if we have played Yakuza previously) and the minigames.
The story is better than LJ in my opinion and one of the strongest in the Yakuza series. You'll feel great when playing it for the first time and I came out feeling more satisfied than the (in my opinion) over hyped Lost Judgment.
The new character Yagami is very unique and likeable. I'll admit I don't like his fighting styles compared to the Yakuza characters, but it's something new to learn and you can master them to an insane level.
The game is also VERY optimised being an amazing PC port of the PS5/XS|X version. The game looks and runs great.

Without the sequel baggage, the story can finally have the freedom to be unique and creative. It has a light Ace Attorney-style narrative that I enjoy. Unlike Yakuza 3, Judgment maintains the line between over-the-top storytelling and a sense of realism. The story is well-paced to keep you interested throughout.

Although the combat offers a lighter depth, it brings back the beloved style-switching mechanic from Yakuza 0. While enjoyable, it doesn't reach the level of being amazing. The mortal wound mechanic is a questionable addition. Its goal is to prevent players from constantly relying on healing items. In my experience, I still guzzle down food to heal. The wound can become frustrating since there is only one spot in town to treat it. 

The friendship mechanic returns and stands out as the best iteration I have ever experienced. It's a mix of easy tasks such as purchasing items to side-quest story content. While the overall number of side-quests may be fewer compared to other Yakuza games, they are well spread within the friendship mechanic and side-cases. On a related note, the girlfriend mechanic is arduous and morally questionable as you are dating 4 girlfriends simultaneously.

The new mini-games don't hit it for me. They end up taking a lot of your time, and the rewards they offer are pretty underwhelming. Even if the payoff is great, the mechanics themselves can be a chore. The number of new major mini-games included is disappointingly limited, with only two notable additions.

To conclude, Judgment is a fantastic game that handles its main story well but stumbles a bit in its side content. Conversely, its sequel stumbles with the pacing of the main story but manages to deliver remarkable side content. What sets it apart from the mainline Yakuza series is its laser focus on the main story, which makes it stand out.",1687237138,1687237138,True,1,0,0.519999980926513672,0,True,False,False

Expected a Detective game with Yakuza elements, but this is a Yakuza game with Detective elements hidden as boring or annoying mini games.

The Good:
- Interesting story but that would be very good if not for some crappy bits poisoning the well,
- Good, well written characters,
- Nice Graphics
- No Crashes, stable FPS (on 2080Ti)
- I dig the Friends system, but It really begs to have some management game tied to it,


The Bad
- Worst combat of any Yakuza games, bar Yakuza 3 maybe,
- Only one useful combat style (Crane Style should be renamed to Blunder Style),
- Mortal Wounds is one of worst systems ever invented - it punishes weaker players by making them even weaker, and is completely meaningless for better players,
- Skill books locked behind awful mini games,
- Costs of some skill unlocks is stupidly high,
- the famous ""Ryu Ga Gotoku Game Balance"", some enemies do absolutely ridiculous amounts of damage, and can take 80% of your level 3 health with one combo (normal mode), while other enemies barely do any damage at all,
- Wall jumping is interesting, but for whatever reason being able to run is very unreliable in this game,
- Tailing get boring after first one and there are A LOT of them...
- Chasing missions are now pure QTE, just get rid of them nobody ever liked them,
- No Karaoke,
- No Cabarets,
- Dice Game is without doubt worst ""major"" mini game of any Yakuza game (yeah I even enjoyed Taxi mission more than this crap), and wish I could refund the 12k SP I wasted on it....,
- Devs have no idea how they want to balance healing, they allow you to eat infinite amounts of Ramen from pause menu, but they heal for stupidly small amount so you have to eat like 20 to regain health... I am surprised Yagami did not burst yet,
- Equipment system was completely removed,
- Extracts could be interesting but as they are now they require grind to prepare and run out way to fast,
- Not only is the whole game only in Kamarucho but its not even expanded upon, in fact its probably the most shrunk version of any Yakuza game.
- zero cameos from any notable characters, why even bother making this in Kamarucho??!
- Drone racing is so uninteresting I almost forgot to mention it,
- thumb turn bypass is terrible and does not even have any skill to improve it,
- the game has a special menu for case files and evidence but you never really have to figure out things anyway answers are always given on a plate in cutsecenes anyway,

As a long-time player of the Yakuza (Like a Dragon) series, I went into Judgment with somewhat high expectations. Big mistake on my part because the majority of Judgment wasn't particularly above average to me. The game falls short in areas I really can't defend and will elaborate on. But its bad qualities don't overshadow the clear effort that was put into this game. Small details like the stellar graphics, detailed animations, and soundtrack, really emphasize the passion RGG Studio had in developing this project. However...

The game is overshadowed by extremely mediocre characters, gameplay, and pacing in my opinion. The characters, while appearing interesting at times and deeper than they appear, often fail to act on this impression. Reacting to events somewhat mechanically and with a lack of passion. 

Judgment, as beautifully detailed as it is, suffers from a similar curse that Yakuza 6 does. The gameplay isn't engaging and the new characters introduced aren't particularly interesting. During the first few chapters of the game I already wasn't finding Yagami (the main character) particularly engaging. I found very little substance to his character and his motivations. I feel like RGG wrote Yagami to be lawful but on the edge of criminal, like a bad boy or something. But Yagami lives by the law, making remarks about criminals having guns like he's seen a f*cking unicorn. YAGAMI THEY'RE CRIMINALS. 

Yet, his character is so defined by his search for the truth he literally becomes righteous to the point of absurdity. It's unrealistic for someone to have so little flaws to his character. Flaws make characters interesting- Yagami's one flaw is also his origin story and by the end of the game we realize said event that defines him wasn't even really his fault.  

I think a big part of the characters seeming uninteresting was due to the poor introduction and motivations presented at the start of the game. As much as fans rave about the writing of this title, the motives are boring and fail to garner emotional investment, the pacing is too slow and bogged down further by slow gameplay (looking at you tailing missions.) 

Speaking of which, realism is what this game does best in terms of its writing. The core premise is interesting (not going to spoil too much) and creative. But it's not really well done. The game's plot is poorly organized and I'm constantly asking ""Okay, but why?"" because as I said before characters don't seem to be logical at all. Ironically the realism is so dominating it actually makes the game harder for me to deal with, the tone in particular is extremely serious to the point of being dry to me. LAD games are meant to have a solid balance between drama and humor. Judgment is almost all drama.   

Judgment has a lot of potential but falls short of it often and if you aren't sold on the game within 3 hours I'd tell you to go for a refund because the first 3 hours establishes the game pretty well. In those three hours, you already understand the layout of Kamurocho.
Kamurocho in this game is small and there's not much to it. I preferred it in every other Yakuza title, cause it felt more lively and detailed. Even Yakuza 4 had underground malls, and rooftops. 

The side content is lacking, Mahjong, 6 or 7 arcade games, no karaoke, no golfing (if you're into that,) Dice and Cube (a virtual reality board game) is the big money making mini-game. and for me it was a f*cking grind. The game forces it on you because apparently the gambling halls don't have plates to pawn anymore.  Speaking of gambling, the game shoves Mahjong down your throat as well. Which wouldn't be so bad since Mahjong isn't too hard to learn, but the requirements for completing it are like three days long in ordeal. By the end my brain was like an egg on a pan. 

In summary; Kamurocho offers very little in terms of exploration and mini-games are subpar. 

One of the highlights of the game was drone racing, which I thought was actually pretty fun but even drone racing was tedious and stressful because of its race time requirements. I was ripping out my hair over race 5 in particular because even with high handling, the drones were very difficult to control through millennium tower openings. 

Bottom line; Judgment is for fans of Yakuza who don't mind a more serious and grounded simulation of Kamurocho, I don't advise first-timers to play it because the spirit of the game is dramatically different from the rest of the series and it doesn't balance serious with comedy very well. Plus, the gameplay is pretty immediate and there isn't as much variety. 

A lot of Yakuza fans will tell you it's one of the better games in the franchise, but I'd have to disagree. In my opinion Like a Dragon despite its turn-based combat, does a better job of emulating the spirit and tone of the original Yakuza games and the characters (especially Ichiban compared to Yagami) are much more interesting and endearing.

Gameplay: 8/10
Graphics: 9/10

The reason for my story rating is that I came from Yakuza looking for a similar Yakuza story. What I got was an ex-attorney turned detective solving a murder case. Typical of cold cases. If you want more cold case files or murder stories, I'd go watch a real series on a cold case or murder mystery. Its way better than this game's story even with the slight plot-twists which is to be expected of solving murder cases. What I'm saying is you might enjoy the story if you haven't binged a bunch of Cold Case stories in your life. I was able to predict most of the story and in my honest opinion, the story doesn't get good until chapter 8 or 9 out of the 13 chapters. You'll find yourself doing more of the side quests aka ""case files"" than the actual story where the side stories are more fun and entertaining than half the game's main story line. So I guess that makes up for it.
As for the gameplay, I hated the ""stalking"" missions aka Pursuits. They were very boring! I felt the devs were very lazy with these missions and decided not to re-work them. If they ever update this game (which I doubt nowadays) but a mechanic needs to be added to add some fun and variety to these missions to either distract the suspect or speed up the pursuit. I felt like I was wasting my time with these missions. Personally, I'm not a fan of stealth unless they add certain mechanics to make it fun instead of playing simple stalk-hide-seek. 

The graphics are super clean and the game is very well optimized. I ran this game at 1440p at 120fps max settings with Nvidia DLSS at Quality with a 3090 and Ryzen 5800x3D all while recording with no hiccups.

This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. Loaded into the game world and started playing but I was stuck on what you were supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he helped me. Loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.

Even though I highly recommend it, I want to complain at least a little bit. I think this about all RGG Studio games but at first it's easy to do the combat and do the chore-like missions because it's a new story, new characters, relatively new setting, etc. More forgivable. After about hour 15, it's nothing but a nuisance in my opinion. Want to progress the extremely engaging plot? Here, beat the crap out of 50 enemies down a series of long hallways. Oh hey, it's gonna take some time for this event to happen, how about you get derailed on some pointless side story about one of the main characters where in the end nothing changes at all, and it's so irrelevant that nobody even bothered recording any voice lines for it? As the game progresses, the enemies get more health and more super-armor to where they don't stagger as much with your attacks so you have to go out of your way to use the ex-boost mechanic a lot. ""Okay so just turn the difficulty down to the lowest setting."" You do that and you pretty much don't even fight the battle yourself. It decides so many things for you during the battle just by you simply moving around and pressing nothing else. you move towards an enemy you suddenly grab them. You move the joystick at all you randomly start full-on sprinting. You press the regular attack button, your guy spends ex-boost to do a special move when on other difficulties that's a different button. So I turned it to easy because ironically on the lowest difficulty if your guy is just sprinting around the whole fight you do less damage per second and fights take longer. I still had a heck of a time though, and there are mechanics in the combat system that reward an unreasonable amount of patience. Got my ass kicked a number of times because I didn't want a fight to last 10 minutes. In the end, you can always just button-mash and use heal items and still win, but it looks ugly and it's not very fun. Not to mention they have a ""lethal injury"" mechanic that permanently decreases max health with certain attacks until you go get it healed for an exorbitant amount of in-game money. To me that's just yet another chore to do in the end. I often caught myself thinking ""Why are they trying to fabricate game-play hours like this? It's a great game even if it's beaten in like 10 hours, why do they have to force it to be 30 hours with 20 hours of bull***t?"" Again, pretty much all RGG Studio games feel like this, but it seems like it can't decide if it's an open-world game or a strictly linear game so RGG Studio just makes some Frankenstein amalgamation of both. 

Despite all that, it's still a great game and I'm glad I played it. Just have patience.",1685066098,1685066098,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Love that they included all the popular upscalers and added proper options. Better than some of the pc ports that come out in the last year. 

Even though I love this game I have some small gripes one of which that stands out the most for me for some reason is that some lag between the transition from fights to exploration when you have friends fighting with you. I know it's meant for those who are immersed in the friend system but, it get's quite annoying especially combined with my second gripe which is the insane amount of enemies roaming the street. I swear almost everytime I enter a new street, a new set of enemies spawn.  Another gripe I have is how underpowered crane style is. Crane style is meant to be used when there is a crowd of enemies yet it's unusable because there is no ex actions strangely for it that damages multi enemies, and when enemies hit you, you flinch and lose your combo easily which u need to hit multiple enemies. Another gripe I have is how rigged the casino is. From what I found online for black jack is that a lot of combinations of cards are found and most end up in a loss. Another gripe which I have ptsd from Yakuza 3 is enemies regarding consistently. It's just difficult to combo enemies just because of them regrading to where I half my combo is usually spent trying to break it. Leap frog is op especially against low level enemies so I just resorted to using it instead of wasting my time trying to break their guard just to get a 2 hits into them. Another gripe I have is during tailing missions you sometimes randomly the tailed target turns around just to look for seemingly forever which really does artificially extends how long tailing missions are supposed to be. I get it for some targets them looking back actually suits their personality and/or story and it's supposed to add an element of difficulty to them. Though it's unrealistic that most normal civilian characters that you tail feel the need to turn back at every corner just to see if they are being tailed. 

This spinoff series has a really good start and I only hope that lost judgement has improved on the game.",1684810828,1684810828,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Thank god there are only a few, and most are optional. Also, integrating side stuff sometimes in the story is good for development, not so much for the pacing. 

With that said, the story is amazingly written, the combat gets better with every upgrade, and sidequests are as fun and absurd sometimes as you would expect from a RGG game. Great for relaxing from the seriousness of the main plot.

Personally, I don´t think Yagami hits the heights of Kiryu or Ichiban yet, but he is the most realistic and interesting of the trio, with his own qualities as a main protagonist. The side cast is also great, and every character is believable and has time to shine. Props to the ""villains"", some of the best you will see in this media.

If you're wondering what's so physically painful about this game, it's mostly the lockpicking mechanic. You're supposed to use either the left stick or right stick to slowly raise the lockpick thing to push the pins to the shear line. If you're on mouse, there are set parameters to where the lockpick thing can go. These parameters do not always include the shear line, so if you can't get it first try (assuming the insanely high sensitivity doesn't make it impossible for you to get it at all, my normal DPI is 1600 and I have to move my mouse about a tenth of an inch before it goes too far, and at 200 DPI I sometimes still accidentally overshoot at mach speed) as far as I'm aware, you're just kind of fucked, and eventually if you keep retrying it you should get it after half an hour or so. 

Aside from the lockpicking, which is equally impossible, and significantly more frequent, there's another weird, shitty minigame for unlocking doors where you use your left stick and right stick to do some bullshit, I don't really know, and I don't think the developers know either. The fun part is, even if you're on PC, you still have to use your left stick and right stick. In other words, you have to use your mouse to simulate the left stick and right stick, making what's normally a fairly difficult minigame genuinely the worst experience I have had in the entire Yakuza series so far (0-6), and yes, I did finish Yakuza 3.

The devs have managed to get the most out of the dragon engine because playing it feels like going through a refined Yakuza Kiwami 2.
The arcady combat I loved from Yakuza 0 is back with a vengeance! And your character is able to start combos and heat actions from walls, adding another layer to the combat.
While there are only two stances for Yagami (compared to the 8 stances in Y0), I could feel that each move was designed for a purpose, and each stance was created with the character's personality in mind.
The story, the world and the characters are so well built that I found myself instantly immersed in the universe and personally involved to uncover the secrets behind the series of crimes our main cast works on. So many mysteries and a few emotional twists to seal the deal as well.
I did not personally 100% this game as I don't find the ""girlfriends"" dialogues interesting but actually quite repulsive at times (Yagami wanting to date 14 year old girls is canon btw, which is a questionnable choice at best), but despite that there are many interesting secondary stories outside of the main case.

The biggest issue I had was that I spent more time watching cutscenes than actually playing the game. It felt like I was stuck in a movie theater instead of being able to explore and engage with the game world.

The storyline didn't do the game any favors either. It was over-the-top and exaggerated, making it hard to take it seriously. I just couldn't get invested in the characters or the story, which really detracted from my overall enjoyment of the game.

To make matters worse, the game is expensive. I don't think it's worth buying at full price, given the unsatisfying gameplay and lackluster story.

Overall Judgement is a really fun game, and while I haven't played Lost Judgement or Like a Dragon Ishin yet, this one so far has been my favorite game of the ""Yakuza"" games. It's got the same awesome, overly melodramatic and sometimes really funny story. Super tight and compact, but awesome small open world, along with decent enough combat to keep the game interesting. The side characters are fun and engaging and the side missions for the most part are really entertaining.

The tail/chase missions were absolutely awful though and the combat, while decent, definitely still feels a bit dated (falls pretty similarly to the beat em up Yakuza games, not Like a Dragons turn based style). Graphically it's pretty decent but you can definitely tell they reused some really old assets from previous titles that just don't hold up at all anymore, but IMO graphics don't count for much if the game is good.

Overall it's a definite recommend if you're a fan of the Yakuza games. If you haven't played those yet, definitely recommend them as well but this is also an amazing starting point for a newcomer and just a really fun and awesome game in general",1682904423,1682904423,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

- Generally you spend whole game running up and down this tiny city on the same streets to the same handful of locations. Gets old really quick.
- Fights with Yakuza, street thugs etc. that you encounter on streets are very annoying and you would rather try to run past them than be bothered to spend time on the fight.

The game's storytelling is second to none, drawing you into a rich and intricate world filled with fascinating characters, twists, and turns. As you navigate through the game's immersive narrative, you'll encounter a plethora of diverse personalities, each with their own motivations and secrets to uncover.

But what really sets ""Judgment"" apart from other games is its over-the-top Japanese weirdness. From its bizarre mini-games to its quirky side quests, this game has it all. Whether you're playing as a detective, beating up thugs with your fists, or just exploring the bustling streets of Kamurocho, you'll never know what kind of absurdity you'll stumble upon next.

I don't know if anyone will see it but I just wanted the opportunity to share how much I enjoyed this game. Yakuza has once again made a compelling, thoughtful, and emotionally gripping story. It is also the first Yakuza game I've played with English Dubs and the voice acting is impeccable and it does not detract from the experience at all. This might be the best story that Ryu Ga Gotoku has published thus far, or at least of the games I've played.  

All of that said there are still some aspects where the game is rough around the edges. Particularly some of the mandatory ""detective"" minigames can be tedious at times. Particularly the tailing missions, where are occasionally peppered throughout the main story and side quests can be extremely tedious. It feels like these concepts were thrown in without much polish. By the end of the game I was wishing I could just press a button to skip. That said, I powered through them and they weren't frequent enough to make me stop playing. 

The fighting styles are also a little limited, you only have two styles. Crane for crowds and tiger for single enemies and bosses. I could see combat getting stale for some people. I found myself rarely using crane style outside of very niche situations as it is just not that enjoyable and it doesn't have much variety or flexibility, but the extracts and leveling really helped with Tiger Style. There are a number of unlocks that can really change the way you tackle combat and keep things fresh and diverse. Crane  just doesn't seem to evolve that much after you unlock it. 

Another warning, the start of the game is an extremely slow burn. I feel that the pacing both with story beats and the unlocks are excellent starting somewhere around the third chapter. The first chapter was a little bit of a slog to get through. Ultimately it was totally worth it and I would replay this chapter because I imagine that there are many instances of foreshadowing that I missed. 

On a neutral note, I think on the zany scale this is significantly less zany than other Yakuza games. However, side quests were still regularly goofy and engaging. Like all Yakuza games it is filled to the brim with unlocks. I particularly enjoyed drone racing and I may go back to complete that specifically at some point in the future. 

Overall, I still highly recommend. This doesn't break significantly from the formula of the other Yakuza games. In fact, where it breaks from the formula, outside of story telling, might be its weakest points. That said, the story is phenomenal and the new cast of characters is a fresh and welcome take to the experience. 10/10 would recommend.",1680214186,1681442747,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Fun fights, a great story, a bit darker, story-wise, than the Mainline Yakuza games, but still with plenty of side activities and memorable characters and the signature humor to break up the seriousness a bit.

This one even has full English voice acting/dub/lip-sync so I could actually see and understand what is going on instead of having to read my way through the game.

It ended up taking me about 60 HOURS to finish and I LOVE THAT!

I didn't want this game to end, but with around a 60 HOUR play time, this game is totally worth the full price for me.

+ Good way to experience a Yakuza game without any prior knowledge of the series. Judgment's story and characters are entirely its own thing.
+ Great cast of characters. The main character in particular has a very interesting backstory, believable motivations, and is generally a pretty cool guy.
+ Complex and well-executed story that revolves around detective work, mysteries, and lots of action. 
+ Overall, one of the better combat systems by the RGG Studio.
+ Judgment continues the Yakuza series tradition of having cinematic boss fights, a detailed portrayal of Japan, awesome EX/Heat moves, and a ton of side content.[/quote]
[quote][h1]THE BAD[/h1]
- The worst tailing missions I've ever played. They are stupidly slow and far too frequent.
- Forced side missions that interrupt the main story. Might be more forgivable if the drop in budget for these missions wasn't so obvious.
- Combat is a bit clunky due to the animation lock of a lot of basic attacks.[/quote]

Mafuyu > Saori.

""A bit"" late review for a long awaited game.

The story is insanely good. I like it much more than Lost Judgment story, which is good, but in different way. This plot feels very personal for protagonist, because of number of reasons. Gotta play to figure that out. The script contains unexpected twists and will surprise you quite often. Story battle encounters are so fckn' intense I just can't describe my excitement with words. Epic ride.

Characters are very likeable, voice cast did incredible job. I can't even tell who was my favorite but since we already figured out that Mafuyu is the best girl, couple words about her. At the end of the game I understood that her playful and kind personality won me over. Just hoped more or her in next game, BUT do not make my mistake. She had 3-5 minutes of screen time in LJ. It's depressing sht, so cherish your gal, til you can. Saori is cold, but funny. Resolute and smart.

Yagami-san didn't disappoint. Bright mind, fast legs and fists. Good sense of humor. Can go on and on, but let's say he won't disappoint anyone. Good written character.

Worry not, there's still a good portion of goofyness in Sub Stories. There's also a new (?) Friends system, which I personally liked. While befriending people around town you will gain a certain goodies, such as materials, money, heat restoration if you meet them in town and even sidekicks on a streets of Kamurocho. Etc.

A lot of minigames are back from old [strike]Yakuza[/strike], sorry, Like a Dragon games. Karaoke is not on the list unfortunately. I guess Johnny & Associates asked for some cosmic amounts of money for Takuya Kimura singing.
Back to it. There's two new minigames I'd like to mention. These are Drone Racing and VR Paradise. Races are pretty chill and fun until you're going for last championship with that golden drone broken AI. I still loved it, water under the bridge. There's customization for performance and bit for visual appearance. Devs also scaterred a lot of QR codes in city for you to discover and scan with your drone in order to get upgrade schematics.
VR paradise is Suits and Ladders analogue. Throw dice, move. Fight, get prizes or lose everything earned this match. Also, cool cyber cats.

Combat. There are only 2 styles, but it's already more than Kiwami 2 and Y6 gave us. It's better, more flashy and still can't carry any weapons. Ngl, I had my fun, no complaints, although it gets much much better in the next game.

Visually game looks great, except characters' hair. In next game DLSS, FSR and XESS make hair look like pixelated spaghetti and I guess I wanted to play so badly that didn't put any attention in this title.

Things I didn't like:
- Mortal wounds. New system which reduce your maximum health if you was shot by a gun, steel arms (? don't remember) or received a damage from Boss' special attack, when they in heat mode. You need to see a Doc to cure it and can buy medpacks from him, but they may cost ya at the start of the game. You get several as DLC (included in game). Most bs part is swarming street encounters, when you didn't notice like the guy in the back pulled out the gun couple seconds after the battle started. Well, that will be 20k. System is removed in next game.
- Thumb turn bypass. Broken piece of shit. Very bad with controller, a bit easier with mouse and minimum sensitivity in options + lowest DPI. The fact this thing is present in VR Paradise as a reward tile is ""mildly infuriating"".
- Money. You can't unlock all skills without grinding VR or other source of income. It's not critical, there's no hardcore encounters (almost), but still unpleasant. If you're going for platinum, that's what will take most of your time. Investing tons of cash into a stupid scyscraper, which does nothing.
- Tailing. Every single one of them except two were basically the same. Long and boring.

TL;DR: buy.

As usual Imma drop couple tracks from OST I liked (don't go in comments, to avoid spoilers regarding Boss Encounter):

Sega and RGG, we love your games and glad you raised salaries for your employees. But your regional pricing became somewhat unreasonable. I bought Y0-6 for full. LAD with -25%.

The story itself while it does have one plot hole and the reveal of who is the killer felt a bit underwhelming is pretty good.  


So far after playing Yakuza 0 and 7, Judgement has that same effect that Yakuza 7 has wherein once you play a couple of hours into the story you feel the stakes getting higher and get invested into actually finishing it.

Combat just feels abit clunky with the fighting stance... It doesnt feel as precise (like in Yakuza 0) but is massive improvement vs 0's combat where it sometimes feels like you get into an animation lock and cant dodge on time.

Having played the Yakuza games from 0 to 5 Remastered, it's clear that RGG really wanted to push the mold with this game and they executed it really well. The story is the best I've seen from the franchise so far, with each chapter feeling like an episode in a season-long detective/mystery series. With some of the Yakuza games, the plot was either too predictable at times or relied on sudden plot twists that seemed to only exist for the sake of progressing the story without any prior set up; Judgement in my opinion doesn't have this flaw and has a coherent story the whole way through. Also, the humor in this game is legitimately some of RGG's best work yet, as there were a lot of times I burst out laughing at what was on screen, both in the main story and the side cases. 

The Dragon Engine they use for the game makes everything look stunning at maxed settings, and I found the combat really enjoyable all the way through. Side note: RGG usually has a heavy fight-choreo segments during boss battles, but they tend to put quick time events in said segments which prevented me from actually enjoying the moves the characters were making; from what I remember every fight-choreo segment for the bosses only had a single button input at the end of them so it feels like you're watching an action movie. Also the Yakuza bosses typically feel like shield/combo maniacs, ie impossible to hit unless you cheese them (tiger drop), but I never felt that being a huge issue in this game. 

Where I think the game really shines is the world-building, as there are so many side cases and friends to meet with many of them actually having great stories to tell/experience. RGG has always had a plethora of interesting substories in the Yakuza games, and the side cases are for the most part very engaging and worth going through. 

Overall enjoyed every minute till the end, and making this the first RGG game that I plan on 100% completing.

(Edit): Recently found out that in chapter 5 [spoiler] when you're in the past and have to investigate the Waku crime scene, the controller doesn't rumble on points of interest unlike in present day since Yagami was basically a newbie at detective work compared to how he is a full-time detective in the present [/spoiler] Just some neat subtle characterization that I really appreciated.",1676276055,1678404313,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

look.. this game does a lot of right, but it also stumbles pretty hard on certain points.
would i consider this a perfect game? fuck no, but if you like me are trying to play through all the yakuza games to catch up it, is a must play.. just be prepped for a lot of BS.

it's not directly tied too the story, but it helps flesh out the world, though that might be the beers talking.
(9 beers in.. thanks for asking)

first the story is fine enough it's set in the same city and world as the yakuza games,. but this time you're a detective.

and this means it's the same devs that clearly can't seem to figure out how to make a game to save their lives.

every boss is a war of attrition. aka bring plenty of healing items cause the BS you'll be dealing with is absurd.

the gang war thingies kept happening when i least needed it, and it got quite tedious.

and please take the idea of mortal damage put it on a flash drive and shove it up the ass of whatever moron thought it would be a good idea.

mortal damage is damage that cant be healed without health kits or talking to the doctor in the sewers..
thats right plenty of enemies that can cut your max health , and ONE motherfucker in town that can fix it, some bosses seems to put it up just for the fun of it.

I get it, you got shot or slashed with a katana, takes more then bento to fix that, but please have more than  one way to fix it. 

all in all I enjoyed my time with this game, but there are certain ideas put in this game that just sort of ruined it.. also the main character, isn't as cool as Kiryu I.M. OOH SO H.O.

Judgment is a proper successor to the original Yakuza games (considering that Yakuza: Like A Dragon turned the series into a JRPG series, which I don't hate, far from it, but it's not a genre I'm into). Coming off Yakuza 6 (and Kiwami 2), Judgment feels like a proper upgrade from the series it originated. Gameplay wise, while it does still have some jank to it, the new combat mechanics such as juggling are a fantastic addition, pulling off long juggles on enemies is some of the most fun things you can do here. Soundtrack and the side content are also some of RGGS' best, I like the ""quality > quantity"" approach here much more than what the PS3 era Yakuza games did, which had TONS of filler and boring content in which felt INSANELY tedious to complete. However, Judgment's best aspect is it's fantastic story. I won't go into detail here because of spoilers, but I can say that thing might be the best story this studio ever wrote (and they wrote some amazing stuff before this). Overall, a fantastic game and one of my personal favorites of the past few years, definitely go check it out.

It took me exactly 40 hours to beat it(at around 65% completion), but due to afking, and trying out things with loading and saving, Steam shows up 60.
The story perhaps is the darkest among the whole series, and it's really good. It might be very slow for some, but on chapter 9(out of 13) it really speeds up, and truly engages you. I always fear new main characters in Yakuza but Yagami really grew on me. I felt he was much bolder than Kiryu, especially if we think of Kiryu's Y5-6 versions. Other characters are very well made too.
The combat is awesome. We have 2 combat styles, one for larger groups, and the other rather focusing on one opponent.
I feel like thanks to this game, Dragon Engine was really polished. It's not Y6 where you had a downgrade in literally every aspect of fighting. The ragdoll still acts funny at times, but it's not as bad as in Y6 where it took ages to get up after a ridiculous ragdoll. 
Side content is still top notch, even if we're missing crucial elements like karaoke and some other activities. There's still a large number of things to do. I think Friendships system really works well in encouraging you to do side missions, etc.
Graphics and audio is also great, but that's a series standard. Dragon Engine still looks pretty, cutscenes are awesome. Some of the QTEs in fights are already amongst my faves in entire series(final boss QTE is fantastic) 
Soundtrack in my opinion goes back to the roots, with guitar themes, also sometimes barely audible lyrics. Took me back to the OG Y1-Y2 and Y3 music.
But, the game has it's issues like every game. The tailing missions are horrible. They are way too long, they always come down to slowly walking around your target, the music constantly changes from calm one to dramatic, because target turned and is behind a column, also they're no challenge at all.
The random encounters were also a pain in the ass, because they're only a waste of time in the endgame. I was cursing this stupid guy, who kept texting you because KEIHIN GANG WANTS YOU DEAD again and again. Thank god for the Stealth extract which disables random encounters for a short time.
The technical side of the game is good too. I didn't experience any serious bugs, crashes or infinite loadings. The game ran well on my average in today's standards PC.
Overall, I think I can safely put this game in my TOP 3 in the whole series, on the first place in podium next to Yakuza 0 and 5.

After falling in love with the Yakuza franchise I saw Judgment and I wanted to give this a shot. After spending 40 hours of doing the ""story"" for my first playthrough... I thought it be best that I come give my opinion on Judgment,

[h1][b] TL;DR [/b][/h1]
Coming STRAIGHT from Yakuza to Judgment... I'm let down as this really felt like a B game and not an A game. The in depth detective work, smooth and spectacular street fighting and vast array of side activities and the conclusion of this suspenseful serial killer-based plot is what kept me playing. The English-language dub was a welcome approach coming from Yakuza and due to all of this, I would whole hardheartedly recommend any fan of Yakuza to play this or for any newcomer to the Yakuza franchise/series. 9/10 a solid play and a must buy for any Yakuza fan!! 

[h1][b] My Verdict/Pros [/b][/h1]
⚫So far I have encountered NO ISSUES at all playing this game. No crashing, freezing, stuttering e.t.c. It seems to run unbelievably well on my 4090. I have heard that before the ""recent patch"" that people were having issues... so yeah.
⚫I thought that I would need to read for 50 hours straight again to be able to play the game but if you fear that too... THE ENTIRE GAME IS DUBBED IN ENGLISH VOICE ACTING and ITS PRETTY DAMN GOOD TOO!!!
⚫The freedom of movement that this game offers is amazing. Being able to run around mid fight, mantle over enemies and wall jump all in the heat of battle... WE NEED MORE LIKE THIS!!!
⚫There was a plethora of ""mini-games"" to play such as ""Kamarucho of the Dead"", Drone League, a VR game and many, many other classic Sega titles.
⚫Judgment has many side cases to which I enjoyed. The FINAL side case... now that was an absolute blast and in my own opinion.. THE BEST FIGHT IN THE ENTIRE GAME. [spoiler] Shin Amon. Yes. That is correct. He is in here [/spoiler]
⚫This is not really a spoiler per say but I am going to mark it as a spoiler. [spoiler] At the end of the game, Tak and Kaito get a phone call about a missing cat which they accept and then the game ends... now... the reason why i am mentioning this is because of what happens during the credits. You get to have a little laugh about it as they actually manage to get the cat during the credits which to me, is very well done. These little fine additions to details is why i love RGG. [/spoiler]

[h1][b] My Verdict/Cons [/b][/h1]
⚫Despite the fact this game is called Judgment, you literally do not get to make your OWN choice's like at all to effect the story.
⚫The main character Takayuki Yagami is so BORING. He is nothing like Kiryu or Ichiban... isn't that the point? well... yeah but he is so stiff and just not relatable in anyway. 
⚫The chase sequences and tailing missions are so BORING. They have nothing going for them. All it is, is ""move your thumbsitcks to avoid bumping into people and press buttons for QTE's. Also, when you start to ""loose sight of target"" you get this ANNOYING music that plays EVERY SINGLE TIME. 
⚫Levelling up made the game boring aswell. E.X During ""Investigation mode"" you can get a skill that VIBRATES when you are near something to investigate which leave you dragging your thumbstick around braindead.
⚫It lacked SUBSTANTIAL side activities like clan creator and hostess club management but this makes sense. They could have added something special for ""Detectives""... aw well... missed opportunity I suppose.
⚫THEY DID NOT HAVE KARAOKE EVEN THOUGH THE JAPANESE ACTOR OF YAGAMI IS A FORMER VOCALIST IN ONE OF JAPAN'S MOST POPULAR BOY BANDS OF ALL TIME - TAKUYA KAMURA.",1676724195,1676724607,True,5,0,0.542572557926177979,0,True,False,False

Genuinely one of the best games I've ever played. The music is excellent, the gameplay is a refreshing shift from Kiryu & Co's more rigid fighting styles, and the story has so many twists and turns and is so gripping that it's hard not to feel attached to the characters by the end of it.
Only gripes I have are: mortal wounds (not mortal wounds themselves, just the fact that to get them healed is so expensive and the doctor is usually on the other side of the map), and the mere existence of tailing missions.
All of that aside this game is an easy 9/10.

Being a fan of the Yakuza series, I wasn't sure how I'd appreciate a story without the memorable cast of characters I've grown to love over the course of 7 mainline games.  Easy to say the fresh face of Yagami is a welcome addition to the quaint city of Kamurocho.  I'll never get over just how much content is packed into each title in addition to the wonderful stories guiding the pace of the action.  The main story is a prime candidate for one of the best set in the Yakuza universe.  

If you haven't played any entry prior to Judgment, rest assured this game assumes you haven't.  You can honestly only play this game and have a full understanding of events.  This title is self-contained.

If the volume of the Yakuza series seems daunting, but you've wanted to experience where the love comes from, you can start here and see if it's up your alley.  I doubt you'll be disappointed!

First and foremost there was a lot of sound glitching within the game, audio cutting out, or faraway voices being a super high volume. For some reason these audio issues stopped occuring a few chapters in with no change/update to the game or my PC? I can only conclude that there's some state that is fixed/checked in later stages

The same issue applies with sprinting, I'll hold or toggle sprint and sometimes I'll sprint flawlessly... other times I'll run a few steps, slow down, and then start running again. Sometimes getting into combat will fix this, but most times you'll have to rely on a major cutscene. But, again, after a few chapters this behavior stopped occuring so there's really something not quite right in the early game

Additionally, if you're playing this on a Switch Pro controller forget about trying to use the Nintendo button layout; this thing runs on Xbox controls and that's the end of it -- I changed controls multiple times to see if I get it to be the Nintendo format and in spite of the game saying changes we're saved, they just never were. This gets frustrating when you're placed in a scene with quicktime events... and even more annoying when you play other games then let you use the Nintendo layout

Issues aside, on sale I think it's a decent buy. It's not quite as good as the Yakuza games in my opinion and the story isn't as outlandish or engaging as those games either. Also, many of the missions/side missions require you to do '''investigation''' type tasks suchs as scanning a room for a specific object in first person, or tailing someone. These missions are extremely painful and every single time I rushed through them as quickly as I could. They're absolutely not engaging whatsoever, if there was an autocomplete option I would have immediately selected that instead

Yagami gets no gear and no weapons inventory, just the clothes on his back, object he can grab from the area, and his array of skills.  Of course the best skills are all hidden away in secret places, so you'll have to keep your judge eyes open on the streets of kamurocho in order to build Yagami up right.

You won't be leaving Kamurocho in this one, so get stuck into your home turf, at least the graphics are great so Kamurocho has never looked better.  It would have been nice to have a karaoke minigame, sorry, you won't find that here.  It's sad because the Kamurocho map includes the usual karaokekan but you can't go inside.  The drone race and dice-and-cube minigames are quite entertaining, however.

When i was first jumping into this, i was expecting something like, L.A Noire, but with fist fighting, which i was mostly correct minus the fact that the detectiveness part wasnt exactly polished (Though spotting cats was a neat treat). Though despite that, there are couple of flaws within this game, like any other game has really.

Pros:
- The story is amazing. Despite the fact that sometimes the story does side track, one reason or another, the main story is just amazing.
- The fighting. At first, the fighting feels... Eh, but once you start unlocking some fun stuff, by fun stuff i mean new battle EXs and such, then it becomes really neat, specially when some skills are nearly ""must have"" (In quotation marks), like double quickstep, Tiger Drop (Not needed but badass if you pull it off), and some other stuff like the Flux.
- The graphics are really neat too. I, during the entire playthrough, never noticed i was playing with low Graphs (Prolly because i am just used to running a lesser end PCs in my life), but even with the said low Graphs, its really pretty. Though again, i am not much of a Graphics person. (Aka Gameplay over Graphics type of a person)
- Side Cases & Majority of Friend Events, on the gameplay side, these two are also neat and are mostly your main source of money and SP, and trust me, you will need a decent amount of money, specially for 100%
- OST, just simply look it up on Youtube, nuff said.

Cons:
- 100%, as much as i would LOVE to 100% the game, there are few things that are holding me back and that specific things are 1 Friendship where you need to play a game of Mahjong with special rules, Poker objectives and Shogi. Its less of a game issue and more of a skill issue, problem is, even if i knew how to play any of those, i am mostly relying on luck, as (For Poker for example) you need to win a number of chips, which absolutely relies on luck as opponents may waste their chips or play it very safe.
- Mortal Wounds mechanic, its not exactly a con, its a good feature, whats not good feature is Firearms. It doesnt help that EVENTUALLY, normal enemies have guns too, and they hurt. Doesnt help that Yagami takes his time to get up (Though understandable lol).
- Threat Level, god forbid whoever thought this was exactly a good idea. On paper, it sounds fine, but in practice, its annoying. To explain Threat level, after beating up a good amount of enemies or waiting some time, the Threat level will be at 100%, in order to lower it, you have either defeat the Keihin leaders (There are 4 of them, each of them having their own abilities). While Threat it up, alongside the leaders, Keihin enemies will become A LOT more common... And i mean, A LOT. To the point of annoyance. Again on paper, this sounds fine, the problem is, this feature appears on Chapter 4, and on top of that, the 100% Threat are very random and can happen pretty much any time, and boy oh boy, that any time is A LOT of time. (Also fuck Koga, bro has 2 guns at 50% HP. >:( )

- Tailing Missions. I dont want to put this to either a con or pro so i will just put it here as a Neutral. The Tailing missions are pretty fun at first, but holy shit, does the game overuse them. And majority of the times, they feel the same. The couple of times that it felt different is tailing more paranoid or aware characters, which trust me, its less than you think. 

Overall: 9/10
Remember, this is all my personal opinion, some people may not share the same issues (Like my problem with Mahjong and Poker). But even so, i personally recommend getting the game. Is it worth 40$? Can be arguable, but if you are like me (A person that like to scrape by with sales), then wait out for Sale.
Note: Despite it being a ""2022"" game, it actually came out 2021 (Remaster, not the OG that would be 2018), therefor threat this game as a 2021 game when it comes to sales.",1675410950,1675410950,True,2,1,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

Taxis are basically useless, since you can't call them with your phone and basically walking to a taxi spot takes the same amount of time to walk to the place you have to go.
Kamurocho feels kinda small compared to Yokohama.
Most of the side missions are kinda meh (some are really good)
Combat feels a bit lacking, once you grab a bike or a cone then you win the fight.
Some of the minigames are irritating and broken, like the follow around people. (later on the game there is even one sequence that is kinda broken followed by a bug that wont let you progress in chapter 10, a bug that has not yet been fixed)

On the good side:

Great plot.
Amazing characters with superb voice acting (Japanese of course) sadly only the main plot is voiced, side mission are not (i got spoiled by Like a Dragon which is fully voiced)
A lot of content for what you pay, at least 40hs with just the main plot.

Its good, undeniably. BUT.

It's soulless compared to the mainline Yakuza games. The city is bland, there are no real unique or interesting minigames (the drone shit is a bit like Dragon Kart from 7 but more enjoyable; still boring and grindy, the [i]of the dead[/i] game is alright, and the VR is... I dunno). Its clear the devs are trying something new, and the ""darker"" tone of the main story is honestly quite well executed, though it makes the silly RGG moments very camp and unintentionally funny.

The characters are... weak, bad in the diametrically opposite reason as to Y7:
They are so god damn boring. And there are SO many of them. Compare this games cast to that of Y0/Y3 and its meme tier, I couldn't put a name to the face of most of them, with the exception of Kaito, who feels like a hybrid of Rikyu and Kiryu, and not in a good way- or, not as good as he could have been.

The story is... contrived. Its clear the devs had a solid idea for the final scene, how it was executed, and the drama, but the plot was obviously built from the end backwards, and it shows. Random, near-pointless plot elements, redundant characters, massive coincidences, strange morals that have you almost wanting the ""bad guys"" to win, and even a dramatic reveal in the last quarter that falls flat on its face. I did appreciate one element of the ending though (spoilers without names) [spoiler] The game sets up clear ""jump infront of the bullet"" bait, but instead, a character whacks the dude with a thrown armchair, who proceeds to try again, only to get lit up and shot to death LMAO [/spoiler]. But yeah, for the most part, the story lacked any stakes, and not in a good way. Yakuza 3 was chill, but the story was absolutely banging. This game? Well, its nice and chill so you can do the sidequests at any point without feeling goofy (ahem Yakuza 0), but the actual plot is hollow and predictable.

I have high hopes for the sequel, I've heard people say its on a par with 0 but I'll believe it when I play it. Hopefully. Overall, this is a pretty solid game as proof of concept for a new IP, its just a shame its set in Kamurocho and lacking in the main plot department. Substories are pretty solid- if a bit bland for the most part.

The game also took me ages to beat, like, half-a-year type length- which is the longest out of any RGG game I've played so far, but I can't attribute that entirely to the game, as I was busy IRL too. Its undeniable I didn't particurlarly feel like launching the game most days, which says a lot.

Its alright, a definite... alright game.",1674687152,1675373186,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,2,True,False,False

The story and storytelling are just perfect, combined with a down-to-earth protagonist with lovable supporting characters, with plenty of them have unexpected development.  We're in for a thrilling ride in a darker side of Kamurocho. The musics are also top-notch. Plenty of the battle tracks are banger, while the BGMs capture the atmospheres perfectly.

Kind of disappointed that this remaster is largely about graphics and performance overhaul, with a little change regarding minigames (I'm glad Puyo Puyo is gone though, haha). Would be nice if they backported the Lost Judgment combat mechanics and plenty of its QoL changes.

Which, has worked for a very small sub-section of people, while many unfortunately has net zero positive result. 

The port is obviously scuffed. Which was very surprising to me as I've played Y6, Like A Dragon, and Y0 on PC thus far with little to no issue, and have completed all of those games.

I'd highly advise anyone on the fence about this to WAIT until it's been substantially patched and updated. This is sadly the worst RGG port to date, along with Lost Judgement from everything I've read, including multiple reports within the bug reporting thread for Judgement.

Lets hope Like A Dragon ISHIN! doesn't get botched.

I'll update this accordingly if SEGA/RGG fixes their game(s). Judgement is amazing and a worthy entry into the Yakuza universe/franchise, I played it to completion on PS4 when it was released.

 Judgment is the beginning of the Yakuza series' move away from that name and its focus on, well, the yakuza. You play as a private detective/lawyer who is not and has never been an actual yakuza member, but who still has close ties with one particular family. The story and gameplay similarly sit somewhere between being about and not about the yakuza - they play a major role in the plot and much of the gameplay revolves around beating them up, but at the same time you can play for hours just doing detective tasks and dealing with civilians. 

The two main shakeups to the gameplay are the addition of various detective-y activities and a bunch of new minigames. The detective stuff consists of activities like tailing suspects, looking for clues in the environment, and dialogue-based interrogations. None of this stuff is ever very hard, and it honestly probably wouldn't have been interesting at all if not for the series' trademark bonkers writing constantly intervening to surprise you. The minigames, meanwhile, are a very eclectic bunch. Drone racing and a VR Mario Party-esque games are the main ones, and the latter is meant to be your main source of income since there's no business minigame. I found both of these a bit tedious because of slow movement in VR and excessive grinding for crafting resources with drones, but they're fun for a bit. Most of my time with minigames was with the batting cages, darts, and Outrun! cabinet. 

Outside of those changes, you'd be hard pressed to notice that this wasn't another normal Yakuza game just from watching gameplay. Most of your time will be spent on crazy sidequests that almost always end in combat or in street encounters against the bizarrely combative denizens of Kamurocho. The sidequests are nearly all fun, but several of them are frustratingly locked behind completing grindy NPC quests that require finding random resources or grinding casino chips to buy paintings. Combat is similarly fun when its new, but random events that spawn Keihin Gang leaders all over the map happen maddeningly frequently in the later stages of the game. Beating up those leaders is fun the first few times, but it's a lot less entertaining when you're fighting the same guy for the 30th time. 

It'd get a lot easier to differentiate the games if a cutscene starts playing, though. Most of the major characters in Judgment are either lawyers at the Genda Law Office or prosecutors working opposite you on a case, and typically your immediate concern is collecting evidence to exonerate your client on a case. The result is something that's half Phoenix Wright and half Yakuza. It's definitely not realistic, but it is thoroughly entertaining. ",1674389539,1674389539,True,6,1,0.606207489967346191,0,True,False,False

I've read though that it's been toned down a bit for number 2 so that's a good sign. Also, some of the other game-play in this game like lock picking, chase missions (introduced in Y4) and having to grind just to get game passes (that allows you to play paradise VR that makes you all the money in this one.) is just to annoying.

The main strong point of Judgment is definitely the story. Although technically a spin-off from the Yakuza games, it still manages to have one of the most immersive, enjoyable, and strongest story in the whole franchise. I was entirely immersed and invested from the introduction all the way to the credits. The story was so enjoyable to experience that I neglected parts of the game like the drone racing mini-game just to progress through and see what happens next. While Judgment doesn't feature the beloved characters of the main games, it adds a whole new cast of memorable and in-depth characters which really make the story come to life and adds a new fresh feel to the game. 

Combat is also very enjoyable and has a different feel and pace to the main Yakuza games. Yagami has two fighting styles that can be used in combat, both being very unique and different to Kiryu's fighting style. Rather than a strong and grounded playstyle, Yagami favours speed and agility similarly to Majima. Very fun to use Yagami's moveset while jumping on enemies and walls.

Visuals are also stunning and really top off the experience. The dragon engine allows the game to look realistic and have beautiful lighting and graphics while not being that intensive.

2058180,130491257,76561197970761123,2946,889,6373,0,6373,1673175586,"I’ve played everything that has been released in the Yakuza/Like a Dragon series from RGG Studio and enjoyed each one of them.  There were amazing games like Yakuza 0, weaker games like Yakuza 3, and different games like Yakuza: Like A Dragon (the most confusingly named one). 

Judgment isn’t technically part of that franchise, but it is from RGG Studio and is counted as a “Yakuza game” by most fans.  It’s the same universe, same city, and has similar interactions with the same Tojo Clan, even if only a side story character crosses over between the two games.   The engine the games run on and the style of the games is very similar.  

In Judgment, you control Yagami, a former lawyer who is now a private investigator.  A simple early case, which involves you trying to assist in the defense of a Tojo Yakuza Captain named Hamura, pulls Yagami into a series of events at the core of the story.  Judgment’s main focus is telling a complex and intricate narrative that evolves throughout the story, though since unraveling is such a central part of the game, I’ll avoid mentioning much more about it. 

What I can say though is while the story in Judgment is interesting and unique,  with satisfying moments, it doesn’t feel as tight as previous Yakuza games and ultimately feels bloated.  It’s a fifteen-hour story told over twenty hours or more.  What’s worse is that the same is often true for the side cases.  Interesting and unique stories, like all side stories in these games, but told slowly. 

A lot of the game feels bogged down by dialogue or a need to remind people of the narrative, it’s unfortunate because it gets in the way of its own momentum, and rather than giving high-action moments, it draws out scenes or shows entirely too much detail when brevity could be better. 

That’s not to say it harms the story, but it does feel long-winded, and perhaps that’s also due to how Judgment is intended to be a detective story and so the game is mostly talking.  There are major moments to the story, but in the Yakuza series most chapters end with a major boss battle, in Judgment, there’s no major reason for the chapter changes, only a few chapters have a big boss battle.  It’s understandable as the enemies aren’t major Yakuza, but the pace makes the experience feel like more of a slog than it should be. 

The gameplay of Judgment works though.  With Yagami being a detective there are a few new mechanics at play.  Hunting through locations for clues in a first-person view is an interesting and unique idea that if anything is underutilized, as they’re some of the best moments of detective work.  On the other hand, the tailing missions where Yagami tails suspects are almost never fun, but that’s to be expected.  The good thing is those don’t happen too often, but they probably aren’t going to excite many people. 

The combat of Judgment is similar to the rest of the series as well, though with Yagami fighting with more of a Shaolin style with two different forms, one for large groups, and one for single enemies, but with enough upgrades it’s easy to use the latter for every battle.  The early hours make Yagami feel rather slow and weak, but a few skill point upgrades and Yagami will be able to take on almost every enemy without a challenge. 

There is one change to the combat that definitely stands out.  Yagami can take “Mortal Wounds”, which means the parts of his health bar are taken off.  This only happens when he’s shot or takes major damage from one of the “boss” characters.  This damage can’t be healed by eating and instead requires Yagami to get healed by a doctor or use a med kit.  The issue is there is just one location to heal up that I found, and the medkits, and fixing these wounds are decently expensive.  But as a mechanic, it just means players will have to go find the doctor, and once the money stops being a major issue in the game, it is simply a time-wasting chore, rather than an interesting gameplay mechanic.  

Take that damage when you’re in one of the few battles where players can’t just free roam, and suddenly it changes a major story moment to a painful experience where players will have to struggle with a tiny life bar.   

Of course, the Mortal Wounds can be mitigated with a few features, but rather than getting deep into it, it’s the most important part of the combat system, but also the one that never feels as good as the rest, and one that luckily was removed before the sequel, and hopefully will not return. 

There’s more to be said, with a lot of it being potentially spoilers, but at the end of the day, it’s a game where players should discover the story, side quests, missions, and experiences, and rest for themselves.  

One other issue comes up in that there are a few DLC parts to Judgment.  I’m not sure if everyone gets those or if they were only for the initial launch, but these DLC bonuses range from pointless (An extra Staminan X?) to overpowered (an essence that lets you instantly kill almost every enemy or cause massive damage for bosses).  

I’m not sure why DLC exist in Judgment, but it’s a shame because they unbalance the game and are no longer optional additions, they’ll sit in your mailbox outside your apartment but different parts of the game will leave bonuses in that mailbox so you’ll likely add them to your inventory at some point. 

The DLC isn’t a massive negative but definitely one that stands out and it’s something that RGG tends to do for all their games (DLC that unbalances the game). I just wish they had a way to lock it away for an authentic play-through because otherwise, it clutters up your inventory. 

Ultimately Judgment is another Yakuza game, with a different protagonist.  It has all the various Yakuza trapping with large side stories and interesting dialogue.  The story is solid but is told poorly at times, and the experience is long but still one I enjoyed.  After thirty-five hours I have to confess, they must have done something right, even if I was bored during a few chapters. 

Judgment is a slow burn but still one worth playing.  Though with that being said I don’t know if I would ever return to Judgment for a second playthrough due to the length of the story. 

Still, if you’re a fan of the work of the RGG Studio, I’d recommend checking this out at least for completion's sake and to learn more about the world of the Yakuza.

So far the story is compelling as hell, and they nailed the main character. To be honest I like Yagami as much as I like Majima and Kiryu from the Yakuza series. I started with Lost Judgment, the sequel, but stopped to play this first. The gameplay is pretty much identical, but I did notice that SO many Quality-Of-Life improvements were made in Lost Judgment.

And for a PSA, I don't know about the other mini-games but the Thumb Turn Bypass mini-game, which has to be played at the end of the game's first chapter, will not work properly if you don't cap your FPS at 60.

Edit: Finished. At least for me, Yagami's Saga is up there with Majima's and Kiryu's. This has been an absolutely amazing game. The story had me on my toes practically the whole time and I can't do anything but applaud the ending. Also second PSA, if you encounter an infinite loading screen at around the beginning of CH10, after the first missions of the chapter, cap your fps at 30 and put on low settings to bypass it. :)",1672476314,1672812453,True,0,0,0.498062372207641602,0,True,False,False

Way better and way more smoother experience than the PS4 version, which had the infamous 5fps Amon battle aka ""Essense of Framedrop"".
This game has the best Dragon Engine rendition of Kamurocho up-to-date with more added shortcuts and big amount of enterable areas, some of which, sadly, were cut in Lost Judgment for unknown reason.

Story is great too, I'd say it's even better than in the sequel. Soundtrack is very good but Lost Judgment's soundtrack was more memorable for me.

This game also is not so stuffed with side content as it's sequel, it feels more ""compact"" as a game overall, and as a result doesn't have that feeling of ""content oversaturation"" I had when I was playing Lost Judgment or Yakuza 5.

Levelling is also amazingly done compared to Lost Judgment or Yakuza 7, never felt the grind when I collected SP for abilities just by doing stuff in the city, for example, just playing main story + doing substories and going to restraunts to replenish HP gave me enough bonus SP points to gain strong abilities to use in fights later on without any grinding.

This game also has cons, such as annoying ""Keihin Gang assault"" mechanic which makes you run around town and defeat minibosses when you want to, for example, focus on doing substories and suddenly you get message from Kim, this mechanic could've used longer cooldowns.
Tailing missions were okay for me and not annoying as people make out them to be, always try to keep distance from the mark and this should make probability of failure much lower.


My personal tips for more enjoyable gameplay due to Judgment not being Lost Judgment in terms of combat mechanics:

1. Do not level up damage too early, Lvl. 2 makes Yagami so stupidly overpowered that you can't do proper full combos on common enemies and they just die from just couple of hits on Hard difficulty.
I suggest against levelling up damage unless you are having hard time with Amon or tougher enemies later in the game.

2. Try to prioritize levelling up your moves (Double quickstep, quickstep attack and cancel, etc.) and Combo Speed first, it makes combo inputs overall more smooth and responsive.


Conclusion:
Very strong 9 out of 10. Already completed the game on PS4 and replaying it on PC feels amazing, regional pricing could've been better for 2018 game but thanks to SEGA anyway for bringing it to PC.


P.S.
If any of the Yakuza modders reads this, please could you make a mod that can ""turn off"" Keihin Gang mechanic [spoiler]after they dealt with after ""Revenge of the Keihin Gang"" substory[/spoiler]? Or just make the cooldowns way longer?
Without this ""endless"" mechanic game would be much better.

Post-P.S.
Decided to update the review to include two ""essential"" mods for the game that I'm now cannot imagine playing without:

1. [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/judgment/mods/14]Faster Style Switching by Emergince[/url]
This small mod makes combat much more fluid by speeding up the style switch, making Judgment's combat more close to what we have in Lost Judgment. I like this subtle change more than full moveset overhauls which, in my opinion, kinda mess up the game flow and feel.

2. [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/judgment/mods/1]Straight to Menu JE by Tacore[/url]

- The bad thing is Mortal Wounds (glad it got removed in Lost Judgment), combat can be smoother and tailing mission sucks ass.

Combat's pretty fun, like a sandbox of IP Man moves... You beat up an ridiculous amount of Yakuza, and to be honest, they're a great punching bag.

Sidemissions are goofy as heckkin' tons of funny scenes and dialogue, however BEWARE, there's tons of tailing missions in which you're literally just following a dude, slowly.

Judgment takes the best parts from Yakuza/Like A Dragon series and add its own touch, with detective gadgets, investigation sections, etc. While the detective sections can be better, it does a good job in making players into Yagami's line of thinking.
The combat is somewhat perfected in Judgment with lots of combos, varied enemies and just generally great feel to it. While it does feel slow at first, when certain skills are unlocked, Yagami becomes really enjoyable to play, becoming a master martial artist from just a rookie in the earlier chapters.
Kamurocho is much more fleshed out now due to Friend Events where a huge numbers of npc can be befriended, some tells their own stories, some act like its own substories and some can even be teammates in random battles. This and with the usual substories (now named side cases) make Kamurocho such a well-crafted city. 

Judgment's story it one of RGG's best. It starts quite slow and eventually one case turns to another and then turns into a huge conspiracy where everything is gray, not really knowing what's really right and wrong. It's such a great well written, directed and acted story. The games does an amazing job in fleshing out its characters with believable motivations so when later on they clash with one another, the tension is believable. It makes the fights a battle of ideologies. As a detective story, it is amazing. As a thriller crime game, what a phenomenal one at that.

Yagami is also the most fitting protagonist for Judgment. an ex lawyer turned detective, he gives the game much more grounded feeling and his actions are believable. All the other supporting characters have their own highlights that they become like a real person with flaws and motivations.

Judgment, however, does stumble a bit when it comes to tailing missions and its implementations of Mortal Wounds, but its strengths far outweighs its weakness. Judgment makes me think about what is right and wrong ethically while also makes me feel sympathy, anger, sadness and guilt in its characters.

Pros:
+ Good story, just like in main series
+ More teamwork, main protagonist is not one vs all (though you can't play other characters much)
+ Tons of enemies crowding Kamurocho
+ Better graphics, compared to main series
+ Player can place pointer on map
Cons:
- Detective features does not affect story, you can't miss clues nor evade fights
- Still no keyboard adaptation, can't evade without focusing on enemy, but you have to hold middle mouse button (its hard to use both MBL and MBR while holding, and remap just moves the problem to other hand) to focus
- Mortal wounds, annoying feature, forcing you to run from enemies instead of fighting.
- Very strange gang swarming (literally, you can meet another group right after fight with one of them) on streets. Defeating their bosses gives nothing, because they would return again just after some time.

I love this game and I love that it's a game that geniunely makes me happy.

Of course the game has flaws with some annoying stuff but that's ignoring the point i'm trying to make. This is a rare game. A game that makes me happy.

_There's the same quality in terms of graphics , characters, voice acting , story telling and mini games. Quite a bit of humor too. Like in any Yakuza games really.  Some good mechanics too, like lockpicking, Drone racing is okay but needs some changes.  

I also played it entirely on mouse/keyboard, and there was only 2 annoying things with that, controlling the vertical axis of the drone, and dodging, which weren't a problem to finish the game on hard.

_On the other hand, the story felt disappointing, not much surprise there.I feel it is more about questioning the player's moral about what's going on during the story than the story itself : The perception of what is justice, and if the end justify the means.  
The story also started to drag on a bit near the end, before the grand finale, but then we get a super short epilogue where we don't know what happened to most of the characters. 

Some content is locked behind a grind wall that is too high so i didn't bother, for example, of the 50 side jobs in the game, i am missing 2 because they are locked behind the 50 friends requirements, which i didn't do because of said grindwall.

The combat system also didn't really feel great or fun, and for real, the Keihin gang constant invasion are an absolute unfun pain very quickly.

I also want to mention that tailing missions are bad, and the Keyholder system is completely useless.

So yes, overall good, but i hope Lost Judgement has a lot of improvements, because that still felt disappointing in the end when compared to Yakuza 0 or 7 for example.",1671973996,1671973996,True,1,0,0.511627912521362305,0,True,False,False

The NPCs look more normal. I felt that Yakuza 0 and Kiwami had NPCs that were on average way too attractive. 

The game has plenty of the typical busywork quests. I skip all the archaic Japanese gambling games.

But being a detective and getting paid to do cases is much more believable than being a gangster helping out random people ""just because"". 

Character development is quite good, and you do end up caring about each character. The story arcs are believable and exciting to follow. 

The worst part of the game is its excessive use of the tailing/following minigame. It's actually quite fun, as long as it's part of an interesting story. But too many side-cases have you follow people that you couldn't give a damn about. (Looking at you, psychic lady)

I can never get myself to 100% these games. I got maybe 45 out of 50 ""friends"" after 87 hours of play. 

The game does a good job at giving you plenty of time to do these side activities though, and it feels a lot less shoe-horned in than it did in Yakuza 0

The fighting is fun in some ways, but the core mechanics of wall-jumps and hopping over people doesn't really work well. You have to run for a second before it works, so you end up having to run away and then run back, because otherwise you will often not be able to trigger the moves and just awkwardly bump into things. 

The special meter runs out way too quickly for what it does. It never felt worth it to activate it. The fighting system should have spent some more time in the oven. But the game lets you insta-kill/end encounters if you want to, which I did a lot near the end. 

The side-quest where a gang arrives to Kamurocho and you have to defeat it's leaders is SUPER ANNOYING. It happens WAY TOO OFTEN and I cringed every time it happened.",1671653347,1671653347,True,2,1,0.510078370571136475,0,True,False,False

[h1]Introduction[/h1]
Never in my life would I have expected [b]Judgment[/b] to come to PC. I was so happy to finally get a chance to play the game in all its glory, and let me tell you, it was a wild ride. Everything about it was just fantastic and I wanted more of it, and it does everything I want in a video game. Doing this review will be a tough one though, as I don’t want to spoil too much about what this game has to offer. [b]Judgment[/b] is a spin-off from the [b]Yakuza[/b] series and takes place in the red-light district of [b]Kamurocho[/b].

[h1]Pros and Cons[/h1]
[b]Pros[/b]
[list]
[*]Fantastic story that can get really intense
[*]Well-crafted characters that are well developed
[*]Fun combat that has two fighting styles to switch between
[*]Lots of minigames and side cases for you to do
[*]Awesome soundtrack that will stick with you
[*]Beautiful graphics that makes Kamurocho feel alive
[/list]

[b]Cons[/b]
[list]
[*]The issues were so minor that they did not meddle with my experience
[/list]

[h1]Story[/h1]
Disgraced ex-lawyer [b]Takayuki Yagami[/b] is working as a private detective alongside his best friend [b]Masaharu Kaito[/b], who is an ex-yakuza. Recently, [b]Kamurocho[/b] has been dealing with murders featuring victims of the [b]Kyorei Clan[/b] yakuza where they have their eyes gouged out for some reason. However, it seems that this entire ordeal is more than meets the eye, and [b]Yagami[/b] has to either go head-first into danger or lay low in hiding.
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2899835224
I never thought I’d see the day when a story for a spin-off [b]Yakuza[/b] game manages to pull off an even better story than the main-line [b]Yakuza[/b] games. It knows how to keep things tense throughout and has many twists that will keep you on your toes along the way.

I also enjoyed the characters as well, [b]Yagami[/b] is just entertaining throughout the entire story. And when he is not doing a series case you can make him do side cases where his reactions are just brilliant the moment that happens. [b]Kaito[/b] is also another character I loved, his personality is something I like.

There are many characters that I want to talk about but I don’t want to spoil the story too much, as it’s honesty really well done. I want everyone who is reading this review to experience the story as best as they can, it’s a wild ride from start to finish.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
Combat is very well done, you have two distinct fighting styles that you can switch between at any given time. [b]Tiger style[/b] is best used when you are in one on one fights or there is only a single enemy you are fighting. [b]Crane[/b] is better used on multiple enemies and can help take care of large groups. Although [b]Tiger[/b] and [b]Crane[/b] can actually do the exact opposite of what they are supposed to be doing which is interesting, frequent switching is encouraged due to the long recovery times for each style.

Also, thanks to my playing [b]Yakuza 6[/b], I am more comfortable with the [b]Dragon Engine[/b] which does make its return in this game. [b]Yagami[/b] also has access to [b]EX Boost[/b], which makes him less likely to flinch, attack faster, and all damage goes to the [b]EX gauge[/b] instead of his health. [b]Yagami[/b] does also have a skill tree in which he will get upgrades, some of these skills though can only be unlocked by books or 2D codes throughout the game. [b]Crane[/b] style also has no sole upgrades, as most of them benefit [b]Tiger[/b] style only or both.

Bosses do borrow move sets from previous [b]Yakuza[/b] games, however, as they have an additional attack called [b]Deadly Attacks[/b]. These attacks cannot be blocked and if [b]Yagami[/b] gets hit by them, he will not only take damage but cause a [b]Mortal Wound[/b]. [b]Mortal Wounds[/b] will cause [b]Yagami’s[/b] health bar to not be fixed by normal healing items and he must either use a med kit or go to a doctor which is only available in a certain part of the world, which means there is only one. Health kits are also very expensive so you better stock up on some money if you want to get them.

Guns and stab wounds can also cause [b]Mortal Wounds[/b] but they are not as severe as bosses' attacks are. Although to be fair that’s a good thing as every time I see a gun in a new [b]Yakuza[/b] game I get flashbacks from [b]Yakuza 0[/b].

There is also a ton of side content for you to do, like playing arcade games, mini-games, and side cases. The side cases were overall very entertaining to do and I loved each one I did, some of them were very funny and they fit the [b]Yakuza[/b] theme of being weird and outlandish. The arcade games to me were interesting but a unique one that I enjoyed was a game called [b]Kamurocho of The Dead[/b], which is a crossover to [b]Yakuza Dead Souls[/b] and [b]The House of The Dead[/b] series.
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2899835321
[h1]Soundtrack[/h1]
The soundtrack for [b]Judgment[/b] is honesty really well done and I loved the amount of good music that was implemented. It nails the aspect of the moment when a certain song comes, my favorite has to be the [b]Keihin Alliance[/b] theme

[h1]Graphics and Performance[/h1]
[b]Judgment[/b] is a beautiful-looking game and [b]Kamurocho[/b] is more alive than ever, I did experience some FPS drops while I was playing but a patch was later implemented to solve the problem. I tested the game on an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 3GB, AMD Ryzen 5 1500X Quad-Core Processor 3.50, and 16 GB of RAM. The game did run at a nice smooth 60 FPS when it was not stuttering
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2899835489
[h1]Final Verdict[/h1]
I highly recommend playing [b]Judgement[/b] if you have not already, especially if you are a fan of the [b]Yakuza[/b] series. I recommend this game at full price at that, but I think you should get the [b]Judgment[/b] bundle as you get this game, [b]Lost Judgment[/b], and [b]Lost Judgment’s[/b] DLC is for free when you purchase both games. A sweet deal that I honestly think is well worth the price as [b]Judgment[/b] never disappointed me in the slightest when it came to its story and gameplay. Something that I personally find a very hard thing for a game to do, and I am looking forward to playing its sequel.

There's way too much for you to do and unfortunately for more than half of the main story, the game keeps interrupting you by showing new side content.

I do want to say the English voice acting is extremely inconsistent in all aspects like - the volume, the quality and the sense of where the voices come from, the atmosphere and more. There's one to the point where a homeless person doesn't sound human at all.

Just play lost judgement (2nd one) and read a little bit in the character profiles to see what is up.

Normally the main character has 2-3 fighting styles all varying in speed/crowd/heavy but this game only has 2... slow and slower. There are no mini-games that are special to this that would make this fun. Example the hostess bar in 0 and kawami 2, The property game in 0, the turf wars in kiwami 2, the Rice cracker company in like a dragon, Nothing special.

But, Here's the things I did not like or felt like a chore:

- Tailing ( I never care for tailing missions in any game since GTA 3 it's been a filler kind of mission for me )
- Investigation mode in first person : I found myself caring much more to find those damned meowing cats in every scene than actually find the ''CLUES"" mostly obvious and easy to find.

The story, long cutscenes, impeccable voice acting are still very good so that it will probably help me get through these two very dull mode that I really despise, they are just fillers to me that should be skippable. They don't bring much fun for me.

Instead, you're a former Lawyer now being a Local Detective trying to solve murder cases and such (totally cool). 

Nonetheless, I wouldn't be too surprised if this game were made by the same creator... like seriously, take for example the side comparison.

[h1] Interactions with NPC's. [/h1]

[b] Shenmue: [/b] yes.. practically with everyone, including ones not of any importance related to the main story.

[b] Judgement: [/b] yes, but only with the ones you can befriend or are otherwise mission related (main story missions or side missions).

[h1] Toy Capsule Machine:  [/h1]

[b] Shenmue: [/b] yes, an ass ton of capsule toys to be collected in fact.

[b] Judgement: [/b] yes, but not nearly as many compared to Shenmue.

[h1] Arcade Mini-games: [/h1]

[b] Shenmue: [/b] yes.

[b] Judgment: [/b] yes, though very few are the same as the ones you can play in Shenmue (I wish the boxing one where you punch the target by timing the button press were in this game)

[h1] Playing Darts: [/h1]

[b] Shenmue: [/b] Yes.

[b] Judgement: [/b] Yes, but also easier imo.

[h1] Gambling: [/h1]

[b] Shenmue: [/b] Yes; Slot Machines.

[b] Judgement: [/b] Yes, but with Poker and Black Jack. Also other things perhaps.

[h1] Buying Food and Items at Convenient Stores: [/h1]

[b] Shenmue: [/b] Yes.

[b] Judgment: [/b] Yes.

[h1] Fighting gang members and such: [/h1]

[b] Shenmue; [/b] Yes, occasionally as part of the Story.

[b] Judement; [/b] yes, an ass ton, almost around every corner you get into a fight.

[h1] Chasing people down while evading obstacles with timed button pressing: [/h1]

[b] Shenmue; [/b] yes.

[b] Jedgement: [/b] yes.

[h1] Differences However: [/h1]

Shenmue's fighting system is a bit more combo ish, with each skill having it's own mastery level, in which you can strengthen by training in a Parking Lot or Playground. Also new moves can be learned from Scrolls and certain NPC...
   Judgement has Skills that can be bought and Obtained with SP that are gained from fighting Yakuza and such (no training in a Parking Lot, etc).

In Judgement you can go to Bars and Liquor Stores, get drunk and even use the Drunken Boxing style Martial Arts (sorta), but you can't in Shenmue (there are Bars in Shenmue of course, but you can't drink Alcoholic beverages in that game).

You can play Pool in Shenmue, but not in Judgment (in Judgement you can play Mahjong or some other type of board game).

In Shenmue there's a kitten you can feed and pet... In Judgement there are Stray Cats you can search for during Inspections (what's up with that? also kinda gives me the ""where's Waldo?"" type vibe lol)

In Shenmue you can get beverages from Vendor Machines and drink them (although pointless, since it doesn't restore health nor anything... but somehow oddly satisfying to watch Ryo Hazuki down a Soda in a few gulps); but not in Judgment, though in Judgement you can go into restaurants to buy food and beverages (in which actually does restore health).

In Judgement you can fly a Drone, and can also do Drone Races (no Drones in Shenmue).

You can smoke in Judgment, not in Shenmue (not a big deal to me of course, I don't give a rats behind about Cigs).

You can go to the Batting Cage and hit Baseballs in Judgement, but not in Shenmue.

[h1] Overall: [/h1]

There are perhaps other similarities and differences as well, but for the most part I'd say if you like Shenmue, then you'll probably really like this game too. that goes without saying of course, that in some aspects I think Shenmue is better, while also Judgement may even be better in other aspects.

P.S. I'm curious whom would win in a fight between Takayuki Yagami versus Ryo Hazuki... what's your thought's? I would be interested to hear in the comments below lol",1670537664,1670715746,True,20,1,0.690844595432281494,8,True,False,False

The Yakuza series, or Like A Dragon, or Ryu Ga Gotoku if you prefer) have formed a critical part of my life at this point. I started Yakuza 0 during the start of the COVID pandemic, and have been on a binging spree since then. I didn't own a Playstation however, so imagine my absolute joy when they just announced Judgement/Lost Judgement for PC. More Yakuza!

Judgement or Judge Eyes is an absolutely amazing spinoff that I really wouldn't mind seeing more of. It's clear that the devs didn't wish to be locked into just the traditional Kiryu plotline with these entries (despite going back to him anyway with the recent announcements lol). If you're wondering if the characters in this one are just as lovable as the old Yakuza games, don't worry, Toshihiro Nagoshi's got your back. 

If you're looking for more critical reviews, there's plenty out there. But if you ask me to list what I love about this series; 
-the Japanese aesthetic.
-the art direction of the locations (seriously, Kamurocho at night in the Dragon Engine looks absolutely [b] amazing [/b])
-the action beat 'em up gameplay (I still liked Yakuza 7 despite not enjoying turn based gameplay as much)
-Buff, muscly men beating the FUCK out of goons, sometimes shirtless, in almost every game, charming female sidekicks.... Hot characters in general, really. Obviously subjective.
-the minigames. THE MINIGAMES. They form 50% of the actual game. You can get lost in any one of the minigames as if they're actual games. You can play SEGA's arcade games in the game because SEGA's the publisher for the Yakuza series and they got the rights for it.
-the plots. Quite frankly the plots are batshit insane in every single game, and it goes so wild at times that after a certain point you slowly accept that these games really are just a fantasy version of reality, just so your suspension of disbelief doesn't shatter completely.

Honestly, despite the flaws in each of these games, the innovations they try with each new entry that both please and piss off fans, each of them is [b] such [/b] a treat that really, you owe it yourself to try at least one of the entries in this series.",1670306846,1670307543,True,1,0,0.50243377685546875,0,True,False,False

I feel like you get so much more out of it with the Japanese voice actors.

Obviously it's still a good buy, after all it offers dozens of hours of fun and quality gameplay, I was just left with the impression of a missed opportunity for something truly special.

However, when Judgment got first announced that it was going to be ported to pc I had my hopes up. After all, this will probably be ""the"" only franchise that will have actual combat based street fighting. It seems that RGG studios only have plans to do RPG-styled combat in their future Yakuza/Lad or other spinn-off games. So this looked pretty promising to the fans that Judgment will see a new light of day on pc. Only to discover a month later, that the agency for Yagami's actor: Jhonnys, had allegidly debunked that announcement made by Sega and claimed that the game will not be avalible on steam due to the privacy for their talents and actors. Which by then Sega had no choice but to own up to that word. This came as a pretty big shock to the community as evryone who loved yakuza games or liked the combat based fighting mechanics specifically had to go home empty handed. However here we are, not just Judgment but also Lost Judgment have both been released to steam. This meant that RGG studios has seen the cries of the fandom and blessed them by talking things through with Jhonny's to finalize this negotiation. So if you are one of the people who still enjoy the old combat system from previous Yakuza games and want to see something new and refreshing, then this game is for you.",1669501631,1669501631,True,18,0,0.666825294494628906,0,True,False,False

2058180,122265567,76561198141526077,59,5,1933,0,1814,1664635867,"[i](This review is written in comparison relative to all mainline Yakuza games (Zero -> 7) with exception of spin-offs & the sequel thus may not be as insightful to people that haven't played one of RGG studio's games)[/i]
[h1]TL;DR - Judgment is one of RGG studio's finest work[/h1]


[b][u]The Good[/u][/b]
[list]
[*][b]Combat [/b]- Being made in Dragon Engine (alike K2/6), the combat has undergone massive improvements whilst introducing new mechanics (wall jumps & flux fissures for example). Yagami plays distinctly different from previous protagonists with the two available stances albeit with slight hiccups on how both are designed. The combat truly starts to show its appeal when you've unlocked two combo speed upgrades & majority of EX/skills from the second tab.
[*][b]Story[/b] - This is probably [i]the strongest point[/i] of this game, and in my opinion has the best story out there. The story introduces lots of plot threads & manage to neatly tie it all together by the end whilst having the whole narrative grounded in reality more than any other RGG games; the story is paced neatly with slight intentional paddings here & there but it doesn't take away from the main narrative one bit. It does take awhile to get going, past the slow first few chapters, but it doesn't brake much after.
[*][b]Progression System[/b] - I liked SP systems in place which incentivizes exploring the town for side activities.
[*][b]Visuals[/b] - Amazing if your hardware is capable enough, the port is good enough performance-wise.
[*][b]Tiger Drop[/b]
[*][b]Friendship System[/b] - I don't know what to elaborate here but it is a really nice addition to the game.
[*][b]Masaharu Kaito[/b]
[*][b]Side Contents[/b] - They're still there, in abundance.
[/list]


[b][u]The Alrights[/u][/b]
[list]
[*][b]Music[/b] - Did not find much outstanding tracks up until the last chapter where most of the few bangers are from : I'd definitely have to re-listen to most tracks again.
[*][b]Photo Operations[/b] - One of the new mechanics that are added so you truly feel like a [i]detective[/i], nothing noteworthy and is used once (?) throughout the story
[*][b]Search System[/b] - Another arduous new mechanic in place for you to feel slightly more involved in what Yagami is doing.
[*][b]Lockpicking/Thumb-pressing[/b] - Alright in controls & in difficulties.
[*][b]Limited Medicine[/b] - They've removed sources of Staminan & Toughness XX & Royales while limiting the amount to 3 of each in its lowest quality variant - I don't mind it personally but it could be tough for people who need them.
[*][b]Story Battles[/b] - There are too less solo fights while too many group fights in the story.
[*][b]Combat Stances[/b] - Two stances in place while skills are designed mostly for one of the two (Tiger) - the other stance gets way too less love & is generally lesser fun to use with DE's ""attacks-bounce-on-block"" function.
[/list]


[b][u]The Bads[/u][/b]
[list]
[*][b]Tailing Mission[/b] - Tiring & probably the least enjoyable experience of the game. Personally, I don't mind it but can't help but sigh when the mission comes as NPC are dumb as rock & does one-dimensional routes with occasional turn arounds.
[*][b]Keihin Gang[/b] - [i]What if we make Majima Everywhere system but with a group of unlikeable chucklefucks with no way of resolving it in story?[/i] The four bosses/characters introduced in this are boring and fell flat while having their presence makes the encounter rate terribly high, with how street fights are rewarded these fights usually get in your way instead of anything meaningful
[*][b]Mortal Wound[/b] - No reason for this to exist - MW is basically a permanent HP-reduction debuff inflicted when you get hit by guns or bosses' finishers moves; it is a way to push a gold-sink into the game with introductions of MedKits.
[*][b]Denuvo DRM[/b]
[/list]


[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
Judgment is a must-play for fans of RGG studio & their games; it is a well crafted spin-offs that does all right they always did and explore more into narratives and game mechanics they've never done before. I understand that most of the improvements are made in its sequel but this is meant as a standalone review. 
[b]The game has no tie-in relevance or any reference to the mainline games' story[/b] & it serves as a standalone game or an entry point into the whole series. Game is worth the price even without sales.

edit: I'm now very close to actually beating the game so I need to get this out of my chest. This is, by far, the best story RGG has written as of yet. At least in my opinion.

I was honestly thinking that nothing would ever top Yakuza 0 but I am so happy to be proven wrong. RGG can write brilliant stories and engaging characters if they try hard enough.

The fighting mechanics are very fun & addictive, the world of Kamurocho is filed with activities, friends and fun, and the writing is excellent. Plus when you have a whole side case which has you chasing/apprehending a panty professor it shows the game knows when to provide a certain level of comedy.

What really makes it stand out is its protagonist. Yagami is a great midpoint between the excessively stoic Kiryu and the lovable Ichiban. He's charming, snarky, and shines as his own distinct character. 

As a standalone adventure, it's an excellent action RPG, boasting some outstanding storytelling and a brilliant cast of characters. And as a Yakuza spinoff, it's arguably the perfect gateway into SEGA's stellar series.

The game can get a disjointed and stop and start in parts mainly due to funds. One consistent problem I found was its battle between egging you to continue the main story versus doing some of the other substories. This goes double for the girlfriend questlines, mainly in part because they (among most of your other conteacts. Fucking Heihin guy for one example) will constantly bug you at almost every turn, even while you're at a pretty crucial part in the story.

Judgment manages to have that Yakuza feel while maintaining a grounded story. Their is no more tiger dropping tigers and tanking gunshots in heat mode.You play as Takayuki Yagami, a disgraced lawyer turned detective who aims to find the truth behind grizzly killings in Kamurocho. Knives and guns are your biggest threats as mortal wounds permanently looms adding a higher stakes in action packed long battles and boss fights. After two entries, the Dragon engine finally shows its true potential as the combat with Yagami is fast and fluid. The days of the clunky combat of Yakuza 6 are well and truly behind. If you plan on 100% this game be prepared to play a lot of Mahjong and you will get familiar with Dice & Cube.

The game is overall ok. Solid 6/10. At least it is better than Yakuza Kiwami, which is pretty much just recycled/water-downed Yakuza 0. But also note that this game is nowhere better than Yakuza 0.

I'm very intrigued by the plot, except the game decides to pause the main story mid-game and force you to do boring side-stories. I assume this is because the main story is too short on its own to carry this game. A lot of these side-stories involve you being a detective to either stalk people and/or play ""find the object in the room/image"" game, both of which feel kinda meh and a slightly annoying. I do enjoy the deductions. But sometimes I feel like the game wants you to deduct in a very specific order. At times you know what happened but you have to kinda guess how the game wants you reach a conclusion and select dialogues (show evidence) in a specific order. 

The combat feels really fresh. It does not feel like recycled content. But beware that the main character really loves walls. Apparently a lot of his moves are designed around running toward a wall and doing some sort of jump-kick. In my opinion this design just makes the combat feel less ""open"" than Yakuza 0. And since it is kinda difficult to pull off the jump-kick, mostly I just end up getting lazy and grabbing a bike to bash enemies. 

I'm also kinda annoyed by the Japanese audio. Not sure why but the English dialogue audio version of this game feels a lot more crisp than the Japanese one. In the Japanese dialogue audio, it almost feels like the voice actors are speaking through a thin blanket.

When a Tojo clan captain is accused of murdering a rival gang member, player character Takayuki Yagami, an ex-lawyer turned private investigator, is hired to find evidence proving his innocence, only to become drawn into a much larger conspiracy.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]

•	Gameplay is very similar to the Yakuza games, so if you’ve already played any of those, this will feel familiar.

•	Combat takes place in real time (like Kiryu’s games, not Like a Dragon’s turn based system). You’ll have to beat up enemies with combos of punches and kicks, you can grab and throw enemies, pick up objects like bikes and traffic cones to use as weapons, dodge or block enemy attacks, and successful hits will build up your special meter allowing you to perform various powerful finishing moves.

•	Combat is easier than most of the Yakuza games. After a couple of hours I put the difficulty up to hard, and even then the mobs that wander Kamurocho were quite trivial to defeat. The scripted story encounters and boss fights were more challenging, but I was able to win most fights on the first try.

•	As Yagami investigates the case you’ll need to use his detective skills in various ways. Search crime scenes for clues, reveal evidence during interrogations, stealthily follow suspects as they slowly walk around half the city, and perform QTEs during chase sequences.

•	In addition to main story quests, the open world contains lots of other content. There are side missions where Yagami takes PI cases such as investigating a cheating husband, protecting a client from creepy stalkers, or finding a missing person. Meanwhile many of the shop owners will ask you to help them deal with their problems.

•	If you want to take a break from beating up thugs, there are lots of fun minigames to play. Many of them have appeared in the Yakuza games, including darts, baseball, poker, blackjack, shogi, mahjong and classic Sega arcade games. Judgment also contains a few new games such as drone racing, an on rails shooter called Kamuro Of The Dead, and a VR dice game.

[h1]Story[/h1]

•	As usual the story is excellent, and well written. Yagami is a strong main character, his companions are all very likeable, and there are lots of other interesting characters including Yakuza, lawyers, cops, journalists and scientists. There’s so much detail, honestly the storytelling in these games is better than a lot of TV shows.

•	Main story cutscenes look very cinematic.

•	Main quest is fully voiced, and the voice acting is high quality, but the side quests are text only.

•	While the main story has a serious tone, many of the side quests feature the Yakuza games’ typical wacky scenarios.

[h1]Technical[/h1]

•	It took me 57 hours to finish the main story and around 70% of side quests.

•	I didn’t have any problems with crashes or framerate.

•	Controls work well most of the time on my Xbox 360 gamepad, although it took me a while to get used to dodge / quick step requiring you to press both RB + A (I’m sure in previous games it was just the A button). And the two lockpicking minigames are almost impossible using gamepad thumbsticks, so I had to use mouse and keyboard for more precise control.

•	While searching crime scenes, a couple of the clues where so small that these scenes turned into pixel hunts as I moved the cursor over every inch of the screen, still didn’t find anything (even with the ability which makes the gamepad vibrate when you’re hovering over the correct area) and I actually had to consult a guide to progress.

•	The game seems to be in a permanent tutorial mode, as after every fight you’ll see a message appear in the bottom corner of the screen offering you hints about things you’ve already done dozens of times, and I couldn’t find any way to disable this.

[h1]Recommendation[/h1]

Judgment is a great game, the gameplay is mostly enjoyable despite a few small annoyances, and the story is excellent. There’s plenty of content to justify a full price purchase.

There’s no connection to story or characters of the main Yakuza series, so if you’re interested in these games but don’t want to catch up on 8 games worth of lore, this would be a good starting point.",1668984541,1668984541,True,57,0,0.799433469772338867,3,True,False,False

However, one thing that I must stress to my very core is the very real passion, love, and care that went into crafting this game. It may not have enough horror, depending on your taste, and some people may dislike the heavy emphasis on the action aspect of the game.

But as continue to play through the game, you'll realize the delicate structuring of every detail that was put into this piece of art. Every area within this game is so stupidly detailed with the new RE engine, and it can't be praised enough for it's style.

I absolutely loved Yazuka 0, Kiwami 1, Kiwami 2 and Yakuza 6 (haven’t played 3, 4 or 5).  It was refreshing to go back into that world with Judgement.  It's got the same gameplay loop as the aforementioned games and that is definitely a good thing.  Combine that with an excellent story and well written and fleshed out characters and you’ve got a real banger.  The game gives you a lot for your money.  It took me almost 55 hours for my first play though so I got plenty of bang for my buck especially considering the quality on display here.

Judgement is visually pleasing, ran super smooth for me on my system and the battle mechanics are tight and well thought out.

Nothing is perfect, however, and I did find myself getting a little overwhelmed towards the end of the game with all sorts of side missions, friend quests, dating and whatnot.  This isn’t a criticism of Judgement as much as it is a criticism of all the Yakuza games as the actual story is serious, intense and urgent, whereas the side content is utterly ridiculous, far out and zany.  This juxtaposition can cause confusion when you are at key moments in the story only to go off looking for a panty thief or lost cats.  This is what makes the Yakuza games so endearing and unique to other titles, though so it really is up to you when you complete side quests and how you choose to experience the game.  

Loved it.  Added to my favorites.  Recommended if you enjoy open world beat em ups with a good gritty story and well drawn characters.",1668495785,1668495785,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

From start to finish, this game has been nothing but a roller coaster, and that's the best way to describe it. There's some slow parts within the story that you may feel the urge to take a minor break from but then they'll throw something in your face that absolutely blows your mind to reel you back in. Takayuki Yagami is an excellent character with tons of depth, and his friends Kaito, Higashi, and Fumiya have this natural energy to them, which makes for tons of comedic moments throughout the game. The idea of law in general initially turned me off, but as time went on, I began to appreciate it and develop an interest in it.

I've been a little spoiled for animations and faces recently, so my usually high opinion of their face and movement animation work is less stellar than it has been in the past, but as a whole Judgment still looks very good. 

The music didn't really stand out to me, unfortunately, unlike in the mainline games. I liked the start-of-chapter review stuff a lot, it helped keep everything in focus when I had to take a few weeks off the game and return in the middle of chapter 10. The story was definitely less convoluted than in the LAD games, but this meant that some of the really goofy moments (highlights of the LAD series, imo) felt a little off-key. But the combat might be the best they've done in this engine, it's definitely superior to 6 and K2. It's fast, fluid, and fun, even if the positional stuff (like wall rebounds) take a minute to get adjusted to. 

There was one section, late in the game, where you were required to learn a certain mechanic of an area, and if you fought the boss of the area without utilizing the mechanic, you were (unfairly) punished by making your attacks miss. Also, as a hint: your strongest move, flux fissure, cannot be chained into bosses. They'll just stumble. I did not have a boss encounter where this was not true.

Things i disliked: Instead of making an entire new soundtrack sometimes they re-use tracks from previous games like Yakuza 6, the substories are not that interesting they lack variety, it almost feels formulaic; talk, tail then fight.

Also the tailing missions become boring the mechanic gets shared between the campaign and substories, and they make less sense since you have a drone, why don't use that instead?!

I hated this story, worst one out of the 5 yakuza games i've played and generally liked for their main stories. Yakuza games are normally pretty realistic with the drama presented in their main stories (or at least that is the impression that i got), but I could not stand how unrealistic any of the court situations were in this game. Some examples: People literally monologuing from the audience, evidence being brought in mid case and ACCEPTED???, the attorneys cutting each other off in the middle of the opposing side's statements, attorneys unaware that there even was certain pieces of evidence submitted, etc... the list goes on and on and on about how cringe worthy these scenarios were.

This story also had the worst pacing i've seen in a Yakuza game leading me to not care about the characters. My main gripe is from the way the beginning of the game was structured. There was a flashback that was half way through the story, but i wish it was put into the beginning of the game because it tells you no new information and gave more of a backstory to the main character.

BUT i still give this game my recommendation because all of the side content was great (except for the tailing portions of the missions, not a fan). The amount of dialogue and tangible interactions with the side story characters while walking around the world made the side stories in this game feel really well integrated into your actual gameplay experience.",1667360279,1667429345,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

The story was amazing, however the combat didn't feel like it had a very high skill ceiling considering you would just spam your OP items you get which I am guessing were some kind of DLC but they kind of completely broke the gameplay once I realized they were actually infinite. You have about 7 or so dlc items which give you super god-like powers, literally summoning lightning from the sky and insta kill destruction. I just used those and all fights became childs play and there was no reason for me to continue doing side-quests to gather money and xp.

Talking about XP, I found the system lacking. I'm probably wrong but for some reason it felt like there weren't a lot of stuff to unlock. There were few things to unlock but A LOT of grinding to get it.

Yagami had really nice combat moves though, they were different from the Yakuza series but it also felt a little lame a lot of the times that he had the exact same animations as Kiryu.

Talking about Yagami, I really enjoyed him and all of the other characters in the game. As I said, the story was really great and so were the characters. There was even a ""buddy"" system in the game, however, it wasn't really good and I thought that Yakuza: Like A Dragon did it way better.

Being constantly attacked in the streets is no new thing for this series, however now it felt REALLY annoying. There's this gang that is after you and not just random thugs, however sometimes their leaders will appear and defeating them will remove the meter and make the attacks happen less... for a bit. Yes, you don't take them down, you just win the fight over them and later it will happen again and you have to defeat them again again and again just to get some air whilst running from mission to mission. It would've been way more interesting to have a system where you take down their leaders one by one and they're permanently down like in Yakuza 0.

Being in the perspective of a detective really helped this game, it was really interesting for once to see Kamurocho in a different angle, however the tailing missions were probably the worst addition they could've ever added. You do SO many missions where you literally just walk behind and npc and hide from them when they look back, and they go on for WAY too long and you do them way too much. I have no idea what they thought when they added this in. And it's not like it is only for some side missions, no, it's for a lot of the main missions as well.


7/10

This really just feels like Yakuza 6 except you're stuck in Kamurocho the whole time and the writers stamped a detective story with a new cast of relatively bland characters over everything. If you're hoping for any kind of gameplay innovation, there's none here. The combat is nothing new and the mini-games are everything you've seen before, apart from drone racing.

The writing is slightly less over-the-top than mainline Yakuza games. The characteristic Yakuza machismo is subdued and it feels more like you're playing a cookie-cutter Japanese TV drama, which I guess some people probably like, but overall the story and main character seem like an awkward fit for a a beat'em up game. The plot is slow to develop and I didn't find myself captivated by it.

I really tried to like it, I completed it - even with some side quests - but in the end I feel disappointed.
The strongest point is the story, but the way it's presented it feels like 90 % sauce, 10 % meat. 

All the Yakuza games worked because it was about Yakuza and not some state conspiracy AND because it was Kiryu or Majina - dead serious mobstesr - who did the dancing and singing. Yagami is cool but everything feels too generic from him.

So please RGG Studio: 
- less talking, or at least less verbosity! I can remember a fact when it's presented the first time, I don't need 3 reminders in the first dialogue, 5 another dialogues Yagami going around and telling people that fact, a ""what happened so far"" every chapter, only to have another summary during a group session with the boys in the Yagami office.
- make combat fun! erase all the brakes like the dodgy locking, camera...
- add better quick travel and mobility features
- while the game is pretty, the lighting looks PS2
- give NPCs a route instead of having them randomly turn around every time ...

Edit:
To be fair, some good points:
- story as a whole is nicely writting and smartly intertwined
- characters are pretty nice and have a ""reason"" for existing

In this game you take on the [b] role of Japanese detective/ex-lawyer Yagami[/b], who returns to the courtroom to help exonerate the captain of a yakuza clan. But in the search for evidence, a possible connection between the captain and the murders caused by The Mole is discovered. The captain, of course, denies these allegations, but something about the aggressiveness of his response convinces Yagami otherwise. And that's why, after proving his innocence, [b]he sets out to find the true identity of the mass murderer[/b]. An interesting story is accompanied from beginning to end by a lot of twists, action scenes and music which makes the game that much greater

[h1] Gameplay [/h1]

After a long time you can switch between multiple combat styles.  Crane style which focuses more on [b]speed and is very useful against groups of enemies[/b] who don't know the concept of blocking. And this is the big weakness, because it is enough for one of them to block and the whole combo is stopped and the only solution is to switch to Tiger style, which is a bit slower, but [b]stronger and focused on accuracy.[/b]

[h1]Soundtrack[/h1]

The soundtrack definitely enhances the experience of the game, and every time the music started playing at the start of a fight, I empathized with Yagami's motivations and fought like everything was at stake. Rather than describe each ost individually, I'll leave a list of my favorites here:

The combat, although a bit janky, is way better than what we've gotten in Kiwami 2 and 6. It is so much fun to keep switching between styles and just beat the crap out of people. The story can be a little too predictable, but it's enjoyable nonetheless, and the characters are enjoyable. ""Cases""/Side Quests are great for Yakuza standards.

[b]Judgment[/b] is, without a doubt in my mind, one of the finest games that Nagoshi's Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio has assembled. It was worth the wait for this port to PC. You owe it to yourself to play this game as a Yakuza fan. I almost feel inclined to say that if you haven't played the Yakuza games, starting with this one would potentially hurt your ability to enjoy the others in the series, despite not having direct-ties to the main-line series. That isn’t to say that the others are bad, per say, but this game, along with Like a Dragon, feel like the culmination of everything this studio has learned.

When I played Yakuza 0-6 in that order as they were releasing on steam, I felt this jarring feeling in the back of my mind that I was watching a creator’s evolution; 0 was an insane high-bar of content in terms of story, gameplay, and side-activity. Playing 1-5, after, felt like I had just read an author’s latest best-seller and then went back to read all their previous books in the order they were released. I saw all the tropes, mistakes, and lessons-learned. Getting to 5, 6, and Like a Dragon (hands down the best games next to 0), filled me with only one thought: More. I wanted more.

Judgment is more in a way I never knew I wanted. Apart from the star-setting of Kamurocho, none of the original cast returns, not even a cameo. As much as I loved the references and callback moments of Like a Dragon, Judgment was made with confidence that the audience would enjoy this game’s cast and story without needing help. It stood proudly on its own, and I have so much respect for that determination. A lesser studio would have had our new cast run into one or two characters from the old blood at some point, and the fact I eventually didn’t want that to happen speaks volumes, considering the original Yakuza cast are some of my most cherished video-game characters ever.

Gameplay is another triumph for Judgment in terms of confidence on the studio’s part. Combat-wise,  we have finally received the best of both worlds: 0/Kiwami’s fun, dynamic stance-system combined with K2/6/LaD’s modern engine. It was the biggest hurdle for me to get over when I played K2 and 6; tha feeling that something was lost when the stance-system was retired. Yeah, we got the polished visuals and physics, but we lost the depth. Judgment brought it back, along with a fun arrangement of 0-tier side-content. Like all the best in the series, I was lost for a handful of hours in the side-content, and unlike most western RPGs, this never felt like a chore or an obligation for leveling-up. I was delightfully gobbling up content wherever I could find it, because I knew I was going to find quality wherever I looked after my first few hours back in Kamurocho.

The story is harder to talk about because I want you to play this game and not read anything that touches on it, but I want to say that completing Chapter 1 felt like I had just cracked open a premium bottle of wine, and I wasn’t going to chug it, but, rather, savor every moment. RGG had a vision for Judgment, and that vision needed its own vibe, and what a vibe it was, lads.

What I'm trying to say is that whether or not you like the [i]Yakuza[/i] ""formula"" is almost certainly going to determine whether or not you like this game. If not, you are unlikely to get any enjoyment out of this title. If you do though, it's really more of the same good stuff you like.
 The ""investigation"" elements, if you can call them that, feel extremely shallow. None of the dialogue choices actually make any difference; getting the wrong answer in the main story just prompts Yagami to try again. Apart from getting to zero health, the only other way to get a Game Over is if one gets caught during a tailing/photograph sequence. As you can imagine, the tailing sequences themselves are somewhat tedious, involving walking behind someone and taking cover when they look backwards. So, it's safe to say that this is definitely not a big genre-bend from the previous [i]Yakuza[/i] games.
Of course, the most important things in the [i]Yakuza[/i] ""formula"" are enjoyable fighting, plentiful side quests/mini games, and side-splitting sub stories. Well, this certainly doesn't disappoint in that regard. The fighting has been tweaked somewhat so that Yagami is more of a glass cannon than previous fighting characters, and so are the enemies. This means fewer health bars to break through, but equally it means your own health must be kept in check. It makes for a faster-paced gameplay style, and I do quite like it, even if it is more challenging. As with the characters in the recent [i]Yakuza[/i] titles, Yagami is able to switch between fighting styles. There are only two of them here, which reduces the variety somewhat, but also makes things a bit simpler. The ""mortal wounds"" element is an attempt to mix things up, but it's just a bit of a pain in all honesty. It's all too easy to get hit with one from a gunman right after the start of a random battle, forcing a trip to the underground doctor and goodbye to 20 grand. The Keihin Gang is also somewhat annoying. I wouldn't mind fighting these guys every so often, but it seems you're getting a call from Kim about them every 5 minutes or so that they're back in town. There's no real story arc with them either; it's basically just a way of farming materials needed for making ""extracts,"" which is another new thing added into this game. At least extracts do have their uses, so it may be worth collecting the materials for them if you find they help you out, or you are just a completionist.
Any slight disappointments in the battle system though are made up by the fantastic story this game has, including all the various investigations you can do, with genuine laugh-out-loud moments. All of the characters are really nicely written, and I just think they did a really fantastic job of it. In conclusion, this game is absolutely worth getting if you want a slight twist on the old [i]Yakuza[/i] formula with a great story and enjoyable gameplay. Steer clear however, if you are wanting to play a game that's truly in the ""investigation"" genre. Recommended, 75%.",1666195832,1666196229,True,3,0,0.518794775009155273,0,True,False,False

Combat is great and manages to feel like a natural progression of previous Yakuza games while also being able to feel unique with the addition of new specialised moves to fit the newly introduced protagonist you play as in Judgment, Takayuki Yagami. The story is another classic for the Yakuza series involving many plot twists that keep the player engaged to find out what happens next. Unfortunately, the pacing also receives the same treatment as other games in the series with big story beats being mixed up with side cases that you cannot skip. This does not take away from the story in any massive way but it does impact the player experience. I would recommend Judgment to anyone who is a fan of action/beat 'em up games or to anyone who is interested in the Yakuza series.

Yagami having two fighting styles which is Tiger Style for Big PP Solo Target Damage and Crane Style for kinda AOE EX Actions and EX Boost is a nice change from Kiwami 2, my only real complaint being Crane having nothing truly giving it an edge or something unique in the skills menu and it staggers a lot outside of EX Boost, outside it's inherit kind of AOE damage normals and EX Actions, There are some skills that apply to both fighting styles although nothing that only focuses on buffing or giving Crane Style something new, but it still is useful for dealing with multiple mobs, up to 3 with a couple or few EX Actions and if you like varying up your attacks like me e.g. not spamming Flux Fissure, as fun as it is too watch 2 bars of EX gauge fill while deleting an enemy while drunk(being intoxicated is a buff with skills that gives extra EX Gauge), it get boring after a while personally.

Combat is great, maybe a little easy throughout it all, first playthrough was ~55 hours on Hard and my ~90 hours is padded because of some afk in some session, exploration and premium adventure. I was able ignore damage upgrades till chapter 5 for the first upgrade, 8 or 9 for the second and 12 for the last since i had every other skill. But that was just my experience with Hard Difficulty and only upgraded damage when I felt it would be a needed because the enemies quality in the random fights were getting higher and a certain side-case in the later chapters rewarding 1.2 million yen really made me grind a little for that second upgrade.

For a few nitpicks, nothing that really affects my overall impression of the game just somethings that slightly bothered me. I feel like there could a little more EX Actions, reduce some of the animation times for the EX Actions unlocked later, reduce the frequency of the combat event with a toggle or something and make some normal attack prioritise over EX Actions. 

I really miss Kiwami 2 Kiryu's 4 directions dodge heat actions, they were awesome, would've been cool to see Yagami's version of them.

Some of EX Actions animations lengths were a quite long while visually it's awesome and stimulating, I get a little impatient waiting for them to finish, mainly the Stunned Enemy> Ex Action and Ex Boost> Battle Stance/Lock On(R1)> Ex Boost, other than some animations being a bit too long they're great. 

The Combat Event happens too often and I sometimes just ignored the thugs and just did my own thing, there are some tricks to avoid fighting but I never used them as I still enjoy fighting more than not, would be great if some kind of toggle or frequency reduction was available, the random fights are fine, just the frequency of the event is too often.

There are a few EX Actions that take priority over normal heavy attacks, personally I just wanna soccer kick a low health guy without using my EX Gauge to punt him into the air or make him speen with a EX Action kick, or using the Drunk EX Action instead of the infamous counter from previous games, It's a little annoying but not that bad either since EX Gauge is easy to build once Flux Fissure is unlocked and the EX skills upgraded makes it easier even without Flux Fissure.

The new Deadly Attack/Mortal Wounds systems is interesting but I think it doesn't really do anything in the long run except be a minor inconvenience when you can just use any medkits, even the smallest medkit to regain access to your full health bar and heal up using the plethora of items available, or avoid being wounded completely by running far enough or doing a wall attack depending on the attacks.

Extracts are a cool idea, never really used any since outside of the DLC ones and growth extract and even then I barely got the KamuroGO challenge done by the final chapter, mainly Fire and Lightning Fists, Instant kill for when I'm feeling lazy during the Combat Event and the healing one when I'm running around Kamurocho and being frugal with my Yen. Wish I found a use for them to make crafting the other ones feel slightly more important, jumping over(from a skill) or grabbing enemies works easier than using an extract.

Trailing is okay, not my thing and wish they happened less often and/or were shorter. Lockpicking and thumb turn bypass are okay, lockpicking is more fun too me, had to use my mouse for both since my controllers analogs have spasming problems and precision is tedious with that hardware debuff, still love my 5 year old DS4 controller tho.

Paradise VR, I really didn't like overall, as the only source of large amounts of Yen which in turns means SP later on, it was just boring counting to 6 over and over and luckily i got all skills before I needed to grind baseball multiple times for play passes, only had to grind 6 or so from the goliath home run challenge to get the final battle skill, still hopefully Lost Judgement is better when it comes to SP grinding, I'll find out soon.

The Story, I enjoyed it a lot, I always keep my expectations for stories low regardless of genre and game to keep me entertained, The story was engaging for me, had to use my brain trying to figure everything out answering questions with the current info I was given each chapter. I won't say much because spoilers but it's definitely worth playing just for the story, but beating ass and the side case dialogue are worth it also.

Pros:
>One of the best combat mechanics in the entire Yakuza Franchise next to Y0 and Y5 combat is easily a 10/10 (They even brought back tiger drop fuck yeah)
>Actually really good story, it's not as mindblowing or tear jerking as the previous games in the yakuza series but they know how to write good plot twists. The story does have it's moments. story for me is 7.7/10
>Performance wise this game is actually really well optimized thanks to FSR was able to game with my gtx760Ti before i switched to my gtx1050ti. So for potato pc gamers out there you have hope

Cons: 
>Grinding can be very tedious, especially since your main source of money is the D&D game which is very rng, and since this is the Remastered Version all previous money grinding exploits have been patched out rip, so yeah have fun grinding the damn board game for hours on end. 
>Reusing of assters, look I have nothing against reusing of assets if it's done well but there's just some things here in Judgement that should be original, mostly talking about the enemy boss movesets almost all of them has re-used moves from previes titles like one of the Keihin Gang Leaders having Shibusawas moveset from Y0. And the music, look man we had the same side quest/case music for nearly a decade now, please RGG studios use something else.

That's all for my review ,I really recommend this game bias aside. If you liked Yakuza 0, Kiwami 1 and Kiwami 2 then this game is a must buy for you :).

""...Detective work?""
""Great idea! Let's make a whole game out of it!""

This is the best RGG game since Yakuza 0. It feels like all the best minds at RGG got together, listed out all the cool thing a past Yakuza game has done, and iterated on all of it in one game. 

Every element of this game feeds into other elements. The friend mechanic from Yakuza 2 is taken to its logical conclusion here. Friends help you out around town, give you discounts, and even lead you to additional friends with their own substories. Remember the ""Murder at Cafe Alps"" substory in Yakuza 3, where you had to link people, places, and information together to figure out what happened? This entire game is built around that idea. I've had several instances where I didn't know where to go, so I talked to someone I had met in a past substory or friend mission, and they actually gave me useful advice. This is a detective game that actively rewards my intuition. If you're somewhat familiar with Kamurocho, try playing with the minimap turned off. The game often gives you enough details to figure out where to go without the marker.

The core of the combat here is really good. Your moves usually have great impact, the animations are extremely fluid, and the heat actions are satisfying. Yagami's Crane style is the coolest thing since Majima's Slugger style in 0. The combat is more slow and deliberate than past titles. Your rush combo loops indefinitely, and every finisher has multiple parts. This encourages you to slow down and think about which attacks you're using, rather than spamming a full rush combo and whatever the last finisher is.

I do have several criticisms.

Context sensitive combat actions don't always work right. Wall jumps sometimes result in Yagami just flying off and attacking nothing. Flux fissures sometimes just don't trigger. This seems most common after an enemy is staggered, which is particularly annoying because that feels like the best opening for a flux fissure.

Mortal wounds just shouldn't exist. They only slow down the combat, waste your money, and waste your time running across town to get them fixed. Wall jumps are recommended to attack through them, which makes it doubly annoying when your wall jump just doesn't hit the enemy.

The English voice acting isn't great. One, a lot of the background and combat voices are still in Japanese. Two, some of the casting choices are questionable, most notably Yagami himself. Yagami's Japanese voice is husky and tired sounding, which fits his character. His English voice is the most generic white dude imaginable. Three, when the casting choice is good (like with Nanami), the direction isn't great. Scenes that should be full of emotion come off as awkward and stilted. I wouldn't normally even mention the voice acting, but English is enabled by default in this game (unlike previous titles, where it wasn't even an option).

All that said, the only thing stopping this from being my favorite game in the franchise is the combat being a little sloppy in places. This game is incredible, and if you've enjoyed any other Yakuza game, you need to try this one.",1665630779,1665630840,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[h1]Pros[/h1]
+ Great port, runs smooth
+ Great graphics
+ Likeable cast
+ Great story
+ Drone racing is fun

[h1]Neutral[/h1]
+/- Some side stories are good, but a lot of them feel quite repetitive and forgettable
+/- Cool fighting styles, but one of them is superior than the other in virtually every aspect
+/- Yagami is cool, but unfortunately less interesting than the characters of other games
+/- There's very little challenge, both with combat and the investigation aspects

[h1]Cons[/h1]
- Mortal wounds forces you to carry special medkits and make regular trips to a clinic
- Detective/investigation aspect is quite... uninspired
- A completely pointless mechanics in the form of a keychain, where you have to memories which keys to use on which doors
- A really annoying mechanic that mass spawns enemies in an event that frequently recurs
- Combat is a little dull compared to its Dragon Engine cousin YK2. You use pretty much the same attack combinations most of the game.

i just finished judgment with almost all complete, at was long, but very worth it.

judgment is a game that you play a lawyer that gets his name smeared, due to a case he won and was believed  he had made the wrong decision by the public's eye, only to find a month later a tragedy happened that made him doubt everything he believed in.
Queue 20 years later as you find the protagonist working as a detective solving small cases for rent, but soon finds his past scars to come back to the surface...

That's about all i feel comfortable to say about the story.

Gameplay wise if you've played yakuza well welcome home as it's based on the lovely dragon engine where you play in a action street brawl/ detective work solving crimes with RPG elements, but with the characters flair in the mix.
The action part as you play the protagonist Yagami, will feel it's much more fast paced compare to past installment as Yagami is a small framed character and uses speed over brawn making it refreshing after so many installments playing Kiryu bulky power style, it's no where near a bad thing, but it's night and day with the style difference.

You'll use what you have at your disposal to dispatch the enemies coming at you, whether it be hand to hand marshal arts, to batons and tonfas, even a bicycle and street signs.
As you win brawls you'll earn money and experience to buy new skills.
As for the puzzle segments you'll embody the character solving mysteries, by following targets, gathering clues and piecing what happened.

Ontop of that in Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio fashion they littered the game in mini games.
The list of games are:
Space harrier
Outrun
Viper pit
Vritual fighters 2, 2.1 (fixes to OG) and 5
Motor raid
Fantasy Zone
darts
Shogi
Koi Koi
Oicho-kabu.
Poker
Black Jack
Batting cage
Mahjong (multiple variance)
Ufo catcher (claw game)
Kamuro of the Dead (spin off mini game of house of the dead)

Outrun used to be a pinball machine, but due to licencing issues they replaced it (a shame cause it was very unique to see in a yakuza game)
And Virtual Fighter 2 used to be Puyo Puyo, but was replaced to unknown reasons i could find.

Graphics are beautiful and just benefit from being enhanced by PC's power.
I did noticed that their are some graphical/ proformance bugs, but the devs are actively working and have fixed a some
1. poker would not work on unlimited frames (now fixed)
2. unlimited frames froze my character in mid punch.
3. with AMD fidelity on there will by some pixelation around seams of a room or windows at certain angles when the camera pans.

solution to have a smooth experience?
1. don't go higher than 120FPS (120 is butter smooth)
2. don't turn on AMD fidelity (playing on a RTX, may be different on AMD hardware)

Originally had it on ps4, but due to the disk drive failing, i couldn't play it anymore let alone finish it, but to some miracle Sega managed to be able to FINALLY port the game to steam.
Reason i say a miracle is the voice actor in Japan that plays Yagami, his agency were incredibly apposed to pc gaming and having any of their products on pc, making it virtually impossible to have a port if not none, same goes with Lost Judgment (The sequel)
So you can imagine when i found out the suddenly it poped on steam how much i was jumping in happiness.
NOT ONLY do we get the first, but the second as well?!
Good job Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio and SEGA you made impossible, possible, making so many fans and new comes able to play this gem.

My conclusion?
I adore Judgment, Great game play blending street brawling with detective work, amazing story and so much content.
To me this is the one that made me fall in love the Yakuza franchise, i have such a appreciation and regret having slept on it not trying Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio games till 2018 when Judgment first came out.
i implore newcomers that on the fence to give it a try, and to buckle up cause it's a LONG journey through the Yakuza series.

While the other mainline Yakuza titles have been carried by brilliant characters like Kiryu and Majima, Yagami and Kaito are as forgettable as the 4th protagonist in Yakuza 4. 

This has not been helped by the fact that the switch to the Dragon Engine has come with a noticable downgrade in cutscene quality. Just like LaD, this game is padded with ugly automated cutscenes, with all of the budget seemingly saved for the (admittedly amazing) finale.

This is also the first Yakuza game I've played where I've barely touched any of the side content, a blasphemy for any Yakuza playthrough. Perhaps this is because I simply wished for the mediocre story mode to end as soon as possible or maybe I'm just tired of the formula, but it did feel like there was a general lack of minigames outside of the abysmal VR and Drone flying which I dropped after the tutorial.

RGG studio is gradually running out of Yakuza 0 goodwill for me, but here's hoping that the upcoming Lad8 and Kiryu prologue are good.",1665436437,1665436437,False,3,1,0.377415716648101807,0,True,False,False

- Solid combat system, similar to Yakuza, but still unique
- Nice graphics
- Excellent story, very engaging
- Side-content is also very fun (I still don't understand majhong after 5 Yakuza-like games)
- Yagami is an absolute badass
- Ace Attorney-esque moments
- Perfect port performance

What I dislike :

- The skill tree doesn't really feel great to level
- The difficulty sometimes seems very random
- Poker and Blackjack are rigged I swear to god
- The weird picture/art/season card game elludes my understanding. (Skill issue)

Overall :

This Yakuza spinoff game is great. The story keeps you entertained from the beginning to the end and the side cases and relationships events are actually interesting. It's a close contender to Yakuza 0 in my eyes, I seriously hope to see more of Yagami.

On a more positive note, the combat is excellent - animations are top-notch. Main quest is awesome, Yagami is a great protagonist and I have loved every minute of the story so far (even if the writing is a little rough around the edges at time). Side quests are fun and (mostly) well written.

Judgement story wise is as incredible as you can expect from the Yakuza series. Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio doesnt miss. This may be one of my favorites and possibly my favorite story in all the Yakuza Franchize. Its incredible. Some of the greatest characters and antagonists in this surrounding corrupt people, the corrupt medical field, and much more. I do feel certain parts dragged and in certain moments side missions were forced into the story. Beyond that, those are my only complaints story wise. 

So now for me to be slightly unfair but to say something for the rest of the game.

Combat is what you'd expect for a Yakuza game with two stances, and a whole new fighting style of course. However, one thing felt strange and clunky. One Tak often wont lock on to enemies worth a shit which can be very frustrating. Two, as much as I love the new wall attack stuff (run up to a wall, spring board off for a devestating attack) I found it not that often to be used, and also made dodging awkward because you have to hold R1 to dodge. I felt this kinda made it awkward. A little one trick pony move that dont get me wrong has many options from grab to heavy and options out of it, I still felt didnt add to much and made that whole thing awkward.

Mini games are lacking I found. (which is big for a Yakuza game, Id especially say in repeatability)  There is a dice roll type VR thing I did not find to be that great. Theres, the usually Mahjong and Like a Dragon like gambling, and drone racing. The drone racing is like an ariel go kart from Like a Dragon. The other parts of this game do feel like reuses of Yakuza 6, as well as parts that have just better versions in Like A Dragon.

To finish this off my only big complaints I can attack this game on. stalking missions (which there are far too many of and its boring as hell) and investigation sections. My feeling towards the investigation sections are eh. Not a big deal honestly. They often were kinda interesting, but other wise frustrating and led to a few moments where I searched it up because sometimes what they expect you to do is ridiculous and without much intuition or direction. This will lead to you running around the room trying to find your little clue, which can time to time feel like a needle in a hay stack. Then theres the stalking missions, that there are far too many of. They are very crap missions where you follow someone without being spotted, going space to space to hide behind cover. They are boring, and sometimes straight up frustrating. They at times made me feel like it was a chore to get back to enjoying the game. The Investigation sections also sometimes had that effect too. 

Oh, and the ""parkour."" Yagami is very nimble and does a bit of stunts you see. Hes quite fast and can climb over things. This add a few additions in the map of construction areas allowing you to climb over them and run between them. It also allowed you to jump up on cars which also have there own little interaction take downs and such which I thought was nice. It was seemingly weird though and not a big deal to add these areas. I feel it kinda took away from parts of the map and was pointless. Also, theres smoking now, but its kinda useless. As is also eating and many other things now. It just kinda add to your health? I found it nice in Kiwami 2 that it seemingly almost made me want to eat at every location because it gives me skill points. Which speaking of skill points... [b] (yes I know this is turning into a tangent paragraph bare with me) [/b] there isnt much variety here. it just a points system of stars. You open your phone and do a pretty linear upgrade tree. I was not that impressed with its skills either. It was a major downgrade from past games. I think it was even a major downgrade from Yakuza 6, but I cant recall certain parts of it well.

Overall, Judgement is an incredible and amazing game. (imagine that, Ryu Ga Gotoku only makes amazing games? noooo)
However, outside its incredible story adventure, feels like a downer in the series. This is me being a bit harsh because, well for Yakuza game standards its a step down and backwards in many directions. (let me mind you this being a spin off that came out after 6) IT FEELS LIKE IT WAS A SIDE PROJECT. Which I wouldnt be suprised if it was, and well idk if its because its just now coming out on steam and its older now, but it does hold a smaller price tag. This is irrelevant to the verdict however, and I am in no way saying this game is bad whatsoever, its just the opposite of the peak of the series in many areas and kinda feels like a small little spin off that did absolutely incredible in every other area that which being its story and a lot of its missions.


GANG WARS ARE SHIT AND ANNOYING. Basically optional areas of purple show up and these annoying gangs want to always fight you. It feels like a shitty version of MR. BIG BUCKS or whatever their names were in the Kiwami's. Also, a turf war happens chapter to chapter basically. An old guy will annoyingly call you over and over again for help. This is the Yakuza of Fallout 4's ""Another Settlement needs your help."" I do NOT CARE. O.O

9/10 - Better than Yakuza 4 & 6? Yes. That makes this the bottom of my favories, it also has like one of the best stories in the whole series.

Having played most of the Yakuza / Like a Dragon series games and enjoying them ""enough"", I can say that Judgment is probably the first ""action-style"" LAD game that I found myself wanting to play again.

If you liked the Kiryu saga of LAD, the gameplay here is similar... But it's so refreshing to see the gang wars move a bit to the side and experience a story that's a different side of Kamurocho. I find Yagami relatable as a protagonist, and Yagami and Kaito together as a likable ""buddy cop"" duo.

And the gameplay changes from Kiryu's LAD are welcome, with interesting detective sections including chases, searches, and tailing.

Some frustrations include the lack of good healing items, broken encounter rates, and the occasional too long fight sequence. The Keihin Gang content is probably the most annoying in the game and I sometimes found myself just running from every encounter because it got boring.

For the good: The story is fantastic once it gets going. It's a nice mystery story with some amazing moments near the end. However, there is A LOT of filler. The main story is stuffed with cutscenes where our main cast sits down and sloooooowly discusses what you just heard from a different character, and the first half of the game is so slow with very little progression towards the actual mystery. The finale is one of the best in the series, but the lead up to it is painful.

The gameplay is great. It may have taken a few games but RGG finally figured out how to make combat on the Dragon Engine work. The only negative is the annoying ""mortal wounds"" system. Basically, if you take a hit or get shot, you get a chunk of your health bar permanently removed until you use a med kit or see a doctor. It's not a big deal, but it still adds more running around you have to do.

The only other bad thing I can say is that the encounter rate is WAY TOO HIGH. The game has a system where everyone once in a while, the city will be put on ""high alert"" and encounter rates will triple until you beat a few bosses. It was fun at first but as the hours dragged on it got very annoying very quickly, and there's no way to disable it.

Overall, if you liked the Yakuza series, you'll probably like this one too. It's got the same style and presentation, just with a more mature story.

We’ve come from having some spin-off titles having no international release and main titles in the franchise having the international release delayed by years, to getting almost day one releases worldwide and future announcements that get so many people excited it would’ve been hard to believe this just a few years ago.

Judgment is the first game that is set in the same shared world as the rest of the Like a Dragon titles that has absolutely no “Like a Dragon” in its title. It was originally released on PS4 in 2018, has gotten an enhanced Remaster on current gen systems juts last year and now is finally available on PC, released the same day as its sequel Lost Judgement. And I have to be honest, even though I like these series in general, I truly loved only 2 Like a Dragon games so far and unfortunately, being extremely long titles, I did get somewhat tired of them last year when I finally wrapped things up with the PC port of Yakuza 6. Even though I’ve heard great things about Judgment, I was still afraid that it will tire me out. Instead, it has become the third game in the franchise that I consider exceptional.

At its core, Judgment is a typical Like a Dragon game (apart from, you know, when it plays as a jRPG) – it’s a story-driven action adventure set in an open world that isn’t particularly large, but dense with details and stories. The combat is still somewhat jRPG-ish in how it happens, as during normal city roaming enemies just get randomly spawned to walk around and if they catch up with you, you enter combat that controls differently and the only ways to end this are to lose, win or try to escape. Combat itself remains, as it is in most titles, very beat ’em up/fighting game like, with combos, usage of weapons you find lying on the floor, visible health bars, special attacks and all of that stuff. Bosses that have more health and special abilities of their own are, of course, also still here and the big new addition for this whole system is that sometimes they can give you “permanent” damage, that cannot be healed normally.

But despite the lack of big changes in the basics, there’s a lot of new ideas and approaches in Judgment to the point, where it feels unlike a Like a Dragon title. Sure, one of the fighting styles private detective Yagami (the main character) uses is reminiscent of the feet-heavy style Shun “Best character in the series” Akiyama has, but playing is Yagami is anything but playing like Akiyama. Being a detective, a lot of tasks Yagami-san has to accomplish required a new set of mechanics and Judgment does most of them well. You occasionally get to tail people, hiding behind corners and blending with people. You get access to two lockpicking minigames, one of which is really fun and the other is a big miss. The chase sequences return, being really well done this time around and a far cry from when they first appeared in the franchise and were terrible. You get to investigate scenes in first person mode, sometimes while using a drone for more advantageous perspective, and a lot of these are fun. There’s a disguise system that is criminally underutilized despite being really cool. And during some scenes and dialogues you get to perform some simple clue compiling and getting to the conclusion in the most efficient way possible.

And the tone of the story and all of the side-stories is also expectedly fitting a detective tale, not a… whatever situation Kiryu, Majima or Ichiban often get into. What I especially loved was how a lot of these stories are now evolved to not just tell a nice story with memorable characters, but many of them often get a continuation or connection to other stories, creating the illusion of a real community in Kamurocho (the setting of the entire game, returning from previous titles). There’s even a really amazingly cool little epilogue story that happens when you’ve made all possible friends and helped people with lots of cases. And the “girlfriend” concept here too is finally feeling more like an interaction with a proper character, than just a mechanic for stats, with all available “girlfriends” getting genuinely interesting stories that you follow.

That said, it still feels very… “girl is a prize”-ish and essentially stops any and all character nuance once you’ve succeeded and you can’t “just be friends” either. I wouldn’t have noticed or even cared if it wasn’t so far into becoming a genuinely great element of the story, instead of just a slightly more advanced and well written mechanic. Sadly, the aforementioned Friends and the rewarding epilogue story require you to grind a lot of stuff you might not be interested in. I mean – why do you need to play lots of poker to get a really wholesome side-story? Why lock it behind so much stuff most people will not enjoy?

So yeah, Judgment isn’t entirely free of the usual faults of the Like a Dragon title. Fights do get more annoying than fun or challenging as the story goes on. Some systems and ideas become more convoluted for no reason, despite starting with a perfect balance of complexity. And the story isn’t free of occasional overtly dramatic moments that don’t really add anything to the storytelling.

Yet. And yet. I couldn’t help but feel that Judgment might be the most “new player friendly” title in the franchise and, overall, the most… well… FUN. There’s no prerequisite story or world knowledge required, even if knowing the world of Like a Dragon adds to it. The combat system is very easy to understand and the skill system is very streamlined without too much extra stuff. We only get Kamurocho, which remains perfect as far as the size goes, so by the end of the game you will most likely understand where the street you need is without looking at a map or a goal pointer. And it hits all of the best story points you expect from a Like a Dragon title and a collection of really good characters. Personally, I’ve enjoyed this cast far more than that of Yakuza: Like a Dragon (now probably to be known as Like a Dragon 7: Like a Dragon?..) and Yagami-san is easily one of the best protagonists in the franchise so far.

So, if you haven’t played a single Like a Dragon game before, I’d say – Judgment is the ideal starting point. I used to say Yakuza 0 or Yakuza 4 and I still consider those titles to be the other 2 best games in the series, but Judgment is just so much better as a jump off point for any series newcomer. And if you have played the series before… Well, if you like it, you’ve probably played Judgment already and know how great it is. And if you don’t – give Judgment a try as it might be the one that gets you hooked. PC port is fantastic, so now there’s no reason to not get this game anymore.",1665005623,1665005623,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

1. Lack of shirtless actions: Yakuza boss fights often end up with men tearing off their shirts and punching the shit out of each other. Yagami never loses his shirt for some reason. In Lost Judgment, we do see a couple of shirtless men fighting, but I think Yagami might be a never-half-nude.

I'm always blown away by how incredible these games look, and the fights in game are as impressive as ever. Not to mention the boss fights and cutscenes, some of them are so intense and well choreographed that I feel like I'm actually enjoying a movie. Extremely immersive storyline, characters you can really get behind and actually care about, and it's set in an environment that I already know and love, so it feels like I'm right at home. The humor in this game absolutely hits a home run, too. I can't help but laugh at some of the ridiculous things that these developers come up with for side quests.

To be honest, I wasn't sure how I'd feel playing a completely new protagonist in Yagami, as I've been so attached to the Yakuza series for a long time now, and getting to experience this world through Kiryu throughout the last few years, I was worried that I might feel a little biased in that regard, and possibly not enjoy this game as much due to this. I'm happy to say that I was wrong. Yagami shows so much character and personality, and to see how strong of a bond he shares with those around him, as well as how he chooses to bear the weight of responsibility of his past, was extremely moving at the most critical moments, to say the least. This is such a fresh experience, and easily is able to stand on its own as a standalone series. 

I only have a couple of gripes about the game in general, but they're nothing that ever discouraged me from wanting to play the game. First off, though I'll say the vast majority of the detective aspect of this game was super fun and appealing, the tailing missions are a little bit...awkward. In the sense that maybe it could have been designed slightly differently as far as being punished when an NPC realizes that you're tailing them. You can in most instances, literally run up to someone, they'll notice you and start watching you nonstop, until you find a hiding spot. As long as you find a hiding spot, it didn't matter how close you were to the person, if you were running at them or not, everything would be OK. They'll say something like ""Must've just been my imagination..."", and eventually be on their merry way, and the tracking bar eventually goes back down to zero like nothing ever happened. It was always just a little too easy to get through these, is all. I still enjoyed the experience, as it's something that was entirely new, but it was a little bit awkwardly executed, I feel.

My other gripe is how often a certain group of people come to Kamurocho, and how often a certain someone texts you to let you know, ""Oh, they're here! It's awful!"" ""We need you to stop them!"", so on and so forth. Didn't matter how many times you took care of these guys, this stuff here is the only thing that got particularly annoying and repetitive, and I wish it would have been approached slightly differently. Maybe eventually this stops? I'm not sure because as of the point that I finished the main story (the time of writing this review), I haven't done all side quests, etc, so I can't be for certain. I guess more than anything being texted by the same individual over and over for the exact same thing while doing other quests and such was a bit frustrating, particularly when I was going through the main story, as it always felt quite distracting at those times.

All in all, I have to say that if you enjoy the Yakuza series/world in general, and are eyeing this series as a possible purchase, absolutely do so. It's strong enough to easily hold on its own, and I'm looking forward to enjoying more from the Judgment series in the future.

Definitely worth playing for anyone familiar with the Yakuza franchise or not. You don't have to play any other games to know whats going on in this one.
If you do decide to play the game, at least in the later parts, i would definitely recommend abusing the unlimited use elixirs you get for free in your mailbox because the combat can be quite unforgiving and there really isn't anything you can do about it other than buy a shit load of food/meds to heal every 20 seconds.

I wrote a review for Lost Judgment and I will write the review to Judgment right now.

I heard a lot of good things about this game but I said to myself I should keep the bar to a minimum. Mind = blown. The game was EPIC.
The story is great, the developers put a lot of hard work but they nailed it.
The characters are awesome. Yagami is so badass. One of my favorite videogame characters ever. The chemistry between him and Kaito is so on point.
The gameplay is cool. The fact that they made Yagami a parkour combined with martial arts character is such a win. The battles and the moves are so awesome.
The music is cool. It keeps you on the edge of your seat in critical times. 
For me, this game is one of the best games I've ever played along it's sequel. In my opinion the Judgment series is much better than the Yakuza series. As I said in my Lost Judgment review, I like Yakuza too, it is cool but I dunno, it lacks a certain something that Judgment series have.

Side cases(sub story) are your usual RGG's sub story, funny, weird, and sometimes a little sad. 

Combat is fun, you can air juggling now. There's only two styles but all the heat action along with the ex heat mode more than made up for it. A lot of them can be fit in the combo seamlessly too.

PREFACE:

At the time of writing this game has only been updated once. As the TL;DR indicates the technical complaints may go away in the future (hopefully) but as it stands right now this is my assessment.

TECHNICAL:

Out of all the video games I have ever played this one has had the most frequent technical problems. Every time a new area loads the game locks up for a while, sometimes a minute, and sometimes a ""not responding"" prompt from Windows even pops up. Very rarely the game shows mercy and instead lets the framerate drop. The game has crashed many times while loading new areas and there were two cases where a save file corrupted and caused an infinite loading screen. I believe my PC is good, and it was able to run Yakuza: Like a Dragon, which features a considerably larger map, with no real issues compared to this. The Drone Racing minigame goes to a black screen very often for some reason.

GRAPHICS/SOUND:

The graphics aim for realism and do it well. I'm pretty sure that most of the people in this game are modeled after real people. I don't think the soundtrack has as many memorable songs as some of the past games though. Overall there is nothing to think too hard about let alone complain.

COMBAT:

The combat is in general okay but a bit weird at times. Wall jumps can lead into attacks but these often cause the player to rocket off in a random direction and getting the aim right requires more finesse than should be needed for a game in which combat takes place primarily on narrow streets and indoors. The criteria for a wall jump is also inconsistent. Sometimes running at a wall does nothing and sometimes you can initiate a wall jump while standing still. 

There are two styles in this game, somewhat of a return to form to 0 and Kiwami's style. Unlike in those games there are only two styles. There is the good style and the other style. The good style is called Tiger. It's the good style because it is faster, does more damage, and has unlockable perks unique to it, whereas the other style doesn't. The other style, Crane, is slow and if a hit is blocked, it stuns you for a second. The only reason to use Crane is to break up a crowd of enemies so you can switch to Tiger and start the real beatdown. I feel like the developers gave more love to Tiger than Crane which is quite sad because a crowd-control style was done quite well with 0's Breaker.

Thankfully, the Tiger Drop is shared by both styles.

Something I don't like is how items are distributed. There is only one variant of the healing drinks (e.g. there is Staminan X but no Staminan Spark) and you can only carry a maximum of six which seems like a bit of an unneeded restriction. There are medical kits that heal a lot of HP but only one guy sells them and it's very inconvenient to have to go to him for this basically essential set of items.

Medical kits also are important because some attacks leave ""mortal wounds"" that decrease max HP, and the kits bring it back to normal. The idea of enemies that could semi-permanently decrease max HP was cool when bosses and a few enemies with guns could do it, but it became very annoying once these gun-toters started showing up on the street because, again, only one guy in the whole map sells medical kits.

The last thing is Extracts. They're potions that cause various effects like making you fight better or reducing the number of enemies on the map. They're interesting as an idea but I didn't use them too often.

EXPLORATION AND SIDE CONTENT:

You are limited to Kamurocho in this game. You will not be going to Sotenbori, Onomichi, or any other district within urban Japan. That's fine because I don't think the plot gives any opportunities for that, and I don't know if this game could handle multiple cities with its technical performance. You have the typical minigames like batting, mahjong, and the arcade games, with some new additions like a rail shooter and a VR fight zone. This is the Dragon Engine, though, so no fishing. 

There's a special important minigame called the Drone Race. You collect materials and buy parts for it and it's a big part of the side content. It's ultimately not too interesting however, because all you do is steer the drone around a route within Kamurocho and hit booster pads. It's not very involved and half of the tracks are literally the other half but backwards and with some changes to the booster pads.

Another thing that returns from 0 is friends you meet on the street. The benefits are a bit more tangible here, since your friends grant you access to rare items, new Heat (or rather, EX) Actions, and even come to your aid to fight on the streets, which is a real improvement. There are a few people you can romance as well, but unfortunately love has no gameplay benefits.

The system for substories is slightly revamped in that the majority of them are found by going up to someone who pulls up a list of substories for you to pick, similar to how you unlock a sidequest in the Witcher. It's a bit annoying because you will frequently check these rather than encountering the substories organically on the street (which still happens but at a greatly reduced rate).

The piece of side stuff I really don't like is the Keihin Gang. Every now and again you get a text message alerting you that the Gang is coming and then the enemy encounter rate quintuples until you find and defeat a bunch of street bosses who are all really far from each other or until you wait 20 minutes or so. There is no way to stop it and it gets very very annoying after the third or so time. It's like a bad version of the Powerful Foes from 6. At least the Powerful Foes only showed up one at a time.

PLOT:

The storyline follows a model set by some of the later Yakuza games, working with the ideas of vast conspiratorial webs incorporating politics, organized crime, and things that on the surface have nothing to do with either. 

The difference here is that instead of seeing this through the lens of the criminal underworld itself you are a law-abiding (for the most part) detective, and hence this is more like a noir film than a crime drama. There is convolution but not a lot of it. It's interesting to see how the style of the previous games fits into this new skin and I enjoyed some of the hardboiled detective flairs they added. They even have an opening monologue ruminating about the city and its crime and all that. I enjoy it a lot and it gets real weighty at times but not soul-crushing, a balance Yakuza is good at striking.

Despite the stylistic similarities and a shared universe, you do not need to play any previous Yakuza/RGG game to follow the plot, and the game does not have spoilers for such.",1664505282,1664505282,False,6,0,0.489263981580734253,0,True,False,False

There's a few extra mini games (from the Sega stores).
Sub Stories and Main story are now called 'Cases' which isn't much. There's a lot of detective work you need to do. Sometimes the game hands you the hints on the map, sometimes you have to work it out based on what you know of Kamurocho. But at the end of the day, you're back in Kamurocho which hasn't changed all that much.

You make friends now, with their own little quirks and requirements. Eat at this store X times. Introduce this character to another side character you meet (by making friends).

Its fun. It's Yakuza. The combat feels a little, floaty? Delayed? I'm not sure how to state what it feels like. You will do a 2x combo of light attack, see the enemy ignore your attacks and throw a punch. You try to guard and it's delayed. 7 out of 10 times I will take damage from the first swing. Dodging also feels delayed. I will dodge during and attack and Yagami will either not dodge far enough, or the enemy will track your movement and hit you anyway. But it is still quite fun.

Leveling up skills is now done via SP (skill points I think?). Eat a plate of food from a store, get ##SP per plate. Use that to level up the normal kind of stuff. Battle prowess, general 'life' skills or mini game skills (like drone flying or lock picking etc).

If you liked Yakuza for the gameplay and quirky story/theatrics then I reckon you'll like Judgement. If you liked Yakuza for Kiryu as a character, I don't reckon you'll like Yagami too much. If we use Kiryu and Ichiban as a scale. Kiryu being a solid 10 in seriousness and Ichiban being a 1. Yagami is dead in the middle at 5.

What I liked the most about the game is that it has really good story plots.
It's a spin-off, so the gameplay itself is identical to the previous Yakuza ""[i]Like a Dragon[/i]"" franchise with some new features, which I think it works very well on this game.

I'm delighted to see [u]Takuya Kimura[/u] as the main protagonist. I've watched many of his Japanese dramas in the past and I think he is a terrific actor.

Needless to say, Sega's [b]Judgment[/b] can easily be one of my favorite games.

On one hand, it's one of the best stories RGG has put out to-date - it's not quite as emotionally heavy as Yakuza 0 or 7, but Judgement makes up for it by having overall excellent story structure and delivering extremely well on the crime investigation aspects. If you're a fan of Ace Attorney or the times the Yakuza games get into that territory, you'll be right at home.

On the other hand, I'm conflicted on the side content. The game reintroduces the Friend System, where you do things for people around town to increase your rep. In the Yakuza games that used it, you could befriend shopkeepers and they'd give you access to a special attack while you're fighting near their shop, like stuffing a goon's mouth full of spicy chicken. Judgement expands on that by adding more possible outcomes, such as additional locations and facilities for you to use, as well as people that'll roam the city and help you out in fights directly. This is a genuinely good expansion on the friend system, which is more than I can say for the other additions.

The sidequest quality is just below 0, 7 and Kiwami 2. Good, but not great. My absolute biggest gripe is with the minigames; hardly any new additions, tons of removals (THERE'S NO KARAOKE) and one of the new additions is both the most-frequently-required minigame as well as one of the worst minigames RGG has ever put out. The tailing minigame gets old extremely quickly and I genuinely hope this game gets a mod that lets you skip it. It's an incredibly low-stakes stealth minigame that is far too forgiving and does nothing but slow the game down. There's also a Mario Party-ish board game minigame that becomes your primary source of money and EXP once you're done with the game, but I largely ignored it and I haven't gotten around to the meat of it. At a glance it's alright.

The combat isn't perfect, but it's still pretty damn good. Unlike previous titles using the Dragon Engine, you've actually got multiple fighting styles - Crane, which is for dealing with crowds, and Tiger, which is for single-target fights and small groups. They both feel great once you expand their movesets a bit, but there's a very noticeable lack of upgrades specialized for the Crane style. Most upgrades augment both styles and behave differently depending on which one you're using, but Tiger has a bunch of upgrades that drastically alter what it can do. Eventually you'll be spending all but a few fights entirely in Tiger style, it just becomes that much better. Tiger style alone still plays better than Kiryu's Dragon style in Yakuza Kiwami 2 and 6 though, the focus on agility feels great.

Overall the game's excellent with some fairly large holes in it.

Edit: It's worth mentioning that every single issue this game has is fixed in its sequel, Lost Judgement; fighting styles are more distinct and have a large amount of upgrades for each, the tailing minigame has gotten a massive overhaul, the sidequests are mostly-excellent and there's far more minigame variety.",1663692376,1664437530,True,17,0,0.677225053310394287,0,True,False,False

They aren't games so much as cheesy soap-opera episodes sprinkled with dull mini games to give the illusion of playing a game. A great example of these illusory tactics is the map. The map is so tiny the game shouldn't even really have one and would be better off as a linear series of events for purposes of story progression. One can  easily run the map end to end in roughly 2 minutes of real time. The map is so small it just becomes an annoyance. There is nothing to discover or explore its so small, so why make the player run back and forth across the same boring and constricted landscape? To make the game feel deeper and larger than it really is, that's why. Its like going camping in your backyard... No fucking point unless your backyard is more than 20 acres of wilderness.

The difficulty level is also a joke. I play on the hardest difficulty and still barely even need to heal myself after battles. These ""fights"" or ""battles"" consist of picking up whatever trash or object is around to bash your enemies, and mashing out meaningless spam combos that don't require any real timing or execution. The other ""mini games"" are just glorified quick time events, chances to spot the difference between things, or requests to find waldo yet again.

The games strong point is style. If you like the certain style and dynamism that only Japanese media can deliver than you might find these titles palatable. Lots of meaningful stares and shouted proclamations amidst crazy action scenes and acrobatics. However, that's about it from the strength category.

I'm going to try and finish the game just to see how the story ends, but could easily see myself getting bored before that happens.

I'm a big fan of RGG Studios and their games, the Yakuza franchise. So this review will be very biased and may change when the post-nut clarity kicks in. But what I'm feeling right now, this is one of the top best video games RGG Studios have ever created. The usual things RGG excels at, great open world, great combat, great content, great soundtrack, and great visuals. My only gripe is only on the main plot but thats only purely focusing on the story. The overall story in a wider context is just great and one of the best I had. These are all the qualities RGG Studios had in all of their games.

You play as Takayuki Yagami, a detective and ex-lawyer, searching for the truth about the serial killings that are happening in Kamurocho. Throughout investigating you'll find interesting reveals. The story and mystery is fun to see unfold. This game is very cutscene heavy but have masterful direction and cinematography, so better bring some popcorn. I have my gripes but I'll get to the downsides. Characters aiding Yagami are Kaito. an ex-yakuza and partner, Mafuyu, Saori, Hoshino, and more that are just very lovable and likable even to a fault, Reaching to the end of the story, I found myself wanting more from these cast of characters and to be frank quite dissapointed I didn't get to know MORE about all of them, which says a lot. The main character, Takayuki Yagami is also kinda cool. Didn't get alot of development but is servicable. The sequels will probably explore more on his character.

Combat in this game is fluid af. Unlike past games where you control a brute hitting people like a truck, Takayuki Yagami is fast and have these kung fu moves. You have to styles you can change to which each have different movesets and specials which is the Tiger Style and Crane Style. Tiger Style is more suitable for one-on-one situations meanwhile Crane Style is more for crowd control with large sweeps and kicks. The moves you can do are breathtaking to look at and some will trigger these special cutscenes, typical Yakuza fashioned brutality.  Other than fighting, you explore the district of Kamurocho filled with adult nightlife. In typical Yakuza fashion, there lots of fun sidequests, or in this game sidecases to experience, minigames, and more. Side content in this game are more like the second campaign you can do either after or alongside the main story which is the serial killings. You can make friends (finally) to level up your reputation which in turn will give you more access to more sidecases. The sidecontent in this game is one of the best I had in any video games.

Although this is a detective game, this game is not another Ace Attorney or LA Noire game that really tests your cognitive abilities and more of a crime drama the series is known from. So sometimes moments in the story will not pickup by the characters the sameway it is for the player. On to the downsides, but this is more from a personal note, the story is kidna dumbed down like the main character not knowing a crucial information and meanwhile the player, which is I, know that information. So the moment of reveal when the character finally know that said information is kinda.... meh. But thats just my personal experience.

The soundtrack is okay. I do have one that is in my playlist but other than that, it is all good. Being a standalone franchise branching from the Yakuza game, there is no need to know about past games since nothing from the past is here except the setting. Also while comparing this game and the past, I am more of a fan of sad, emotional moments from the past games, which is not present here since the main story is more focused on solving crimes, law, justice, good and bad. That's why I don't have any strong emotional connection to this game, but that's just my personal taste. 

Overall, a great game that is probably going to be overlooked.

In the world of Yakuza, we take the role of Detective Yagami, a move that really freshens up the original action/rpg/comedy formula. His fighting styles are a bit more elegant perhaps, but of course no less comically brutal than Kazuma's. So far the main story has been good enough with several interesting new characters on display. Kamurocho is as usual packed with things to do besides following the main story missions. Side-missions have become Side-cases, still very much reminiscent of the former, bound to make you laugh at some points. There are the usual arcades, the batting center, dozens of restaurants, stores and bars, the new drone races - one of the more major mini-game additions - and more. The Tokyo-neighbourhood has really come a long way over the years and now I even enjoy just walking around in-game looking at the density of neon-signs and possibilities. I don't really know what else to say besides that the hours will keep ticking up, for weeks if not months ahead, while I keep enjoying Judgment. Great game to give a go if you want to see what Sega studio Ryu ga Gotoku's games are all about as it starts from a new beginning story-wise. As a longtime Sega-fan, I knew I would get this immediately if it was ever ported to PC though, so my grade is:

Judgment is an AJRPG - Action Japanese Role Playing Game (with adventure elements) that is set in the same universe of Ryu Ga Gotoku / Like A Dragon / Yakuza, but as a spinoff and is NOT part of the mainline series. It was first released in 2018 for consoles, and very recently in 2022 for PCs. It is developed by RGG studio, also responsible for all the other RGG games, and published by SEGA.

[b][u] Graphics, Environment Design [/u][/b]

Judgment is developed on an updated variant of Dragon Engine (same as Kiwami 2 and 6) and as such, looks absolutely phenomenal when compared to the previous engines used in older games pre-Kiwami 1. The absolutely stunning graphical and technical capability of the engine exacts a substantial toll on GFX cards, however the existence of FSR 1.0 and 2.0 for PC version means it is easier to run across a wider range of hardware, weak to strong.

Judgment's environment is primarily the one and beloved Kamurocho - a very well-done, true to life recreation of Kabukichou, with a few other select locations for purposes of progressing the story. While daytime isn't making an absolutely strong impact, nighttime Judgment's Kamurocho has a different...vibe to it that Yakuza 6 and Kiwami 2 and even LAD does not possess at all, driving home its uniqueness relative to the mainline entries.

[b][u] Story, Character(isation too) [/u][/b]

Judgment follows the tale of freelance detective Takayuki Yagami as he tries to uncover the truth behind a series of murders in Kamurocho that is deeply entrenched in a massive web of conspiracy that could shake the nation of Japan to its core. Without spoiling the story whatsoever, Judgment fulfils the interactive part of a detective thriller show as well as the protagonist self-insert in the form of Yagami, where players follow his story and footsteps; and it does so VERY WELL.

Even though it is only just one game that this review is talking, and that it is just a spinoff, RGG has managed to create a highly compelling cast of characters, not just Yagami, drawing from both camps supporting and fighting against the protagonist, in true RGG fashion.

[b][u] General gameplay [/u][/b]

Judgment's primary gameplay is the same as the Yakuza main entries - kicking and punching the shit out of people, with extreme style and violence. Specifically, it blends the critically well-received multiple style mechanics of Yakuza 0 / Kiwami 1 with the general gameplay / physics  of the Dragon Engine. As a result, the protagonist Yagami can make use of two different styles, Crane and Tiger.

The addition of lethal enemy attacks that reduces max hp until rectified by a doctor or medical kit, as well as wall jump attacks and even mobile attacks around the enemy adds a lot of both novelty and fresh air to a potentially stale combat system. The usage of charged attacks (light and heavy) is reminiscent of older games (Kiwami 1 in recent memory) discourages button mashing same combos over and over.

The general difficulty is also higher as well, with HARD difficulty being potentially comparable to other game's LEGEND mode. This may shoo some away, for it may catch them by surprise unpleasantly, or woo some for the added challenge. Personally, although RGG games aren't known for being intentionally difficult on the same level as Dark Souls, I welcome this change. There is no shame for playing on easier difficulties either since this is the case.

[b][u] Soundtrack [/u][/b]

There is not a lot to say about the soundtrack of Judgment (same for other RGG games because I'm not well-versed with music theory unfortunately) other than that it is about on par for the course relative to RGG's main entries (in my personal opinion). Most tracks have a more gentle, chill sounds as opposed to the more wild, rocky vibes from Kiwami 2, for example. If I were to quantify the strength of an impression that it left on me, I would say its just about equals Kiwami 1 and 2 - I remember roughly the same amount of tracks across all three titles.

Can't take it for granted though so RGG deserves praises for putting out an excellent output with quality consistency equalling other RGG games.

[b][u] Personal nitpicks and final verdict [/u][/b]
I personally dislike that:

1. You CANNOT buy sodas and drinks from vending machines - you can in other Dragon Engine games.

2. There is no karaoke (minor nitpick because it is seemingly justified - the actor for Yagami is supposedly very costly to hire for SEGA)

3. The Keihin gang attacks are a bit annoying - or rather, it is an ineffective replacement for perpetual SP / exp combat farm.

4. The tailing missions are a bit one-note and not very dynamic. It would have been nicer if tailing missions allowed taking cover at almost any location rather than blue-marked spots and/or encouraged the usage of drones. AI taking a round path around a block seems like its emulating a real life person checking to see if they've been followed, but its just a time-sink in a video game. We ought to have a balance between realism and fun for games always.

All those things aside, virtually every other aspects of Judgment is very well done, and makes for a very compelling experience that leaves you wanting to power through it (at least in my case). If I were to rate this with game considering all pros and cons, as a RGG fan, then I'd say that Judgment is a [b]STRONG 8/10[/b].

I liked RGG studio enough that I bought it full price without discount. A 8/10 might be grounds for a full price buy for some, but for most people it might be wait-for-sale. You don't have to get it full price, so long as you experience it sooner or later. Sale or not, it doesn't particularly matter in my opinion.",1663371016,1664098356,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Judgment feels like a transitional game very similar to Yakuza 3, where a lot of new features are being introduced and they don't really click until later entries in the series. Far too much of the game consists of boring tailing and running sections, the combat is pretty limited and the plot is all over the place. The game also has problems running above 60fps, where some minigames don't seem to work properly.

Baseball indoor batting couldn't hit the ball due to a stupid aim system that felt impossible with a controller .
Poker was good but i have no idea how to play .(  that my fault not the game ) 
Dart's is almost impossible with standard dart set as its like aiming at the board with the worst shake's in your life.

The VR dice board game was awesome really liked that one.

Fights with main bosses are awesome but street fight's get little bit repetitive due to lack of verity

All in all I have to recommend judgment though due to the face animation being superb .

The game has a lot to offer compared to other games I have played not surprising since this is from the same people who made Yakuza.

So If I could rate this game out of ten I would give it a 8.5/10. It takes itself seriously and then at the same point you will be forced to bond with a child. It is stupid sometimes and over the top but honestly that is the charm of the game. I just want to say the pros and cons real quick.

Pros:

Combat - Unique with two unique styles which change the style of combat instead of Yakuza where it usually has more impact, this focuses on speed and movement. SO you will be moving around quickly in the air like a monkey pouncing onto dudes constantly. It is addictive.

Story - Quite unique following a ongoing elaborate case of ""what you would do to justify your goals?"" However most of the time with some of these segments you will be interrupted from a serious scene to a music tone shift which focuses on comedy. It happens often in the early game and it can be quite jarring.

Soundtrack - Very unique soundtrack especially the theme for ""the mole"" but honestly with the amount of reused tracks there are for certain sequences, They have a lot of variety. I suggest listening to a couple of spotify, since some are absoulte gems.

Side Content - It is Yakuza side content, silly, wacky and weird however not necessary to complete (most of the time)

Clan Encounters - At random points you will be contacted that a rival gang is out on the streets looking for you, why is it good. Well if you need higher chances of being in encounters plus the luck potion you can have a easy time farming. However it can get annoying when you are on other important missions like main quests and they pop up.

Now THE CONS:

First 6 Chapters - I have no idea how but this introduction is so weak. It helps you get to characters and settings but after your first tailing mission it sends you on a  bunch of meaningless fetch quests and just when something intresting is about to happen you are pulled back to do a mandatory side quest. Here is my question...why?! It is the only way to progress and sometimes you have to do an additional 2 or 3 which take 20 or more minutes. Look I understanding waiting around for info but this is ridiculous.If it happened once in the introduction I wouldn't mind but this happens for at least the first 6 chapters before it starts to ignore it. I dislike it extremely.

Trailing Missions, Lock Picking, etc. - Now I understand trying to diverse a game's options and mechanics but sometimes it feels pointless and unwanted. If these were only used sparingly or well optimized maybe it would have been better but sometimes you have to be close to pixel perfect in order to pull off some of these missions. As side content that makes sense but as most of the mechanics it feels annoying when it pops up for the 50th time.

but other than that the game works as intended and is really fun...I just wish you know some of these methods didn't keep prompting up. Also I listened to this game through its english dub and subtiltes I think it is fine, if you disagree fight me.

Hope this will help you if you ever think about buying it. Personally I recommend it.",1663202528,1663915831,True,2,0,0.522792398929595947,0,True,False,False

If I had to nitpick, I'd say trailing missions are a snooze, Yagami can seem kind of bland at times and the combat could use a bit more polish to remove some of the jank and flesh out the different styles a bit more.

However: This game just isn't as fun as any other Yakuza game.
Yes, I'm a major sucker for Kiryu, Majima etc. but that has 0 impact on why I'm not a huge fan of this iteration.
I wasn't a big fan of Like a Dragon, but surprisingly enough I've sunk more hours into that game than any other Yakuza game.
I can't see myself throwing as many hours into this one as any of the others.

Kamurucho is glorious - Further more it's nice being able to ""parkour"" around the town, and take some of the small ""shortcuts"" into side alleys that we've never been able to before.
Whenever I played a new game, it was always one of the top things for me to figure out: ""What has changed this time around"" and for the most part it hasn't disappointed me.
The major grief I have with the town is the removal of Karaoke - Why couldn't they have left out Mahjong instead? xD

Tailing is probably the worst ""game mechanic"" I've ever experienced in this universe since they turned the series into a flawed RPG game (Holy fack it's flawed). It seems pointless, slow and it's just plain horrible.
It's even worse than unskipable cutscenes/dialogue.
Next up is the entire investigation crap...
I get it - We're a detective yada yada yada. But why does it have to be so horrible?! And now we have to present our case to convince people of A, B and C?!?

The fighting styles suck - Yes, I haven't unlocked that many skills yet, but they're so clunky and slow. After finishing a combo he'll just stand there for 2 hours while being open to attacks.
The lock-on system is a major downgrade compared to any of the previous games and the new EX meter sucks.
And don't get me started on the freakin' drones.. I thought I wasn't a fan of the toy-car races but seriously.. fuck that drone - And fuck having to scout out areas with it too!
While not having a real impact yet, even on hard, I can't see any reason why the new wound system is in place. It seems weird and horrible at the same time.

Some of the, few, things I welcome in this game is some of the new mini games (zombie shooter is amazing!), the more nimble character (actually being slim enough to go through narrow paths lol) and the removal of weapons/gear but sadly that's about all the positives I can come up with at this point.

When I noticed the game got released, I basically blew my budget to get the collection and sadly I have to admit that I deeply regret it.
I thought I disliked the new direction of Like a Dragon, but honestly I hope this spin-off dies. The sooner the better.

It's still good old Yakuza with a gripping main story and entertaining side quests, only this time it's from the perspective of a private investigator  
If you liked Yakuza 0 to 6, this game will be right up your alley for the most part  
  
Cons:  
Tailing missions (Seriously, the sheer number of these is ridiculous, and they're all mind numbingly boring. This game makes old school Assassin's Creed look like a little baby)  
Ryan Acosta  
  
Editing after finishing main story and 44/50 side cases:  
  
I think the game was considerably hampered by being limited to Kamurochou, the oldest town in the Yakuza series  
By the time I was done with the main story and 44/50 side quests, I was just about done with this town and didn't want to be back anytime soon  
Doesn't help that anyone who's played the mainline Yakuza games would be already really familiar with this particular town, and they haven't even added the rooftops except for around three small buildings

As a spin-off of the Yakuza series, it obviously is cut from the same cloth in a lot of ways but the game definitely stands out as something more than just a spin off especially with it's detective slant.

It's easy to get hooked into the main story once it starts to really kick off early on.

It's an alright game, would recommend getting it on sale and if you are into Yakuza Gameplay.
Else only get it if you are into Detective Games.
Main Story takes about 20+ hours, took me 29h to finish the game.

Keep in mind the game does have a game breaking bug (softlock) currently, so save frequently!
It seems to be related to the Skill that lets you charge up your Y Attack move, if you do it mid combat it just freezes Yagami in place until you get hit by an enemy that staggers you.

Positive:
+ Yakuza Gameplay - beat people up proper 
+ Side Cases and Minigames all over Kamurocho to play 
+ If you pick a wrong option during a ""interrogation"" the game wont make you restart from a checkpoint, it just simply tells you it makes no sense and lets you retry from the point at which you can choose the option
+ in most ""search screens"" you can find a stray Cat :3
+ your Healthbar can be ""destroyed"" by quite a bit if you get stabbed or shot, neat idea (only annoying that you take that damage before you find a way to fix your health)
+ Credits have a nice small ""movie"" taking place in the Background, i would prefer that anytime over just a black background

Meh:
~ you can only eat as much as ur current health bar allows (dmg taken) - you need a skill to eat ""unlimited"" amounts of food
~ i might have skipped the dialogue box telling it to me, but the game doesnt tell you that you need a certain skill to make the Drone fly higher, or that you have unlocked it for skilling

Negative:
- Trailing Missions - hide behind a slim streetlamp so your target wont notice you :^)
- The second you get a ""major"" hint for the story, the game makes sure you realize what the hint is about
- Game breaking bug / softlock regarding a certain Skill
- some physics for coats and jackets are a bit janky - most likely because it used to be a console game
- some ""search screens"" have cats being invisible? Most likely a bug (my case used to be in a side case at the Batting Cages)
- some minigames dont work currently (casino related - blackjack and poker), they seem to work later on in the story in which it is mandatory to play a single round of poker
- Street fights are pretty much worthless to attend, they offer 0 Money and only very few skill points (depends on the amount of people you fight)
- the occasionly appearing gang is just plain annoying lol",1663426864,1663530070,True,15,0,0.570105910301208496,0,True,False,False

You have the hard-hitting combat, which is more more energetic than ever thanks to Yagami’s agility, an engaging story full of twists and turns, and a varied range of activities to preoccupy you in between meeting the story objectives.
The investigative elements simply add to the variety that’s on offer, and make you feel more involved in the goings-on in and around Kamurocho.

This game right here is one of the great RGG titles that everyone should at least check out. The combat is similar to Yakuza 0 with how you have styles that you can switch on the fly, that being the Crane Style and the Tiger Style, Crane is more used for crowd control while Tiger is more used for 1v1 fights, but that's what they want you to think, because you can use either style in different ways, even if Crane isn't as good as Tiger, you can start a juggle combo using Tiger and switch to Crane for the more wider and quicker kicks with EX Boost.

The story is amazing, probably one of the best stories RGG has put out next to Yakuza 0, 7, and Lost Judgment. As this is the first game in the Judgment series to follow Yagami and his group, this is a fantastic start, with a captivating case, which originally starts as something small like a serial killing that leads to something even bigger than just a serial killing, without getting into spoilers.

The amount of Side Content in this game also is amazing, 50 Side Cases, and 50 Friends, a huge completion list like how it was in other Yakuza games, my bane of existence the Keihin Gang (probably the only thing that sucks in the game though the bosses are cool), the Judgment games as much as it is serious in its main story, balances that out with the wackiness from the side cases it has, though I did wish that certain points in the main story didn't stop for a mandatory side case.

The detective stuff in the game is alright, the tailing missions as much as i did like them, get boring after the 6th time doing one, especially with the last tailing mission in the main story which is drawn out so long that i wished that it was just a cutscene instead, search mode is a fine addition, especially with the amount of SP you get for just looking around your surroundings, also the cats :3. Lockpicking and it's other counterpart for turnknobs is a pretty neat addition as well, and not as annoying as skyrim's. Chasing is fun, not to short, not to long, they are nice to have the adrenaline pumping after the slow parts.

Now talking about the PC port, yeah its a PC port, basically if you were able to run dragon engine games in the past, you should be able to run this game without that many problems, but it is really nice to have after the long waiting for the PC port. Can't wait to see how modders take this apart, especially on how johnny and associates have prevented us from getting this game on PC because of that reason.

So, if your a Yakuza fan, then this is a must play, if you never played Yakuza game in your life, this is a great starting point to the world of Yakuza and its city Kamurocho.",1663208980,1663208980,True,2,0,0.516129076480865479,0,True,False,False

After Judgement, I bought every Yakuza there is on Steam. Always a little teary eyed knowing I wouldn't expierence these gems on my PC.... Sorry.... Getting emotional. Hold on.........

[h1]The Game Itself:[/h1]


If you enjoy the Yakuza series, then look no further. This spinoff puts you in the roll of a disgraced attorney turned detective who, after taking whatever jobs come his way, gets sucked into the underground crime of Tokyo to solve a string of horrifying murders. With the signature Yakuza combat and 2 styles to fight, a giant city to explore, and the incredible story-telling the series is known for, Judgment is not a game to skip. The shakeup of working as a detective and emphasis on investigation instead of fighting is a lot of fun and brings a welcome change to the series known for being a hardened Yakuza member.


[h1]Steam Deck Performance:[/h1]


Judgment runs significantly better than I expected on the Steam Deck. I assumed it would be a lot harder to optimize, but as soon as the game started, it was a welcome breath of fresh air. The game won't be a stable 60 FPS, unless you are okay draining your battery within 1.5 hours, but 40 FPS is not only achievable, but feels incredible with over 3 hours of battery life. There are some pockets of framerate drops when loading in new areas, but overall, it was worth it for the smoothness, battery life, and low temps.

To my surprise, Judgment also has FSR 2.0 incorporated into it, which was really unexpected. FSR 2.0 is the 2nd generation of AMD's upscaling technology, which allows a game to run much better on lower end devices by upscaling from a lower resolution internally. FSR 2.0 is not turned on by default though, so you do need to go to settings and fiddle with it. The game also offers cloud saves which, as a desktop PC gamer, will be fantastic to go back and forth on.

Overall, I was impressed with the performance. You can set the game down to 30 FPS to minimize all drops, though you can still feel them, but the upgraded smoothness of 40 FPS won me over. If you are hoping to play this game on the Steam Deck, then I have good news for you, it is DEFINITELY playable. Full detailed settings we used can be found on our website below.

If you ever wanted to try Yakuza- Judgment and Lost Judgment are SOLID entry points. (They are standalone but just take place in the Yakuza world and maps) With some of the best action combat in all of RGG studios games. Adding in some of the best writing in my opinion that keeps you on your toes and wanting more.

This and its sequel WILL NOT disappoint you. I love this game more than i love myself.

PSA: if your game is running too fast, set the FPS to 60. It put me on 30 by default and it caused the entire game to run at double the speed. (Probably a bug that needs to be fixed as the console versions were made for 60 FPS)

Absolutely still one of the best game Yakuza series in my books. The sleek fighting system that's flows so smooth and thrilling story/soundtrack to back it up. OC, Yagami is fukin beast.

I cant believe Sega did the impossible and got this gem on PC after the legal mess it has gone through lol. 100% worth the submission for those 3D brawler fans for sure",1663172796,1663173698,True,2,0,0.449275344610214233,0,True,False,False

- Story is among the best RGG Studio has written
- Gameplay is solid (though Lost Judgment's combat is better in my opinion)
- Characters and voice acting are great (English dub is solid too)
- Side activities are fun and engaging as always (especially the newly introduced Dice&Cube)

- Tailing missions during the main story can get kind of bothersome (thankfully this gets fixed in the sequel)
- Sometimes it can be unclear what you need to search for during investigations
- The evidence system is fairly simple and basic, but it's nothing too bad or disturbing",1663171972,1663171972,True,74,1,0.807474434375762939,0,True,False,False
