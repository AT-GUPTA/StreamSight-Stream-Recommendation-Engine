I was used to play my civilization 4 and 5 and 6 at prince and/or king difficulties but now, in the 4, I just played whole day today and I made 5 or 6 games and I failed them all. I was about to retry at warlord difficulty but I decided to just uninstall instead! The game is fully unbalanced. I was always using the ""balance"" resource but the bots very often started right in middle of 234723427 luxuries, Ghengin Khan came attacking me with wtf 47 units + 2 vassals, in another game I tried stacking 75 units in 2 groups and I had time to capture only 2 cities before the bot and its ally come counter-attack my face like butter. ffffuuuuccccckkkkk that ! The techs, you are ok for half the game, you trade 1:1 with the bots and you follow them, then BOOM they get 5-10 tech ahead of you under just 15-30 min of playtime wtf, this game is completely broken ! What I remembered about this game is me playing with Louis XIV and capturing the bots cities but now I can only capture a single city in a whole playtrough. They for sure changed something ! (I was using a cultural leader + making cultural buildings + 20-30% gold per turn in cultural and the bot next to me, in my last game, was beating me super easily, probably with this wonder, a christian one I think, a church or something if I have good memory but this wonder, a couple years ago, was making the bot equal to me.

Sometimes I don't play a couple of months, then I start a new game, maybe 2, repeat. I keep coming back to this gem of a game, it calms me down because it makes me think. 'One more turn' is this game for me, just like it's commercial back in the day. I play mostly turn based games because I have a slow reaction time ( ADD, getting older and kids ) like age of wonders, hearts of iron, xcom, etc. But civ4 will always be my favourite, it just never bores me. My praise is long but I'll try and keep it short and why this beats the bad later civ games.

The good:

-Every turn matters, I almost never click next turn without doing or thinking something. For instance in civ5 in the short period I tried it, I had nothing to do. Build a thing in the city, 30 turns, move your unit, that's it.... nothing. In civ4 I'm thinking about keeping my scout alive, scouting next city spots, thinking on what tiles to micro to get the most out of my cities, what specialists to run, what tech to go for, etc. There is always alot going on that keeps me invested. 
-The quality of the game and it's fanbase: this game always runs, even on a crappy pc. Heck the full game on disc came without DRM, you could install it on a friends pc without issues. Because they trusted the fans to actually buy it to support it. It came with a manual 200 pages thick which I've read countless times when I was younger. And the most friendly people on the planet will answer all your questions on civ fanatic, with tons of great mods. Heck I just started playing again to try realism invictus, another huge mod that changes everything. All free! 
-The UI is amazing, sure it looks clunky at first but with some basic mods everybody uses and that are easy to install ( Bug, bat, etc ) you see EVERYTHING that you want to see. No hidden info, no menu's in menu's ( yes I'm talking about you horrible civ5 ), hotkeys for most things, waypoints, etc. Once you master this game you will WANT all this information and it's there, to let you focus on the fun part. Actually playing the game! 
-Some people hate the look of the graphics, for me it's one of the positives. I love the colourfull world, the tiny buildings and wonders you can actually see in the cities themselves. Heck my 3 year old daughter looked at my worldmap yesterday, just enjoying the animal animations, the scenery. You can tweak the graphics a bit with more mods like marble, but personally it's fine. Yes I've been playing for a long time but the graphics are part of it, because they follow the need of the game not the other way around. I can instantly see what is what, for instance the difference between a hill and a mountain. A jungle or a forest, what the resources are, what the units are ment to be, etc. This sounds simple enough, but do you ever find yourself losing time in newer games thinking what the hell is that?
-Turns are fast, this game runs milky smooth. I found myself frustrated at games like civ5 or homm4 where even early game you click next turn and the game just lags for 10 seconds for some reason. 

Could be better: 

-Me and a friend of mine used to play alot of mp and the game was prone to some desynch issues sometimes. Still not sure what kept causing it, but we usually worked it out after reinstalling. 
-After all these years some balance issues were never adressed, but there are thousands of mods for this. 
-You will lose track of time, but hey the game has an ingame clock that you can even use as an alarm ;)
-You will hate all other civlike games after mastering this. Yes I'm looking at you hexbased games with 1 unit per tile. 
-You will forget to make a review even after 20 years, because you've been to busy playing the game. ( untill now )
-You need to finish your games to learn young padawan, restarting constantly only gets you so far ;)

Steam doesn't count the hours I have in this game before it got on steam, I'd be well over a 1000 by now. Buy it, the BTS expansion is essential. Look on civ fanatics to learn the game, they are the most friendly people on the planet. Easy to play, hard to master. Have fun! :D

City management is much better in VI. In IV, the aeas are marked in squares. In VI, they are round making the borders more natural. Resources are much less in IV. Military units are stacked in IV rather than spread out one to a hex as in VI. I like the districts in VI, which IV doesn't have. There are other minor differences.

I've taken breaks from it for years at a time, but I always find myself coming back.

The game has aged graphically, but if you're willing to look past the stacks of doom and unit spam that can bog the game down towards the end, you'll find a game that is still fun and full of depth without ever feeling overwhelming. If I was able to learn how to play it (poorly) when I was 9, you can too. The mechanics provide depth in a way that allows a skilled player to leverage them to their advantage, without punishing someone who doesn't. Additionally, this makes the AI significantly more competent than in VI since it won't fall so far behind because it can't plan districts 200 turns in advance. Civ IV's modding scene also adds a significant amount of content, although I have never really dabbled in them myself.

As a leader of one of the eighteen civilizations of the base game (that can become even more with the two expansions, Warlords and Beyond the Sword) the player is expected to explore the surrounding lands (in a potentially procedurally generated map) and expand their city borders, found new cities or conquer others to gradually become an empire and eventually win a campaign that spans from the stone age to the near future of 2050. Victory can be achieved in many ways, from being the first civilization to reach outer space, to remaining the only civilization that is left on the map. The most interesting and addicting factor of Civilization IV are the choices the player takes, each one leading their civilization‚Äôs progress in a different direction. The technology tree is interesting and varied, allowing to focus on military prowess in one game or scientific progress in another; each choice could be the better one, depending on the map, the adversaries and the success in building world wonders or founding religions. Accompanying these potentially endless games are decent graphics that are clear to understand despite the complexity of the system and an incredibly (and award winning!) soundtrack. The Warlord expansion adds six more civilizations, more leaders and unique scenarios to the main game, but is otherwise unremarkable. The Beyond the Sword expansions is a lot better, adding ten more civilizations, more leaders, more unique scenarios and late game buildings; it also adds natural disasters and expanded victory conditions, making the end game a lot more interesting.

[i]Rhye's and Fall of Civilization[/i]

alright, that was several words,
but that's beside the point, the point is mods like Rhye's made this game great.

And looking back now, it was probably the best time for mods,  at least in the universe of Civ, mods at the time could actually change the fundamentals of the game, and the game was transformed into very different ones with different mods, and it was fantastic!

Mods like [i]Rhye's and Fall of Civilization[/i] was so unique, that years later, I still find myself wanting to go back to it, and I have to fight the urge every god damn time, 

""the graphics are just so aged."" I'd tell myself. 
""but the game-play is gooooood."" myself would counter.

Arguments continues......
...

""So what?! Download it again then, you wouldn't last more than 5 minutes anyway."" I'd always bring this final argument every-time every few years.

""Challenge accepted.""

I'll post an update with a proper review, once I'm finished with the game once again. this time.

Reason no. 1 is because the is no one unit per tile rule, and the AI knows how to use their units.

Set the difficulty so high that you lose half of your games. That makes your game interesting until the last turn.
No. 2 tip is to take breaks, this will give you new ideas and you may develop your strategy.

-1 Star for stupid cartoonish leader pics

-1 Star because it does not make it easy to identify (by simply looking at the map) which of your cities have Hydro Plant, Coal Plant, or Nuclear Reactor.

-1 Stars because having a Hydro Plant + Coal Plant + Nuclear Reactor in the same city nets you NO benefit BUT does still have all the penalties of the individual buildings (ir reactor meltdowns and health loss)

-1 Stars because the game ALLOWS you to accidentally build multiple Power sources in the same city, even though there exists no benefit (and only penalties) for doing so.

-6 Stars because it does not allow you to demolish buildings.

Obviously, poor design. If a city only benefits from having a single Power source, then it should not allow you to build multiple Power sources UNLESS it will also allow you to demolish redundant/useless/harmful buildings.

Somehow Firaxis designed a game superior to Civilization 1 while also being less than Civilization 2, imho.

EDIT: Played some more, same complaints but need to add the Culture Flipping nonsense to the list.

So -2 Stars for Culture resulting in non-military border changes.

And -3 Stars for making it possible for a city to be lost due to Culture alone.

The remixes of the original player faction themes from Civ 1, with the addition of tons of additional period-appropriate tracks, made the music very enjoyable to listen to, even as a soundtrack album away from the game.  The Beyond the Sword expansion lacked the gorgeous intro movie and the Christopher Tin ""Baba Yetu"" main menu song of the Civ IV base game, but it built upon Civ IV: Warlords' introduction of the Warlord special unit by adding (I think) other types of special single-person units who could help your civilization in other ways (such as the Great Prophet, Great Scientist, etc.), and by introducing special events (which your civ could respond to in various ways) and Quests (meet the quest's goal before a certain deadline, and gain a benefit for your civ).  Your civ could also found a religion if you were the first to discover certain technologies, and could use missionaries to ""win friends and influence people (other civs)"".  Finally, Civ IV was much more moddable than had been Civ III, and some of the mods (which could require either just the base game or either of the expansions) are still some of my favorites today.

First, the DLC aren't expansions that add to the base game but stand alone copies that you have to install separately. I found this out after purchasing the bundle and this one is apparently the most complete version so here I am as opposed to leaving a review on the base game's page.

Second, let's talk mechanics. Combat is terrible since I couldn't find a way to attack from a distance with ranged units. Trebuchets and archers attack just like melee meaning there's no way to protect them from counter attack which is really dumb. The ability for land units to embark on sea tiles is so far down the research tree that it's also really dumb. If a nation you're at war with lands on your city and there's not a military unit on the tile, it just takes your city. 

I could go on but I'm not wasting any more time on this review or this game pointing out how it's just Civilization V with far worse mechanics. I'm glad I started at V and haven't gone farther back because V seems to be the pinnacle of this style and VI plays way different than previous titles.

It plays so dramatically differently from the newer games and not just in a ""old game super simple"" kind of way like Civ III and previous, I regularly play it alongside its sequels and get something out of each.

The flow of the game is more variable than the newer games which kind of box you into specific strategies based on the civ you pick. In Civ IV the leaders have different traits which make them fairly unique, but in general they don't lend themselves so heavily towards specific victory conditions. It's more intuitive to have your approach to the game be based on the map, the diplomatic situation, available resources, etc. There are lots of different strategies for different scenarios and it makes it possible to play the same leader or similar leaders twice and have very different games because you dont have to commit to some linear strategy from the get go, which I feel is the game's greatest strength. I also like that diplomacy is more feasible and interesting because you can actually cultivate meaningful relations with the AI, compared to V and VI where the AI literally realizes its in a game and behaves irrationally. There are a few other cool mechanics and details like being able to turn rivals into vassal states instead of conquering them outright which can be convenient and creates a cool dynamic, and overall the game feels satisfying as both an intricate strategy game and a good representation of real world society and history which is a focus I think Civ VI especially kind of lost.

The particularly weak area in my opinion is the combat. You usually end up stacking countless units on the same tile and moving the stack around which eliminates much of the intelligent use of space and terrain of the newer games. The units are also largely based around a kind of checks and balances system where you have a big stack made up of various kinds of units designed specifically to counter one another, it comes off as a pretty goofy and meta gamey thing at times. Overall I think conquest is a lot less satisfying than in the newer games, but it isnt awful either. 

I definitely recommend checking the game out, maybe look up some playthroughs first if coming from Civ V or VI as the game is pretty complex and very different.",1627837990,1674689115,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Whenever someone asks me about my obsession with politics and history I show him this game. If only it supported Steam Workshop, since the game files are not compiled thus easy to edit (and make mods), so a Workshop support would be useful and especially a safe place to get mods. Otherwise, it's more than a great game that defined my childhood.

The final and best iteration of the first CIV games (I - IV), that allowed multiple units per tile. It is a more complex version of CIV III, adding religion, and unit promotions.

There are two ways to build up your economy, hamlets (that are build around the cities and turn into towns), and specialists (that live in cities). There are advantages and disadvantages to both, giving the game some complexity.

The tactics during combat are complex enough to make it interesting but not overly complex. The most controversial part of combat is collateral damage, which allows units such as cannons to damage multiple units per tile. Collateral damage takes effect during attack, making it important to attack first. However, who gets to attack first depends more on luck than tactics. Units move slower in enemy territory, because they can not use roads (, unless they have a specific promotion), which limits the maneuvers that attackers can do in enemy territory. The slower movement is a bit of a flaw of the game.

Cons:  
     -of course graphics, but in stratagy game they are not as important.  
     -No real cultural decisions, this would give the player even more investment in the nation.

I have never been a fan of online multiplayer games because of the immature psychological attitudes and biases that these players inadvertently bring to their games. NOW, I am 74 years old and learned about computers and the internet when I was in my late 40's as an English professor. so that is definitely a source of my attitudes about multiplayer gaming. 

So, going beyond these kinda complex issues that are really more a personal thing, with me, I would say that most people are not so much stuck on making sure I feel realism while playing strategy games and this is what gives me permission to recommend the game to a much wider span of people than I might normally allow myself.

It's kind of like that but if Return Of The Jedi was actually good.

Also, Leonardo Nimoy!  He is a StarWars!  Sometimes I just play the game to pretend he is still alive, and imagine him holding me, quoting quips as I fall asleep in his cold, logical arms.  I miss you space papa....

The worst example of this is the Scientific Method, which paradoxically reduces your scientific output by obsoleting monasteries and the Great Library.

Ambassadors representing the US have to go through extensive classes to reach fluency. Native English speakers spend around 600-750 classroom hours for proficiency in Spanish and French, German about 900 classroom hours, Hebrew and Greek around 1100 classroom hours, and the hardest level, Arabic and Mandarin Chinese about 2200 classroom hours. 

This week I hit 1000 hours playing Sid Meier's Civilization IV (Civ4). And what a fun 1000 hours it was to experience. That is some serious time investment, as I could have had an ambassador's fluency of most European languages with that time. And those are hours just on Steam, not including the unrecorded CD Rom hours I played in the old days before Steam. A lot of these hours were racked up during the pandemic of 2020, and time spent playing went in tandem with hanging out w/ friends in an activity more interesting than a phone/video call. 

The game teaches you a lot about strategy, culture, history, resource management, and even language (the game is operated in English, French, German, Italian, and Spanish). One of the gems with the game is the well thought out, information dense, Civilopedia. It is an ingame information guide that is user friendly to perfection. In-game content describing the most basic warrior unit, to the history of Bismarck's Germany, is easily contained and categorized, accessible with multiple embedded hyperlinks during the game. If anyone is reading this who needs to open a website, buy the game and tinker w/ the Civilopedia. It's how most information packets should be operated. Easy to look up info, clickable photos with information makes a great product years after launch. 

Another category with this game that's fantastic is that you learn how to manage resources better. Patience will be the best tool at your disposal as you learn how to employ effective supply chain links to your armies, planting the seeds of commerce with cottages, and conserving Great People for future gameplay exploits. So many in-game wars with friends were fought to the last military unit, in a struggle for survival in an ever increasing difficulty level as we got better through experience.

 I‚Äôm very fortunate to have enjoyed Civ IV with good friends and gotten the opportunity to share the game with new players who caught on quickly and enjoy the game too. If I could make a request to Steam on tweaking the game, would be to allow more than 4 human players on a game. There‚Äôs 18 max slots for AI players but for human players the limit is 4 human players. Involving more of our friend group would be immense fun. Also if you could save a Worldbuilder map for multiplayer use would be awesome too, but don't know how much Steam can do on that front. Thanks Civ IV, there‚Äôs a lot one can do with 1000 hours; spending it with friends building empires through tough times and good times, long after the 2007 game release date, has been 1000 hours well spent.",1641958496,1641958496,True,51,3,0.821529567241668701,0,True,False,False

Those hexes tho..so beautiful and strategy packed. Long story short - I bought this on sale for price of a big mac, and loaded the mod CAVEMAN2COSMOS into it.
This mod makes 5-6 look like an 80's arcade game. There are probably more units available in the prehistoric age, than there are in either one of the other civs mentioned all totaled. There are undoubtabley more buildings in the mod than both games combined. The research tree makes both games look like they only thought to give you the instructions on a 2$ cake box mix. The unit promotion tree makes 5-6 look like they were made for the mobile platform. Spend 3 days on wiki browsing through them all - you wont...
There are more options & settings in the Caveman2Cosmos menu - than the top 10 AAA games combined. The options run on for days....
If you lust after a long epic strategy game - Grab Civ4 off of steam, and DL the 1gb Caveman2Cosmos Mod.
 *Im not responsible for any marriage breakups*

EDIT > So I am 30hrs past my last review - still in the prehistoric age - and the caveman to cosmos mod is even BETTER than I could ever imagine. This mod has no competition. NONE. It IS in a class of its own. It is safe to say ; I havent even crossed into the ancient era, and I have had a better journey thus far than every civ game combined put together. And thats saying alot; I bought the very first Civ game almost 25 years ago.  The Caveman2Cosmos mod will rule your night and day. I think about it when Im sleeping. I think about it at work. I think about it when Im on my 4 wheeler hanging off the edge of a possible cliff. There is not another strategy game game that can even come close to this. The developers of caveman2cosmos put INCREDIBLE thought into this mod - and after 100hrs of playing it surely shows. Cant wait to get into the Ancient Era. Im on turn 2398. It shouldnt be long.                                                                                                                                  
Review Update*  786hrs later. Same game roll as initial review. Try to keep it short. The reason I havent got back sooner is just.... one....more .  ..  turn. 
Keep in mind were hard mode, gigantic map, slowest research (epic)
Civ 4 is the King of all Civs > but coupled with Caveman2Cosmos, it is utterly fantastically phenomenally mind blowing. Im on turn 4798 now, I just hit classical era. (prehistoric>ancient>classical) and there are I think 9 eras left. Ingenious game, Ill give no spoilers, but it gets better every turn. If your a civ fan, or call yourself a wargame strategist, and have not played this mod ; you are truly missing out. Cheers to Sid Meier's. Cheers to the total geeks who made Cave2Cosmos. Next turn.

As this is an expansion, and not the base game, I'm not going to detail all of my thoughts about the game here. Feel free to look up my Civilization IV game review for that.

Pros and Cons specifically for this expansion:

Pros:
+ Some minor mechanic improvements.
+ ""Corporations"" as a sort of ""religion"" feature is a fun addition.
+ The Space Victory and Diplomatic Victory features were expanded nicely.
+ The Espionage feature is introduced earlier in the game, making is useful.
+ The Final Frontier mod is one of my favorite Civ IV mods.

Cons:
- Sometimes the new ""random events"" can frustrate the heck out of you. There were a couple of times when I was hit with several negative random events in quick succession, messing up the war campaign I was on.
- The infamous ""Stacks of Doom"" of the oldest Civilization games is still present here. (And IIRC, for the last time.)

Rating: B+ (for its time), B- (for 2021)

You can turn off giving the cities back in the settings, but it will keep asking you, ""the citizens are *rightfully* asking"" to be given back to another empire, as if the freaking game has some sort of moral authority. It's incredibly annoying.

The entire espionage subgame is annoying and unpleasant to play. You can turn it off, but then you are left with wonders and buildings that serve no purpose, just taking up space in the menus.

The suggestions are often annoying. It often gets into a state where it's asking you every two or three turns if you want to make a settler unit, even though there is no place to put a settler, and there is no way to say, ""Stop asking me this."" And if it thinks its time for you to build a wonder, a dozen cities will have that suggestion in the popup, even if you start building it in the first one. This means that you have to scroll down in the menu to find the next thing each of those dozen cities needs to build. And if you don't want to bother with that wonder, even worse; then it will be taking up that valuable slot for a dozen cities for many turns.

Finally, the game is also politically snotty. It raises the 20th century mass butchers Stalin and Mao to the status of great leaders, even though neither actually did much for their country. But not Hitler, who actually did rule over Germany while it went from a disastrous economy to one of the greatest war machines in history. I'm not saying they should have included Hitler; the fact that he was a mass butcher is good enough reason to ignore him, but Stalin and Mao were just as bad. The difference is that white university-educated pseudo-intellectuals think Stalin and Mao were mass-murdering heroes.

Then there is making the Mt. Rushmore wonder available with the discovery of fascism--a deliberate slap in the face to American patriots. Another slap at America was replacing the Hoover Dam with the Three Gorges Dam. The Three Gorges Dam was just another big dam.

The graphics are horribly outdated now, but the gameplay is still what this game is all about and thankfully the game still holds up, even better than Civ 5 and Civ 6 in a lot of ways. I still enjoy stacking my units before sending them off to raid civilization capitals, which remains to this day the best strategy to beat another civilization in a war, in any version of the game.

The the BUG mod, which is built in with this edition (I believe) or which can easily be installed so as to provide a superior interface, makes this an 11 on a scale of 1-10.  Incredibly deep and incredibly addictive;  experts as well as aveage players come back to this from time to time.  I think it is a good prediction that it will be the best game on your hard drive EVER.  No, that's wrong.  The best game on your hard drives that you will have as you upgrade from time to time..   (It does play perfectly on Win10, btw. 
 That's a  pretty galactically crazy thing to say, but I am confident.   It's 20+ years old (although with the full set of expansions counted, since it doesn't really hit GOAT without them, I think its a little less than that.  No matter.   Civ 3, 5, and 6 are all very good games, but this is the shining start.
Why?   You have to play it, for quite a while, to really understand.  Ignore that 60+ hrs It says I have played.  Bull, I surely have put hundreds if not thousands or  hours in, and it is fresh and inviting every time.  Note there are TONS of excellent guides on steam and on the internet, I particularly like Sulla's guide.  It's got deep strategy pouring out all  over itself, from diplomacy to religion to corporations.  Oh there are tons of scenarios you can  play also...I haven't tried them much because the base game is such a treat.  Multiplayer is possible and playable but I don't recommend that unless you can get people together for hours at a  time,.  One has to think, one has to plan, one has to hope.  You can play 20 hours while constantly feeling like the roof might fall in any second,  
If  you really don't know about this game (really?) you might want to watch a Civ 4 let's play by Quill18.   If you don't like 4X, then why are you reading this?

Battle encounters are a little slow moving but can be turned off and ignored if you're impatient like me.  I'm not the biggest fan of the espionage addition in the expansions, but again, it's able to be turned off.  Game is addictive, be prepared to lose a whole weekend.  And another.  And another.  I highly recommend getting the expansions.  I also recommend the Epic speed setting, it's the best balance between resources and time - anything shorter and by the time you've built a unit it's about to become obsolete.  Especially if they have to travel any kind of distance, they'll be obsolete before they arrive.

Also beware of Isabella of Spain, she's out for blood.

I have bought and played Civ V and Civ VI, they aren't as fun.  The map in IV is cleaner, it's easier to see what's happening, city influence areas are more regular etc, for my OCD brain this level of tidiness is important.

The advances from the previous iterations are also welcome - getting rid of the caravans, and unit costs being tied to the city of origin...  The added Wonders, religions, politics/leader personalities and trade/diplomacy is great, a valid and fun addition.  Also more balanced than past games.

I have dumped hundreds of hours into this game on steam (untold hundreds more on my non steam copy) multiplayer on the steam servers just last year and still have no fatigue of this game.  The replay value is incredible and you can even find interesting strategies with unrestricted leaders.

It still has huge faults - things like how diplomacy will at its best serve a minor role in your play style and more than likely be essentially be forgotten, you're no longer able to use bombers to destroy roadways which really weakens their use, a sea-based invasion on an opponent is near impossible until fairly late in the game and even then you need to have a sizable military that you're completely devoting to capturing an insignificant foothold, I feel like Great Generals are nowhere near as useful as their peers (except of course Great Spies which are completely forgettable), etc. - but the game still has enormous potential. The addition of religions and corporations adds a fun and unique strategic element to the game that its predecessor was missing and the expansive wonder list not only continually tempts players but also provides play variety in terms of focus. (Though it becomes obvious pretty quickly which wonders are considerably overpowered when compared to others - I find myself always striving for Stonehenge if it looks like it's in range, the Eiffel Tower is also considerably useful if you anticipate being a war monger that needs captured cities to expand quickly, and I almost always settle an early game city near a river solely so I have a shot at constructing Three Gorges down the road.) I know many had complaints regarding unit stacking and that's largely why Civ games following IV no longer allow it, but I feel like stacking is not only vital (to a degree) when it comes to playing this game but that it actually adds a fun additional element to the game where you then begin to consider things like ""supply lines"" as you wage a war deeper and further into enemy territory (obviously both war parties are stacking their units, so is it worth the risk to try and spread your units thinner to try and sweep cities away from them quicker or will you leave yourself too exposed?)

- This is a city management game first, a battle strategy game second. A consequence of this is the square tiling, instead of the hexagonal one used in battle games.
- Stacks of Doom are easier to handle instead of carpets of doom
- Making too many new cities is controlled by adding bigger taxes to those specific new cities instead of punishing the whole empire. This means that if those cities will eventually be good profitable additions to your civilization, then it's worth the investment.
- Diplomacy is perfect. Trading works as intended and you can always understand why another leader hates you or loves you.
- Pretty graphics. Colorful, unrealistic. The game is pretty and kinda silly. You'll get feedback for every interaction against other leaders.
- Late-game turns are still fast and if you make queues or automate city productions and workers orders then it will require minimal output from you.
- Civilopedia has links from one article to another.

Graphics stand up to modern standards even today; the modding community takes it to a whole different level and transform it into different 4x games with barely anything in common.

The interface is gorgeous and you can always easily find the information you need to make the decisions to take your empire to the place you wanted it to be. Going wide and going tall are both feasible and your starting position and resources heavily influence what your strategy is going to be without being forced to one particular playstyle only depending on your starting Civ.

They were fun, but the next couple entries in the series topped it, as Firaxis keeps doing new and cool things with this amazing franchise. The reason I have nearly 4000 hours logged on this game is the mod Fall From Heaven 2 (with probably 500ish hours being me literally asleep in front of my keyboard after a marathon, or leaving the game on while I go do something else). Even subtracting a generous 800ish hours from my total, this means I have something along the lines of 3000 hours played on a single version of a single game. 
Fall From Heaven 2 is worth every hour spent. It is an insanely rich reimagining of the base game. A full-conversion fantasy mod that adds memorable characters and storylines to a genre that you would think would handle those poorly, but the leaders, factions, and scenarios allow you to participate in dozens of engrossing stories of the history of Erebus.
FFH2, from what I've read in forums and articles, started as a Dungeons and Dragons campaign played for quite some time by several of the original creators of the mod. They used the characters and storylines from their DnD campaign to flesh out their omage to Master of Magic, an absolutely stellar full conversion fantasy version of Civilization 1, done by Microprose many years ago. They brilliantly intertwined concepts from MoM and their DnD campaign to create something mostly new, with enough concepts from their inspirations to tug at the nostalgic heart strings of many an old nerd.
There is entirely too much content to cover it all, but it is all brilliantly put together, fairly well balanced, and offers excellent choices for heroes and villains of all kinds of tactical flavors.

TLDR: You can pick this game up cheap, the Fall From Heaven 2 mod is free. Get them both and prepare to lose significant stretches of the rest of your life to this amazing game.",1606417085,1606417085,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

""Civilization V"" is my favourite, but ""Civ IV"" has also a lot to offer and it's worth playing not only for nostalgic value. Everything what I'm saying relates to ""Beyond the Sword"" expansion and I highly recommend to purchase all the expansions, because, without them, the game is incomplete and you have limited mod and civilization options. (Actually, I don't understand, why people play vanilla versions. For ""Civilization"" games, it's usually like this: they release an incomplete game with some gameplay faults, which is substantially improved with following expansions ‚Äì not only in terms of content, but also in terms of mechanics.)

Here are some things that ""Civ4"" does have that ""Civ5"" doesn't, and things that ""Civ4"" is better at (well, imo, at least):

+ More customisation options (e.g., no limitations regarding how many civilizations could there be per map size; an option to assign leaders to different civilization, for example, Ghandi as a leader of Russia).
+ By far better interface (except, for one thing - when you are offered research/tech choice, you need to make decision right away - you can't examine your empire first. You can change it afterwards in the same turn, but, anyway, it's not very convenient). Apart from that, it's more easy to review the overall state of your progress. For example, howering over a tech gives you a detailed explanation of what you can achieve with a tech (units, wonders, bonuses for discovering first, etc.), why it's important and where it leads. Also, in ""Civ4"", there is the option to see the network of global politics or what a particular leader thinks of other leaders or what he wants or is willing to trade. I also prefer ""Civ4"" icons over ""Civ5"" icons.
+ Unit appearance is different for each civilization and religion (and not just in terms of colour). For example, Korean swordmen will have different swords than European swordmen, a Buddhist missionary will have a different outfit from that of a Christian missionary.
+ Cool wonder animations.
+ Civics (ideologies) are available much earlier in the game, you can change them more easily and they are not linked to culture points. In ""Civ5"", many of the civic system functions are transfered to the relligion system.
+ Map trading
+ Cultural victory is actually a feasible option contrary to ""Civ5"", where it is possible only in rare occasions.
+ Inbuilt World Builder (In ""Civ5"" it's available only from the ""Workshop"")
+ Workers can build forest preserves (that add happiness)
+ The rather unique ""Afterworld"" scenario and ""Final Frontier"" mod (which both feel like and actually are completely different games ‚Äì full-conversion mods, if you like).
+ Vassal states (you can push other leaders to become your vassals).
+ No lag on large maps, since it is a much older game and requires less system resources.

+/- Random events instead of city state quests
+/- Workshops and windmills are tile improvements instead of buildings. 
+/- Religion doesn't have that much impact as in ""Civ5"". But it does have a considerable impact on diplomacy.
+/- Culture bombs work in the same way as great general citadels.
+/- Different great persons may discover different technologies.
+/- Corporations - spread them like relligion and each corporation will have different effects. ""They are mechanisms that can add substantial production to a city, at the cost of higher maintenance costs. Thus, in essence they convert gold into other basic goods (food, hammers, science, and culture)."" [From Wikia]

However, there are some aspects in which ""Civ4"" falls behind ""Civ5"":

- Square tiles. Hexagon tiles are far better for strategical gameplay and layout.
- Unit stacks. I know that I will be condemned for this and for a while I missed the stacking option in ""Civ 5"", but, when I got used to it, I must admit that one unit-per-tile limitation actually improves the gameplay a lot. With this limitation it matters much more where you put your units. You can manage your army more easily. The city placement has a bigger impact on your attack/defence strategy. And, finally, if you play smart, you can save more of your units (sometimes even win the game without loosing any unit), whereas in ""Civ4"" you are bound to throw your units into the battle as cannon fodder. ""Civilization 5"" feels like chess in that matter. And I prefer it that way.
- Ranged units (Archers, Crossbowmen, etc.) don't have a ""ranged attack"" option. It is available only for siege weapons (""bombard"").
- No city states. I actually like how city states provide bonuses, quests and influence the diplomacy. I think it's a better mechanic than influence points. Although, on the other hands, AI leaders in ""Civ5"" are completely irrational, their attitude sometimes doesn't make any sense and there is little you can do about it, whereas in ""Civ4"", you can at least change your civic/relligion or influence those of the AI leader.
- ""Civilization 4"" is harder than ""Civilization 5"" (although it might be a good thing for some players). In ""Civilization 5"", I feel comfortable on ""Emperor"" and with a bit of luck I can manage ""Immortal"" on smaller maps, whereas I struggle on ""Noble"" in ""Civilization 4"". Perhaps, it's because I haven't played ""Civilization 4"" in years and hadn't developed any strategy when I did.
- Technology trading. This actually makes the game rushed, unbalanced and it's much harder to make that technological gap between you and AI players. Although, there were moments, in ""Civ5"" multiplayer, when I wished there was this option. But, now, I see that research agreements are actually a much more balanced mechanic. Luckily, you can turn ""technology trading"" off in ""Civ4"".
- ""Civilization 4"" pushes you to expand early (as mush as possible). ""Civilization 5"" pushes you to build army early (expansion is less crucial than in ""Civ4)"". I don't like any of the two, but, I think, that the fact, that AI civilizations are expanding so rapidly and that you need to keep up, makes ""Civilization 4"" unbalanced - it's hard to maintain positive stats and to manage the cities and units. In ""Civ5"", you can win with less units, less initial cities and the overall pace is slower, which allows you to build your empire in a more balanced way. ""Civilization III"" had the same problem btw.
- No ""Steam Workshop"" support. But you can still use 3rd party mods.

There are probably some more differences that I've forgotten, but, in the end, I would like to say that ""Civilization 4"" is a great game and offers many things its successor lacks. For that reason it's worth purchasing even today ‚Äì not only for a nostalgic value, but also for the different and fun experience it offers.

My overall rating: 9/10

Also, my personal feeling is that ""Civilization 5"" is better in its strategical aspect, whereas ""Civilization 4"" is better in its ""God game"" aspect ‚Äì just to fool around on easier difficulties.",1451134863,1605718219,True,62,3,0.853017151355743408,5,True,False,False

The AI civs now how behave as per their leader's traits, so you can still get expansionist and aggressive opponents, but they are not ALL like that by default! It makes for a much fairer, more enjoyable game, without being forced to expand up to 100 cities before you have even got out of the iron ages!
The game is also very moddable, as you will see from some of the fully modded scenarios that come with Civ 4: BtS.
Unit strengths are now more diverse, the gulf between higher tech units and lower tech is much greater. You will now rarely see tanks defeated by pikemen!
On the negative side it has some stupid game rules. Aircraft and nukes in particular!
Neither can destroy a single unit at all. Only damage them up to a certain %age!
You will realise how fk-ing dumb fk this is when you CANNOT destroy ships with bombers - but only damage them to 50%. Once at half their HP's, all units become IMMUNE to air attacks.
Artillery using ""indirect bombardment attack"" has the same problem, though they can also attack ""conventionally"" and can destroy enemy units that way. Aircraft don't have that ""conventional attack"" option, only the ""indirect bombardment"" one. Aircraft have been the greatest DESTROYER of ships since WW2, even the game's texts say this, but in practice not ONE ship will ever be sunk by aircraft here in Civ4, not even a fishing boat!
Nukes still do not destroy cities, as in all previous Civ's. But this time they don't destroy the units garrisioned there neither. They will knock them down to just 1% strength, but that's no good, they'll be back at 100% within three or four turns! Fallout also fades away after just a dozen turns...... BULLSHIT, it should last dozens of turns at least, or until cleaned up by workers, like as in the original Civ 1!
When you find remnant ""barbarian warriors"" or ""barbarian galleys"" still entrapped in the sea ice in the map's polar regions, ie places where they cannot move units out from, nor can you send any units into, and you find that even nuclear weapons cannot destroy them....... well, you'll realise how stupid this ""only damage up to xx% rule"" is.
The ""random generator"" is also ""pre-ordained"". So if a bad ""random"" event happen, or a battle goes badly, do NOT expect to roll back to the previous turn and try again. EXACTLY the same results will happen again and again and again no matter how many times you retry!
If you see anything that tells you of an ""odds for success"", it's talking bllcks! Anything below 80% chance of success is actually ZERO% chance!
The new espionage system is not well thought out. The damage your spies do to the enemy is pathetic, and they'll fix it all within a couple of turns. It's not worth the effort building a strong spy network.
City production values are also too low. It can take an entire ""game epoch"" for some buildings/unit to finish construction!
Thankfully, I believe ALL those above negatives can be fixed by making your own modded set of game rules. How easy that is, I do not know, yet.",1603833865,1604081016,True,7,1,0.560909748077392578,0,True,False,False

I won't go into what Civ is specifically about. You should know.
Nor will I compare to other Civ games. It has been done.

This versions' depth is impressive, and the playability is... at least a few lifetimes.
Graphics are normal, but totally irrelevant!
The 4X strategy design and many (but not too many) balanced options make it something that will always be enjoyable.
Spock will still read your Scientific discoveries out loud! :P

It has the most stable and competitive community (at civfanatics mostly).
Online strategy guides and discussions are plentyful, and you might as well spend a month reading about a well documented game thread to understand just how deep and creative the game is.

Relative to other Civ games, it's HoF also contains the most entries.
It has many mods, some are great trips of history or/and imagination of the modders, and include a LOT of content.

I recommend the 2 expansions (BTS being the second) for a complete experience.
Of course, if you are not into managing all aspects of an empire, this is not for you :)
If you want to spend years of your life relaxing, contemplating your options, perfecting your strategy, and forgetting to eat sleep and.. live, this is perfect for you! It is for me :>

I haven't even played the vanilla game in over a decade (and the hours I have on Steam are only a fraction of my total hours in this game, as I've been playing it since 2008 or so). Instead, I shall talk about a couple of mods available for this wonderful game - they're the real reason Civ 4 is still the best in the series.

[h1]Realism Invictus[/h1]

This mod greatly expands the content of Civ 4 and adds more realism and historical believability to it. Different civs now have more unique playstyles than before and there are a lot more techs, buildings and units to research and construct. Graphics have also been improved and offer a more pleasant visual experience, with less bright and more natural terrain textures. Unlike some other mods (Rise of Mankind or Caveman 2 Cosmos, which I'll be talking about below) this one doesn't go overboard with adding new things, though. It's a well-balanced mod that expands upon the vanilla experience but doesn't stray too far from it. And its last update was released this year (2020), so it's still being worked on.

[h1]Fall From Heaven 2[/h1]

THE fantasy mod everyone raves about. A whole lot of different civilizations, all of which have their own unique unit rosters and some of which play completely differently to the others. It also adds a magic system a la Master of Magic to the game, as well as an armageddon counter that will spawn a demonic invasion once it reaches its peak. There are several spinoffs of this one around, made by different modding teams who put their own spin on the mod's gameplay and factions. Highly recommended.

[h1]Rhye's and Fall[/h1]

The basic version of this mod is already included in the game. It lets you pick any civilization from antiquity and then lead it through the ages on a big map of Earth. New civilizations spawn at historically correct times, so if you start out as Babylon you will have to deal with a Persian invasion at some point. It's a very different experience to vanilla Civ's random map sandbox, and I find it highly enjoyable. There are some spinoff/provincial campaign submods of this, like Rhye's and Fall Europe 500-1800. Highly recommended

[h1]Caveman 2 Cosmos[/h1]

The biggest, baddest mod of them all. It adds everything. Literally everything. You guide your civilization from prehistoric caveman times to a post-scarcity hyperspace future. There are dozens of civilizations and leaders to pick from, leaders can gain experience and earn new traits rather than being stuck with their starting traits, the early game consists of exploring a wilderness populated by megafauna and hunting animals to provide your village with food, when you start out your civilization doesn't even know how to talk yet... [b]language is a technology you have to research first.[/b] There are probably a thousand different buildings to construct and units to recruit. I'm not even kidding. You can construct such lovely buildings as a toymaker's shop, florist's shop, street sweeper's office, hairdresser, wig maker... according to the developers, there are over 734 technologies in the game, and many of these techs unlock between one and a dozen buildings to construct. It also adds new gameplay elements such as waste management, pollution, crime rate, and many more things you have to manage. If you like mods that add a lot of new stuff, you will love Caveman 2 Cosmos. It's the prime example of ""bigger is better"".

Now excuse me, I'll have to go back to my game as Adolf Hitler of the Germans, who is currently trying to convert his neighbors to Scientology, and anyone who refuses gets terrorized by spies detonating pocket nukes in their cities (yes, this mod has [b]pocket nukes[/b]) while my [b]giraffe cavalry[/b] (yes this mod has [b]GIRAFFE CAVALRY[/b]) is patrolling my borders.",1601835285,1601835305,True,44,1,0.790807843208312988,4,True,False,False

Civilization IV is, for me, the peak of the Civilization franchise. It's much more accessible and user friendly than the first 3 games, but isn't overly streamlined like the most recent games. It can be played casually and you can still get a lot of enjoyment out of it, but you can go deep into the micromanagement of it and make the game a lot more complicated, if that's how you prefer to play your strategy games. This flexibility is another of its strongest aspects, which is heightened due to the extensive modding community. It is the largest and most active modding community across the entire franchise (in my experience). There are some truly amazing mods that can completely change how the game is played and what it's about. My personal favorite would be Caveman 2 Cosmos. It has 5 times the technologies of the base game, which expands each era into its own small game of Civ. It is extremely long and adds dozens of new mechanics, so it might be too much of an overhaul for some people, although I still recommend giving it a shot.

10/10 (with Caveman 2 Cosmos mod)

Pretty typical strategy game, with the typical goods and bads. There is a lot of depth to the potential playstyles, going with culture, war, religion, or winning through the power of being filthy rich. Lots of unit/city options for specialization, and unlike some games of this genre you can even automate a lot of production (however, the AI is pretty bad, it'll completely cut off production to increase population growth, even though you don't have the buildings to support that population, even if you tell it to specifically prioritize production). At it's core, it's a pretty solid game mechanically.

However, that solid mechanical core is exactly what makes this game a bit bad too. You have all these mechanics that YOU have to learn to do well...but the AI doesn't follow a single, solitary bit of it, and this issue isn't confined to the insane difficulty settings, where it's a bit more expected for an AI to ""cheat"" in order to maintain difficulty. The game gives you a list next to each leader saying what they like and dislike about you...but having 0 dislikable traits (such as being the same religion, having open borders and a lot of good trade, not having border tension, sharing common enemies) doesn't mean a thing, they'll still declare war with no given reason. You can have excellent espionage and satellite technology that let's you see every part of the map with no blind spots...just so you can actually SEE the AI spawn an army when it needs it. Turning on permanent alliances and forming one with an AI will lead to them just gifting you EVERYTHING extra they have lying around, which is nice, sure, but does go heavily against all mechanics previously learned, and weakens them often to the point where people will attack them regardless of your treaty, dragging you into wars with no real purpose.

In short this game, while fun, isn't really all that strategic in reality, because you cannot trust the information the game gives you to strategize upon. No matter how well things are with your neighbors, you may as well have not tried, because you still need to build an inordinate amount of defensive units, wasting years and gold, because your best friend will attack you out of the blue. No matter how strategically you played, having an, again, inordinate amount of units is the answer to attacking as well, because 10+ units will just appear in the third to last city you need to conquer, in a single turn.

It was the last civ game to have the stack of doom and its nearly impossible to play now after civ 5 completely changed the field. 

The main issue was simply how defence and offence were handled in the game. Defence was majorly OP. I mean, a single longbowman with 1 city defence was able to hold his own, agaisnt 3-4 units. In otherwords a city with 3 longbowman would need a army of 12 units to take, and thats without a) losing any on the way and b) not including any catapults that you would need to reduce the walls, otherwise you could add an extra 4-5 units.

In other words to take a city with 3 longbowmen and walls would require 20 units. It was such a bad design that a complete re-haul of the combat system was a main point for civ 5.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

THE REVIEW:
First and foremost my playtime is far from the actual time I spend with it. Over the course of time I probably played it for 100 times as long, if not more. But I recently got the game on Steam very cheap, the reason being my old copy of the game I bought long time ago was from an old gaming site which had implemented an obnoxious yearly updated that had to be manually re-installed to ""refresh"" their DRM protection (or the game wouldnt run). So the current 77 hours is just from the time I bought it a few weeks ago until now.

I am recommending the game, but I really shouldn't if we are just talking about the vanilla game with no mods. The vanilla game is.. well quite frankly it's not very good. It's barebones, very predictable, with a shoddy AI. However, with mods you completely and utterly transform it into a magnificent masterpiece that truly stand the test of time. The modding community was/is especially strong with this title and incredible mods and overhauls have been created through tireless and immense devotion from talented modders. The fact that the game engine does ALLOW modders to add and change so much as they have done, does at least give the game some credit. The later renditions in the series, civ5 and civ6, are very limited in mod support and as a consequence those games have much fewer and much smaller mods. Modders weren't able to fix those games, they still suck. (but the majority of civ5 and civ6 gamers seem to be overjoyed with these games for some strange reason... I guess most gamers want dumbed down superficial gameplay. ah, but that's another story. If you don't like complexity and details I can tell you now that any civ game in it's vanilla state will probably be just what you want...).

Now that I made it clear how important mods are for this game (I wouldnt have played it without mods and I think I actually only played the game ONCE without mods, then when I started with mods I never looked back) I should mention Caveman2Cosmos mod overhaul pack (C2C) as it is insanely filled with content. I can't even start to describe just how much content it has unless you actually see it for yourself. But here's a few pointers: 13 tech eras. 13!, from ""Prehistoric"" era all the way up to ""Transcendent"" and each of those eras containing from ~50-100 technologies, which all amounts to nearly 1000 total technologies to research. Compare that to vanilla civ4's 86 (92 if you include BTS's +6 techs) total technologies...! That's the kind of grand scale C2C provides. And this trickles down into almost every area of the mod, be it units, buildings, wonders, promotions.... And many more specially designed concepts are implemented too, like hunting. Hunting animals to capture to use on your cities for bonuses and benefits is a major part of the game, especially in the prehistoric era, which is obviously very fitting. But there is also a ""cover"" system where units can have different cover and spotting modifiers through promotions or terrain or improvements, making for a very fun and interesting hide and seek mechanic. But enough of that, I could talk all day and night about C2C and I would only scratch the surface of what there is.... If you like details and complexity, you definitely must not miss out on C2C.

C2C official forum thread here: https://forums.civfanatics.com/threads/caveman-2-cosmos.288570/

Outside of C2C I can also recommend the Realism Invictus mod which true to its name seeks to give the player a more realistic experience. It's far from as complex or content filled as C2C, but it has its own charm and is very polished, with still a large amount content (just not the INSANE degree of content in C2C ;) ).

Realism Invictus official website here: http://www.realism-invictus.com/

The great thing is that these mods can be installed concurrently without interfering with eachother at all. A specific mod can be loaded with the game through a mod supplied batch file or you can run the vanilla game and then load the desired mod from the main menu (prompting a restart launching of the game with the mod loaded.)

A note to would-be mod users: you must play on 64bit system or else you will probably sooner or later run into a MAF error which is due to the game using too much memory for a 32bit system to handle (or maybe civ4 just wasnt optimized to handle such memory allocations on a 32bit system with so much extra content) Whatever the actual reason, a 32bit system wont work for you if you decide to install mods that boosts the amount the content more than just a little. The vanilla game doesnt run into this problem, but mods such as the two above mentioned has so much content that games will grow the memory beyond the limitations that the game can get in a 32bit system. Even on a 64bit system there is a risk that later eras can give problems if you choose to play on huge maps. Especially if you play C2C on a huge map the later modern errors are liable to produce a MAF error, even on 64bit systems. A MAF error will make your save game unable to continue because you will keep getting the error each time you end a turn, sometimes you can reload the game and get one turn more, but then the next turn will produce the error again, until finally it happens everytime you end that turn and you cannot progress anymore. However on Large maps there shouldn't be any problems no matter the era you reach or how long you play with C2C (I never had anyway, but of course I dont know the specifics of your system so I can give no guarantees you wont experience MAF's even if you do make sure to use a 64bit system and no maps larger than Large). So as long as you have a 64bit windows and do not use maps larger than Large maps then you will most likely be fine (again I give no guarantees, all can say is it works for me). If you do choose to use huge maps expect problems MAF's to begin occurring around or after Modern age. On a 32bit system expect MAF's around medieval age even on Large maps. Again, note that the vanilla game has so little content it is unlikely to have problems with 32bit systems even with Huge maps.",1594895752,1594898974,True,2,0,0.516192972660064697,0,True,False,False

The final and most ambitious of the Civilization IV expansions, Beyond the Sword is a phenomenal advancement of the Civilization formula--expanding the core game beyond the confines of Earth and into space. When Civilization tried this same trick, several years later, they simply re-skinned Civilization V and sold it as a new game, without even half so much depth or heart as Beyond the Sword--which is a total conversion of Civilization IV.

Beyond the Sword is a bit more difficult to get into now than it was during its heyday, owing mostly to the dated design of Civilization IV. Most egregious is the absence of tooltips, which exacerbates the learning curve and can make even simple tasks a bit tedious to complete. The combat mechanics also leave a lot to be desired, especially as the science fiction setting seems to lend itself more towards war than diplomacy (or maybe that's just in my head). Today, there are tons of brilliant grand strategy games set in space, but most are in real-time, and of the few that are turn-based, fewer still offer the complexity or depth of Beyond the Sword.

Pros-

#1.Many civilizations to choose from

#2.Good graphics

#3.Good music and voice acting

#4.Many difficulty levels

#5.Many religions in the game

Religion does effect how some people treat each other.This is very realistic

#6.Multiple ways to win the game

#7.Custom games

I like that I can turn off barbarian and animal attacks.I know having them are realistic but I prefer to take them out.I also change other things and I like the freedom.If I could not make my own custom game then I would of rated this a 5 or 6

#8.Cool animations after you build most wonders

#9.Random events add more of a challenge

#10.Conquering a civilization that has been pissing you off is fun

#11.Cool mods to check out


Cons-

#1.Unrealistic combat in some situations

Could a tank ever be killed by some of the units in the game? Even if a tank ran out of ammo and fuel than the only way some units could kill the men inside of it would be to wait for them to exit the tank.There was certain battle winners that seemed really unrealistic.Overall the combat odds of winning a battle seemed realistic enough but I hope it is improved 


#2.Not being able to see the cities the way Total War allows you to

Compared to Total War in which you can see your city up close,Civ needs some major improvement

#3.Not upgrading the battles the way Total War has

The up close combat in Total War is far from perfect.The AI can be stupid and unrealistic but the up close combat battles are an option that Civ needs in my opinion

#4.Not enough religions and lack of religious options

I think more religions should be added.I also think being able to choose atheist,theist and agnostic should also be added


The Bottom Line -

Civilization IV: Beyond the Sword has plenty to offer strategy fans.I have spent countless hours playing it and I can make custom games very different from each other.I would say it is the best Civilization game I have ever played.I think I like more than Civ 5 and I have not played 6 yet.

I do think it needs even more options for custom games though.It just doesn't have enough options for me.

I do recommend that all strategy fans buy this but I didn't find it to be amazing or revolutionary.It is just a good turn based strategy game that can give you hours of fun.I do hope they try the total war battles it would be cool.

The modding community for this game is excellent.  Fall From Heaven II and the modmods bring a wealth of gameplay options that after 2000 hours is still not stale.  Highly recommend.

For anyone who liked playing RISK the board game, or Settlers of Catan, or SIMS, or anything like those games, try playing this. It is a strategy game, but you can spend just as much time exploring and developing your lands and trading goods with neighbours as you can going to war. And while war in this game is fun, you don't even have to go to war. There are multiple ways to win the game, (for example you can found the United Nations and win through diplomacy, or you can build other world wonders and win a cultural victory. You can win by having the most land, and so on. And yes of course you can also blow your neighbours up too). Try it. :)",1579148723,1579150068,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

It is a game that is enjoyable the more and more you play it and it rewards new strategies as well as playing to certain strengths. I have gotten to where I can win almost every time on Monarch difficulty, yet it is rewarding because it still is so challenging at times. My only complaint is that because the game was developed so many years ago, you can abuse the AI in certain ways. (For example: At war, the AI if they have catapults will always lower the wall defense, even if they could take the city with little effort, sometimes allowing you to get troops there in time to defend). But then again there is an advantage to being human I guess. I find myself playing Civ IV and Civ III more than any of the other ones. I think this is largely due to the fact that the game is simple to understand but extremely hard to master. I would love to see a redone version of Civ III or Civ IV more than I would a newer game, but those are just my thoughts.

At first it felt like this game was impenetrable, but I stood up all night regardless throwing myself at this game until things started to click. Some of my fondest memories was spending late night hours with a bottle of crystal light, venturing further and further into the future where I would eventually walk away with a victory. I would go so far as to say this game has brought me some of my fondest memories, perhaps some of that is due to a time and place of when it took place, but it was special none-the-less.

So that's why I bought Civilization 5 almost immediately, and something was different in how I felt about Civilization afterwards. Chasing that high I got with Civilization 4 actually made me dislike 5... I still had fun sometimes but it felt like a chore. I was sticking with 5 because I enjoyed 4 so much so I had decieved myself into thinking I was having fun. I rarely finished a game. 

Jumping back into it a little more than a decade later, a similar rush of excitement came over me when I joined a lobby that didn't immediately disconnect or where everyone left. Seeing the map and units on the map gave me a sense of joy and familiarity... the only other strategy game that has even came close to that was Endless Legend. For a while, playing Amplitude's game brought me back closer to the original Civ 4 days, so I became a primarily Endless player for a short bit. The difference to me was that while Endless Legend had interesting ideas, I felt like once I saw those ideas in play, I wasn't too tempted to repeat that process. Whereas Civ 4 felt timeless in a way, because of the similarities between factions, they were more open to be played differently I guess.

Anyways... this is just me showing my respects for a game that has introduced me to strategy games in general. It's more for me than anything else, writing a quick thing about a game that has meant so much to me for so long. The other games I currently have accompanying this one is Offworld Trading Company, Chaos Reborn, and Koikatsu Party. I'm currently chasing that next high in discovering a new game so I'm cautiously looking for the next best thing. I'm honestly uncertain if that'll happen in my current mindset, I might have to move on for the sake of discovery.

first, it isnt properly explained how civ 4 works: if you bought it complete like mine, the expansions are not installed by installing the base game - each of the installs is actually separate, so each succeeding expansion version includes any previous dlc plus the base game. this means to play all of civ 4 and expansions, you only need to install the beyond the sword version which was the final expansion and so includes everything.

this game is different in many ways to civ v - the map isnt hex its squared, which i think is not as good as civ v; but this game the combat is very different, with unit stacking. you can get some pretty impressive battles as a result, where a huge stack of mixed units tries to take a city from another huge stack or from a small stack of highly experienced units. this makes the experience very different - not better necessarily, just i think some will prefer civ v and some this game.

diplomacy is different also, i have other civs as vassals for example. while that means you are their boss, it also means 2 other things - when you get into war so do they, and if someone attacks them, you have a moral obligation to defend them. this complicates diplomacy in an interesting way.
. 
some units behave differently, the one most springing to mind is the privateer: in civ 5 it captures enemy ships but is always clear who owns it. in civ 4 it has hidden ownership - so you can blockade cities and sink ships with them and nobody will know who to declare war on. you can use it to enter enemy territory without risking war.

all in all this game is in some ways more complex, and others just different to civ 5 and just for the change of pace its worth buying this game, particularly if you get the complete civ iv with all expansions. there are lots of mods you can find for the game, and scenarios that it comes with. very enjoyable game.",1571012342,1571012342,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Civilization 4 broke the chain. I could win Civ4. Managed economies, production chains, monetary power houses. I had it all.

RNG IS THE WORST

It ruins games strategically, all that effort, all that work WASTED because of a lethal Rng roll. I'm not entirely against rng in general, procedural generation is a blessing for maps, enemies, missions, etc! And you can't just lose a tank to a spearman because of random chance. It's too strategically sound. 

(Apparently the rng also employed ""streaks"" to simplify processing according to one person on a single forum somewhere..)

Civ4 is like a lesson learnt from the developer. To anyone and to all, this game is the redemption to the impossibility of Civilization. The ""one more turn"" factor doubly more impactful.

Final Frontier, is my mod of choice. After a dip into trying my hand at Civ3 again and losing agonisingly so, I played a nice loong game of Civ4 in space, winning with sheer militaristic culling and politically cunning dominance.

Although it may now seem  a little dated when compared to the newer entries, it was a landmark entry in the series that added a number of features seen regularly in the successive Civilization games: multi-model units, religion, and depth in systems of government perhaps most analogous to the civics system in Civilization VI. 

The game itself is purely strategic empire building; the player generally starts out with a handful of units under their control with which to create an empire (although, with Beyond the Sword, accelerated starts, in which the player begins with a developed nation, are an option). From these humble beginnings a player must manage what little resources they have to grow. Production takes place in cities, which produce both units (the various units can create new cities, fight other player's units and capture their cities, or build infrastructure) and buildings (which affects how a nation grows in size and in sophistication, gathers wealth, distributes resources, and produces units). More advanced units and buildings are unlocked as players research new technologies. Technologies also unlock civic choices (think style of government) and religion, which impacts your nation's domestic policies as well as your international standing.

All of these actions can lead to a myriad of ways to win the game, which reflect a number of playstyles- you can colonize or conquer the world, convert everyone to your religion, be the first to send colonists to distant space, or through shrewd diplomacy run the world through a global congress. The onus is on the player to determine how they play and win the game, with arguably more potential means to do so than in the previous or successive games.

Civilization IV manages to strike a balance between domestic management, strategic events, and a dynamic world in a way that prevents any one facet of empire-building to eclipse the others, and to advance the pace of gameplay at a rate that, for the most part, keeps it from becoming tedious (sometimes early game can develop slowly, but as a player expands their holdings, it quickly moves past any potential stagnation).

Beyond the Sword adds an additional smattering of content that deeply impacts how the game plays. While the most visible aspect of the expansion is the addition of a number of new civilizations, a large amount of content is added that expands late-game action, especially in the areas of espionage, global diplomacy, and trade. Features like the addition of corporations and random events have a way of radically altering the direction a player may take in a game.

And all this is before one mentions mods. Civilization IV (and Beyond the Sword in particular) has a plethora of high-quality mods available, which, once downloaded and installed, can be easily started in-game while picking a scenario. The focus of the mods run the gamut, too. Fictional scenarios abound: Fall from Heaven II puts the player in a dark fantasy setting, while Dune Wars is a reimagining of Frank Herbert's influential science fiction classic. And if authenticity is more your style, mods like Realism Invictus attempt to provide historical accuracy (among a host of other features), and Caveman 2 Cosmos attempts to follow the human story from its infancy as ""cavemen"" to being the transcendent masters of the universe.

But above all else, Civilization IV is about freedom- the freedom to run a nation any way you wish; the freedom to be an influential leader, a wealthy trader, a passive pacifist, or a cruel tyrant; and the freedom to do all of this with impunity. It is about the freedom to tag alongside icons of history and repeat their triumphs and failures, or to forge your own destiny and leave your own legacy. And taking the various pre-installed scenarios (exponentially so if one would download mods) into account, it can even give one the freedom to lead their people as a hero against a fallen god, to crush one's enemies with their hordes of giant robotic war machines, or to explore the furthest reaches of the galaxy.

In Civilization IV, with the Beyond the Sword expansion, the choice is up to the player. The question is- will you take it?",1562009577,1562009577,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

-Vibrant MP community
-Many Mods: Fall From Heaven 2, Rhye's and Fall of Civilization, Dune Wars, etc.

The best of all Civilizations, it stuck to its origins of being a strategic empire-management game. Civilization IV has an extremely high replay value: I had a non-Steam copy for years, and have logged at least 500+ hours on Civ4 and its mods before deciding to purchase a digital copy.

I -HIGHLY- recommend this game!

And if you do get a copy, let me know and we can play multiplayer sometime!

Fall From Heaven is an interpretation of Simtex's turn based strategy, Master of Magic (MoM). MoM with its artefact editor was very configurable with great replay value. Fall from Heaven stretches the magic metaphor with all kinds of cool, playable options.
Race world spells, alternate magic progression trees, evil / neutral / good aligned races, evil / neutral / good avatars. 
How great is it to play evil, own the good magics and summon the avatar of Good - thus denying him to a good race (or vice versa). 
Or discover the technology that leads to the Shadow unit + the Shrine of Sirona. A Shadow can chip away at the units of your enemy and constantly be healed. 
How about capturing an end game boss - Acheron the Red Dragon spawns after about 100 turns - chip away at it with a few units then use a Beastmaster (I used a Shadow). 
Endless joy from dungeons that spawn baddies - park a unit (or hero) near and manage the xp. Even better than dungeons are the indestructible locations such as Guardian of the Pristin Pass. Don't build cities there!
The soundtrack by Nox Arcana is exceptional, the civilopedia is comprehensive - but there are little things you keep discovering. The mod works fine on the Civ IV engine and does an excellent job of conjuring up the sense of difference and the strange (but oddly beautiful) of Simtex's Master of Magic. I can only scratch the surface with this review so check around on the net - there's plenty more info - and yes I sometimes crank up Simtex's MoM.
Fall From Heaven 2 mod for Civ IV BtS is endlessly replayable - give it a try, you'll be hooked.

While less tactical than the latter versions of Civ, it holds it's own in feeling like a true civilization builder, somewhat lost in V and VI.

The multiplayer is still active, however you may need to join up on a Civ IV BTS steam group and send out a few friend requests. You need cordination between players due to the long hours of each game and generally most won't play unless offered. 

As a side note, I really suggest going on the website Civfanatics for Civ IV BtS (link below) and downloading the mod/map GEM (Giant Earth Map). You won't get a better Earth based ""building a civilization"" experience, which is what I and many geogrpahic/geopolitical buffs love.

I simply have nothing negative to say about Civ 4 beyond the sword. Keeps me coming back year after year.

So much has been added to make the gaming experience better, everything frustrating about civ 5 and 6 can be fixed by just playing civ 4.

Beyond the Sword is a great expansion as it brung a lot more units, and a lot of helpful addition in control the government of your civilization, along with introducing some re-defined conditions for revolts and wars. It also expanded on the Civilization IV community, specifically modding and redefinitions of the series. This essentially expanded upon the 1700s to the 2000s and beyond, introducing a few more mods intended for this expansion.

Graphics - 
Despite its age the game is graphically appealing and has its own charm.

Game Play  compared to civ 5/6 -

Civ 4 feels more like a empire game compared to civ 5/6,  the game allows for more wider playstyles, but also has emphasis on controlling a greater number of troops and as well cities.
Civ 4 also provides you more leverage over your own economy by tinkering with your overhead costs and managing your tiles, The economy seems alot more interactive compared to civ 6 forexample
the AI also seems to be better in Civ 4, due to the fact that Stacks of Troops are easier to manage for them.
Defending just means stacking more and more, so that works out for them.

Overall a great game and expansion.

I loved the fact that I could play leaders from the greatest nations and empires the world had ever seen, building an empire that can stand the ""test of time"". It is because of CivRev that my Brother and I went to the nearest Walgreens to purchase a cheap Civ game at the time(this was when Civ 5 was still fresh). Armed with $20, I bought my steam card, went home, and made a purchase, a purchase that would forever change my life. I should note that I was a noob back then, and bought vanilla Civ 4 first, but I do not regret it, hearing the sweet sound of Baba Yetu grace my eardrums, oh what sweetness. It all went downhill(or uphill) from there. Civ 4----->Civ 4 Warlords------->Civ 4 Beyond the Sword(BTS), that is the order I went to purchase. I can say that Civ 4 BTS was the pinnacle of excellence for me, and remains as such today( Civ 5 plz bring back one more turn for multiplayer :( ). I was able to play 1000 turns with my bro on one game, a testament to the playability of Civ 4 BTS. The ai can be shabby at times, but when its good( Peter the Great of Russia), you can get wars on the magnitude of WWII in the game.

I easily have several thousands of hours maybe even tens of thousands in all civ titles together playing it since civ 1.

But civ 4 is the best in terms of depth, replayability and strategies. Its not as dumbed down as civ 5 and has many ways to win the game not just war.

Edit:
To add a little depth to this review, compare the mod features of civ 5 and 4 and you will easily see how superior Civ 4 still is even without Steam Workshop Support. 

- Civ 4 has Multiplayer Mods. Still not happy? 
- Civ 4 vanilla has a working AI, want more?
- Civ 4 Ai can be modded to kick you in the butt unless you are a freakin PRO! More?
- Civ 4 has many ways too win and each can be played for equally...
- Civ 4 offers small civs a debth and playability you cannot get in civ 5 it is actually pretty damn well balanced. Since with small civs you can outtech bigger guys like crazy... he attacks with stacks of doom 4x your size? Who cares his Swordsmen are no match for your riflemen...done that dozens of times...
- Civ 4 has a well balanced techtree with rounded civics that work like a charm beside it. You can stack your bonusses to match your preferred way of winning. Tech-crazy, Culturewhore, Militarist, Space-Alien-Weirdo...and so on. 

Ever wanted to get diplomacy to be transparent in 5? Me too...never really worked. In Civ 4 it is transparent, you can actually rely on the information in diplomacy. Are those pesky civs getting on your nerves...mod it, mute them, play in peace and calm :) 

Alright so the only downside for some might be the stack of doom, but if you rely on that vs a skilled player you can probably kiss your stack goodbye anyway... so, in MP a non issue if you know what you are doing. In SP, well... it actually is not a clickfest like civ 5...""hey your 500000 units need to move...even though the entire map is already filled with units, but please do...""

Hands down...Civ 4 >>>> Civ 5 all the way except in graphics :)
----
With civ 6 on the market now for a while and the first DLC also available i still stand by my review. Civ 4 is by far the best title in the series so far. Civ 6 just never really has much action, its Civ City more like a sim city in civ clothing. You build and build and build never really action and if you do attack the AI is so freakin bad at basically the entire game, its just another tedious boring repetetive task. Sadly the only real action you can have in Civ 6 is religious wars, the rest is just not good. Remember Panzer General? Thats how turn based 1 unit per tile tactical battles should look like, but civ 6 is too small for that. A city has no real surrounding land its just city, minimal distance city, minimal distance city...not much tactics on near to no land possible. If you up the minimal distance to 5-7 (mod) its getting better however tech progression is also way too fast. You build a few units you can already start building the new type...and so on. Tech progression too fast, wars to boring, constantly building some upgrades boring trade mechanics, boring religion, boring culture...i am slowly losing hope with the game designers at firaxis. It was once GRAND Strategy now its more like dumbed down to tactical warfare between production centers. Not much grand strategy anymore in sight. Better play Europe Universalis IV or Stellaris or Civ 4 :)",1445606755,1518722319,True,18,0,0.542566061019897461,0,True,False,False

This is my favourite Civilization game and i have started playing Civ on my Amiga in 1994. Although Civ V comes close, IV wins over it by having great mods such as Fall from Heaven 2 and Dune Wars.

All of the Civ games up to V are timeless classics and i have recently played all of them from I to V, then went back playing IV with mods.

Besides being incredibly fun and addictive these games are also quite educational, which is always a plus.

It is incredible how much attention was paid to even the smallest details, and even after playing for twenty years there is always something that pleasantly surprises me.

All of the Civ games have great music, but i have to emphasize the high quality and authenticity of Civ IV and V.

After nearly 13 years since its initial release, Civ IV has established itself as one of the 4X genre's classic titles, taking its honored place next to other giants like Master of Orion and Alpha Centauri. Chalk all this up to the hordes of devoted fanboys if you must. Or the fantastic modding community. Or the perceived inferiority of later titles in the series. But I'm still of the opinion that this game has succeeded on its own merits. Even over a decade later, its mechanics still hold up to scrutiny. They're simple and abstract, but deceptively complex--one look at a Deity run on YouTube, and you'll understand what I mean. Granted, the graphics are a bit dated in 2018, and some still shudder at the thought of the infamous ""doomstack."" Warfare has been (and always will be) a weakness of the series, but Civ IV eschews tactical depth in favor of sheer breadth. Neither Civ V or Civ VI gives you the epic sense of scale that Civ IV delivers when you reach a late game war and slam dozens of units into each other. And at the risk of offending naysayers, the warfare in Civ IV is still some of the best in the series. War is less tactical and more logistical. Winning requires planning, grand strategy, and proper allocation of resources, not finesse. This kind of approach feels better for a game that purports to cover the entire history of the human race. The game makes warfare a function of empire. You feel like a ruler sending nameless soldiers to their deaths, not a general commanding a single army. It's this sense of distance that the later Civs lack. Empire building games do not mix well with tactical wargames. Rather than succeeding as either, Civ V and VI turn out to be poor attempts at both--subpar wargames and subpar empire building games. In the end, Civ IV turns out to be a much more focused experience. It knows what it's trying to do, and it does it effortlessly. 

Whatever you may say about warfare, Civ IV is still king as far as the ""management"" and ""expansion"" sides of the game are concerned. One problem the Civilization series has always had trouble addressing is the problem of controlling expansion. How can we limit growth in a way that feels natural and rewarding to the player, while also leaving room in the late game for sprawling empires? It's a difficult question, and Civ titles rise and fall on the answers they give. Civ IV's answer is by far the best in the series, and it comes with three very basic principles. 1. Science is tied to commerce yield. Using a percentage slider, the player controls how much of their commerce they want committed to science and how much they want committed to gold. 2. Cities have a maintenance cost which depends on their distance from the capitol and how many total cities are in your empire. 3. Cities initially cost more gold in maintenance than they make in commerce. Together, these three mechanis require the player to take a balanced approach toward expansion. Expand too slowly, and you'll lose out on the early game land grab. Expand too quickly, and you'll ruin your economy, forcing your research to grind to a halt and causing your units to go on strike. Each city, as the Civ IV veteran Sulla once said, is an ""investment."" Early on, new cities are weak and are a burden your empire has to bear. But if you keep developing them, building and working cottages, they can eventually support themselves. Establish a strong enough economic base wth a few core cities, and you'll have the ability to control dozens of cities in the mid-late game. It's a fantastic system, and still, I would argue, the best the series as seen so far.

Yeah, but it's 2018. We've got Civ VI now. Civ IV is old hat. It's dated, it's UI is clunky, and there's just no reason to play it anymore. Au contraire, my friend. Whatever the game may now lack in modern amenities, it makes up for with timeless mechanics and peerless depth. This is a game, to the detriment of every other aspect of your life, that will keep you glued to your seat well into the wee hours of the morning. If you have friends to play with, this is a game that will surprise you with escalating borders, Cold Wars, stunning betrayals, and the occasional nuke (not that I would know anything about that). This is a game that will test your capabilities, especially on the higher difficulties.

Pros
-UI is the best of the series. Numbers, Details, and Strategic informaiton are all readily available
-Graphics not ""cartoonized"" like the recent lineup.
-Replayability is high as no two games are alike
-Modding Community is active and supports expanding the game
-Diplomacy enchanced, Religions deepened, Corperatrions added all creating a more immersive experience

Cons
-Macro and Micro management can overwhelming to beginners

On a serious note.  This is the best Sid Meier Game EVER! No contest.  Along with a dumbfounding number of  AAA, ‚Äú5 Star‚Äù quality mods (Fall From Heaven, Rise Of Mankind, etc ‚Ä¶) this title is, off hand, one of the best PC games ever made.

A fantastic game for the series, Civilization 4 Beyond the Sword improves the base game in so many ways it will forever be a must have expansion for this classic. The game run's smooth and with little to no bugs, and there is never a dull game if you love the Sid Meir series. The base game improved with a variety of new units, buildings, and civilizations that are all a blast to play and add a new flare to the game which makes it feel fresh. Classic Civ at it's finest. 

The game also has some of the most diverse and incredible scenario's to ever grace a civ game. Not only have they pulled scenarios from some of the best old mod of their time, such as Ryse and Fall and Fall from Heaven, but also a host of unique scenarios that almost feel like DLC within a DLC. Next War adds an entire new era and story allowing archology cities and clone armies to devastate the world while Road to War throws you into the war torn WWII era Europe and Pacific. They even added 2 scifi mods, one a traditional 4X space empire game and a Turn Based game controlling a team of cyborgs. These are only a few of the numerious scenarios they have added and your playtime will rise exponentially as you play each scenario for hours on end. This DLC is more like a dozen smaller games put together and packaged at an insanely low price. If there is any selling point you should follow in my review, it's simply this. 

Beyond the Sword is perhaps one of the best DLC to ever be sold for Sid Meir's epic series, perhaps 4X games in general. A DLC that takes numerous unique takes of the game and makes for endless fun.",1498189867,1498189867,True,4,0,0.565217375755310059,2,True,False,False

Civilization 4 was such a game; from the moment you played your first turn, you knew it would claim far more of your time and energy than you were sure you had to give. Just one more turn? No, just one hundred more. And now that the latest expansion has dropped, it's time to re-evaluate your schedule once again.

Before we launch straight into all the new stuff, let's get the game's most noticeable flaw out of the way: Leonard Nimoy is no longer the voice for the game's pithy quotations. And since the tech tree has been considerably changed up, you'll be hearing Sid Meier's voice, and not Nimoy's very early in the game. Sid's a nice guy and all, but he's no Mr. Spock.

The expansion brings with it a host of changes, additions, and re-balances of Civilization 4's old formula. The benefits of the previous expansion, Civilization 4: Warlords, are rolled right in as well. Among the new systems are the espionage system, the corporation system, an advanced start system, and an army of new combat options. This is before we even look at all the new scenarios and mods that come packed on the disc.

Espionage makes for an interesting addition to the game. Unlike the somewhat awkward spy unit of pre-expansion Civ 4, the re-worked espionage system provides for a variety of different options. By spending espionage points, which are generated much as research points are, you can work on counter-espionage, foment rebellions, gather information, attempt to steal technologies, sabotage buildings in opponents' cities, influence local civics and religion, or even poison the local watering hole. Most of these require you to send a spy along to a target city, but there are still some passive benefits to building up espionage points, most of which are just gaining inside information on your foes' activities. The espionage system doesn't really require you micromanage carefully, so it's a pretty rewarding system all around. While you shouldn't be expecting to watch James Bond murder his way through the Soviet Union to make certain your civilization comes out ahead, it's nice to know he's on your side.

Excuse me a moment, I have to conquer Mongolia.

[3 hours later] Crap, it's that late already? Alright, well, let's talk about one of the other new systems quick ‚Äì the random world events. The addition makes a lot of difference to the game, and they're worked in amazingly well, frequently playing off of the events that are already ongoing in the game. Random events pop up due to wars between civilizations of different religions, over-farming, failed royal marriages, or just plain chaotic weather patterns. In a lot of respects, the random events are reminiscent of Galactic Civilizations 2, though they generally feel more balanced and less arbitrary.

Some of the new systems don't go over as well, though. The corporate system in Civilization 4: Beyond the Sword presents an almost nightmarish window into our own corporate structures. Founding a corporation is an interesting proposition, as it may very well harm you more than it benefits you. Corporations can potentially generate massive profits, but they take a great person, access to specific resources, and a fair amount of startup capital to get off the ground. Even after that, they can end up costing a lot to maintain, and getting rid of them is hard. 

Spread a branch office to your foe, however, and suddenly the maintenance burden is lessened, because your neighbor is now shouldering some of it. It's a weird, and eerily accurate, process, where frequently no one but the corporation really profits much. When you feng shui your trade routes, resources, expenditures, and diplomatic relations just right, however, corporations can generate an impressive amount of income ‚Äì finding and maintaining those balances is the trick, and it's not a simple one. Overall, corporations can be far more trouble than they're really worth, so players that aren't trying to eke every last benefit out of the game should really just stay away from 'em.

The combat refinements - including some considerable changes to artillery units - change up warfare in some interesting ways. The new specialized units bring some flair, and can help define some civilizations' preferred ages. Likewise, the new rulers (and in the case of Rome, a change in the ruler) also help spice things up in some interesting ways, and help to provide an even more varied experience. The new changes and additions help the game's replay value immensely ‚Äì though it's not as though it was needed in the first place.

Hang on, Egypt's getting uppity again...

[Another 3 hours later] Well, I'm happy to report that the pharaohs have made friends with my cannon balls. A few rounds through their fancy stone walls, and suddenly we're the best of buds again! Hatshetsup was positively grinning when she heard I wasn't going to put holes in the roof of her palace ‚Äì but it's not cause she asked me real pretty, it's because she always serves the best beer at her diplomatic functions.

The A.I. in Civilization 4 has been revamped immensely with the new expansion ‚Äì for once, you can't win the game just by keeping up with the science and agreeing to the occasional demand. When I first took up Civilization 4, I got into the habit of playing on ""Emperor"" difficulty level and doing alright for myself, but Beyond the Sword has forced me to scale back to ""Noble"" to break even, and ""Warlord"" to do well for myself. Between the new complications and the much cleverer A.I. opponents, I've found the game to be a renewed challenge, and a heck of a lot more fun. Given that the game was already siphoning off shreds of my very soul to power its dark simulations, I fear I might need the services of a preacher before I'll rid myself of this game. What's worse is that I'm not even clear I'll want to get that exorcism.

Getting away from all that's new to the gameplay, the expansion also comes packed with a variety of mods and new scenarios. Some are great. Some are really quite bad. There's a total conversion packaged with the game that's frankly terrible; it attempts to be some kind of tactical RPG, but ultimately comes off as a clunky turn-based strategy game with ugly units. Though it's interesting to see what can be done with the platform that Civilization 4 was built upon, it's a poor addition to the expansion. There's also a fantasy total conversion packed in, which fares reasonably, though will likely not distract you much from the main game. The varying new scenarios and little mods add some extra amusement to the game, especially the Next War mod, which expands into futuristic, sci-fi technologies.

Overall, Civilization 4: Beyond the Sword presents a lot of additions to what was already a great game. It's a good expansion, and capitalizes a great deal on fixing some of the weaknesses of the original. That said, the expansion doesn't do anything that will make someone who did not already enjoy Civilization games dance for joy.

The combat in the game starts off pretty simple as mostly just rock paper scissors until the ages move on and new tech is made on these fronts, becoming more complicated with artillery and aircraft being thrown in to the mix.

Building an empire is fun, as populations rise and cities and buildings are constructed the appearance of said cites change  in size with the various buildings being visable inside them.

Researching technology is a neat experiance; every time you have completed on you will be given a lovingly narrated qoute and a short description of what you accomplished, and after certain techs are resaerched you will enter a new era that will be accompanied by a change in the ambience music will change along with the asthetics of your cites to signify the age your people live in.

Espionoge mixes things up quite a bit, it gives you opportunites to see what your friends and rivals are resaerching and with enough intelligence you can do everything from poisoning the water hole to learning every single last move the target of your spies is making.

Wonders are great buildings and monuments that offer special bonuses such as The Great Wall, which will prevent barbarians from entering certain parts of your borders, The Oracle, wich will give you a free tch of your choosing, and The Taj Mahal, which gives you a golden age- a event that lasts a number of turns which will give boosts to virtually everything.

Another thing that can occur is the creation of Great People: Great Builders, Great Prophets, Great Merhcants, Great Generals, Great Artists, Great Scientists, and Great Spies. These guys can give you a variety of different boons from starting a corperation, expanding your borders, giving more experience to some of your units, and giving you a free tech.

You can manage you system og government from it's humble beginnings of tribal barbarism to slavery, police states, free speech, state property, theocracy, etc. These can vary in terms of expense but can also effect what kind of special events that can occur along with how other nations view your country.

Diplomacy is another thing that is simple at first but becomes far more complicated over time, between wars, religion, charity, various events, actions made by your friends, and many, many, other factors can change how the leaders of the world view you- or even how your own people see you.

I think above all others however in importance is the world maps, randomly generated that still manage to retain a sense of organization and beauty that are never the same, your experience will be different every time you play.

I have a lot of trouble getting into most 4X games, even turn-based ones, but what I think makes this game far better, than, say, Galactic Civilizations 2, is that it's complex enough to give rise to various strategies, game styles and outcomes, but you're still presented with enough detail that you can look at your civilization, its cities and its individual units and find out exactly why they're unhappy, or unsuccessful, or unprofitable.

Games like Galactic Civilizations 2 hide the formulas that govern your civilization under the hood, and playing them ends up feeling more like SimCity than Risk or chess: you simply find yourself responding to events as they happen, without a clear understanding of how your actions will affect even your own civilization. Civ4 throws that sort of design out completely--it's detailed, but not ridiculously so (like, say Master of Orion 3, where you feel like you're playing a spreadsheet), and knowing that its design is good, it doesn't feel obligated to hide the details.",1385446343,1479959760,True,38,0,0.781773805618286133,1,True,False,False

My gaming experience started with Dune 2, followed by the Settlers, C&C and Red Alert. I found nothing as interesting and addictive since then. You may know what I mean.

And then I got sucked into Civ5 2 years ago. I've never played a TBS, only RTS. But I really loved it. Now I learned that CIV6 is scheduled for later this year, but at the same time I learned that some hard-core CIV fans prefer CIV4 over the later versions.

I wanted to know why. And now I so do! If you are like me, you will love CIV4!

What do I mean? I mean if you prioritise the plot of the game, the depth of the scenario over the graphics, this game is so for you (not that the graphics is bad!)

If you actually want to think whilst playing, if you like complexity, if you enjoy devising long-term strategies and short-term tactics, you will love CIV4.

I have had the disk version of this game for years, and have played it so many times, and never gets old.

Vastly superior to Civ V which is lacklustre by comparison and, sadly, vastly superior to Civ Beyond Earth (+ BE Rising Tedium) which should have a been a brilliant game but just lacks so much.

Even with the dated graphics and original square based system (rather than the standard hex these days), it is just utterly suberb for many reasons, the main 2 of which is:

1) comes with a really easy hands-on map/civ editor so that it couldn't be simpler to create the kind of maps you want to play on; allocate global rescources to create trullty strategic scenarios, allocate where civs are, territories, allocate science, city infrastructure etc etc, the possibilities are endless. 

2) the Modding support for the game is HUGE. There are so many wierd, wonderful and awesome things you can add to the game, whiether you want to be historically accurate and/or add fantasy+sci-fi elements to it, there is so much choice for the player. 

This is CIV games at its finest. The choice of leaders is huge, each with their own bonuses, and characteristics. Diplomacy is FUN and engaging!

I have installed it on every computer I have owned since it came out. The Steam play time reflects that I played from my CD-ROM copy of CIV 4 complete until recently when my install discs became incompatible with Windows 10. I feel that the Civ 4 gameplay is the most balanced and addictive of Civ 4 series games, with strong ai, diplomacy, building, expansion, religion, commerce, and war all providing great depth that makes playing just one more turn addictive. In my opnion, only the great Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri has comparable all around strengths and innovations for its time, Moreover, Civ 4 has given me unparalleled replay value because it is the most modable Civ game.  Besides the usual tweaks of the vanilla game on can find in Civ 5, Civ 4's structure enabled the creation of many complete overhaul mods that transformed CIv 4 with new gameplay and graphics, including historical, fantasy, and sci-fi mods. For example, in my opinion, the Civ 4 fantasy mod, Fall From Heaven 2, remains of one of the best 4x strategy fantasy pc games ever made. 

Civ IV, however, does show its age when compared to more refined interface of Civ V. Civ 4's maps of square titles and battles with stacks of units on the same tile, also give a less sophisticated first impression. However, when I compare the gameplay between Civ 4 and Civ 5, I find Civ 4 AI is usually more challenging, sophisticated, and strategically effective than in Civ 5, with regard to both combat and non-combat activities alike.

Install Civ 4 complete (Civ IV, Civ IV Warlords, and Civ IV Beyond the Sword) and join the addiction!

The following review will focus first on Civilization IV as a whole, then on the expansion ""Beyond the Sword"".

[b]Civilization IV[/b]
Civilization IV was the first game of the Civ-series to go 3d, for better or for worse. The graphics are in fact atrocious compared to the newer Civ 5, and even Civ 3, with its 2d isometric graphics and heavy reliance on shades of brown. But as any fan of the TBS-genre will tell you; graphics are secondary to everything else.

You may ask yourself ""why invest in Civ 4 when Civ 5 and BE is out?"". Well, apart from having better graphics and adding [spoiler](and taking away)[/spoiler] certain features, there aren't many differences between these games. Some of the most important differences (or improvements as some will call them) are the limitation on movement and stacking in Civ 5. One may argue that limitations compared to older versions are negative, but the point would be moot when faced with ""the stack of doom"". So yes, at first glance, the newer games are better. There are however saving graces for Civ 4: Plenty of advanced and interesting mods, as well as a (more) stable multiplayer, the latter of which is laughable in Civ 5.

[b]Beyond The Sword[/b]
BtS is arguably the largest expansion to any of the Civ games, and a must-have if you want to use mods, as most of them now require it to work. It adds quite a few new features, including, but not limited to:
[list]
[*]Ten (10) new civs, as well as 6 new leaders for existing civs.
[*]Corporations: The religion of business.
[*]Random events: FUN
[*]Lots of new game rules and options, to help customize your experience.
[/list]

In conclusion: If you like the civilization-games, but don't care about graphics, or don't like the limitations of Civ V, or like Civ but want it to be more advanced with certain mods, or just want to be able to play multiplayer for more than 10 minutes without having problems; i would suggest grabbing Civ IV with BTS as soon as possible.",1440514843,1440514879,True,3,0,0.547478973865509033,0,True,False,False

[EDIT]
[I just saw this review and I consider it to be lacking]

400 hours of Civ IV later, I can still recommend this to you, I have not gone insane. It's a classic turn-based empire game with real charm, character and a grammy winning theme song. Voiced by Lenard Nimoy, and emblazoned with the Sid Meier's logo, this game is almost a must own for any self respecting human being.

Although, some people might think that this game is slow and boring. And yes, if you play on marathon mode, or long mode or even normal mode, you can satisfy a whole week's worth of game time in just one save file.

But, and this but is a Nicki Minaj scale but, turn the turn speed up to quick, set the world size to small, with random terrain generation and a full house of 16 civs, and watch your hour-or-so long chaotic power struggle ensue.

Of course, if you were looking for a more epic game, the RevDCM mod pack alongside one of the larger scale earth maps, or a huge scale random map, will set you up for one of the most enjoyable empire building sim game experiences you can get.

To round up, a flexible game with stunning audio, that can be tailored and played to pretty much anyone's needs. A great game and worth picking up.",1291009546,1438744104,True,0,0,0,1,True,False,False

You take control of a civilization starting at the dawn of time all the way to the modern era and beyond. The game is very in depth with all of the options at your disposal for how you manage your government, economy, religion, espionage, foreign policy, and many other factors. You can be Gandhi and set up a fascist theocracy with a socialist economy and nuke everyone on the planet. There is a lot of literature out there about how spectacular this game is so I‚Äôll just stop here.

One of the few flaws is the combat. It is all percentage based, so you can get in some pretty frustrating situations. Maybe you go into a battle where you have and 80+ percent chance of winning, but there is still a chance you can lose. Even at 97+percent I‚Äôve lost some times. This combat system is extremely frustrating when you ‚Äúget haxed‚Äù and lose on battle you should have won. Another issue is that in late game the combat really just becomes ‚Äúwho can have the most units crammed into a tile.‚Äù Your (and your opponents‚Äô) empire will get so big and have so much production that it becomes quite cumbersome to manage a war with all the military units you‚Äôll have around. Since you can fit literally infinite units in one space, it really becomes a contest of who can get the biggest army and march from city to city. These flaws pale in comparison to how great and addicting this game is, however.

This expansion, beyond the sword, is the best. It adds even more units, buildings, and civilizations to the game. Also, it comes pre-loaded with some of the best mods, including Rhye‚Äôs and Fall of Civilization, which takes this game to a whole new level. Over all it‚Äôs as close to a 10/10 game I have ever seen. You won‚Äôt regret spending the money to buy this, especially when it is on sale.",1388677007,1431495179,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Features:
- Cultural Borders, I really miss this feature in newer Civs. It's so much fun to see your culture pumping cities capture the ai miniature settlements near your borders without ever going to war.
- Vasal States: threaten other nations into becoming your vasals. Vasals will give you one of their resources for free and always vote for you. A much better way than in Civ5 where the defeated, down to 1 city civs need to be wiped out to get rid of them sabotaging you at every oportunity.

One of the things I like most about this incarnation of the Civ formula is the variety of ways you can play, and the customizeability of each game. You can set how many players/AI, there's a great variety of map types, and quite a few settings for how you want the game to behave as you play. In the game, you can micro-manage as much as you want (or s little as you want), with settings/tweaks to the production values of individual cities, or you can just set everything to auto. While I've always prefered a tech/diplomatic approach to winning the game, there's also a pretty good combat system as well for those that prefer launching stacks of archers and catapaults at their enemies.

This game isn't perfect. Some find it to be too micro-managey, despite the ""auto"" options. Others find certain systems to be lacking in complexity - the ""stacks"" combat often gets a lot of flack. If you're on the fence, read more reviews to see that the problems are, and decide if that will bother you.

The game offers a turn-based look at history from the stone age to modern times, as is the case with all Civ games. What sets IV apart from the rest of the series is the sheer depth of the different mechanics that the player must manage to be successful. These include, but are not limited to: Economy, Military, Population, Health, Technology, and Espionage. With all of that work to do across the different eras of human history, it is easy to say that the turns you take in Civ IV will be longer than any other in the series.

How you deal with this fact is up to your personal preference. However, one thing is certain, Civ IV is extremely well streamlined, and even new players will be right at home with the mechanics with a modicum of perseverence. As someone who struggled with Civ III, I had fully grasped the mechanics of Civ IV by my tenth hour of gameplay: easy to learn, hard to master.

Ultimately, I recommend this game wholeheartedly to strategy fans. If you have Civ V, consider this the wise granddaddy of that great game. It is a wholly different and in some ways far more rewarding experience. If you have never played a Civ game before, Civ IV is a deeper choice, though if you are impatient and seek a more casual experience, the excellent Civ V is recommended.",1415656639,1415656639,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Seems I've come full circle with Civ 4 after playing Total War games.

Civ 3 is still good and this is just as good as that. I can't compare with Civ 5 because I haven't played that.

With what is included in this package with Colonazation thrown in as well it certainly is value for money even at full price. Was is contained in the Warlord expansion is also included in Beyond the Sword.

All of the Civ games have taken a huge amount of time out of my life and I would say that every hour was worth it. Civ IV is my favorite installment in the series and BTS is by far my favorite variation of it. 

If you're wondering what makes BTS different from regular Civ IV, the difference is that BTS combines all of the exra features from expansions like Warlords and then adds a lot more: new units, buildings, wonders, AI and features such as events and new mods and scenarios.

This truly is the best stategy game i've ever played and still do.
Will you be a wealthy/Smart civ? A religious zealot? A Trader? A Cultralist? A Warmonger or Someone Everyone else hates a little bit less than your biggest rival?
PROS.
There is NO set stategy to win this game, and you have to be able to adapt to a developing world.
Soooo many choices of what to build, research, Influence, destroy.
CONS.
Other Human players (Either Suck at this game or don't understand it)
Spies were better in warlords.
City Govenor will prioritise scientists over other great people, Its really annoying.

War is NOT the only answer. i've won many cultrual, space, world/religious leader victories and never killed a single unit even with aggressive AI On Immortal. You bribe others to go to war for you!
Dont get me wrong i like a good war but if its not in your interests or you have nothing to gain avoid it.

People complain of broken deplomacy and stacks of doom.
On lower difficulties, deplomacy is Frustrating, as you'll be way in advance of the AI and it'll demand unreasonable trades and requests, that you WILL refuse, and as a result so and so declares WAR.
On higher difficulties the trades and demands are still weighted towards the AI but its NOT AS ridiculous and you're more inclined to take them.
You CHOOSE your friends. You CANNOT please Everyone.
As for 'stacks of doom' catapults rip them too pieces.

MULTIPLAYER
LAN = amazing, a real challenged if you opponent is good.
ONLINE = lots of issues.
Staging room is fairly vulgar due to the same few people.
Ragequits all too common.
Multiplayer is poor but Only due to the ameturism of your opponents, and i'm yet to actually see a winner of a game.
Nearly all of the players you come across are fairly weak and use the same stategy again and again.
Pick the Romans, get iron, build pretorians and go to war. its the same with any other race that gets an early unit that owns.
Nobody will allow tech trading as its ""unfair"" apparently, Truth is, that warmongor who set up the game doesn't want a challenge of facing longbows early.
Usually someone states they have infantry in x amount of turns and everyone else quits saying ""good game, you win, i forfeit"" even though i was 8 turns from a cultrual victory. Not that i'm bitter about it or nothing but it was only 1390ad and i was 8 turns away from Victory that no-one saw coming, and was then robbed of it. 2hrs of my time for nothing.

Civ V
No more stacks of death (you cannot stack units)- you must actualy be strategic when it comes to how you wage war: no more ""meh army bigger than ur army. i win."" 
Better graphics (if that matters to you: I could care less)
Game is more basic
Replaced gov types with culture branches... not sure which one I like more.
Made culture/domonation victories winnable. The only way I could ever find a way to win in civ iv was space race. I'm still lost when it comes to deplomacy.
City states: Single NPC cities that you can befriend or cature.
They replaced the square tiles (from which you could move 8 directions) with hexes (from which you can move 6 directions).                   
larger tech tree. 


Civ IV
they took away religion in Civ V! I loved the concept of religion, in my opinion they should have built upon it.
They took away sickness! I loved the concept of bla bla bla ^^^
They made it so that cities no longer become unhappy indivigualy, now the entire nation becomes bitchy at once. I liked the old way much better.

Beyond the Sword is the expansion pack that made everything about Civilization IV better, plus is necessary for some of the really good mods outs there such as Fall from Heaven.

So, I am certainly going to recommend it.  It is a strategy game that got a lot right.  The gameplay mechanics encourage expansion, but simultaneously impose reasonable limts.  New technologies can alter the way the game is played, making a very different strategic picture through railroads, airplanes, and democracy.  The religion mechanic adds great flavor and some interesting gameplay.  Diplomacy is easy to understand, but hard to exploit.

There are some flaws.  Get to far behind and you've lost, even if it takes another 100 years for the axe to actually fall.  The end game becomes a bit to grindy with units becoming to common.

RFC is amazing. In RFC, you can choose a civ, and play as them, in world history. You can also change history - for example, the Germans winning World War II, or the Mongolian Empire reaching from Africa to China. I have to criticize, though, that, if you want to play as, say, the Americans, I am pretty sure you have to select another Civ and play as them until 1775. But other than that, RFC is good!

Civ IV is a sublime strategy in the truest sense of the word. Spanning over 6000 years of human history, you'll start with a single settler forming a tribal village. Dozens of hours later you could be sending a fleet of warships to control oil deposits in the north pole, taking control of the global market with a corporation monopoly, or ordering a charge of knights in a futile last strike against an Aztec airbase.

It's a game that provides multiple ways to win and even several options to get to each of those conditions. You will compete against up to 18 other nations using diplomacy, warfare, exploration and luck to establish an empire. You will need to stake a claim on finite global resources, defend your borders, make friends and defeat enemies. Spread religion and corporations to control the masses and bankrupt your ememies. Deploy spies to see enemy troop movements or sabotage their reserach and production. Build great wonders to boost your cultural impact. Difficulty is easily scaleable and 'tweakable', providing a fantastic challenge. Perhaps you will triumph...and perhaps you will meet your end at the hands of Mahatma Ghandi's nuclear arsenal. One thing is for sure...you will have many, many replays of this game.

THEN there are the scenarios - various historical or fictional settings that tweak the rules and gives special conditions. See if you can spot the mod (inclided with the game) that inspired their later offering - 'X:COM Enemy Unknown'.

In Short: The greatest strategy game ever made*- there'll be no need for friends, jobs or even sunlight anymore with this baby. The only reason you should not be buying it is because you were reading this review. But it's over now...so go guy it!

But now the village elders have consulted with the shamans, and have advised you to cease. For you have found the perfect place to call your new home. The grass is green, and ripe for farming. The river sparkles and dances in the golden blaze of the setting sun, waiting to be tamed, to feel the keel of boats along her great girth. And beyond, the distant forested hills call to you. Maybe someday, you and your tribe will dig deep into the womb of the Earth-mother, and harvest the metals that lie within. 


You gaze with delight as the procession passes your balcony. The Emperor Jeffersonius himself, in his resplendent robes! His chariot rattles down the cobblestones as the victorious troops of the Ethiopian campaign march trimuphantly behind him, shields and swords gleaming in the summer sunshine. ""They have tamed Ethiopia, you know..."" you hear your father remark. "" We must move to the colonies soon, else there'll be no space left for us!"" Your mother laughs gently, and pats you on the head. "" We must think of Marcus. His education must take precedence, and you know old Ezrum refuses to travel....."" You smile, and throw flowers into the path of those brave legionaires, who fight for the Empire so you may have the best of all  things, here in the capital of the world, Washington.

Your horse gallops wildly through the smoggy streets. Gentlemen of industry, the representatives of the counties, aristocratic ladies, all of them jump and stumble out of the way as you ride past, angrily cursing your receding backside. Along the way, the butt of your rifle thuds against a slow-moving old academic, leaving him senseless upon the cobblestones. You care not, though. You have urgent news for the High Chancellor, and must not be impeded. A rebellion in the Indian colonies! The impertinence astounds you. How dare they, those brown-faced mongrels, rebel against the American Republic? You gallop up the steps of the Palace, and stop to gaze at the Eiffel Tower, under construction on the south banks of the Appatomac River. The fools....the nation that builds such wonders will not fall prey to such nefarious misdeeds! Reflection done, you proceed into the chambers of the High Chancellor to give him the news.

You sigh as you read the fine print of the tender submitted by the cold IronCorp executives. Summary privatization, first right to exploration contracts, government subisidzation of the first twelve months of drilling in the Thames estuary, etecetera, etcetera....your eyes water and you fling the document away, feeling the need for a break. You wipe your glasses and stroll over to the window. You gaze wistfully across the expanse of glass, neon and concrete that obscures your view of the Cristo Redentor, perched high above the city on Zara Yacob Hill. You ponder for a moment....is modernity really worth all this? Did all your ancestors, all the thousands of years of history, all the breakthroughs in science and technology and reason, all the accumulated pride, joy, triumph and defeat of the last four thousand years, lead to this? In the year of our Lord, 1955, you're standing here, in the Pentagon, trying to decide between two equally heartless, vile corporations. Is this what society has become?Ah, well. You wipe your glasses for the last time and shuffle back to your desk, reaching for the legal papers with a weary sigh. You look up at the television to see the newsman babbling about a terrorist attack on the Taj Mahal in Kyoto. Surprise, surprise......

""Oogaboog, wake up!""

""hhmmphr....grumble...what?""

""Chief Washington has called a meeting. He want all us warriors to attend. Quickly, get your club.""

""....sigh...okay. But remind me to tell you about strange dream I had just now. Big strange.""

""Okay, now come , we'll be late!""

You exit, yawning, into the golden rays of the setting sun, hoping that Washington would let you settle here. After all, the shamans did say it was a good place, and you are tired from all the wandering.
