I should also mention this game requires a Ubisoft account which is permanently bound to the game so if Ubisoft gets hacked, you loose the game.

From the moment you step foot into the sprawling landscapes of Bolivia, you're immersed in a world teeming with danger, intrigue, and endless possibilities. Developed by Ubisoft Paris and released in 2017, this masterpiece of a game sets a new standard for open-world tactical shooters.

First and foremost, the sheer size and detail of the world in Ghost Recon Wildlands are breathtaking. Bolivia comes alive with vibrant ecosystems, from dense jungles to towering mountains, each area offering its own unique challenges and opportunities. The attention to detail is astonishing, with every tree, rock, and building meticulously crafted to create an immersive and believable environment.

But it's not just about the world; it's about what you can do in it. Ghost Recon Wildlands gives you unparalleled freedom to tackle missions however you see fit. Want to approach stealthily, using silenced weapons and careful coordination to take down enemies without alerting reinforcements? You can do that. Prefer to go in guns blazing, unleashing chaos and destruction at every turn? Go ahead. The choice is yours, and the game rewards creativity and adaptability at every turn.

One of the standout features of Ghost Recon Wildlands is its seamless integration of co-op multiplayer. Teaming up with friends to tackle missions together is an absolute blast, with each player bringing their own unique skills and playstyles to the table. Whether you're coordinating synchronized sniper shots or causing mayhem with explosives, the cooperative experience is second to none and adds a whole new layer of enjoyment to the game.

And let's not forget about the story. While some open-world games sacrifice narrative depth for the sake of freedom, Ghost Recon Wildlands strikes a perfect balance. The tale of the Ghosts' mission to dismantle the Santa Blanca cartel is gripping and immersive, with memorable characters, intense cutscenes, and plenty of twists and turns to keep you on the edge of your seat from start to finish.

In conclusion, Ghost Recon Wildlands is nothing short of a masterpiece. With its stunning open-world design, deep and rewarding gameplay mechanics, and unforgettable cooperative multiplayer experience, it sets a new standard for what an open-world tactical shooter can and should be. Whether you're a fan of the genre or just looking for an epic adventure to lose yourself in, Ghost Recon Wildlands delivers in spades.

Ridiculous that coked out gangsters have better accuracy than your supposed elite operators. Once actual combat starts your AI companions are effectively worthless. The game is really balanced around having four players so solo play can be frustrating. 

The forced stealth sections of the game are infuriating. You can spend 15 minutes slowly creeping through a mission only to be forced to start over due to one mistake or just bad luck. Enemies can see you at huge distances any time they're facing you and can often see through solid cover. The lack of ability to move bodies so they aren't discovered turns these sections into a tedious waiting game for the enemies to slowly patrol out of the paths you need to cross.

Driving feels pretty good with many of the vehicles handling better than they probably should. Most vehicles are fun to drive with the exception of the armored SUV and APC. This is good because you're going to be spending a lot of time traveling to each objective. Once you do a few rebel operations you can unlock the ability to spawn a helicopter every minute or so which will greatly speed up your ability to go from objective to objective. The exception being some provinces which are so covered in SAM sites that any air travel is nearly impossible.

Progression wise if you seek out all the available skill point bonuses you'll usually be limited more by scavenged resources for upgrading skills. The random small caches are basically pointless after the early game and you'll primarily be hitting convoys to get the resources you need. These are a hassle until you upgrade the EMP drone that lets you easily stop a convoy and pick off the guards easily.

Overall, there's some fun to be had between long tedious sections and others that are infuriatingly unbalanced. A flawed buy playable game.",1708202736,1708468518,False,1,1,0.505494534969329834,0,True,False,False

This game is one of the most fun I've had with my friends in a long time. 
I never really got into any of the Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon games before Wildlands, so I was compeletely new to the special forces and their covert missions.
From the first trailer I was hooked. What an interesting villain (El SueÃ±o) with a whole cartel of characters that are still memorable over 5 years later. 

Never before and never since have I enjoyed picking up a multitude of vehicles to drive or fly around to my missions. What other game lets you ride a tractor to battle? (except farming simulators...) 

The movement is smooth (vaulting over things, running, etc.) and satisfying. 

The map is divided into different sections that are controlled by parts of the cartel, that need to be taken down. Even though each part of the map has recurring missions that might sound tedious or repetitive, I never felt like I was simply grinding the missions to advance. I loved collecting things, helping people, killing bad guys (and girls) and sneak around. 

The whole world in Wildlands is beautiful, there's people and animals that you can interact with. Yes, if you leave your vehicle on the street a whole traffic jam will occur. You have an impact, you are a person in their world not just a player in a map. 
On top of all the regular missions there's secrets you learn by talking to NPCs. I still remember the town that is completely inhabited by only dogs or the legend of El Tio.

There's also a whole thing about weapons and customizations but I'm going to be honest, I did not care about weapons when playing. As long as I could kill the enemies, I did not care whether my gun was more or less accurate. To learn more about this, another review might be more helpful.

Cons would be the enemies sometimes spawn on top of you and they have pin point accuracy and never miss.

It encourages planned and carefully executed assaults in a way that most modern shooters fail to. You wanna pretend you're special forces without dealing with the intricacy of milsim shooters? This is the ticket. Also, Breakpoint sucks, so buy this instead on a sale.

The map is sprawling. It's chock-full of content that you can easily play for 100 hours without getting bored. Inserting in a heli, rucking over a hill to a sniper spot, and picking off sentries before moving in to loot a base is satisfying every time. The enemy AI become weirdly omniscient once you get detected, but your AI allies are wallhacking aimbots, so it all balances out. The game also has some things to say about American military and economic intervention in South America... but it doesn't commit to its messages very well. The story and dialogue are better than your average modern military shooter, but this is no ""Spec Ops: The Line.""

Just watch out--weapon stat cards lie, and Ubisoft's store and UPlay integration are terrible. Those can be ignored easily enough.",1708238293,1708238644,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

As usual, an interesting concept for a game but VERY poorly executed by Ubisoft. 
- Repetitive, cookie cutter copy and paste gameplay 
- Small skill tree padded out by ""skills"" like having a few more grenades and doing more damage to vehicles (somehow)
- Most importantly, the worst AI in a ""triple A"" game. Honestly feels like the AI is from a mid 2000's release. Completely takes you out of the immersion. To be frank, a pathetic and laughable AI quality. The devs in charge should be embarrassed.

A worthwhile purchase if you can get it for under $40, otherwise I wouldn't recommend financially supporting a company that thinks this is the quality of game consumers deserve at it's usual price.",1593845399,1708234557,False,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

The camera is so glitchy its unplayable, constantly getting stuck while transitioning to/from aiming. The movement is horrible, often times while walking, sprinting, or crouch-walking the player just stops moving despite still holding the movement keys, or gets stuck in a spot and starts to rapidly spin their body, preventing me from aiming. The gun play is mediocre, worse than far cry, and completely unrealistic. 

The car controls are hands down the worst I've dealt with in a video game, there's no real control over your speed, steering is slippery and unpredictable, and that combined with bumpy roads means sometimes you just fly off the road without any chance to correct it. Planes and helicopters are passable, but still worse than far cry. 

The AI of your squad is irredeemable, they don't follow you, they don't shoot enemies, they can't even get in vehicles youre driving half the time because they get stuck on terrain - not an issue cause the game auto teleports them when you start driving. 

If you want a stealth action game - Play MGSV. If you want an action game with squads - play Far Cry. If you want a squad based game - play anything else. I think I could get better gun play, driving, and squad tactics from a modded Skyrim install. If you buy this game, expect that you wont get more than an hour or two of fun, the game simply isn't well made enough to guarantee any more enjoyable time.",1708192839,1708192839,False,1,0,0.512195110321044922,0,True,False,False

I'd like to give it a middle-of-the-road rating, but a AAA studio should produce better games. I'm disappointed by the game's potential, but its current heavily discounted price tag is tempting.

ghost recon wildlands is certainly not the most amazing game out there and not even what the trailers promissed if you ask me.
but still: busting through fictional bolivia and doing the ubisoft busywork kinda is very fun in this one. maybe not very innovative, mind you, but fun. 
the tom clancy logo should be ignored - although by now noone really thinks that has any meaning anymore, right?
the graphics are stellar (and fairly well optimised) and the sound-design is great as well. since it's a vast open world, assets will repeat themselves a lot, but with the visuals they managed to mix it up enough for it to not be too obvious. sadly the same can't be said about the voice-acting: the overly ""cool"" and ""badass"" lines your character and your companions tend to spout will be rather annoying at some point... 
the AI is... ok i guess, but you will wish for coop-players because while it does the job, the order-wheel with which you command your AI comrades is rather limited and it is just easier and more fun to come up with neat little tactics to engage the enemy when you do it with your friends. the enemies are not stupid but not the cleverest either and in the beginning of the game rather ""blind"". but things will increase in difficulty the more often you run into heavily armed unidad or cartell squads. the unidad is relentless in their pursuit and you may wish for them to be ""blind"" soon enough.
as mentioned before: the world is filled with the usual open world collectables, side missions, and so forth. it's quite enjoyable to tag medical supplies and ammo etc, and gladly the map is visually and thematically varied enough to keep you playing if you enjoy exploring. if you don't care about exploration, the missions will have you see a lot of the map quickly enough. 
missions will be the same old, same old at some point but they tried mixing it up. with this amount of stuff to do only CD project red managed to keep it interessting. but they worked on it for longer and actually did care ;)

gladly the microtransactions and general monetisation is not the worst out there, but the whole pricing for a gold or deluxe edition is crap. buy the standard edition on sale and you will have your moneys worth.

in short: wildlands is in a weird spot right in the middle of ArmA and GTA online :D
you have light tactical elements and a variety if guns and tools to take it seriously and try playing cleverly... but on the other hand you can go in guns blazing with an armored SUV or genereally just dick around and have fun your way.",1519121379,1708028346,False,0,0,0.567941665649414063,0,True,False,False

Even with grinding lots and lots and LOTS of simpler support missions to build skills and rebel support - it is virtually impossible to single play the harder missions against Unidad targets even on the easiest play setting.  And it just becomes so frustrating having to make multiple replay attempts to try and figure a stealthy path into some of the locations.

I actually started playing Ghost Recon Breakpoint first which IS setup to allow single players a reasonable shot at achieving everything.

The open world of this game is huge, explorable but memorable. I personally really like how much work got put into this game, it's really well made. 
Storywise [spoiler] the game starts up pretty nice, the missions are really well designed and it genuinely is fun to play. But you'll probably still be disappointed with the ending.  [/spoiler]
The graphics and performance are a bit ehh, but what do you expect from a game developed by Ubisoft? They are still alright and you get to know the graphics settings very easily. Resolution scaling tends to set itself to x2, which is really annoying because you get no profits from it except lower framerates if that's a profit in your eyes. 

The Multiplayer gets it's own little part, because it's an outstanding multiplayer storygame in my opinion and I'm really surprised that I say that for a game developed by Ubisoft. Heads up, good job people. But even if you don't have friends to play with, in this game you get help from bots that you can communicate with and command, which can be really satisfying. 

The skilltree is a bit overpowered in my opinion. I purposefully didn't buy some things, because it would make the game too easy and boring, so be careful with upgrading the skilltree, if you want to keep the difficulty. And the last thing that annoys me a bit are the loaing times, because they can take disgustingly long, even though I have an NVME SSD built in. Joining servers can also take a long time.

This game is one of few that have, and will continue to capture a sense of nostalgia. We will all look back on Ghost Recon Wildlands the way our parents look back at Pong, Jump Man and Pac Man. 
Why do I feel so strongly this way? Because GRW did something that no other game has captured in such a way during it's life. It was one of the last good games made by a triple A company that was actually decent. You have full control of the outcome of every fight; your methods, tactics, approach angle, detection, CQB or long range, on foot or in a vehicle. Not to mention the customization and ability to play with friends.
Was it perfect? No, absolutely not, fuck DLC and micro-transactions. But it was unique. Goodbye GRW.

- Driving camera always snaps back to center, who ever tested the driving doesn't touch the mouse when driving which i think is insane.
- Shoulder view switches automatic, meaning sometimes you'll be looking at the wall instead of the door.
- a third person shooter without a proper third person shooting mechanic, meaning you'll have to go into iron sights for precision...

I found the game to be highly immersive and good, if not great except perhaps the clunky gameplay which I tend to think is because it's somewhat of an old game coming from 2017 because also games have become a lot smoother since then both in their graphical streaming and gameplay. Of course high graphical fidelity games that run super smooth have existed in the past but just not necessarily in such an extent as - for at least at the time of release of this game - their scope, and I believe that is one of the aspects where its clunkiness comes from, that it's an (Ubisoft) original. By that I don't mean a jab at, but rather to say: it's an original game for its size. Not many other games come to mind that are as big and wide as this one is but a few do come to mind and they usually come from Ubisoft as well.

A few games in recent times that I have played from that era were also kind of clunky in their execution while others certainly were not and beauty of games goes for me a long way back so the pure beauty of Wildlands isn't necessarily in what it shows and how it shows it; it's a ""techno-thriller"" action/adventure game / tactical experience with very true to life game mechanics like the one shot one kill / death mechanic which really goes back to original Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six games which at the time of their release were truly original games with original mechanics and so: ideas behind them; where most of the other games were sort of blends of Fantasy themes and not really ever high-detail mili-tech, and such games are not really replicated a lot in a slew of games since that time. That is one aspect I appreciate about Wildlands, one that I embrace and one that I miss often in others, despite that this sort of theme feels like a niche.

Its quote/unquote -realism- which can be found in many aspects beyond the damage model is what appeals to me really and honestly appeals to me most out of many other game related themes. World or the geography of the game's world would be another example as would be: the story as well. I find that a lot of these aspects are actually bound to this Tom Clancy methodology which also go back to the writer's books as a core foundation establishing a legacy of someone who sold insurance for a living and had nothing to do with neither books nor games but who would later expand into both and have I would say pretty big success with. This game extends and in some regards expands on that legacy.

Realism of Wildlands appears in many factors which makes the game unique in even Ubisoft's catalogue of Tom Clancy's games but I feel are not necessarily alien to the person themself.

Realism also comes back in a few more aspects than gameplay alone as I eluded to before in context of damage mechanics and gameplay in terms of dealing that damage and receiving it and this cat and mouse or predator and prey type of gameplay becomes really the core aspect of the game which to some like myself would be enough to enjoy a gaming experience but Wildlands does much more with that core, aspect of the core loop of the gameplay because it makes the whole experience interconnected together because it blends together with many immersive and personal experiences like: exploration, discovery, understanding, expectation, learning and trial and error of amongst whom the lore it exposes and realism it allows you to experience in an immersive and sometimes very hectic and exciting way stand out to a high degree. Pleasure and enjoyment included!

Things like vehicles, tools and gadgets and weapons enhance this immersion which I think for the developers might have been a bit of a gamble because next to the story's exposition Wildlands is very limited in the way it is scripted and all the action that happens in the game involving the player, the player themselves initiates which is also another aspect of realism that makes the game, compared to other games stand out in essence in a sort of elegant way due to the simplicity these elements that game's realism provide. No explosion will happen unless player choses it to happen. It's like, making a choice. If it's a good choice it will work and if the player has made a bad choice then they start over, which admittedly is not realistic as in the real world so much as it is in a gaming context where the sandbox is the playground and you play it your way, given the circumstance and given the tools and the means, you chose your way, and usually in a split second  i.e. you make the choices and the choices revolve around you who is responsible to evolve the game furtherâ¦ This seems simple and logical until you realize that you've spent playing the game for years nowâ¦

Something to savor?

Clunkiness of the game, makes the game harder than it has to be but also in a sense it makes you rely more on aspects found within it, like one thing that stands out is for instance the power of teammates and rebels who you deploy as in a sort of Guerilla warfare type of way against seemingly an overwhelming enemy but the enemy in the game isn't so much overwhelming as that they are precise. They usually come in small groups and it's an even playfield in terms of damage taking and dealing and in this sense the game makes you as the player attempt a different type of approach that you would, playing other games that involve bulletsponges and more fantastic elements for in here are no healing items (there is life regeneration albeit slow) and there are no power-ups. There is only skill that comes in and persists through experience and knowledge, not necessarily overpoweredness like just a sheer numbers advantage or reliance on heavy metal of various shapes forms and sizes like superior body armor, brute force of war machines like tanks or the brunt of a thousand missiles raining down through artillery and patience of a siege for this skill gathered through what seems to be years of experience comes through knowledge and understanding of your weaknesses and strong points which this game has an interesting way of implementing and leaving it up to you to figure out what to do with and how.

â¦

So by referring to ""game's clunkiness"" I might as well had been referring to my own self because there were countless instances of situations that kept repeating where I would die simply because the aimbot like aim of the opponents and my inability despite having high frames in game of not being able to react in time to have a fair fighting chance where the enemy would simply pawn me and rinse and repeat until I became better. Clunkiness of the game can appear through the fact that the game auto switches between third and first person while aiming, that this leaves you somewhat disoriented and not being able to aim well at the enemy after you auto-lean out of cover to shoot, and the fact that when aiming down the sights the FOV zooms in so reaction times as well as overall vision of what is in front of you become hindered, and truly because of this the importance of correct positioning and angles of view from out of cover that you have to make in order not to die a lot and through maneuvering from place to place in game and so effectively learning to play the game become more apparent. I have managed to become better at it so about towards the end but still I think that if the game had more refined gameplay like for instance is found in Breakpoint, it would have saved me a lot of if noting loading of previous saves because the difficulty is really up there.

On the highest difficulty it's a darn hard game though so better pucker your buttholes, meaning: learn to become patient and learn to play",1688655088,1707031116,True,0,0,0,10,True,False,False

-Unidad are overpowered.
-AI aim is absolutely rediculous even on arcade. The fact that there is a difficulty setting which has little to no effect on each areas own difficulty level is amazing.

Ubisoft has truly showcased the talent of its environment and asset designers, creating a vast and dynamic world that is breathtaking in its detail and diversity. From the lush jungles and towering mountains to the bustling cities and dusty rural settlements, every corner of Ghost Recon Wildlands is a pleasure to explore.

The game's weather and day-night cycle effects add another layer of realism and immersion, with rainstorms, fog, and varying light conditions that affect visibility and gameplay. The sound design is equally impressive, with realistic gunfire, ambient noise, and a stirring soundtrack that heightens the tension and excitement of each mission.

In terms of game design, Ghost Recon Wildlands is a high-quality experience that offers a compelling blend of stealth, shooter, and open-world gameplay. While some may find the gameplay to be repetitive at times, the advanced AI ensures that each encounter is challenging and engaging. Enemy soldiers react intelligently to the player's movements and actions, taking cover, calling for backup, and using tactical maneuvers to flush out the player. This level of detail and challenge makes each mission feel rewarding and satisfying.

The game's story is another highlight, offering a gritty and realistic portrayal of a drug cartel's stranglehold on a fictionalized Bolivia. The player takes on the role of a Ghost, an elite special forces operative tasked with dismantling the cartel's operations and bringing its leaders to justice. The story is well-written and well-acted, with a cast of memorable characters and a strong sense of moral ambiguity.

Overall, Ghost Recon Wildlands is a must-play for fans of stealth, shooter, or open-world games. Its stunning setting, engaging gameplay, and compelling story make it a standout title in the genre, and one that is well worth experiencing for yourself.",1706371198,1706371198,True,11,1,0.639220535755157471,0,True,False,False

That was the case with Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Wildlands. It is still a sandbox full of repetitive side quests but it is not all that terrible. There are few crazy missions that can test your patience but it is all doable, even on harder difficulties.

The graphics are still good to look at, especially at higher resolutions. The only things that feel dated are character models. Performance wise I had no issues, although I had one graphic glitch where I fell through the floor and opened parachute below the map. Sounds and dialogues are good, story is decent. Music/radio is not my cup of tea so I was playing my own tracks in the background. Gameplay is surprisingly smooth and easy to learn.

Back in 2017 when I first played Ghost Recon Wildlands it had a pretty solid multiplayer, but unfortunately it is pretty much dead now. Still if you don't mind playing this solo or have few friends to play 4 man coop, you should have a blast for most of the time. 

Today when I was finishing the game to 100% I felt kinda sad, in a good way, as I will slightly miss the diverse biomes that this open world had to offer. It was simply fun to roam around through forests, dirt roads in the mountains etc. Although you will realise that apart from clone missions and occasional secrets there isn't much in this virtual Bolivia, you can still add some extra immersion of your own - for example by customising your AI companions look depending on the climate of the zone you are clearing. For me it was fun to change weapons and clothing in each new area.
If you still have not tried this game out you should, better now before it gets too old to be enjoyable. Myself, I will consider playing this once again in couple of years.

PS: Ubisoft launcher is annoying as it doesn't remember your credentials, so you need to pop them each time you want to play the game. But it is at least quick as the launcher itself is not bugged. Yup, still Ubisoft as we know it.

Also, do NOT but any DLC for this game. They just suck (tried them in 2017 on PS4).",1706320008,1706320552,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Ghost Recon Wildlands is a great open-world game. From the beginning of the game, it starts your first mission which requires you to traverse many locations to progress through missions that are yet to be discovered either with cars, boats or even a helicopter and planes! Bolivia is a huge map with different enviroments and areas that gives you multiple ways to plan your next move to stealth,infiltrate or recon the enemies whether it be the city, wildlife, outposts or bases. Ghost Recon Wildlands definitely is one WILD experience. Also watch out for any crackheads or guards who are on patrol while driving on the road or you will get in trouble.

I rate this 9/10 for it's wonderful game design.

Unfortunately that's where the good stops. To my mind this is sadly not a good game. Broken stealth that just doesn't work, enemies instantly knowing where you are and nearly always difficult to detect, even when close, this makes game play static one dimensional and boring all the time. 

Very poorly optimised, and that totally kills this game.

Machine guns that easily take down helicopters. No real difference in gun classes and types that give you any real advantage. Confusing and convoluted story. Worst of all linear enemies that offer little resistance.

Open world adds nothing to the experience. You'l just call for a helicopter and go from one mission to another. The missions them selves are are also mediocre. unfun shooting, broken stealth. 
Game has a lot of weapons but because of how the game is, only assault rifles are useful. Unlocking guns is a waste of time unless It's an assault rifle. 
The cherry on top is now I can't play with friends at all because some weird ubisoft NAT system says I'm offline. I can't connect to online services. Nowhere does it even explain what NAT is. I looked for solutions but turns out even ubisoft support is not much help.

After playing it for a few hours I can start to understand the appeal, and go to know certain mechanics in this game that work a lot better than other shooters. In short, this game is good (and even better with friends), but does have a few limitations that may put off potential players.

Ghost Recon Wildlands' (GRW) [b]gameplay[/b] is a lot more engaging that I initially assumed. In my opinion, the gun handling/shooting in this game far exceeds a lot of other shooters (and dare I say, Call of Duty). It's satisfying, it feels real, the impact feels proper, and bullet delivery (especially with snipers) feels like it was done right. Although this is the highlight of the game for me, there are other features that players may buy into. The open world concept is a little overwhelming at first. As the player does a few missions and begins to notice how the game is structured, completing missions and acquiring new abilities becomes a little easier. The user interface and menus try their best to break down what the player can or should do next. At first the game's missions may seem a little ""easy"" compared to the initial Ghost Recon I played back on the Xbox. As the game progresses, some of the missions begin to get difficult objectives which challenge the player. If you are playing this game yourself the AI soldiers actually provide a decent amount of support. Though, I don't understand how sometimes friendly soldiers can move in front of the enemy, even if it is behind a buildings shadow midday. There are a few vehicles to choose from in the game from cars, trucks, mounted trucks, helicopters, and planes.

The [b]visuals and graphics[/b] are pretty good for a game of its era. Although the landscape looks stunning (and shaders seem to be really well done to reflect its beauty) the minor animations seem to be there. NPCs are interacting with one another (to some degree), enemies are patrolling and sometimes engage with their environment. Even though this is a large map game it can make the player feel like they're right there in the village, simply looking around and exploring (or sneaking and hiding). The [b]sounds and music[/b] are satisfactory. The radio is a little in what in can play, but Spanish music can be heard blaring while rolling on four wheels. There is interaction between the soldiers (and sometimes NPCs). The voice acting itself is suitable to a triple A game (especially coming from an Early Access game). Both domains were done well (especially the visuals), but I feel the sounds department could've done a little more to immerse the player.

Overall, this is a pretty good game given certain circumstances. Playing solo can be fun for about ten hours before some missions can seem extremely difficult without the support of another player, and sometimes boring without friends to play with. I'm happy I purchased it on sale - and would recommend the same to the reader! The driving is a little wonky/blocky and other little small movements throughout the game share the same value.

It's still one of the best Ubisoft titles in the last few years though, and the way it mixes tactical, hardcore gameplay with Far Cry-like arcade gameplay makes it probably one of the most unique games in Ubisoft's catalogue. You know when people had this discussion on Far Cry not being an immersive sim? The Ubisoft game that probably has the most Immersive sim elements is Wildlands. And getting such a package at SUCH A SCALE + co-op is a pretty good choice.

I'll warn you that it's still an Ubisoft game though. Don't expect anything truly amazing and you'll sure enjoy this. Even the story feels like it had some care put into it. Gonna warn the game can be a bit stereotyped in terms of south american portrayal and that you can unironically ask for airstrikes in the middle of a populated town. It might be offensive to some, but I took it as unintentional comedy. Like, it's fun as fuck to see this game trying to be morally justifiable, politically correct... and then do shit like this.

Story, nothing special, just switching from the war on terror to the war on drugs.

Gameplay, brilliant, it has a lot in common to MGS 5 oddly enough, but built on top of a shooter game first and foremost. It's fun, engaging, gets you thinking if you want to be an actual ghost and do some sneaky stealthy stuff.

Graphics wise, the game looks good, very well optimised, works on some lower end hardware.

Sound design is good, guns are punchy the voice acting is decent.

I haven't sampled any other game modes for this game at the time of this review, the PVP extraction element mainly, but if there is one thing that I find mandatory is to play this game in co op, it enhanced the experience for me, especially after starting alone.

The only gripe I have regarding this game is, of course, the loot boxes and the whole micro transactions ecosystem on top of the 50$ retail.

Overall this is a good game that offers a great co op experience. If you see it on sale strong arm your mates into buying it so at least they can say that the game was good while they beat you up. Have fun!",1705781109,1705832718,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This is a true Open World game -- if you wanted to you could walk one side of the enormous map to the other without any unrealistic barriers.  You'll find that cliffs will block your path now and then, but just walk around or fly over them.

The story-line is great and very detailed with many many tidbits of lore and background history scattered around to pick up.  I played this on the easiest difficulty and it was still a decent challenge - especially the incredible final mission against the main bad guy.

It is easy to play this whole game without the online features and without purchasing any extra guns from the store for real money.  The in-game guns are quite good and there are many to be found around the map.

This game is absolutely HUGE in terms of map area.  And it's a beautiful game even on low graphics settings.  If you have a powerful PC then you're in for a treat.

Despite the plot, this story portrays Bolivia and its history in a positive light, for the most part.

It gets pretty dark in places though, so if you're of a weak disposition, be ready for some grim themes.

I once thought Watch Dog 1's driving system is the worst one ever but now I take that back. Ubi truly doesn't have any programmer that knows how to design driving system.

Mission has no saving-loading system at all. Failed a mission in the middle? Good luck on 
starting all over from the very beginning.

Tons of bug as usual. No fking quality control. Typically Ubi-soup. Imagine failing a mission due to a bug or bad mission design (e.g. the dude you wanted to capture alive got killed by something random or your ret2ard AI teammate; or your vehicle got stuck somewhere then the timer runs out).

I bought the game on sale for less than Â£10, and honestly it wasn't a bad deal for the first 7 hours I had fun going around as a sneaky sniper or balls to the wall gunman. However it immediately becomes stale, its a standard ubisoft affair of go to point a and do 1 of 10 things and then you can actually play the missions. The guns and enemies are lacking in so many departments 

The guns are weak and lacking any punchy sound effects to accompany the paper mache bullets you fire. Honestly a confetti noise would be a welcome addition. Weapon progression is fucking wack as well, the fucking AK-47 is locked inside a 5 skull difficult region (the most popular weapon with rebellion, cartels, fucking anything is locked in a 5 skull difficult region). Fucking wacko.

The enemies range from brain-dead where they walk towards where their comrade just died like a zombie or spam out reinforcements because they can't see you, this is probably my biggest gripe. I hate when I kill everyone, blow up their radar and still reinforcements are on the way. I guess the cult of santa muerte is fucking transcending death. 

The exception to this however is Unidad, fucking unidad. These motherfuckers don't only have a reinforcement mechanic they have a get spotted well get fucked mechanic, as each unidad member you kill while engaged will increase the ""Unidad Patrols"" this actually means a fucking reinforcement that if you kill it, it will immediately spawn a brand new reinforcement and that means it's sticking around for longer, making escaping harder and most likely engaging you again and again and again... 

Apart from the standard ubisoft grind with resources the upgrades suffer from being absolutely useless to cool but mediocre. An example would be 8% rebel damage versus an exploding drone. I don't even have to explain the difference between the power with these two but I will say I do love me an explosive drone. 

Overall if you like a game where you can listen to a podcast and don't mind grinding out a bunch of menial tasks that have no engagement and will tire and bore quickly, I'd recommend this on a similar sale. Otherwise please put your money elsewhere, seriously it's just not worth it. 

Anyway I've got another ending to unlock.

So I got the ending, honestly it's marginally more satisfying and not much harder to get. I guess it's worth it at the very least to see the other buchons taken down. 

I also tried the multiplayer out, it was fun honestly similar to farcry but way easier to die, solid 7/10 on that end.

It's the biggest map ever designed when it launched and you'll find many vistas there: forests, swamps, snowy mountains and salt plains. 

But like most open world games it can get quite repetitive and you'd find yourself bored to death sometimes. Definitely better playing with friends on cooperative mode.

There's a competitive multiplayer. I personally don`t like and didn`t play much.

This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my daughter, as she is always out with her friends or just watching overweight men eating large amounts of food and crying on YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside her. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my daughter for help and she hosted a game for me to join.

If you have a high end device capable of running this game on ultra, it is incredibly detailed for a game of its time. The story is amazing, combat is amazing, completing objectives completely undetected whilst taking out cartel members from hundreds of metres away(amazing). The gun mechanics are incredible, for a Tom Clancy's game it is much closer to realistic in terms of bullet spray/drop, recoil. I haven't had more fun in any game involving stealth and espionage. The amazing range of clothing, and weaponry along with an amazing selection of paint presets from a military POV(as in there aren't any bright colours except for some specific clothing items). Other than vehicle spawning being a bit funky sometimes(mainly with planes), there isn't anything bad I have to say about this game. My experiences have always been unique and engaging and there isn't one way you can go about a mission. Even if you are required to complete a mission completely undetected, you can choose to sneak in past enemies, or sneak in whilst strategically assassinating cartel members like you do it for a living.

Pros - graphics, stealth, gun customization, fun coop game, good sound design, good gunplay

Cons - repetitive mission structure, hate the unidad patrol system, buggy, ubisoft launcher, connection issues, terrible voice acting, (not really a con but the story is kind of mid)

If this game was made by people who were actually passionate this could be an amazing game instead ubisoft made it so there's constant technical issues with this game. But honestly if you're willing to overlook this game you can have a blast with friends whether it be laughing your a.ss off after blowing up a teammate in a helicopter or doing other goofy stuff or by playing serious and tactically by working together to sync shots to take out enemies without alerting anyone (most satisfyingly thing ever). However in good consciousness i can't really recommend the game there's way too many issues. 

Honestly its a fun game and for Â£8 i had 30 hours of fun but i could only really recommend this if you're a gun nerd and like stealth its pretty much far cry but if it was tactical and chock full of bugs.

The plot surrounds a team of special operatives that go by the name Ghosts who can either be your AI companions or co-op friends. The Ghost's objective is to take down El Sueno and his cartel. 

The gameplay revolves around going to different provinces in real life Bolivia to liberate them with the help of the Rebels in the area who are fighting against the Cartel State alongside you. 

There are brilliantly crafted, fully animated cut-scenes that are fully optional (but totally worth it) and the game leaves a lot of freedom of how easy or hard, and immersive or arcade-y the player wants it to be. Settings such as removing crosshairs, more realistic AI, limited HUD, etc. can allow for the player to decide if they want something more akin to traditional Ubisoft shooters, or opt for a more realistic, tactical experience. 

The progression in the game is very satisfying and doing side content is incentivized with cosmetics, guns, attachments, and rebel assistance through drops and back up; all are fun and get rewarding content, but almost none are necessary to completing the game. 

I spent ~67 hours in game at the time of writing this review but I immediately moved on to the sequel after this, and will probably come back to Wildlands at some point, I can easily see myself putting 200+ hours into this game before I'm done with it.",1703805664,1703805664,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Bots are more or less useless except sync shot. They will walk between enemy and nobody gives a shit about them but also they wont give a shit about enemy. Can't bring myself to kill other half of cartel to get the other ending.

Gameplay wise gunplay is average, skills are useless, driving is arcadish and five lines repeated by bots are driving me crazy. Also you fly helicopter and not drive it.

If you are looking for mindless game, where you go from place to place and shoot dudes with cliche story this one is for you. Could be more fun with friends but then again Ubisoft has shit servers.

Great graphics and PC optimization despite no quicksave, yes I have my own shadow. -eat your heart out Corvo- A day and night cycle as well as weather effects sublty change the missions adding some variety in this somewhat dull world to travel. Super small uninteresting population and a non diverse set of misions, trees, people, plants, and animals(?). Ammo is practically everywhere. Oh, the dude can't jump and aparently didn't bring a rope or carribeaners to the mountainous region. And why cant the AI drive me to my destination and let me sit shotgun? 

 Good weaponry although you don't get to keep or unlock confiscated weapons as they revert to your selected weapon after fast travel. No rocket launcher? Where are theese S.A.M.s coming from? Can't use mortar emplacements. Mini gun on chopter weak against vehicles. Did I mention ammo is everywhere.

 In the end I really wish I could jump between all of my teammates in order to set up some cool raids like in the Original Ghost Recon. Also miss the character building of my crew, leveling them all up, having to choose who to give the points to at the end of a mission and whether or not to restart the grueling mission or continue on, if, god forbid, one of my longtime characters had perished. 

 Great graphics and world but hollow gameplay elements eventually lead me to my decision that you should only buy this game if it's on sale.

I appreciate the developers responding but I tried their fixes but nothing. To add to the issues, I recently learned that you can't even play offline as you need to be connected to Ubisoft servers to even get it working. I know I said I bought it primarily to play Multiplayer but this is still a big no no. Also, the whole deleting games and DLC thing. Just wrong. All of it. I know one thing Ubisoft, you have lost another fan. Good job!

[h2] Original Review [/h2]
Wildlands is a decent game, but I primarily bought this mainly to play multiplayer, not singleplayer. I may be late to the party but I expect AAA game servers to have long support times. In Wildlands case, it seems not. Multiplayer is a hit and miss. Some days you may be able to play with friends, some days not. It all depends on unspecified factors that even Ubisoft claims not to know.

Also, I do not know if the claims are true so take what I am about to say with a grain of salt. Apparently people who have submitted support tickets have been told by Ubisoft to go play their latest Ghost recon game, instead of, you know. Fixing or suggesting a fix to Wildlands issues. Pretty scummy and downright wrong if true.

So to the above I say: Stay away from this game until a fix appears, which lets face it. It most likely will not happen. It is Ubisoft after all.",1661386903,1703252429,False,1,0,0.51530611515045166,0,True,False,False

+ One-shot kills
+ sensible weapon customization mechanics
+ missing ""numbers game"" (i.e. you need to wear down the enemey with ridiculous amounts of hits... (even pistol one-shot kills are possible on head-shots).
- loot-boxes (mostly for cosmetic stuff, but also for additional weapons and vehicles, esp. the vehicles change abilities in game, as you can not call in an armed helicopter as transport vehicle until you find it in a loot box)
- (esp in tier mode) unrealistic enemy behaviour. e.g. snipers see you within seconds when you enter their viewcone and cross the imaginary view area boundary, sometimes also outside of their viewcone (i.e. when stealth approaching from behind)
- impossible spawning behaviour (i.e. clearing and barring and area with mines after, but enemies spawn between the barrier and you after moving forward; enemies spawning in impossible locations that have been cleard and are basically dead-ends. This is esp. irksome as the game in it's setup (and the original Tom Clancys brand legacy (yes, which has been dilluted by the more recent entries since the UbiSoft era, i know) would be the perfect open world stealth game without this problem, take your time stealth clearing an area and carefully approaching an objective, taking out enemies that go clear of their buddies , only to be killed by reinforcments spawned in between your AI buddies or something.
- (esp in tier mode) sometimes impossibly fast detection by enemies (e.g. running around a corner, but immediately seing you hunkered down behind cover, only very partially visible or behind shrubberies, insta kill while the enemy is running.
- As soon as one enemy spots you, ALL enemies know where you are, even if you kill that enemy half a second later and he never would have had a chance to tell anyone (yes, I'm looking at you, stealth missions, short burst to the head of enemy 1, short burst to the head of enemy 2, but enemy 3 spots you a splitsecond before burst to his head. Yeah, you are done, mission restart.)
- there are some stealth missions, where you have a timer running, but are not allowed to kill enemies initially.  The randomly spawned enemies make this unnecessarily hard.

+/- don't play alone, best played with four additional actual human players (that you know, don't play public games). In Solo play your AI can revive you once (2 or 3 times with upgrade). In MP you can infitnitely heal and the mission is not completely restarted when someone dies, they get respawned somewhat close and have to reapproach. Which esp on longer missions with an attempted stealth approach is terribly annoying.

So yeah, It was some fun, but it also was very annoying (esp when playing solo).",1702903199,1702903958,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

One of my favourite games, 9.5/10. Play through the game at your own pace, some of the best fun is learning to build effective and fun gear sets, and learning how to explore and traverse the map is another great part of learning the game. However, there is one thing you should do after learning how the game works and what play-style you enjoyâ¦ [b] Complete Remanzo EARLY[/b], as sometimes an objective won't spawn, soft-locking the story, and requiring restarting with a new save until it spawns. There can be some jank, but it's usually not an issue, and some reviews really oversell how glitchy the game can be. Ubisoft and U-play sucks. Easy Anti-Cheat can suck, make sure it's not being registered as malware by your security program of choice. There are micro-transactions, but they're not necessary, and can be circumvented through daily challenges and ghost mode (use the pause menu, in-game menu, or hot-key, k, to see them).

Sniping and stealth are extremely satisfying. This is a [strike] tactical [/strike] [b] tacti-cool [/b] game, so learning how you position yourself for your goal, how you approach your goal, when to adapt, use of the resources you have (drone, rebels, and vehicles), how the game reacts to your actions, and [u] looking as badass as possible [/u] are essential. Driving is fun, SAM launchers are death, flying is fast, helicopters with weapons are easy mode, and [b] NEVER [/b] use bikes in perma-death mode.

[b] When Going Loud [/b]

Rate of fire, cover, and range are king (M4 + GL supremacy) in gunfights. Some weapon attachments are pointless, while others are nearly required to stay alive on higher difficulties. More bullets (bigger magazine / higher rate of fire) = more dead enemies and less bullets that could kill you. Anti-material/heavier weapons melt anything they shoot or spray at. Although, the most badass approach is always best, and the best looking gun always wins the gunfight.

This game has very firmly convinced me that the meta for having fun in the current year is Coop games with a dash of jenk.

It's still a Ubisoft title from 2017. Physics are buggy, menus are bad, you have to install Uplay to even get going and then deal with all that chicanery, and It takes a solid 5+ minutes to figure out how to party up nowadays.

But

After you deal with all that you actually have a fun, chill, and generally customizable experience that can be as serious or goofy as you please. Wanna take it waaaaaaaay too serious for what it is? Sure: crank up the difficulty, turn on to Tiers mode, and have at it. A stealthy, no-hud experience that will challenge your abilities and your sanity because (insert ubisoft bug here).
Wanna get a little silly? A little Goofy even? Play tactical barbie dolls for half an hour so you look like a thrift store massacre and play dress up to LARP as different countries or aesthetics (my favorites are Rhodesian SAF, British SAS, Crayon-Eaters, and Ted Kaczynski fan club.)

Stroll through Bolivia and just do CIA type jazz. Liberate the oil, communicate with rebel forces and provide them with better munitions, politely explain to journalists why they shouldn't have made that publication, and leave no witnesses (but it caps you out around 3 with a two ish minute cooldown so you're fine).

If you try to play this game alone you're missing out, big time. Even just getting one extra player (but don't play with randos) makes it exponentially more fun.

Oh, also the PvP is basically dead. Only way you'll get a game is custom matches

Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Wildlands is a shining example of what a good shooter game is about. The two biggest downsides of buying this title through steam is 1. Still having to use the Ubi Launcher... which sucks, but you get cool rewards through Ubi connect and 2. The AI can be very weird and some world items arent entirely accurate (ie. you cannot shoot through spaces in bridge railings as its a wall asset) However, this game, being released almost 7 years ago now, I cannot fault it that much.

This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you were supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he helped me. Loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died.

All you do is drive across the big boring ass map doing missions, picking up items, marking things and occasionally having a somewhat decent gunfight with enemies. The guns sound weak and the movement and aim feels clunky. I can't describe it very well but I get almost this feeling of motion sickness while playing because of how clunky it feels.

Strangely enough this game has some rather decent response mechanics with really satisfying hit effects for when you damage enemies and kill them. Plus there are bullet wounds, blood splatters on walls and even blood pools. But get this, dead bodies will despawn almost the moment you turn around if you walk more than 10 or so meters away from them. So there is virtually no aftermath after gunfights. I assume this is because Ubisoft was too lazy to implement a body pick up mechanic, you know that thing they had all the way back in fucking 2002 with Splinter Cell. The enemy AI are BRAINDEAD and you can easily take down an entire outpost without them even noticing you were there by just clicking on their heads with silenced weapons and snipers you get at the START of the game (On the hardest difficulty by the way). 

All this in tandem with the mediocre gunplay, long driving segments that only YOU can do because the AI teammates cannot drive and squad mechanics leads this game feeling so underbaked and unpolished. It's a shame really because conceptually it does not sound that bad but this is Ubisoft open world games we're talking about here. At the very least customization is halfway decent and you can make your character look really sick. I wouldn't say it isn't worth your money because you can get it for quite cheap. The issue is that this game simply isn't worth your time. Maybe you've got nothing else going on and don't really care about any sort of immersion or engaging mechanics and just want a stealth-power fantasy then maybe it ain't half bad. 

This game is not terrible, but its not good. It's boring and mediocre which IMO is far worse than being plain bad.",1700902861,1700903127,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I was pretty excited about playing Wildlands as well, especially that I was going to finish it with my friend in co-op - and so we did.
At first it was fun. We were trying to go full stealth mode, but often failed miserably. Soon we started to gain more resources and invested them in completely different play styles that complete each other, so we became more effective and started to progress faster. Clearing out camps and military bases, finding new equipment and hunting for convoys was all fun...for maybe 20 hours. Then the repetitive gameplay loop became a chore and we started to mindlessly fly from place to place, trying to finish the main storyline as fast as possible... and even then, it took as over 50 hours to complete (without DLCs).
But the pain started after reaching Tier One (which can be enabled or disabled at will). When it is disabled the enemies are half-blind, take some time to realize that you're around, even if you stand right next to them, and taking into account how many bad guys you fight, it is fine, even if a bit stupid. But then, after level 30 and activating Tier One mode, you will discover how botched the AI really is in this game, how primitive and lazy the programming is. After gaining a few levels, the enemies turn into cyborgs. 
Discovering you not only takes much less time, but the distance us much greater. Often the enemies discovered us through solid objects.
Furthermore they become tanky as hell, being able to survive a sniper shot in their chests (even when not armoured), but the worst part is, they always know where you are and act like they are connected by some kind of hive-mind, but the worst part is that they never miss their shots and as soon as you're in their unobstructed line of sight, they'll mow you down. Their aim works like an aimbot and jump right away from player to player. Add to that the unending of Unidad and stupid, unfair design of some tasks and you get nothing but frustration - either that or a feeling that you're losing progress and miss out on further character development by disabling Tier One.",1700697891,1700697891,False,1,0,0.513936102390289307,0,True,False,False

Travel beautiful Bolivia in a tractor, in the APC or in the helicopter and shoot the bad guys one by one.

The cons? All that freedom means you can get quite easily into a situation, when you have just too much of everything going on at the same time.
There are some issues with the persistency of the world, some bases you can clean again and again. And again :)

Released in 2017 by Ubisoft, this tactical shooter introduces a vast open-world setting, allowing players to immerse themselves in a gripping narrative while employing strategic gameplay.

The game's standout feature is its expansive open-world environment. Set in a stunningly detailed and diverse rendition of Bolivia, players are given the freedom to explore landscapes ranging from dense jungles to arid deserts. The sheer scale of the map provides an immersive playground for tactical operations, fostering a sense of realism and unpredictability in every mission.

In Ghost Recon Wildlands, players assume the role of an elite Ghost operative tasked with dismantling a powerful drug cartel. The narrative unfolds through a series of interconnected missions, each contributing to the overarching goal of destabilizing the cartel's operations. While the story may not break new ground, it serves as a compelling backdrop for the intense and strategic firefights that define the Ghost Recon experience.

The game's tactical gameplay mechanics shine in both single-player and cooperative modes. Players can choose to tackle missions solo with AI-controlled teammates or enlist the help of up to three friends for a cooperative multiplayer experience. The emphasis on careful planning, reconnaissance, and synchronized execution adds depth to the gameplay, rewarding those who approach missions with a thoughtful and strategic mindset.

Ghost Recon Wildlands boasts an impressive array of weaponry and equipment, allowing players to customize their loadouts to suit different playstyles. The game's skill tree system further enhances personalization, offering a sense of progression as players unlock new abilities and improve their Ghost's capabilities. This level of customization encourages experimentation, ensuring that no two players will approach missions in exactly the same way.

The visuals in Ghost Recon Wildlands are nothing short of breathtaking. The attention to detail in the game's environments, character models, and dynamic weather effects contributes to a visually stunning and immersive experience. From the sun-drenched landscapes to the tense night operations, the game's graphics play a pivotal role in conveying the atmosphere and tension of the covert operations.

While Ghost Recon Wildlands received praise for its engaging gameplay and expansive world, some critics noted occasional technical hiccups and repetitive mission structures. The AI, while generally competent, could at times exhibit inconsistencies in behavior. However, the game's post-launch support and updates addressed many of these issues, reflecting Ubisoft's commitment to refining and improving the player experience.

In conclusion, Ghost Recon Wildlands successfully marries the thrill of tactical military operations with the freedom of an open-world setting. Its vast landscapes, strategic depth, and cooperative gameplay make it a standout entry in the Ghost Recon series. Whether playing solo or with friends, Ghost Recon Wildlands offers an intense and rewarding experience for fans of tactical shooters and those seeking an immersive open-world adventure.

But now that one is available on Nexus, the game is definitely worth a play through.  Especially if you can get it for an 80% off sale!

Edit: Flying is terrible in this game.  I don't expect a MS Flight Sim, or even an Ace Combat, but this flying is worse than even the Far Cry's-- which until now I thought would be impossible--but the planes in Wildlands are a new UX low.  At least add an altimeter to the plane.  it couldn't be that hard as you already have it in the helicopter.

Edit2:   The main story line is LOADED with timers.  So your strategy goes out the window for a headlong rush to try to beat the stopwatch on the screen.  And to make it worse you never know when a timer will pop up, so you can't really perpare.  This artificial and lazy technique to increase difficulty is, IMO, extremely anti-immersive and extremely poor UX.   I won't be finishing the game and am just glad I got it for 80% off.

Note to developers:   Take a hint from the most popular open world game ever, Fallout.  There is NO TIMERS in the entire game, and the user can choose first or third person.

Mundo abierto, Muchas armas y personalizaciÃ³n, un pequeÃ±o sistema de Ã¡rbol de habilidades, vehÃ­culos, variedad de entornos y libertad a la hora de hacer las misiones.

Desgraciadamente se encuentra plagado de bugs y glitches que van desde los inofensivos, pasan por los graciosos y finalmente los que crashean el juego. 

La historia es predecible si ya eras fan de otros juegos de Tom Clancy. Sin embargo fue bastante entretenido y me mantuvo lo suficiente para completar jefes y misiones secundarias. Tal vez la parte mas triste de este juego es que haya sido diseÃ±ado con una orientaciÃ³n enferma a microtransacciones, con objetos que solo se pueden obtener pagando por ellos.

Finalmente debo decir que los DLCs son algo agridulce. Por una parte, Narco Road fue pÃ©simo para mi. Fallen Ghosts fue mucho mejor, pero ambos son historias ""independientes"" que tienen progresion, armas, habilidades y todo en paralelo.

Si tu ya terminaste alguno, debes comenzar el otro desde cero, con otras armas y vehÃ­culos, sin relaciÃ³n o conexiÃ³n directa con tu personaje original. 

Un juego que definitivamente debes comprar en oferta si es que estÃ¡s interesado. Sin embargo veo el potencial que tiene en multi-jugador y tiene un grandÃ­simo valor de re-jugabilidad.

Don't get me wrong, this is still an absolute banger, but it didn't go without it's bumps in the road. Upon release, many glitches were prominent, which definitely stabbed the game's performance early on where it's most critical. But as time goes on, things got fixed, and people moved on to the next thing as the game got its repairs. This left it to not really blow up as much as what could be expected. I mean you look at the game firsthand and you hear glitches and Ubisoft, already a no-go, right?

What the game lacks in some functionality it makes up for in visual beauty. Yeah, you do need a decent rig to run it smoothly, but it's absolutely worth it. It still stuns me now, and I've tried RTX Minecraft. The lush forests, barren saltflats, and changing weather really bring this game to life.
There's LOTS, and I mean LOTS of information in the game about Bolivia itself which I find to be extremely appealing to have. Many games will take place in like France or something and not give you ANY information about the culture. That doesn't slide here. In the game, you're an operative in a country that isn't immediately in the mainstream media, so if you aren't familiar, the game gives you trivia. Post-war Germans living in the country, Death Road, JesÃºs Malverde, and more stories are able to be found. There are also PLENTY of files and dialogue on the main game story as well in case that's what you want to pay attention to, but none of said files and trivia are required to continue on. It's a respectful thing to do, and it shows the developers really went out of their way to understand Bolivian culture; it shows how much they really cared about the game, so it's nice to see.

The stealth in this game is fairly good, def could be better but pretty good. The game lacks in being able to drag bodies which is a pretty big letdown, but usually the AI is pretty easy anyways. The easiness was actually a complaint early on for the game, so Ubisoft added Extreme mode and Ghost Mode. Extreme mode meaning your body would seize if you breathed too much, and Ghost Mode meaning basically 2 shots without a revive and you gotta start over. All the way over. Like, back to the part where you're landing in the country, over. Talk about being careful. Still, can't drag bodies which is annoying and I really wish being able to hide in bushes was a bit more functional than it is as of writing, but the enemy on the right difficulty can still be scary at times which makes it all the more satisfying to do things right. When playing with friends, I like to have my friends infiltrate compounds while I post up as a sniper correcting any mistakes they make from 400+ meters away.

It would be a crime to not talk about the guns in a gun game. The guns are great in their models and customization. You can paint your guns solid colors, official camos, funny camos, whatever suits you. Then you can modify it to just how you like. Every Buchon has a custom gun you unlock too that reflects their personality. For example, one guy you capture builds submarines, so naturally his unlock is a gun made from sub parts. The sniper rifles were done really well in my opinion because every rifle has quite a different bullet drop, and since the landscape is huge, you have to pay attention to it a lot. I found myself testing different scopes with different rifles to see which was best, and started remembering where the range was on each set. It's very satisfying to get it right and pull off a 500+ meter shot.

The customization on the clothes as well is really good. The game gives you hundreds of options if you want to go with tactical clothes or more civilian-style like Nomad's base character. Of course, there's like 70 something different colors you can do for basically half or more of those clothing options too. When you're done with that, you can choose what patches you want to do on your backpack, baseball cap, shoulder-armor, etc. ""Made in the 757"" is a personal fav.

I'm a motorhead, so obviously I want the driving mechanics to be good. This game did okaaaay with that, but honestly better quite a few other games out there. Steering is pretty annoying, but the transmission mechanic is really good. You can hear the RPM climbing and, if you're smart, tap the throttle before it shifts to get a premature gearshift in the car. I'm glad they paid attention to that. What didn't go so well was the flying mechanics. The flying, like driving, is okaaaay, at least in classic mode. If you want to hit something in classic mode with weapons, forget it. It's basically impossible. Ubisoft tried to fix this issue with new flying mechanics but they found a way to realllllly fumble it. It's REALLY bad. Driving = eh, not bad | flying = pretty trash depending on what you're doing.

People in this review section have been talking about connection issues. While I haven't had to wait 20 minutes (yet) to go in-game, I do have a ""connection error"" every time I try to the load the game up. Not game-breaking, but quite a nuisance. I got a feeling this is just something Ubisoft did to mess things up like usual, so I can't be mad at the game for it,

My final verdict: 8.02/10, just barely got the 8.
The culture attention and visuals are fantastic. Gunplay, character/weapon customization and difficulty are great. The driving, stealth, and story is pretty good. The flying and the networking is meh. The fact that this is a Ubisoft game, meaning lootboxes and network issues, is bad. Just bad.

These other people are right for saying this game is better with friends, because without them it becomes a bit of a grind. Is it worth the $50? Ehh, with friends, for the most part, but definitely try to snag a sale first. I've made some good memories with this game, and I've played through GR: Breakpoint after this too (that game is basically just a sequel btw). That game had a lot of stuff I wanted in this game, but if I had the tough choice to either do one or the other,

If during a particularly challenging point in the game you find yourself having to take repeated attempts, you very well may start at a completely random point that is in no way connected to what you were doing.

Multiple times, the game decided to restart me in the middle of the freaking desert at some rebel base that had absolutely nothing to do with the mission I was trying to complete. A game being challenging is fine and if I truly enjoy the game, I typically like it to be a bit challenging but a game that is challenging because it doesn't function correctly is challenging for the wrong reasons.

The game itself is... ok I guess, but some things ar juste downright frustrating. For example, the vehicles are just horrible to drive : they turn slowly, skid as soon as you touch A or D, and have not any resistance (you jump in the vehicle and if it's next to an object it will take quite a bit of damage.
Next, shooting. Don't even bother trying to understand how it works : between leaves that stops sniper bullets and invisble walls (without mentionning wind of hurricane level), just accept your fate and the 50 ennemies comming from nowhere.

I know I'm salty, but I just can't stand gambling games, and this one feels really close to one. And since my time is up I can't reimburse the game so...",1699712823,1699712823,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

For every fun moment and interesting game-play element there are 4-5 different things that just completely suck the joy from this game.
There are still technical issues this long after release, and the AI (both teammates and enemies) is a complete disappointment.
The breaking of the camels back was ghost mode which is a one-life-game-mode. Permadeath and immediate cloud save of your failed attempt...

In any other game this would be a cool challenge. Except this game which has no predictability, consistency or logical reasoning for a player to consistently avoid death.

I'll even admit to keeping backups of my saves for this mode, to only have the entirety of it being completely fucked up by Ubisoft and their decision to save anytime you are downed (you can get revived by your teammates which is not a death scenario) EXCEPT the AI was too stupid and inconsistent to actually assist the player.

This is the hallmark of Ubisoft games. Its a million great ideas, decent depth and, good concepts bogged down by terrible execution, stupid decision making, and development pitfalls that creates a dog water, piece of crap title.

I wish I could regain the amount of time spent on this dog-water but sadly that's impossible. 

Uninstalling this turd is equivalent to ending a toxic relationship. The immediate relief and freedom is amazing. 

Better yet, never purchase this game at all and you'll save yourself from this trash.

All the ""good"" moments are not worth the garbage this game hands you in droves.

-UPDATE:
The final mission to cap off the entire game is an underwhelming, half brained, complete nonsense turd.
Its not difficult in the challenge, requiring smart play and good ""tactics"" instead its just throw every enemy at the player, every second, without pause and put them on a time limit to complete a ""GET TO THIS POINT"" objective.

Ubisoft deserves every ounce of hate they receive. Abysmal. I hope some company, somewhere rips the Tom Clancy rights out of the screaming baby hands of the Ubisoft CEO... the IP deserves better.",1697871195,1699178900,False,4,0,0.590498149394989014,0,True,False,False

The first is you must be online with the Ghost Recon servers to play the game.  If your internet goes down or Ghost Recon's servers go down, you are out of luck.  It's just the games way of letting you know that you don't own it.  Then, it is utterly ridiculous is that everything on your weapon from sights, to magazine capacity, are upgrades you have to find on the battlefield.  This means for the first while you are stuck with Vietnam Era 20 round magazines for your rifle, and you have the lamest kit that only let's you carry 5 magazines.  These two things are so ignorant that I just cannot recommend this game, which is too bad because I was really looking forward to this when it came out.

I was hoping this would be a strategic game with tactical battles but there is no strategy at all.  None of the targets you pick have any effect on the battlefield.  Outposts are repopulated within minutes of you defeating them.  It is only a check the box exercise.  Missions you fail are immediately reset so you can do it over again.  Some, way back at the beginning that makes the tactical part of the game a complete drudgery.  The enemy never comes looking for you.  There are no hunter killer teams.  If you are spotted the enemy will call for help but help gets there WAY too quickly confirming that enemies endlessly spawn just out of range.

So much of the game is scripted and though parts are fun it just reminds me the game is playing me.  Failed missions have no impact on the game because they just reset.",1689488860,1698384295,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Only downside is Ubisoft's @$#@!!$ front end and anti cheat joke that some how triggers every time I end the game.  Even though the game is playable offline it fails to detect a connection and launch the game every time initially, even though I have blazing fast cable webs.
But yes the game is the bomb; it is a truly non-linear, open world fps with options and flexibility in play style, loads of vehicles and weapons.  Another note on the con side, good luck finding the unlock for the weapon you want.  And despite unlocking a dozen or so accessories that are supposed to fit the weapon style you are using - they never show up as an option.  As an example you may unlock a slick scope labeled as an option sniper rifles, and think Sweet!  I can use this on my sniper rifle of choice!  But no, you are SOOL until you happen to unlock the ONE sniper rifle that scope is slotted for.  So yes, some random frustrations like every other game, and a dog sh!t ubisoft front end and laughably bugged anti-cheat detection - but the game is a gem and highly worth the dough to run all over the place whacking those bad guys.",1698273479,1698273479,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Don't get me wrong, it has stealth shooter sections, and those are by far the best parts of the game, but that is fundamentally not how the developers seem to intend for you to play.

There are simply too many story missions where you try to go in with stealth, and the game forcefully causes you to be detected. This leads to having to shoot everything that moves, while every enemy taking potshots at you from behind cover.

In mission when you die, you have to redo the first bit of the mission, then fly a helicopter in a straight line for 5 to get back to the part you died at. I'm not sure if travelling long distances is supposed to build suspense, but it doesn't, it causes me to literally watch movies while holding a key down on my keyboard.

Combined with Unidad spawning infinite enemies, like GTA, except in GTA it is punishment for killing random civilians, where in Wildlands it is punishment for standing on the side of the road.

Not to mention, there are way too many escort and extraction missions.

All in all it is impossible for me to recommend this game. Go play Rainbow Six Vegas 2 if you want a good shoot-em-up game. If you like stealth, try Hitman. I would recommend Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter 2, but good luck getting that game to run on a modern PC. Or maybe just heavily mod Fallout 4 until it plays like a Ghost Recon game.

EDIT: Also, the ending is bugged. If you 100% the game, it will give you the bading ending and say something along the lines of ""Congratulation, you've completed 100% of the game. Now complete 100% of the game for a different ending"". Apparently the developers assumed no one would be stupid enough to 100% the game and didn't bother testing for this eventuality. You can replay the mission to get the correct ending, but that at point you might as well just watch the ending on youtube and save your time.",1668825843,1698262541,False,5,0,0.555510759353637695,0,True,False,False

But for a lower price I recommend this game for its amount of content.

The stealth mode is satifying, but the game itself is repetetive as f and there are glitches all over the place. Driving is somewhat satisfying but really glitchy, AI sucks and is glitchy. Both friendly and enemy AI teleport all over and it feels like the enemy AI have more health as soon as you exit stealth mode which means you're fckd.

Otherwise the map is huge, but the ""random encounters"" is not worth your attention since they are always the same, boring and worthless.

The arsenal is wide which means you can experiment and find a favourite gun that suits your gameplay, but of course you can choose two primary and one secondary which is nice. There is also a lot of modification that can be made to the weapons so you can personalize and adjust you weapons to suit your needs depending on the mission and your playstyle.

I have not tried the 'Ghost War' 4v4 multiplayer gamemode and don't think I ever will cause it doesn't really attract my attention that much, so I can't say anything about that, so far.

Later edit: The ""final"" mission which involves El Sueno was the shitiest so far. I have not yet completed it cause I've spent 1 and a half hour trying to get this mission started. First it was a glitch that made the quest fail immediately saying that I was detected, but it is not a stealth mission. When I finally got out of that glitch, the next steps in. When I arrive at the coordinates the mission gives me, it says that the mission is unavailable and that all Ghosts has to leave the area. I got bored and frustrated and will make another attempt another time and let you know if there are any other glitches during this mission.

Note: that I have not played any other 'Ghost Recon' games so I can't judge wether or not this game should be classified as a 'Ghost Recon' game.",1523566977,1697776909,False,0,0,0.462830096483230591,0,True,False,False

Edit:  After 120hrs I can absolutely recommend this game.  As games go (and I stress this is a game, not a simulation) itÂ´s fun, actionpacked, has a good story and lots of guns.  Vehicle controls are not great but you get the hang of it soon enough and itÂ´s not really a liability.  120hrs of gameplay to finish the story without doing everything for 60$ is worth it.

Edit 2:  350hrs. in the new gamemode Ghost where you die you have to restart is fun and exiting.  Skip the DLC, both are trash and donÂ´t buy any of the micro stuff, the guns in particular are nothing the base game doesnÂ´t have.

I skipped the rest of the Ubi/Ghost Recon games until this one. This game was bastardized to be more mainstream or lack of buttons on controller. 

At the time of this posting, I bought the game on deep sale about a week ago. For the initial honeymoon phase of the first 10-20 hours in I was having a lot of fun in co-op and solo, but the more I played the more I dislike it. At the time of this at 78 hours in I'm slogging through it with repetitive side quests to improve my chances of success.  

For starters, 6 years after release and it still employs Denuvo with the capability to degrade performance with Easy Anti-Cheat on top? Why? Anyone that wanted to torrent the game already has years ago, not to mention doesn't have to deal with UPlay. 

There's no option to play fully in 1st person and no manual leaning system. There are FOV mods to mitigate this but no manual leaning system is a massive blow. I do understand that this is a stealth game and I can lean around corners and walls when I ADS, but I'm exposing myself to be shot at by more enemies in a weaker position. The older games on the original xbox from 15 years ago at the time of release had this feature. Why do I need to mash 4 to switch between half a dozen throwables? Why can't I split these grenades up on 5 through 0 on the keyboard? Or better yet categorizing them from flashbangs, frags, mines, and other explosives. 

Despite having the game on Ultra settings, enemies on solo disappear past 600 meters. What is the point in having these high power scopes when we can't even fully utilize them? In addition killing the cartel bosses makes no difference exploring the world. 

The friendly AI is both powerful and stupid all at the same time. You get access to the powerful sync shot with up to 3 charges. Inside vehicles they are fine and always ready to shoot back. But I've experienced a few times when we are in the middle of a fight the friendly AI(s) don't even acknowledge the enemy shooting at them, the same issue as in Ready or Not.",1697670738,1697670738,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This game simulates the life of civilians in Bolivia very well, I can consider myself an expert since I closely observed the Bolivians, carefully running me over, even 5 meters from the roadside, curiously in Expert mode they killed me more times than the enemies themself, and they have killed me MANY times.
Also, the enemies probably have tape magazines up their sleeves, because they never reload.
Finally, ghost mode is the opposite mode to realism, due to the many bugs that persist from normal mode, if they existed in real life I don't know how mankind would still be alive (because of the Bolivians behind the wheel)",1672684469,1697501587,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The Ghosts and I had been tracking this particular cartel base for weeks, watching from afar as the criminals executed their nefarious deeds. Tonight, the time has come to put an end to their reign of terror. I'm armed with my trusty M40A51, the cool metal grip reassuring in my hands. My comrades, Weaver, Holt, and Midas, have my back, and the thrill of coordinated teamwork is palpable. We're all players in a meticulously crafted symphony of destruction.

The base is sprawling, lit up like a Christmas tree. Our objective: eliminate the cartel boss and extract vital intel. I rely on my drone, a handy tool in our arsenal, to scout the enemy positions. As the night closes in around us, I mark enemy snipers, armored soldiers, and spot a mortar that could mean our end here. The cartel's defenses are no joke.

Silently, we move forward. The moonlight casts eerie shadows through the jungle canopy as we approach the base. The stealth aspect of our is where we truly shine. We take down a couple of guards with well-placed shots, their deaths shrouded in mystery. The tension mounts with each silent kill, and I can feel the adrenaline pumping through my veins.

However, the element of surprise is short-lived. Our stealthy approach inevitably devolves into chaos as our presence is detected. Bullets fly, explosions rock the base, and alarms blare. The base comes alive with cartel soldiers hunting us down like wild animals. The heat of the firefight is breathtaking, and the sound of bullets whizzing past and explosions is as exhilirating as it gets.

In the midst of the chaos, we locate our target - the cartel boss. The intense firefight becomes a game of cat and mouse as we hunt him down through the twisting labyrinth of shipping containers and buildings. It's a heart-pounding experience, each step more dangerous than the last.

After an intense firefight, the cartel boss falls, his reign of terror over. With his death, the base is practically ours. I can't help but feel a sense of accomplishment as we extract the vital intel we came for and help the allied rebels into the base.""

Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon: Wildlands is a breathtaking journey, an open-world sandbox of military strategy and tactical warfare. From the sprawling landscapes to the realistic gunplay and the richly detailed narrative, it's a game that immerses you in the life of a Ghost. If you love intense combat, a compelling story, and the thrill of battling the odds in a hostile, drug-fueled world, Wildlands is the game you've been waiting for.

So grab your gear, rally your squad, and step into the shoes of a Ghost. The war against the Santa Blanca cartel is calling, and in Wildlands, you'll feel the adrenaline, the tension, and the thrill of the silent shadows like never before.",1697491159,1697491159,True,3,0,0.51811593770980835,0,True,False,False

If you turn off HUD displays you aren't told what weapon or attachment you collected - in the weapons  menu! The loadout doesn't tell you the most obvious stuff (zoom settings of scope) You cant fly higher than 1ft because of SAM. I won't even go into how useless your fireteam is. The laziness of the placing of intel is annoying and adds zero value to the gameplay (yet all areas have 14 to collect), and it is obvious the devs ended up shoving two in many places - so pointless. The response time from the enemy is overwhelmingly fast and is ridiculous - you silence an alarm but helicopters turn up anyway. Don't even get me started on Unidad superhuman powers. Why do they have a problem with the cartel if Unidad are all robocops? The civilians walk around in firefights passively and disinterested. The game physics are slow, unresponsive and not accurate (playing on 13th gen with RTX4080 - so not me). I had to stop playing because not risking mashing my new beautiful Lenovo Legion 7i for this POS game.

I can understand why the Bolivian Government had a problem with this game - it wholly misrepresents their country but personally I think that the reason they got so insulted ... is because if you are going to try and tackle a difficult topic like South American corruption in a game ... make it a good game, but this - this is so bad it makes the country, it's people and it's illicit drug industry look stupid. I find nothing makes people angrier than making them feel stupid. You can do a lot to a person if you are respectful, but make them feel stupid and you will find out quickly how even the most oppressed can rise up and f you in the a.

I uninstalled this within days of purchase. I appreciate the industry has great pressures on dev leadtimes and logistics. I appreciate that this game is some years old (I actually played Breakpoint to completion before buying wildlands on sale 80% off and whilst also underwhelmed by Breakpoint it is at least better in all respects I listed above and would still recommend buying at a discount if you get the chance).

 That Wildlands it is still being sold for over Â£35 is shocking to me. If I had spent that much you can bet your bottom dollar I would have demanded a refund. As it is, I am not going to flog a dead horse and accept it for what it is - a troubled game (as so many are these days). 

I have played so many open world games as they are/were my jam. I am at heart a masochist. This time however I simply asked ""why am I doing this to myself?"" and uninstalled.

I am not attacking the devs (I take a knee and raise my fist in the air for them) but I am attacking the industry and it's financiers: they are the reason so many potentially excellent games get released without finesse and thus break the 4th wall for the consumer.

This is my first negative review of a game. I have played many bad games that lacked for so many reasons. I think the reason that this game received my full aggression is that it made me feel stupid and I don't like that. I suspect others will feel the same way and so I say - do not buy!",1697278832,1697295576,False,7,1,0.514343380928039551,0,True,False,False

First things first, let's talk about how it compares to Breakpoint. Now, I don't want to throw shade, but let's be real â Wildlands is like the big brother Breakpoint wishes it could be. It's more open, more engaging, and just...better.

Now, onto the nitty-gritty - gameplay. It's fantastic, no two ways about it. The freedom to tackle missions in any order and the ginormous open world to explore is a blast. You can go all tactical, sneaking around like a ninja, or go in guns blazing, and both ways are satisfying.

But here's the kicker - it can get repetitive. Clearing out yet another cartel outpost, stealing another chopper, it starts to feel like a Groundhog Day scenario after a while. But, hey, isn't that what we signed up for in a sandbox game?

What's great about Wildlands is that it feels like you're playing with your buddies. The AI team members are surprisingly competent (and you don't have to worry about them stealing your snacks).

The story? Well, it's not exactly Oscar-worthy, but it's enough to keep you moving from one breathtaking locale to another. You're on a mission to dismantle a drug cartel, and let's be honest, it's a pretty solid excuse to explore the stunning landscapes of Bolivia.

Now, I can't finish this review without mentioning the vehicles. From dirt bikes to choppers, you've got an impressive garage at your disposal. The driving physics are surprisingly solid, and there's no greater joy than catching some air off a cliff in a stolen sports car.

So, in a nutshell, Ghost Recon Wildlands is an action-packed sandbox, a little bit repetitive but hella fun. It's the better sibling compared to Breakpoint, offering an open-world playground with plenty of toys to keep you entertained. If you're into tactical shooters with a dash of chaos, you've found your game.

To explain the reason why I *HEAVILY* suggest against buying this game, I'll put my points as to what I liked, what I don't like, and my reaction to the positive reviews.

The good:

Vehicle driving feels more fun, being able to drift around corners and give chase to lieutenants can be exhilarating!

The variety in guns is acceptable

Being able to help the rebel resistance to gain access to support options like rebel mortar fire is really interesting and cool, allowing you to plan for bigger assaults

----------------------------------------

The mediocre:

Call me crazy, but I think the gun mechanics are very mediocre, it feels like most of the time, I'm slinging bits of hardened playdough at my enemies, not damage wise, but the feel of the gun feels off, like battlefield 4 kind of gunplay, where the guns don't feel satisfying to fire

Along with this, there is gun customisation, which is okay, however the actual customisation of guns is limited, for example, to get a grenade launcher, you need to... put skill points into it? It rubs me the wrong way and is more of a personal preference, however comparing it to previous games, the customisation feels mediocre, or even a couple steps back

Character movement in this game is passable, it's nice how fluid getting behind and coming out of cover can be, however most of the time it feels like you're running through wax and it never feels like you're getting anywhere fast enough

Lack of specialists means that everyone feels the same. There's no difference between two maxed out players apart from their weaponry, which just feels bland, especially compared to Breakpoint. It's not for everyone, but not having access to unique abilities or tradeoffs makes the game very stale.

The character customisation is flat as a pancake, you have a choice between seven different hairstyles which are shared between both genders, different faces that you can't change the colours of, so I ended up just making Foap from MW3

----------------------------------------

The Bad/Controversial:

You are a regular soldier. On the surface, this may be a bit baffling, however comparing Wildlands to Future Soldiers is like comparing a generic armyman to someone in the spec ops, you're meant to be top class soldiers with futuristic equipment on you, allowing you to take care of situations quietly or be able to assault in ways that completely overwhelms your enemies, instead you're just Joe. You have your rifle, secondary, pistol and drone, and that's it. No stealth technology, no door busting gadgets, not even a throwable scanner of some description, and it's just.. empty. If you're going into this game with the expectation of being an actual member of the Ghost Recon squad, I'm sorry to say, you're just some standard army riflemen.

The map... by god the map. Your minimap is something you'll look at, purely for the purpose of finding materials for the rebels or for collectibles. Is it above or below your location? I don't know, it's just there, which makes it frustrating. Does it tell you where possible entrances are? Nope. Maybe it can give hints as to nearby people who haven't been identified? Nope. This makes looking at the minimap pointless, unless you wish to run around to give the rebels some supplies, speaking of..

The rebels, this system, while cool in theory, is just wasted potential. Most of what they can do is specifically useful when you're assaulting an area loud, however, you're Ghodt Recon, you're meant to be stealthy, which throws all of the cool stuff such as the mortar barrage, squad of rebels, etc out the window because calling any of them in will blow your cover

Guns, their customisation, the lack of sorting options, just baffles me completely. Bearing in mind I have all the DLC, the most useful weapon I've had is the rapid fire crossbow, which will one shot anyone, pierces so you can do a 2 for 1 deal, is always silent and hardly has any drop, meaning you can go on entire mutder sprees considering it fires as fast as it reloads, whilst holding 60 bolts, I have never felt like it was good using a gun as the inaccuracy modifiers and recoil of the gun were too penalising compared to using the crossbow, nevermind the lack of customisation compared to Breakpoint, which came out before this

Vehicles suck, the only vehicle you'll ever need is the minigun helicopter as driving takes too long with all the mountains, and the minigun eill not alert enemies outside a certain bubble, so you can spray to your hearts content at all the little dots down below

The lack of life in this game feels cheap, sure people drive by or are walking by the road, however I have never once stopped by the road because something caught my eye, as you're fast travelling then just going from point A to point B, at least in Breakpoint there were constant patrols, items to collect, resources to gather, in Future Soldier exploring would reward you with collectibles, guns, what have you, but EVERYTHING you need to actually progress is highlighted in all the different towns, which just kills off anything outside them, sadly

There is backstory to the characters, but they purely come from the collectibles, so if you ignore collectibles and just go straight into killing the folk, you won't even know stuff about the people you killed, which changes... nothing, the fact that they don't taunt you, or know about your existence after dlaughtering their dedicated sector feels jarring and unreal, I'm more than certain if you wiped off an entire group from a real life cartel, they wouldn't take it lying down.

My biggest grudge against ANYONE who says that ""Oh yeah, playing it with friends will make it better"" Is just a blitering idiot. Any game with multiplayer instantly gets better when you can have friends in it, however, if the core game is such a terrible dtate of empty, then what reason would YOU have to continue? Compare this to deep rock galactic, in which yes, you can play this with friends, playing it solo feels great to play as well as coop, and sometimes EVEN BETTER!


So riddle me this Batman, if this game is bland, empty, a point to point mission slog, with a story that probably is better left uncared for than you actually paying attention to it, by playing 3rd person Call of Duty, why would you want this game? If you desperately need your open world multiplayer game itch scratched, go play breakpoint, it has a much, MUCH better system than Wildlands.

----------------------------------------

Tldr: Game has nothing of value to give, multiplayer games are always more fun with friends, if you want futuristic gadgets with a more fun combat system, go play Breakpoint, it's cheaper and doesn't require as hefty of a system to look as good :)

Yes I'll leave replies on in case I'm wrong, but in 5.6 hours ish I've played, I've completed the first zone after collecting the collectibles because I thought it would change my mind, instead it just frustrated me, and seeing all the positive reviews feels disingenuous to what the game actually is",1697175424,1697175424,False,1,0,0.462919414043426514,0,True,False,False

Now I'll keep it short and sweet the only downside to this game, is just the AI, sometimes the enemy AI(specifically the faction Unidad) can be overwhelming, but it really depends, I like hard difficulty in stealth games, the friendly AI can be.... iffy sometimes, especially on convoy missions, which thankfully they don't punish you if the ai messes up.

This is like a really sweet spin off to Splinter Cell, oh man mind you the easter eggs are soooo sweeet in this game, it even has call backs to Ghost Recon Future Solider, as well Splinter Cell and a few other ubisoft games, ESPECIALLY SWAT.

This is a 10/10 game for me besides microtransactions stuff, I ignore it cause well, this game has a ton to offer, it's an open world splinter cell game, with all the fun stuff and different ways to play out an AO, by far as well its much better than Ghost Recon Breaking Point, the world feels, how do I say this, ALIVE",1696988280,1696988280,True,9,0,0.636626005172729492,0,True,False,False

here's the thing. i think of steam kind of like an arcade hall. i got 30 hours of good fun for 10 EUR.
no serious glitches or game breaking bugs. i ran into something that really bothered me, but in retrospect i think i was just having a really bad day. which is why i didn't write a review that day. even though it's ubisoft and mankind loves throwing shit in a pile.

well, that's the gist of it.

summary. throw your 10 bucks. it's worth it.
there is a lot of value in this game.

the guns are kind of.. i don't know. i play a lot of splinter cell and such, so i had a bunch of nice guns from the start.
so i never really had to bother with any guns at all. for 30 hours.

fair enough, my aim is pretty good, but the guns and upgrades are pretty boring.
you get a couple of worthwhile ones like infrared, battery upgrades and silent running etc.

the rest is just idiot fodder.
fillers. why bother?

the local backup-function is pretty cool but i don't feel i ever need to use it because..
well. the game isn't that difficult? maybe i'm playing it wrong.

This game is a treasure trove of unforgettable memories, and it's held up incredibly well over time.

Even in the gaming world where new titles constantly clamor for attention, Wildlands still shines. Its polished graphics and immersive open-world environment feel just as fresh today as when we first dove in. The attention to detail in the sprawling landscapes, from dense jungles to arid deserts, is simply stunning.

But what truly makes Wildlands a standout experience is its co-op play. Playing with friends turned the game into a rollercoaster of hilarity, tactical brilliance, and occasional friendly fire mishaps. Whether we were coordinating helicopter assaults on drug cartel compounds or hijacking convoys, every mission was an adventure.

The outposts and objectives could sometimes seem repetitive, but when you're laughing your head off with buddies while trying to stay stealthy, it hardly matters. And speaking of variety, the game's high weapon customizability and the abundance of character perks added depth and replayability, keeping us hooked for hours on end.

Ghost Recon Wildlands isn't just a game; it's a canvas for unforgettable co-op stories. It's a testament to the power of friendship, teamwork, and the joy of conquering challenging missions together. If you're looking for a game that stands the test of time and offers endless opportunities for cooperative fun, look no further than Ghost Recon Wildlands.

- Your companions are near useless, and only ever function right when you are directly commanding them and not focused on defending yourself.
- Enemy ability to detect you is near supernatural 
- You're a tier 1 spec ops operators that can't afford to start with rifle mags that can hold a standard 30 round capacity
- You can't use your parachute any time that it matters.
- Airplane missions are impossible because the controls are garbage and your companions can literally bump into the wing when exiting and make them explode (not an exaggeration, that's actually how poorly calibrated the physics and impact settings are). 
- All difficulty is cheaply artificial due to suicidal enemy AI, and them being able to spawn wherever they want. The rules of the game only really apply to you. 
- Ammo is plentiful to the point that I've never run out, making brute force almost always the best course of action. 

There is a good game buried deep deep beneath the absolute absence of quality control, but the problems with it surface so constantly that I've never been able to go a single day without being infuriated and having to take a break. The sequel overhauled a lot of these problems, but did so without replicating the tone and feel that made Wildlands compelling to come back to, resulting in a completely different game that doesn't even resemble the same franchise.",1657761782,1696386965,False,1,0,0.497925341129302979,0,True,False,False

I have spent the last 10 hours on it and honestly I've forgotten the entire rest of the story line at this point but I can't clear the region until I beat it AND it starts automatically if you're in that region AND you aren't even allowed to enter that base to look for the files if you haven't completed it.  I don't understand how Ubisoft manages to wreck every game with at least one massively stupid decision.

Other than that, it's basically a forgettable Far Cry clone with none of the silly humor that feels designed for people who want to LARP real soldiers. Which isn't a bad thing.

It's pretty, lots of character customization, stealth mechanics stink, bullet drop is random and doesn't make since, Unidad response is like GTA cop stars but done very poorly so you go from 2 soldiers to 12+ armored soldiers accompanied by 3+ helicopter gunships in about 90 seconds unless you abandon whatever you're doing and RUN as soon as you tick off any soldiers.

I dunno, even if I get past this mission at this point I'm just finishing it to get it off my list of unfinished games in my library and will likely never replay it.

Story is forgettable at best.

Also the night vision kindof stinks in an unrealistic way.

Also enemy hit points seems to change if they're alerted vs unalerted so they turn into bullet sponges once they see you.

You can choose to go with the main story or just have fun with the side quests. You can also try to find all collectibles which can help you in various ways.

The progression system is quite unique. You'll have to find predefined items and tag them. You'll get certain points by doing that. Then you can use those points to level up. There are a wide variety of skills that you can progress in. Each is quite unique also. You can choose to boost your combat skill, enhance your drone, or improve your stealth skills.

In most case, you'll prefer stealth approach for all of your missions. It's because you can only take several hits from bullets before you die. A compromise between realism and game aspect.

It is it's most hilarious when I'm driving a vehicle of any kind on the winding roads and narrowly avoid hitting the many civilians walking along the side.

I love that we can go in to every enemy situation in a variety of ways, including stealthy or guns blazing on a military tank we stole from the last group. Sometimes we don't always realize what we're supposed to do, and some story missions take multiple tries before we figure out how to be successful, but it's fun to be challenged once in a while. Playing together can be a bit funky. It took a while for us to figure out the correct order of steps. We need to have both the steam launcher and the ubisoft launcher open and set ourselves to online. Then we need to make sure we both get the online notice after launching the game. After that I should be able to invite my husband to my game in one of several ways. The most consistent has been inviting him through the ubisoft launcher once I've started a gaming session, although lately I've had better luck inviting him from the game menu. If you're having trouble, snap three times with your left hand and do a spin counterclockwise, followed by four taps of your right toes and blink in a left, right, left, right, right pattern, and that should do the trick.

Honestly you *should* play it, but every time I have fun, its often partnered with equal measures of frustration due to poorly implemented or unpolished systems,as well as bugs and other annoyances.

Some grievances:

 - Enemy AI is either complete idiot behavior or its actively cheating and sees you through walls. No matter where you are on the map, if the detection status changes to hunted/engaged/etc, the enemy will beeline toward your location and often has zero reason to even know your location. Body found at a location you already rotated away from? They know your current one, and you get to move AGAIN. Silently kill someone while they're alone and nobody else is around but you're already being hunted? Boom, they know your current location again like 70% of the time. *This isn't about easy or hard*, its about logical sense. Logical behavior. Its easy to mow down whole bases but that's boring as hell, and the stealth inconsistencies ruin a ton of potential fun. Meanwhile they're one of the only other creative options.

 - Because of the above AI bullsh!t, you are either in a firefight or are perfectly hidden, and very little inbetween is possible. If you're suspected or detected, you have to wait and Kite the AI around until they stop, instead of them logically following any normal reason to investigate anything. The game sees you at all times, which is fine, but does a PISS poor job of pretending it doesn't when it shouldn't.

 - Vehicle spawns are absolutely horrible and frustrating. Firstly, the most useful vehicle, the bike, isn't even available despite a HELICOPTER being available when you max out the ability to spawn vehicles. Secondly, when you do spawn vehicles, they game puts them in completely different area codes for zero fucking reason. Roleplay-wise your rebel contact delivers these vehicles to you, meanwhile I could be in a town that has one area full of enemies, and the dumbass drops my helicopter or armored car in the cloud of fucking enemies. Very smart, very realistic, very convenient.

 - The occasional on-rails-but-you-get-to-trial-and-error-find-the-rails story missions. Most are fine, even well made! But some are just purely unnecessary in terms of wasting time, and patience. For example, the  Silent Spade Mission with the helicopter segment (which I completed btw).

 - Enemies often do this ducking/sidestepping animation during gunfights, as if they hear gunshots and reflexively stumble out of the way. It always happens AFTER you fire on them, and it always essentially gives them an ""oops that didn't actually happen"" card to play while engaging them. What this means is while you're returning fire they can randomly just stop taking damage for a second, while things like detection still keep on ticking away against your favor. Edit: adding to this as I've noticed more, 

 - Inconsistent bullet damage to enemies when they're beginning to detect/have detected you vs when you're undetected. When undetected you can 1-2 shot most enemies even if you aim between the head and torso. When detected enemies occasionally decide to take upwards of 3 extra shots before they go down. Some things like snipers and machine guns tend to not suffer from this.

 - [Admittedly a small complaint] The Grenade/items UI system. Theres grenades, mines, c4, diversion lures, a flare gun, etc. And rather than make a system thats easy to use, you have to either spam 4 to cycle through it, or remember its cooresponding number key as a hotkey. Just make 4 a gear wheel with the locked/unlocked options on it. It would be so much easier.


In conclusion Id rather be playing MGSV but that games map is more boring, and has no civilians. I'm gonna keep playing this game and wish the things I've listed could be addressed, but since its Ubisoft I know it won't be. And that alone is why I think they deserve the thumbs down.",1692520029,1695043265,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

UbiSoft games are ALWAYS a hassle to own.  The game bothers you CONSTANTLY in game to play online with friends, and if you go offline it will not let you play the SINGLE player game.   I loaded this game up recently as I wanted to play a military FPS... and it reminded me why I havent bought an UbiSoft game since 2017.   

The game bombards you constantly IN GAME to invite friends or other online people to your game.  STFU Ubisoft!!!  I just want to play  single player and not be told by some 12 year old that they want to F#CK my Mother.   God I hate UbiSoft

I am not even mentioning the idiotic rules that apply in the game though.  Can enemies shoot through fences? YES!!  Can you?  NO!! Why?  I dunno... bad programming?  No idea...

Anyhow, the point of me owning this game now seems to be nother more than a good reminder that buying anything UbiSoft is a mistake.

Which means this truly awesome game gets a thumbs down.

One other fairly major complaint. The devs are apparently too inept to make the game remember your graphics settings.

It does take about 12 hours to get into it as the control system is quite hard to master.  If you do buy it bear this in mind. Now I am over a hundred hours in but its still more like pulling teeth than enjoying yourself.  I did manage to finish the single player on easy. I am trying again on normal but I die much more often making if very slow.

The game is one of the slowest games to load that I have ever played.  Far cry and AC Valhalla are slow but this one is much slower. And when you get killed, which is pretty often you could make yourself a snack or go get yourself a beer while it loads again.  And don't don't even try fast travel; its quicker to run to your destination than to wait for it to load. Its not my machine, its the fact that it goes out to servers at Ubisoft and this can take upto 5 minutes

Secondly its almost impossible to be a ghost. The bad guys have 20-20 night vision and take about a second to spot you.  They can also hit you from 200 meters away with pinpoint accuracy.  In Normal mode this means you have a second to get out of the line of fire.  In advanced mode its be seen, be dead.  More often than not you move out of one line of fire directly into another.

In single player your squad is dumb as shit.  Your AI colleagues are mostly a waste of time in a fire fight. They never stay close to you so that when you need reviving its just a minute of waiting on the ground while they find you, put the silencer on their gun, take it of again and then decide to revive you often while leaving the guy that shot you completely alone.  They also let people creep up on you; they hardly ever watch your back.

And then some of the missions are just random.  Parachute into a base, kill all the bad guys without getting noticed, fly out with a helicopter and then suddenly have to fight  5 helicopters all of which can shoot you down in one shot.  Fail, then rinse and repeat.   There is no skill, its just sheer luck if you make it to the end. 

The terrain is very tedious and difficult to move across.  The game could do with some AC style parkour skills.  Several times I have had to resort to fast travel to get out of a hole that I am trapped in.

It tries to be Just Cause meets Sniper Ghost Warrier 2.  It fails on both counts.  In Just Cause the vehicles work.  In this game all vehicles are skittish and random.  The helicopters fall out of the sky unless you keep pressing up, the cars might as well be roller skates as none of the wheels are connected to the ground, they just pivot around the centre.  In Just Cause I almost never died.  You can always get out of trouble using the grappling hook then regroup and go again.  In this piece of trash if your vehicle dies then you are dead; If you get spotted by Unidad you are dead.  

There are a million different weapons with a million different combinations of add-ons and yet they are all the same.  Its been proven that the damage stats don't matter.  Similarly for the costumes. These options are like a pencil with no lead - pointless.

Get through the first few hours however and you will start earning skills.  These make the game more enjoyable indeed playable.  I have just gone back and done a ""protect the radio"" mission that was impossible 5 hours in and is now possible thanks to all of the upgrades. Even now, some of the things are hilarious like your teammate trying to walk through a moving train and getting run over mid battle.

I think the worst problem though is having played stealth shooters including the Tom Clancy ones for perhaps 20 years this one is so generic as to have lost something.  I could be playing Farcry 5 or Just Cause 3.  Its so much harder to play in stealth mode that I gave up wheras in previous incarnations it was always possible. 

If you are a fan of the series then you might find it a refreshing change. or you may, like me, find it a sell-out.",1688517213,1693511484,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Alert 1 AI and every AI enemy knows exactly where you are and what you are doing as long as you remain in alert status, anywhere you go in the world. 

Try to play this game tactically to take out the AI carefully? Nope. 
AI are spawned within your operating area. Sometimes directly behind you (don't forget they instantly are locked on and firing). Sometimes kill an Enemy and another spawns in it's place... notices the dead body... and immediately all AI know what happened. 
Okay, so you can get in a fire fight and shoot your way out? Nope. 
The AI never... never needs to reload. So 100% accurate. 100% awareness. Infinite magazine rounds. You die. Replay the mission - from the absolute beginning. No way to skip those intro cut scenes that you watch 12-20 times (but you can skip the end of mission cut scenes). 

The AI can see through all trees and bushes but you cant. Don't forget you can get killed behind over. The bullets seem to curve or be guided. You can get shot behind concrete walls because the AI can shoot about 5 feet through the edge of any wall. You can't. 

Sometimes, the mission involves an AI character that needs to stay alive for you to interrogate. Well, he is often surrounded by shooting AI. So that's difficult. Sometimes, the AI will accidentally blow something up and kill the Mission AI - you start over from the absolute beginning. Other times, you have to talk to the Mission AI. Does the outside world pause? Nope. The Enemy continues as normal game play. Terrible when you have to stop talking to the Mission AI, kill all the Enemies (which will return shortly), and then RESTART the Mission AI dialogue from the introduction!!!

The AI is BAAAAAaaaaaad. I'm talking Metal Gear Solid 1, if you're caught, everyone knows exactly where you're at. Often will spawn on you. They also start shooting you before they have Line of Sight so do NOT run around corners. Skills barely feel impactful aside from the Items and Drone.

It is reminiscent of Far Cry 2 where the world is huge, and what's more, you can go absolutely everywhere within it.  You chose your path to the ultimate confrontation, and the weapon selection is again, huge.  Weapon sounds are not that brilliant, but that's completely liveable with.

No game is perfect though.  Brilliant as Wildlands is, there are some very annoying parts that are unavoidable.  Missions that are time dependant that can get very repetitive due to the insufficient amount of time give.  Missions that have three or four parts to them that have no save point, and return you to the first part if you end up killed.  it's a relief to get those missions out of the way - but there are not that many of them.

You can chose just which missions to take on that are not story related - side ops that contribute to your ability to expand your characters capabilities.  And there are hundreds of these - no way you need to complete them all.  I did a huge chunk of them, and ended up finishing the first complete run through of the game in over 250 hrs.  Again, it's not necessary, but you get the most out of the game if you take on rebel ops that increase your abilities.  

The missions generated are not boring or too similar.  With Far Cry 2, it became all too easy after a while, and the missions chosen looked all too familiar.  Not with Wildlands - the world is even bigger, but this time the missions - even the side missions - have real contrast.

It does become a little easier once you develop your character's abilities.  Vehicle drop offs are a must - and it becomes more helpful if you can ask for an armoured car or a helicopter for some missions.  Weapon upgrades - loads of them.  However, I did find that there were limited weapons that could have grenade launchers attached.  A weapon with a grenade launcher is going to make your life so much easier.  I've played this first run through with weapon suppressors on the sniper rifle, assault rife and handgun.  It makes sense - but the next challenge would be to try a run through with no silenced weapons.

There are two possible end cut scenes - you have to complete the game once to generate the second ending. 

On a down side, there is one really bad bug that has not been resolved since the game's launch.. The first El Gato mission is seriously bugged if you are playing as a single player - the bad guy just doesn't appear so you can't take him out and therefore you can't progress.  The only way I found to get around this is to play this one mission as a co-op mission - let your team mates do the necessary - the mission gets finished - then revert back to the single player mode.  I've discovered that this bug has been around for years now - and it's really disappointing to find that Ubisoft still haven't fixed it.

That aside, this is one of the few games around that are worth the purchase price.  Loads of gameplay, and real challenges.  For all the faults I've mentioned, it's worth it.  Enjoy.",1693008027,1693008027,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Pros-
Well firstly the graphics are absolutely immaculate and crispy.
Weather its raining or just wind blowing the bolivia inspired place looks so good And the shooting and handling of weapons feels good and amazing.
The big open world map actually fits here for the first time but due to poorly+tedious mission structure makes its frustrating as always (gonna talk about it later)
I even put a first person Mod because i hated the third person movement in this game.

Cons-
Ubisoft always have to put worthless grinding in their videogames.
This is same mission structure followed through the whole game-
1)You go to a province

2)You go to an informer

3)You ask him about 1 thing out of 3 things (ask about weapon cases or skill points or rebel missions)
Now you have additional intel and the thing you asked him for ex i asked about skill points
Now your map is filled with intel to collect basically to progress through main story and skill points which are useful 


4)Now you have to ask another same kinf of informer person about accessories rebel missions because rebel missions gives you rebel points and rebel points are needed to upgrade your character without rebel points skill points are useless
Now you have intel on map

5)Collect 1 intel then do the follow up story mission and do this 5-6 times as each provice has these no. Of missions to do before killing the final boss.

6)Now skill points are scattered across the map and weapon cases are also as well as accessories cases(they have different scopes muzzles forgrip etc) each of them are scattered individually across the province you just discovered and every thing you have to collect because collecting weapon cases gives you different weapons which is necessary to keep the game fresh as well as weapons 
accessories, skill points are necessary as well as you have to rebel missions to get rebel points otherwise in later game it would be extremely hard to progress without upgrades 
This is basically the whole structure of the game


Now just reading this made your mind fuc ked

Just imagine instead of this fuc-kall mission structure the game should have weapon cases on the same area as the missions so you dont have to back track or just grind to get a weapon case 
And weapon cases should come with accessories automatically so you don't need to waste your precious time on bullshit.

Instead of rebel missions normal missions should have additional objectives to get rebel points and skill points should be given automatically after each story missions.

This all would have been so nice but no its a ubisoft game and its not a ubisoft game if it has countless problems.",1672531674,1692823789,False,1,0,0.499826431274414063,0,True,False,False

Friendly AI couldn't be more stupid. Waste a bunch of skill points and resources to improve their effectiveness, yet they remain completely useless.
You will fail missions constantly due to rebels alerting everyone within a 1KM radius while you're trying to be stealthy. Or you being hopelessly outmatched in forced CQB situations where you immediately die, then sit and wait for your ai teammates to stand still doing absolutely nothing for 30 seconds while your target gets away before they bother reviving you.
Enemy AI is broken, with wall hacks, aimbot, eyes in the back of their heads and impossible abilities: i.e. shooting directly behind themselves. Enemies tend to remain entirely passive during a fire fights, until you break cover or push, and they suddenly all decide to peak cover or charge you at the same time.
Don't bother playing on harder difficulties. You will die every time you step out a vehicle or away from cover. 1 shot by anything from a pistol to a sniper, yet even your Level 15 upgraded M4 will still take 4-8 rounds to put down a single armoured enemy. I've completed the game on extreme difficulty: beyond maybe the first couple hours, It's just a miserable experience.

The Pros:
- A good thing I can see in this game is the stealth that it includes. The stealth is very cool.
- Another good thing is the character customization and the weapon customization.
These 2 were all the good things I can see. Nothing else

The Cons:
- The controls are very VERY frustrating. The Helicopters are VERY hard to control. The ground vehicles sometimes WON'T turn left nor right.
- The NPCs that need to get extracted sometimes get bugged. Some other times they even hide under destroyed vehicles making them unable to be moved by the player. At the same time you might be fighting against a whole army and of course you can't leave without the prisoner because he is, of course, under the vehicles.
- The enemies Have AIM BOT. They almost NEVER miss!
- Random Enemy NPC spawning at bases that I have already started invading. (Even if you do neutralize the new spawn, it WILL SPAWN after a few seconds AGAIN and at the same spot!!!).
- Launching the game is quick...... But after entering the menu, choosing ->""Continue Campaign"" and the ->""Launch in Offline"" takes AGES.
- Sometimes you might find yourself reaching a base and then a Random Spawn of Enemy vehicles enters play and gets you from behind.
- Other times the drone won't be called out. It just won't!!!
I have many other Cons too, but I can't remember them at the moment.

Other bad things:
- The talent System Just SUCKS. It's very grindy. I have 70 skill points which I can not use. I need millions of the other resources (gasoline, food, etc). So I can't progress it.
- I remember leaving with a plane and an enemy chopper spotted me. Guess what? I could NOT evade it. A plane is supposed to be running faster than a chopper.
- If you get spotted in an enemy base, that's it! You will find yourself fighting for Hours!!!!
- The talent that's called ""Bullet Resistant"" does NOT work. I have it 4/4 and I die with like 3 bullets.
- There is a bugged mission where you frame one of the Cartel Underbosses, meaning that the rest of the Cartel will start attacking the base of that Underboss. Guess what. You will get close to that base and the base will be INSTANTLY aware of your presence! So the following events is what happened:
1) R.I.P. your talents, which are most of them, stealth oriented.
2) I remember myself cursing on this mission.
3) I tried calling support from the Local Reb.... HAAHAHAHAHA. 1 guy arrived.And died instantly....................
- The characters that help you complete the missions try to look cool and bad-ass style. They are not even funny. They are just bad. The things they say are just out of this world.
-The talent from physical category ""Faster Regen"".... I don't know what's the use for it, if it appears as if it doesn't make any difference AT ALL!

Conclusion: if you have money, don't spend it on this trash. There are other similar Video Games that deserve credit, even from the same company (Ubisoft). I bought it from discount for 10 â¬, even these 10 â¬ were too much for all of this.

Multiple difficulty options and HuD settings allow for easy run and gun to near Mil-Sim/stealth required playstyles.
Main cons are Ubisoft server/slight glitches and driving physics related. Sometimes connecting to online services can be an issue. The squad commands are basic, NPCs AI is mid quality. Gunplay and shooting are smooth and responsive but sometimes suffer when trying to stay in cover/ move positions. 
You can shoot down resource carrying convoys with a gatling helicopter, rain mortar fire anywhere you want, and snake through bases to hack servers to delete stolen files that will incite wave after wave of undesirables to come knockin' you down.. Some other Tom Clancy games have cameos, giving a few different styles of missions.
Decent story, cool secret mini-boss enemies (El Tio/El Yeti), good amount of cosmetic customization, rewards for end game weekly challenges, a hardcore mode that deletes your save when you die, and one of the best free roam maps you can deploy to and wreak all the havoc a team of four highly trained covert operatives can muster (bring your friends for Co-Op if you can get past Ubisoft BS) and there's even some multiplayer modes.

-The helicopter blades don't kill enemies/people yet break against terrain (TIP: Try bouncing ontop of an enemy heli with your own to break their blades. Absolutely cash money, plus you dodge their gunfire)

-ALWAYS online, regardless of single player or not. Plus Ubisoft may delete your account and thus, your games if you dont play for ~6 months? 

-You can't jump.  

-New guns and attachments are unlocked by exploring and retrieving them in crates, a fair system. However, you can freely change your loadout wherever you are, in combat, in mission, 3000 feet in the air. No real need to ""plan"" or optimize loadouts

-Because attachments and weapons are so sparse, you really suffer in the beginning. Need a sniper? Use a FAL. SMG? FAL. CQC? FAL! Theres no benefit or any real need for other guns beyond different scopes. 

-Sometimes you need to interrogate someone, but they have a gun. Theres's no less than lethal tools to subdue someone... even grabbing them and ""knocking them out"" counts as a KILL. Lazy. 

+Realistic bullet ballistics and customizations do help make a gun feel like yours

-Vehicles are VERY loose/touchy and will easily toss you off a cliff
+Motorcycles are borderline impossible to fall off of as a result.

-Im ~18 hours in as of writing this, but after killing 3 buchons under an Underboss, this just getting kind of tiring. Sure, each mission is different and each boss has a ""persona/unique"" thing about them, but it's the same stuff. Find gold folder, do mission. Repeat ~5 times, go kill them. Buchon dead, congrats! Theres only 17 more, to do over again... and again... and again. 

-The missions fails are VERY brutal, borderline kicking you back to the start if you fail. Did you drive a box truck halfway across the map, clear a compound, deliver it, and fail because a patrol vehicle spotted you? Do it again, I wasnt looking. 

~The map is large, and each country has a feel to it? The map feels alive yet, so vacant and repetitive. Let me know when you find the ""Mayor's Office"" building that has the central large stairs and 2 sets to the left and right on the second floor to the third. 
+The HEAT MAP idea is a very cool feature, but a cleared providence still has cartel there, and some cartel control areas have heaps of rebels just driving around or patrolling. They could've had the map turn red vs green vs purple and focus troops or rebels there? But no, its just an overlay, that doesnt update live or reflect anything youve done beyond where youve traveled... which the normal map does anyways! What a waste. 


TL:DR; its a giant sandbox with stuff sprinkled in it. That's a lot of games broken down but, you're in Bolivia as a secret crew that drives around and kills endless cartel members. Missions can be completed in any order and thus have no real tension or ""story"" besides building your way up the chain. 

It has no real substance and is more of a time occupier than something you invest your time in and feel GOOD playing. Hell, go play Far Cry 3. Its similar but way better.",1691804459,1691805175,False,1,1,0.49918702244758606,0,True,False,False

I like to give older games the benefit of the doubt because I run Windows 11 and not everything is optimized for it. While none of the issues that I have are game breaking per say, when they add up it becomes obnoxious. I simply have neither the time nor energy to explain everything wrong with the map alone, but just know that in multiplayer I simply default to other people to use it because it is bugged beyond hope. Otherwise a bunch of little things like vehicles randomly appearing and disappearing, characters teleporting, getting stuck and only being able to get out by suicide, falling through the world, and severe audio issues. When I am playing in multiplayer as not host I get most of Bowman's phone calls but only audio from Midas and Holt. I only ever hear Nomad when it's either a random curse or a transmission ending in ""Nomad out"", and I only hear Weaver only once per two hour gaming session on average. In addition there are a number of lines from Nomad that I don't get. I have compared what audio I receive and who says what with the host and I am just missing a bunch. Perhaps it has to do with playing as a female Nomad, I don't know.

Additionally, the game is slow as hell. I know everyone will talk up their PC but I have a tank for a computer and I have newer and larger games that don't take a fraction of the time to load. Other than a literal Roscosmos software this is the only thing that takes any significant amount of time to load. The person who I play with runs Windows 10 and has a much older computer, and his loading time seems to be on par with the rest of his stuff and he doesn't get many of the same bugs that I do, although he is not bug free by any means. Overall, I would guess that this game isn't well optimized for Windows 11.

Good:
Overall nice tactical game, scratches the itch with gameplay close to commandos, but in first person. Good graphics, nice story, neat puns, good gameplay overall.

Bad:
Game is full of bugs and ubisoft dropped support prior to fixing the issues. Game is more than 6 years old, has built-in store and some even pay-for features are not fixed. Shame. Randomly exploding vehicles, inability to aim via scope, invisible pistol (i.e. no aim mark at all), teleporting enemies, respawning enemies 2 meters behind your back. And that's only in singleplayer.
In multiplayer, public team search doesn't work, constant NAT (i.e. network features) failures/errors, random disconnects, all bugs above increase in frequency.
Store: works with some lag. 1/3rd of dailies can't be completed since the feature of clans/guilds is not supported any more.

Summary: it is a decent game that didn't go all the pay-to-win shenanigans as Breakpoint did. But keep in mind that you're not buying full experience. By now you buy a bare scraps of what remains. Moreover, Ubisoft continues to cut on the support of the game and who knows when they remove servers overall and the game becomes unplayable.

I have only played this game solo and ""offline"" (its online but goobisoft speshal) and its one of my all time favourite games.

Its stealthy, but shooty with a solid story and great voice lines. You can do just the story or every single side quest. The AI is quite good and its overall aged like fine-wine. 

Disclaimer however; If you are expecting a highly polished game, well you've never played a goobisoft game but it has some glitches, some broken mechanics and the graphics can be a bit wacky depending on specs. I think it adds to the fun but if you dislike those things, it'll ruin your experience.

However, there is one minor issue I wish the developers would address - the ability to adjust the frequency of rainfall. It would be fantastic to have an option to control how much or how little it rains in the game.

Despite some attempts at a sequel like Breakpoint, I believe nothing can compare to the adventure and storytelling of this game. From the compelling beginning to the satisfying conclusion, the storyline keeps you hooked throughout the entire journey.

-Using rebel skills is fun.
-*Certain* missions are memorable (the final battle, Bookhart, the mission with the Unidad general, and the mission with Sueno's wife to name a few). Ironically, the most fun missions for me were bonus missions completely unrelated to the story (the Predator, Sam Fisher, and the Breakpoint tie-in mission).

Cons:

-Pretty much everything in the game reminds me of another game that did a better job. Metal Gear Solid 5 has better stealth, Arma is more realistic, Hitman has more memorable missions, Far Cry has more eccentric and interesting characters. 
-The balance and the way damage is calculated is way off. Submachine guns and shotguns are just not that viable at higher difficulties. Assault rifles, LMGs, and snipers are better in 99/100 scenarios.
-Most of the special tools in the game are worthless. Lures are completely outclassed by flares, flashbangs are never more useful than frag grenades, and frag grenades themselves are outclassed by mines and C4. 


The ""stupidly big but empty map full of busywork"" has been done to death, I'm sick of it, and the work never really pays off. Take your money elsewhere. Also, stay away from the sequel. It's somehow even worse than this game.",1684000325,1691365582,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Your arsenals are limited mostly to small arms, sometimes a fun vehicle, of which there are two, weee, but really leaves something to be desired. Controlling your squad and drone are highly entertaining to me personally, but they're limited to ""make gun go pew"" and ""make thing go boom"" after a short while, everything else is redundant. Noise maker? EMP? I think you mean explosion for literally everything because it has the same effect without the need to swap out in a menu (side note, the GUI in the menus is atrocious) 

A lot of gameplay is also inconsistent. Need to sneak into a military base but not allowed to be detected but also can't kill anyone? Great, I'll sneak up and press the big button that says ""knock out"" on a guard. Lo and behind, ""knock out"" is actually Bolivian slang for ""Murder""and will fail you said mission. Game is also wild with how it defines ""detection"" in different missions, sometimes its enough for the guards to hear an explosion in the distance, sometimes you can literally have a shootout and nobody will notice. 

The story line that will make your eyes roll as soulless cardboard cuttout npcs recite 40 year old Imperialist American propaganda at you, all of which leads to you essentially filling out a shopping list with bullets. I could excuse it if the game had been made about 40 years ago but for fuck sake, there is no excuse for having this level of misunderstanding of the war on drugs at the time this was released. Not to mention, you will suffer through it all for basically nothing. Everyone dies, or everyone dies later in a different cutscene, amazing stuff.

Not to mention that its not only full of micro-transactions but you can't even directly buy what you want, its lootboxes only. And no, its not just cosmetic, there is gameplay hidden behind those boxes, like the vehicles that have actual combat use (and make the game laughably easy once you get them) 

Most people say you should buy this game when its on sale. For me personally you could not pay me to ever play a ghost recon game again (or any tom Clancy game again if the story is this bad and unaware of itself, holy fuck)",1690740538,1691288422,False,4,0,0.543427109718322754,0,True,False,False

Very cool game with at least one friend. It deserve to give it a chance, very funny, albeit as for Ubisoft - expect heavy unfairness of the game, mainly in bugs. As a special commando, You arrive at Bolivia to exterminate cartel boss, but it won't be easy. Unless You take easiest difficulty that is. 

Pros:
+ Depending on difficulty - relaxing or challenging
+ Audio
+ Visuals
+ Bots / 1-3 living players
+ Touches some hard topics
+ Opposing factions and somewhat ""alive"" world
+ Many weapons and full character customization

Cons:
- Got stuck in textures or undermap few times
- A lot of small errors, giving unfair advantage to enemies, hits hard on higher difficulties
- AI tends to be... UbisoftAI
- A lot of small glitches here and there

In overall, there's a high chance You will get mad at game for being unfair with errors and glitches, but it should be overall a nice experience all together. Give it a try if You can! Recommend at least one friend.",1691267816,1691267816,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Dull world that you have zero impact on long term; die > everything re spawns.
Every enemy re spawns. 

The Enemy AI is stupid - drop line of sight and they'll run til they see you. I.e. Into the open. No enemy has any challenge.

Missions are: Go to place, kill enemies, interrogate. Repeat.

NPCS are purely for aesthetics - no impact on anything.
No need explore the open world as it's virtually empty. 

Exploration means you gather supplies, which you need to spend ability points from levelling. Which by it's very essence, requires you to search the map.

Can't progress the campaign til you kill enough baddies to meet a arbitrary meter.

Most the weapons are just skins - the stats mean nothing.

Basic rifle + sniper - no upgrades - will get you through the game without issue.

Team mate AI is stupid: They'll randomly stand in the open and get you seen.

Stealth mechanics: Useless. You can snipe everyone with a standard rile and clear the base. No need for the team/other weapons. Can't even stealth kill an enemy up close!

Forced to use vehicles to traverse as the map is unnecessarily large for this type of shooter.

The main enemies are UNIDAD: They'll endlessly spawn if you get caught (They're always aggressive), just like GTA. 

No manual save point.

No tactics required.

The online is entirely a graveyard from how dead it is, and if you even had friends you'd still be bored since there's nothing much to do besides jump into a base with a helicopter, take out a few guys and get a weapon case for an attachment that will only help you with one gun for the most part before you ditch it for another gun.

The game could be improved but you know how Ubisoft is with ghost recon, they already abandoned this one.

However, you could get break point since it's by a pinch more interesting than wild lands and the online works. The story isn't captivating but the map is beautiful in it's own way and the weaponry and skills are far more easier to get than with wild lands. 

Lastly, if you're wondering break point is also abandoned and won't get any more updates.

Then I gotta have this notification on the top right that pops up every 2 minutes that says ""You're offline"", and ""You're online and can play with friends"" because I got shitty spotty internet.
Then I get more pop ups on the left middle telling to watch a cut scene mid firefight that never goes away.

Then of course there's the unlimited Unilad 5 star enemy system. You think after killing hundreds enemies, helicopters, and APCs they'd give up seeing how this is a small region of Bolivia. If I wanted to do this I'd open up GTA. There's also no load last checkpoint or saves so if you're a perfectionist like me and want to redo a stealth mission you can't. Probably something to do with this online coop feature. So instead you have to kill yourself twice. Because there's never enough enemies to kill all 3 of your teammates, they'll just pick you up after you get downed.

There's also 5 skill branches, one of them being Drones. So you can go 8 hours putting all your skill points into the Drone branch instead of the other 4 and find out that enemies have jamming areas. Making those 50 skill points useless.

I'd give this a thumbs up but that notification system plus the game play features I don't like really bugs the shit out of me. Because this is indeed a good game.

If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead, murdered by my brother-in-law Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, Hank came to me with a rather, shocking proposition. He asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using his connections in the drug world. Connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded, I... I always thought that Hank was a very moral man and I was... thrown, confused, but I was also particularly vulnerable at the time, something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me on a ride along, and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin so I agreed. Every day, I think back at that moment with regret. I quickly realized that I was in way over my head, and Hank had a partner, a man named Gustavo Fring, a businessman. Hank essentially sold me into servitude to this man, and when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn. Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling out. From what I can gather, Hank was always pushing for a greater share of the business, to which Fring flatly refused to give him, and things escalated. Fring was able to arrange, uh I guess I guess you call it a ""hit"" on my brother-in-law, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured, and I wound up paying his medical bills which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge, working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring, and did so. In fact, the bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen in the ranks to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA, and about that time, to keep me in line, he took my children from me. For 3 months he kept them. My wife, who up until that point, had no idea of my criminal activities, was horrified to learn what I had done, why Hank had taken our children. We were scared. I was in Hell, I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, to end this nightmare, and in response, he gave me this. I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. I... All I could think to do was to make this video in hope that the world will finally see this man, for what he really is.",1690839918,1690839918,True,9,10,0.531155824661254883,0,True,False,False

The game is probably pretty good. It looks good based on the videos I've seen on Youtube. I wanted to try it bad enough that I purchased it since it's currently 80% off. Well, I did and couldn't play the game even once because Ubisoft is perhaps the single worst developer in the entire gaming industry. The whole issue stems from the fact that you have to use Ubisoft Connect. I tried to log in using my existing credentials. It said my password was incorrect, so I tried to reset it. Then it said that my login wasn't recognized. I tried creating a new Ubisoft account. After I did, I tried to login using that new account. It said that the email I used did not exist. Eventually, it took my login and you'd think I got to play, right? Wrong! I finally got logged into Ubisoft Connect and guess what??? UBISOFT CONNECT WOULDN'T WORK!!!! It said that it couldn't go online at this time. That's an issue... you know.... BECAUSE YOU CAN'T PLAY THE GAME WITHOUT UBISOFT CONNECT BEING ONLINE. So here I am, in the middle of a return request with Steam because the game isn't playable. What makes it worse is that the lack of playability has nothing to do with the game itself, but because the required software it takes to run it does not work. If you want to play this game, buy it on console. If you do not have a console, then buy one so that you can play it on console. Ubisoft is utter garbage, doesn't care about the consumer, and screws you out of your money when buying their games on PC. Such a waste of time. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME ON PC. If Steam cares about the integrity of their game store, they will remove all Ubisoft games from their library.",1690493224,1690493224,False,1,1,0.473509907722473145,0,True,False,False

I bear not just the weight of my father's care on my back, but also the heavy memories of games that have promised so much, only to deliver so little. Here's my take on GRW, sprinkled with humor and a bit of furry drama. ð®ðº

You know, growing up with the Tom Clancy series was akin to navigating a labyrinthine ice mazeâ thrilling, yet often perplexing. While the universe was distinct from my gaming comfort zone, the tactical military simulations always held a strange allure for me. Kinda reminiscent of Flashpoint's popularity; my pal Shilka swears by it! But enough of the past. Letâs focus on the icy present.

GRW promised the ultimate military tactical experience, but instead, what we got was a game plagued by server issues, especially during the alluring summer sales. You think you'll dive into an exciting co-op mission? Think again! The glitchy servers ensure you remain stranded in the virtual abyss, unable to play with your buddies. Ubisoft, you done goofed up! When one of my pack finally gets in, another gets kicked out, forever trapped in the âCannot connect to Ubisoft serversâ error message. It's frustrating as a howling wolf on a silent night! ððº

The predatory MTX lootbox model is yet another bane of GRW. Picture this: youâre gearing up for a mission, and BAM!âyouâre reminded of a sleazy microtransaction. The corporate greed here is colder than my icy homeland. Itâs saddening to see a game that could've soared high like a hawk, fall flat like a penguin on slippery ice. ð§âï¸

Yet, it's not all frost and gloom. My crew and I, in our prime, had quite a blast looting, sneaking into bases, and letting our guns roar. But then came the dreaded July 2018 update, locking away our hard-earned weapons and attachments. You can hear the distant laughter of the devs, âWant your weapons back? Pay up!â #UbisoftPls #ColdHardCashGrab

But letâs roll back a bit. Remember the raw, unparalleled joy of playing the original Ghost Recon? Those were the days! The excitement of GRW, with its vast Bolivian landscape and sandbox gameplay, was reminiscent of the classic experience, but modern-day issues like unresponsive AIs and the overt lack of tactical elements left me frost-bitten.

In conclusion, while Tom Clancy's Ghost ReconÂ® Wildlands is a vast snowy field with patches of warmth, the cold winds of corporate greed and server glitches overshadow its radiant sun. As an Ice Wolf who has seen his fair share of challenges, I'd say wait until Ubisoft gets its act together. Until then, game on, and may your adventures be as epic as the tales of old! ð®ðºâï¸

Stay frosty, fellow gamers! ð®ðºâï¸#SnowpawOut",1690418211,1690418211,False,2,0,0.374296367168426514,0,True,False,False

When it rarely does start after about 5 minutes of launching, the game plays smoothly. I wish i knew how to resolve this issue. Tried troubleshooting on my own with the help of online forums, after i lost hope on Ubisoft tech support team, and i still couldn't get it fixed. PS: Hardware on my machine is sufficient to play this game on Ultra/high settings. I had to uninstall the game after a week of trying. 
I must have played for about a hour so, but the recorded time on steam is 9.5 hours owing to all those hours of waiting for the game to start after launching, which makes me ineligible for the refund. 
Steam support was total disappointment. As for Ubisoft support, my complaint is awaiting response from one of the Ubisoft support techs since 16 days as of today.

The Game is an absolute Banger though. Such a beautiful environment Ubisoft devs have constructed for the player to experience and enjoy. Go for it. I am just ranting because i am disappointed with the kind of support Ubisoft and Steam provided for my issue.

Edit1 - I bought the game again from Epic and it works great. No crashes. 
Steam and Ubisoft integration have few things they need to look into, before all the gamers start flocking on to a stable launcher.
Edit2 - I re-installed it from Steam. The game takes about 10 minutes to load after the splash screen appears, but it seems to launch everytime, unlike before where it used to crash 8/10 times. Nevertheless, its some kind of improvement as i can play, at the least. My guess was there is something wrong with the ""Easy anti-cheat"" as i saw Battleeye in the list of apps which can communicate through firewall, so, I manually added EAC in the list. 
I dont need the refund from steam anymore and I am going to take it off from Epic store for now. But i am still extremely unhappy with kinda support steam/ubisoft offered though.",1689704112,1690205565,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Overall Rating: âââââ (4/5 stars)

Gameplay: âââââ (5/5 stars)
Ghost Recon Wildlands delivers a compelling gameplay experience that combines tactical shooting with open-world exploration. The freedom to approach missions in various ways adds a dynamic element to the gameplay, allowing players to experiment with different strategies. The vast array of weapons and gear, along with customizable characters, cater to diverse playstyles. While the AI can be inconsistent at times, overall, the gameplay remains engaging and enjoyable.

Graphics: âââââ (5/5 stars)
The visuals in Ghost Recon Wildlands are nothing short of breathtaking. Ubisoft Paris has crafted a stunning open-world environment in the lush landscapes of Bolivia. From dense forests to arid deserts, each region is meticulously designed, creating a realistic and immersive world. The attention to detail, day-night cycle, and dynamic weather contribute to the game's stunning graphics, making exploration an awe-inspiring experience.

Sound: âââââ (4/5 stars)
The sound design in Ghost Recon Wildlands is well-executed, enhancing the overall immersion of the game. The ambient sounds of the environment, gunfire, and explosions create a realistic atmosphere during missions. The voice acting for main characters is commendable, though some supporting NPCs may lack depth. The soundtrack complements the gameplay, adding to the intensity of combat and moments of suspense.

Story and Narrative: âââââ (4/5 stars)
While the premise of dismantling the Santa Blanca drug cartel sets the stage for an intriguing storyline, Ghost Recon Wildlands falls short in its narrative execution. The plot can feel somewhat predictable and fails to fully engage players emotionally. The character development lacks depth, making it difficult to form strong connections with the protagonists. Despite its potential, the story doesn't reach the same heights as previous entries in the Ghost Recon series.

Multiplayer: âââââ (4/5 stars)
The cooperative multiplayer mode is where Ghost Recon Wildlands truly shines. Joining forces with friends to tackle missions and take down targets offers a more enjoyable experience compared to playing solo. The seamless transition between single-player and multiplayer modes ensures a smooth and immersive experience. However, the absence of competitive multiplayer options might disappoint players seeking PvP gameplay.

DLCs: âââââ (3/5 stars)
Ghost Recon Wildlands' DLCs, ""Narco Road"" and ""Fallen Ghosts,"" add exciting content to the game, including new missions, weapons, and storylines. ""Narco Road"" introduces thrilling undercover missions within the Santa Blanca cartel, focusing on daring vehicle-based gameplay. ""Fallen Ghosts"" ups the challenge with tougher enemy factions and intense survival gameplay. While some DLCs lack impact and suffer from occasional technical issues, overall, they enhance the game's lifespan and offer additional value to fans seeking more adventures in Bolivia.

Bugs and Updates: âââââ (3/5 stars)
Ghost Recon Wildlands had its fair share of bugs and technical issues upon release. While Ubisoft Paris addressed many of the early concerns through patches and updates, some issues persisted. The occasional AI glitches and mission bugs could disrupt the gameplay experience. However, the development team's commitment to providing updates and addressing player feedback deserves recognition.

Conclusion: 
Ghost Recon Wildlands successfully blends tactical gameplay with an expansive open-world, offering players the freedom to chart their paths in a visually stunning environment. With solid gameplay mechanics, cooperative multiplayer, and outstanding graphics, it provides hours of enjoyable gameplay. While the story could have been more compelling and certain technical issues lingered, the overall experience remains engaging and satisfying. Whether you're a fan of the series or a newcomer, Ghost Recon Wildlands is a thrilling adventure worth undertaking. if you come here after playing Breakpoint then this is a much better option.",1508580707,1690202546,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

There are plenty of side quests and locations to keep you engaged.

The gameplay is what truly sets this apart from other 3rd person shooters, in that there are tons of ways to take on enemies or explore the terrain.

TL;DR: Mediocre AI, driving, performance

Pros:
-I like the concept
-Playing barbie doll with your elite soldier
-Replayability with weekly challenges

Cons:
-Civilians won't react to cartel members being assassinated before their very poor AI eyes
-Driving is really not natural and  arcade-like, lots of bugs where you can clip into the ground and die
-Micro transactions on release day
-CPU demand is out of this world! (for the time). This lead to freezes, frame drops and crashes on older PCs that could run other AAA games at the time. I had a  i5-3570k with a 970strix at the time of the launch
-Some missions, like defending AI during a car chase is quite infuriating

A problem I really dislike in Ubisoft games now is that you can't kill civilians, now I know you're thinking I'm a homicidal maniac, but no, I am not. I'm fine when the AI is like, ""You dumbass, that was an average Joe,"" But it takes too much as a crime that It auto-game-overs you after 3 civs are dead. I hate the fact that the developers are forcing us to play the game ""Their Way"". Last time I checked, I thought players could have free roam within the game. There are a lot of problems with the gameplay, such as when sprawling on the floor you tend to get stuck on little rocks and are unable to move when your vehicle explodes and you're in it, it spawns you under the car and no one can revive you.

Ghost Recon Wildlands delivers an open-world experience that combines tactical challenges and intense firefights. Set in a dramatic rendition of Bolivia, the game captures players with its breathtaking landscapes and attention to detail. 

The game's standout feature lies in its tactical gameplay mechanics. As a member of a special forces squad, you have the freedom to approach missions with a range of strategies. Whether executing a methodical infiltration and recon, coordinating synchronized takedowns with teammates, or opting for explosive assaults (that will probably end up killing you if you aren't prepared, but eh, the respawn is quick enough that it's viable with a squad of 4 players), the choice is yours. The extensive selection of weapons, gadgets, and vehicles adds depth to the tactical experience, enabling adaptability in various scenarios. Being able to swap tools on the fly and order vehicles through the resistance Just Cause style helps keep the gameplay moving since you can change play styles whenever you get bored of stealth or action.

Ghost Recon Wildlands truly shines in cooperative play, being able to join forces with up to three friends seamlessly, transitioning between single-player and cooperative sessions without any loading on the host's part. The game allows the player to plan assaults with their team before they step anywhere near the enemy and allow a greater strategic depth than similar co-op shooters like Sniper Elite or Far Cry.

While the story may not delve into deep narrative complexities and is at times very blunt, the game and its strategic cooperative gameplay make it a must-play for fans of tactical shooter. Although I like it, I cannot in good faith recommend purchasing it at the current price of $50. However, the game very regularly goes on sales to $10 and I would recommend picking it up then.",1689389160,1689550128,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

Genuinely don't recommend it.
The only reason I'm doing it is because of my hyper perseverance and self-hatred.
Also, playing without teammates.

The gameplay itself is fine, fun even occasionally. Shooting feels good, but trees and bushes are wildly inconsistent with their ability to block bullets or let them through. You aren't always going to be able to tell what trees actually have collision or not until you run through them or shoot a bullet into it.
Controlling vehicles feels wonky but workable. However, it does become infuriating when you land fine on a bike going downhill and die for no reason. Vehicles get INCREDIBLY fast, and while traveling on the higher mountain-side roads, you may very well fly right off the side if you aren't careful.
The narration is incredibly meh. The characters go back and forth on medals from ""hey these cartel medals are kinda cool"" to ""man this medal looks like shit lol"", and a lot of the conversations feel incredibly xenophobic.

Ghost mode is where I say meh.
Ghost mode says it makes a realistic experience. This includes permadeath, reloading drops any ammo left in a magazine, and you are limited to 2 weapon slots (primary and secondary). 
Personally I feel that it should have just been another game difficulty, instead of a whole new mode, however I find the most annoying part to be it deleting your save. This may be a me problem, as being booted back to the main menu with a message saying ""your save file ded xd"" is fine the first time, but after the 2nd and 3rd time it just became aggrivating. Yes game, I realized I died and my save is gone because of that. Couldn't have guessed. This is especially aggrevating when you die in a way you feel you shouldn't have. Like a unidad patrol randomly deciding to come into this random area you're clearing out, then mainly fight you instead of the cartel also firing at them. And if you want to get rid of the unidad, you better hope you get them all in one go, or else they will pretty much constantly call in more reinforcements, leading you to HAVE to retreat or even leave the area entirely. 

Remember, I'm playing without teammates, so I only have myself to rely upon. When you play with teammates, you can get revived, have covering fire, and faces to look at so you don't go insane killing and dying. But the revive part is important. if you play without teammates in ghost mode, you die instantly if you go down. There's no skill I could see which allows you to revive yourself, nor do I know if rebels can revive you if you call them in, but this DRASTICALLY increases the difficulty of ghost mode even higher. 
Did you slightly miscalculate that fall? Well, your 8 hour run is now over :). Did you just accidentally stare at your enemies as they shot you because you didn't know you can only pull out weapons from holster with 1 2 or H? (you cannot press m1 or m2 to bring out weapons)

The last thing to gripe about is the linearity of the story and missions. You can go ANYWHERE on the map from the beginning. And if you do, you can explore a LOT of different cities and ruins and shanty towns. But you won't find ANYTHING unless you get the yummy yellow files. 
Example, there's a prisoner you can save from a chapel. However, if you come here BEFORE picking up the note that TELLS YOU there is a prisoner there for you to save, they will not spawn there.
If you find a unidad base and clear it out, loot it, then leave the area, find a yellow file that tells you there's an objective there, you will have to fight through THE ENTIRE BASE AGAIN. 

It's halfway between a yes and a no, but I'm bitter so I'm putting it at no.",1689240920,1689240920,False,0,1,0.47413790225982666,0,True,False,False

There are pro's and con's but man do the cons just suck sometimes a little too much. Overall I'm cheap when it comes to games for fear i'll waste the money. A fear of ""well what if i buy the game and don't like it"" sorta situation. As of now i don't feel the game was bad, but i doubt i'll put more time into it. 


PROS
- I bought the game for 10$ so I can't really complain about the enjoyment i got out of it. I had a lot of fun trying a different FPS out. A simple youtube search for a FPS with high weapon customization (I don't like the idea of Tarkov's gameplay, and I despise battle royals honestly) and this game came up. This game is my style in some form, reminds me of far cry but in a different way.


CONS
- The AI is just ridiculous sometimes. Hiding is impossible so don't try it, just run endlessly to get away. But by far the worst part of the game and AI. Is if you ever become hunted or a threat according to the minimap that shows like your stealth status. They will always 100% know, where you're at no matter where you're hiding. Missed a shot by a couple inches from 400 yards away on a cliff side hiding in between bushes in a rock crevice. Too bad, they know exactly where your shot came from and will aggro to include shooting pinpoint mortars on you. Forcing you to relocate. Sniped someone from the same location and someone witnesses the kill, same ordeal. 
Here's a different scenario that's even more far fetched. Place a C4 somewhere and go hide or camp on the otherside of a compound. In a tower. Wherever you like, once you activate the C4 and they AI start to hunt for you, they already know your last known location at the time of being hunted. So you're hiding in the tower, aggro into hunted from an explosion, they already know you're in the tower. So you gotta relocate from there even though theres no way they even knew you were there. 
- A somewhat different con but maybe i should say each to their own. This game has a definite style that you should play to play the game so to speak. And that's stealth. I played on extreme difficulty because I wanted a tad of realism and not feel like a bullet sponge while 1 tapping other enemies. But i feel like you cant play it any other way. If you try to take them all on you'll quickly die. There were multiple times i was stealth-ing through and got caught so i attempted to fight my way to a win. But died every time i think. There was even a case that a pinged enemy was running towards me, i knew i had the advantage because i would see him coming before turning the corner. And In a magical buggy way, he turned the corner. appeared further than where he stopped,and shot me instantly before i could possible even think about shooting back. And I knew he was coming! 
- I think lastly, driving controls are atrocious. I'm mouse and keyboard and i understand the issue that a keyboard is not analog input. But man everything sucks. Even if you just baby tap cars it still wants to fling left and right. You can adjust the camera so you cant hardly see anything. You have to constantly adjust the camera with your mouse instead. Flying controls are equally bad. The helicopter has an updated new controls that are easier for sure than what the classic controls. But still, with the mouse controls it feels impossible to control the gun. Yes you can adjust the sensitivity but it felt useless. Even on low sensitivity the helicopter would swing past further than where intended. Crank up the mouse sensitivity. And it's the same problem, just faster. 

Overall, do i recommend the game? Yes, I cant say I'm upset or anything. Whenever the cons would come up I would just think about them every time, and would just put it in the back of my mind, its the wildpoint gameplay. I would just do things differently if i had the choice to change things in game.",1689175887,1689175887,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

has decent looking graphics(not the greatest for its time). This game has a vast terrain with different environments all over the map since the it is 576 kmÂ². And now for the best part, THE STEALTH. The fact they have so many features that helps you have a quality experience( drone, thermal vision, night vision, active camo, stealth takedowns, synced takedowns) and playing this game in co op only makes the experience so much better. now i have to say the story was a bit of a let down since the game had an RPG style story, and it wasnt too immersive. although it wasnt too terrible. easy anti cheat and denuvo are completely unnecessary but were still added since ubisoft had way too much hopes for this game.

BUT the open world gameplay is terrible. The design itself is pretty good as it feels lively and each region feels different. However, the open world suffers from the same problem that AC: Odyssey has: Despite having unique regions, it's too big for its own good and you'll be spending a good chunk of your playtime just traversing the map to get important collectables for unlocks and upgrades.

If you can get past the terrible open world gameplay, I definitely recommend this game.

From the moment I started playing, I was hooked on its gripping storyline, vast landscapes, and thrilling gameplay. As a fan of the Ghost Recon franchise, Wildlands exceeded my expectations and solidified its place as one of the best games in the series.

The first thing that struck me was the game's breathtaking open-world environment. The fictionalized version of Bolivia is stunningly realized, with diverse landscapes ranging from dense jungles and towering mountains to sprawling salt flats and bustling cities. The attention to detail is exceptional, and the sheer scale of the world is awe-inspiring.

The gameplay mechanics are polished and offer players a wide range of options to tackle missions and objectives. The freedom of choice is one of the game's strongest aspects. You can approach missions stealthily, gathering intel and taking down enemies covertly, or go in guns blazing, causing chaos and explosions. The variety of weapons, equipment, and vehicles at your disposal is extensive, allowing for strategic planning and execution.

One of the highlights of Ghost Recon Wildlands is the seamless co-op experience. Playing with friends or joining a team online adds a new layer of excitement to the game. Coordinating tactics, executing synchronized takedowns, and working together to accomplish missions is incredibly satisfying. The teamwork required brings out the best of the tactical gameplay that the series is known for.

The story campaign is engaging and keeps you invested throughout your journey. Taking down the vicious drug cartel, Santa Blanca, feels like a monumental task, and each mission contributes to the overarching narrative. The game's writing and voice acting are top-notch, immersing you in a gritty world filled with interesting characters and high-stakes situations.

Moreover, the developers have consistently supported Ghost Recon Wildlands with updates, patches, and new content, ensuring a rich and evolving experience for players. The addition of the Ghost War PvP mode further extends the game's longevity, offering intense multiplayer matches that put your skills to the test against other players.

Lastly, the technical performance on Steam is excellent. The game runs smoothly, and the graphics are visually stunning, showcasing the beauty of the environment and the detailed character models.

In conclusion, Ghost Recon Wildlands is a masterpiece of tactical open-world gaming. With its captivating storyline, vast and immersive world, engaging gameplay, and robust co-op experience, it stands as a shining example of what a tactical shooter can achieve. If you're a fan of the genre or simply looking for an unforgettable gaming experience, I wholeheartedly recommend Ghost Recon Wildlands on Steam.",1688714808,1688714808,True,1,0,0.522293031215667725,0,True,False,False

This game claims to be all about tactical warfare, but it feels more like a snooze-fest on steroids.

First things first, the storyline is about as captivating as a limp lettuce leaf. I mean, seriously, who came up with this generic, cookie-cutter plot? It's like they threw in every clichÃ© they could find and hoped for the best. Yawn.

And don't even get me started on the characters. They're about as memorable as that guy you met once at a party and forgot about immediately. The voice acting is so cringe-worthy that it made me want to stab my eardrums with a rusty spoon. Bravo, developers!

Now, let's talk about the gameplay. Sure, you can roam around this vast open world, but what's the point? The missions are repetitive as hell, and the AI is dumber than a bag of rocks. I've seen more intelligent behavior from a pigeon. It's like the developers took ""tactical"" and replaced it with ""tacti-dull.""

Oh, and the graphics? Mediocre at best. The environment looks like it was designed by an intern with a limited budget and a bad taste in colors. There's no wow factor here, folks. Just a whole lot of meh.

But hey, if you're into mind-numbingly dull gameplay, a forgettable story, and characters that you couldn't care less about, then go ahead and waste your hard-earned cash on this snooze fest. Personally, I'd rather watch paint dry or count the tiles on my bathroom floor. At least that would be more entertaining than Ghost Recon Wildlands.

One of the most impressive aspects of this game is its breathtaking open-world setting.  From lush jungles and towering mountains to bustling cities and desolate deserts, every corner of the map is meticulously crafted. The attention to detail is simply outstanding, making exploration a joyous and visually stunning experience. I love how I can join forces with friends in the seamless cooperative multiplayer mode. 

Moreover, the narrative in Ghost ReconÂ® Wildlands is gripping and keeps you engaged throughout the game. As a Ghost, you're tasked with dismantling the Santa Blanca drug cartel, a formidable and ruthless organization. The story is well-written and filled with intriguing twists and turns, offering a compelling backdrop for the adrenaline-fueled missions.
 
It is a remarkable game that deserves high praise. Its vast open world, engaging gameplay, and thrilling narrative make for an unforgettable experience. Whether you're a fan of the tactical shooter genre or simply enjoy immersive open-world adventures, this game will captivate you from the first moment and keep you hooked until the very end.",1688396786,1688396786,True,1,1,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

This is one of the 3 stealth games I've played and actually enjoyed (the other 2 being MGSV and Deathloop). The gameplay is pretty good and the game is fucking beautiful, seriously one of the most beautiful games I've ever played. However the game defiantly suffers a few problems, The biggest problem is Unidad, they might be the most annoying enemy's I have ever played against in a video game, they kill you so quickly. they have a massive amount of health, AND the infinity respawn until you escape them, it goes from challenging to tedious very quickly. And holy shit there are a couple of dogshit missions in this game. One of them you have to sneak into a Unidad base (shockingly the terrible mission has Unidad in it) and kill some guy. However it is literally impossible to normally sneak into the base because there are rebels fighting Unidad at every entrance, it was a clusterfuck to complete. But fuck me it wasn't the worst mission. The mission where you help Sam Fisher. Shockingly again you have to sneak into an Unidad base, this time without killing anyone, which is already really fucking annoying. But then you have to defend Sam (who is supposed to be an incredibly skilled soldier) whilst he hacks a fucking laptop for 5 mins. But here's the very fun part, Unidad soldiers infinity spawn right fucking on top of you constantly, including fucking attack helicopters which will insta-kill you if you are hit by it's rockets, all while the super soldier Sam Fisher sits there with his dick in his hand hacking a fucking laptop. It is 100% the most annoying mission I have ever played in a video game and I didn't complete it, hell I barley even made it to the 2 min mark. But aside from Unidad and a few missions (please don't do the Sam Fisher mission) the game is overall very fun. The side missions get repetitive pretty quickly so I just didn't do any of them, and the story was fine. Even though the game has a few of the worst missions in gaming history (which you technically don't even have to do) I'd still say it was very fun. However not fun enough to make me want to play Breakpoint.

Starting off, Wildlands offers you to be able to do missions whenever you want, in whichever order you'd like. There is a lot to discover and it is fairly easy to find new weapons, attachments or skill points. This all through a beautiful landscape and map.

Next, customization in this game is fairly nice, since there is a lot of clothes, accessories and whatever else to choose from, so you can easily adjust your character to whichever environment that you'd like.

Lastly, the game allows you to have three friends to play along with you, though same goes for Breakpoint as well, this really allows you to communicate and plan tactics with your friends. Talking about tactics, stealth in both Wildlands and Breakpoint are both a nice way to get through the game.

Though able to get achievement based and spec-ops crates, though to get them is challenging and the challenges to earn credits are sometimes neigh impossible unless a serious player.

The setting (Bolivia) is fantastically rendered and flying around I have really enjoyed the variety of terrain.  The story is good, the main baddie is like Colonel Kurtz meets Rutger Hauer in Sin City. I love my AI compadres speaking bad spanish to peasants in the field...reminds me of Team America (""don't worry...everything is bon"").  They butcher Spanish like Brad Pitt butchers Italian in Inglorious Basterds. 

I am down to tier 35 so locked on extreme mode which means death if detected.  It's fine.  If I don't want this mode I'll switch down to regular. I haven't played with any humans, but the AI team seems to do the job of reiving me and killing bad guys so no real complaints.  

I think this has the edge of Just Cause/Farcry because it is a little less cartoony.  It is pretty grindy and getting the same banter triggered every time you go over a spot is irritating (I must have had that legal coca bants 20 times when flying backwards and forwards).  Unidad is a suitable deterrant from doing an Arnie and going in all guns blazing...I spend more time running away than fighting.

Almost every mission, apart from the really main story ones, usually consist of, in one form or another, of either invading a base, or trying to collect intel from someone, and with little to no variety it gets a bit boring at times. I played the game predominantly in co-op (forgot to mention you can do that), which did make it a bit more interesting, but if you plan to play solo throughout, just know that there will be a lot of travelling from one place to another in between missions.

The matchmaking servers fail to connect most of the time but sometimes they do if you're lucky. This will likely be a constant problem from now on as there were reports of server problems last year too. They were slow in the past but now won't connect.

A solid game with 4 player coop. Has a massive map, a lot of content with a bit of variation but you end up doing the same things over and over. It's a long grind to pick up all the weapons, attachments, skill points, and medals; which are spread out on the map. Tier One mode unlocks after you level up and gives supplies bonuses but forces you to play on the hardest difficulty.

Unfortunately the game suffers from a lot of Quality of Life (QOL) issues. You will spend most of your time down waiting for a revive, or repeating missions over and over because the target died or someone got detected. You will be stuck staring at a loading screen every time you die, fail a mission, or fast travel. Even with an NVMe SSD the load times are long. You can shoot while riding as a passenger on cars and helicopters but it is very difficult to aim as your aim moves with the vehicle. Vehicles also have low health and don't last long, even the APC. Calling for a vehicle delivery will often spawn it far from the group in dumb places which is infuriating as you will be using it all the time.

This is one of those games like GTA 5 which is overall a fun game but very frustrating at the same time due to all the issues. With server problems it's hard to play in coop which is what this game was built for. Hard to recommend unless it's 10 dollars and there's nothing better to play.

The gunplay is ok, but everything else sucks balls for a game released in 2017. 
A major problem is just how ugly the game is running at the highest graphics settings. I am honestly surprised at how bad the graphics are. The game is, and I am not lying, more ugly than the first Crysis game. I am shocked. I am shocked that you can create such ugly games in the late 2010s. 

So, to boil it down, all aspects apart from the shooting are awful in this game. Everything. Every-fucking-thing. There is no enjoyment to be had. And I decided to quit before being sucked in.

You can have several main quests available at once. Say one of these requires you to do a task without raising an alarm. 
Say now you are in a rare armed helicpoter, and you find an enemy convoy that has some resources you would like. So you attack the convoy. The convoy tries to escape, and by chance drives right next to the main quest. The action from the convoy triggeres the alarm, and giving you a mission failed. 

The mission failed requires a reset of the area for you to try again, to it resets the player and the area around, spawning the player on the ground, without the vehicle the player was in, and with the convoy gone. Erasing all the progress you just did. 

Or a main quest requires you to kill somebody who is running around on the world map. If you stumble upon him, and he escapes, is it mission failed, and the game resets. 


This exact scenario has happened to me, several times. So. Fun game mechanics, aboslutely atrocious game design.

Wildlands excels in providing players with a deep and tactical gameplay experience. As a member of an elite Ghost Recon team, players are tasked with dismantling the Santa Blanca drug cartel. The game offers a wide range of tactical options, including stealth, long-range sniping, and coordinated team assaults, allowing players to approach missions in their preferred playstyle.

The open-world nature of Wildlands adds a layer of freedom and exploration rarely seen in tactical shooters. Players can navigate the massive and diverse Bolivian landscape on foot, by vehicle, or even by air, uncovering hidden objectives, gathering intel, and engaging in dynamic encounters. The game's attention to detail, including realistic ballistics, weapon customization, and equipment choices, further enhances the tactical depth and authenticity of the gameplay.

Cooperative Multiplayer:
Wildlands shines when played cooperatively with friends. The game supports seamless drop-in, drop-out multiplayer, allowing players to collaborate and tackle missions together. The cooperative gameplay mechanics, such as synchronized takedowns and coordinated squad maneuvers, make for thrilling and rewarding teamwork experiences. Whether it's infiltrating enemy compounds, coordinating synchronized shots, or executing complex strategies, Wildlands offers a dynamic and engaging cooperative multiplayer mode that greatly enhances the game's replayability and enjoyment.

Open-World Environment:
The expansive and detailed open-world environment of Wildlands is a standout feature. The Bolivian landscape is breathtakingly recreated, featuring a diverse range of biomes, from dense jungles to arid deserts and snowy mountains. The world feels alive, with civilian and cartel activities occurring dynamically, providing opportunities for emergent gameplay moments. The attention to detail in the environment design, combined with the day-night cycle, dynamic weather, and realistic lighting, adds to the immersion and authenticity of the game world.

Narrative and Character Development:
While Wildlands' narrative may not be the main focus, it successfully sets the stage for the player's mission in Bolivia. The game's story unfolds through mission briefings, cutscenes, and character interactions. While the plot may not offer groundbreaking storytelling, the character development within the Ghost Recon team adds depth and emotional investment to the experience. Each member of the team has a distinct personality and backstory, creating a sense of camaraderie and attachment as players progress through the game.

Visuals and Audio:
Wildlands boasts impressive visuals, with stunning landscapes, detailed character models, and realistic animations. The game's attention to environmental details, such as flora and fauna, further adds to the immersion. The audio design, including weapon sounds, environmental ambiance, and voice acting, is top-notch and contributes to the overall realism and atmosphere of the game.

Conclusion:
Tom Clancy's Ghost ReconÂ® Wildlands offers a compelling and immersive tactical adventure set in a vast open-world environment. With its deep tactical gameplay, cooperative multiplayer, and attention to detail, the game provides an engaging experience for fans of the tactical shooter genre. While the narrative may not be the game's strongest aspect, the expansive world, realistic mechanics, and cooperative play make Wildlands a standout entry in the Ghost Recon series.",1643325799,1686082866,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Developed by Ubisoft Paris and released in 2017, it offers an immersive experience filled with intense firefights, stealth missions, and breathtaking landscapes. As a fan of the Ghost Recon series, I found this installment to be a compelling addition to the franchise, although not without a few minor drawbacks.

One of the standout features of Ghost Recon Wildlands is its massive open world. Bolivia is beautifully rendered, offering diverse environments ranging from lush jungles to arid deserts, towering mountains to sprawling urban areas. The attention to detail is commendable, creating an atmosphere that feels alive and authentic. Exploring the vast landscape, players can choose to tackle missions in any order they please, providing a sense of freedom and agency rarely seen in similar games.

The gameplay in Wildlands strikes a perfect balance between tactical strategy and exhilarating combat. Players assume the role of a member of the elite Ghost Recon team, tasked with taking down a powerful drug cartel. Whether playing solo or in cooperative multiplayer with friends, the game offers a wide array of tools, weapons, and vehicles to accomplish missions in your own style. The tactical aspect is enhanced by the ability to mark enemies, coordinate synchronized shots with teammates, and execute carefully planned infiltration strategies.

In terms of visuals and audio design, Ghost Recon Wildlands delivers a high-quality experience. The attention to detail in the character models, weapon animations, and environmental effects is impressive. The sound design effectively captures the chaos of combat, and the dynamic day-night cycle and weather system contribute to the immersion. However, occasional visual glitches and repetitive character animations can momentarily detract from an otherwise polished presentation.

While the game's strengths lie in its cooperative multiplayer experience, the single-player campaign offers a solid and enjoyable experience as well. The AI teammates are competent and can be given simple commands, making solo play a viable option. However, their behavior can be predictable at times, and a deeper level of squad customization would have been a welcome addition.

One area where Ghost Recon Wildlands falls short is the narrative. Although the premise of taking down a drug cartel is intriguing, the story lacks depth and fails to develop memorable characters or a compelling plot. The game's focus is more on the gameplay and exploration, but a stronger narrative would have added an extra layer of immersion and motivation.

In conclusion, Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Wildlands offers an exhilarating and vast open-world experience that fans of tactical shooters will thoroughly enjoy.

With its expansive open-world setting, diverse mission structure, and intense cooperative gameplay, Wildlands offers an immersive experience that is both exhilarating and satisfying.

One of the standout features of Ghost Recon Wildlands is its vast and visually stunning open-world environment. From dense jungles to arid deserts, the game's recreation of Bolivia is breathtakingly detailed. The varied terrain provides players with a multitude of strategic options, allowing for diverse approaches to each mission. Whether you choose to engage enemies from a distance with a sniper rifle or engage in close-quarters combat, the game offers a great deal of freedom in how you tackle each objective.

The gameplay mechanics in Wildlands are well-crafted, providing a satisfying blend of tactical planning and intense action. As the leader of an elite Special Forces team, you are tasked with taking down a powerful drug cartel. The game encourages players to carefully plan their missions, coordinating with teammates and utilizing a wide array of weapons, gadgets, and vehicles. The cooperative aspect is particularly impressive, as playing with friends adds a whole new layer of excitement and strategic possibilities.

In terms of mission variety, Ghost Recon Wildlands shines. Each mission feels distinct and presents its own set of challenges. Whether you're infiltrating enemy bases, rescuing hostages, or gathering intel, there is always a sense of urgency and tension. The dynamic nature of the game world further enhances the replayability, as enemy patrols and encounters can vary in each playthrough, ensuring that no mission feels exactly the same.

The game's narrative, while not groundbreaking, provides a solid backdrop for the action-packed gameplay. The story follows a team of Ghosts as they dismantle the Santa Blanca cartel and disrupt their operations. While the characters themselves are not particularly deep, their interactions and dialogue add a layer of camaraderie and personality to the game.

While Ghost Recon Wildlands offers an exceptional gameplay experience, it does have a few minor flaws. The AI of both friendly and enemy NPCs can occasionally be inconsistent, leading to moments of frustration or immersion-breaking situations. Additionally, some players might find the game's vast open world to be overwhelming, as the sheer size of the map can make navigation a bit cumbersome at times.

Overall, Ghost Recon Wildlands is an outstanding tactical shooter that delivers an exciting and immersive experience. With its stunning open world, engaging cooperative gameplay, and diverse mission structure, the game offers hours of thrilling entertainment for fans of the genre. Despite a few minor flaws, Wildlands succeeds in delivering a highly enjoyable experience that is well worth diving into.",1685664281,1685664281,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

The best way to describe [i]Wildlands[/i] is probably this: Itâs a typical modern Ubisoft game, with all the strengths and weaknesses that come attached with that. On the one hand, [i]Wildlands[/i] offers a vast open world with different environments, ranging from forests to deserts to mountains. Said open world, Bolivia in this case, is also filled to the brim with content, from story missions to side activities, which are cramming up your in-game map. And of course, there are lots and lots of ways to upgrade your character: level ups, skill trees, new weapons (& weapon parts for an in-game gunsmith) to find, rebel support upgrades, etc. â in short, [i]Wildlands[/i] gives you a lot of different opportunities to invest your time.

On the other hand, the sheer mass of content also means that the developers favor quantity over the quality of the individual activities. Many of the upgrades donât really matter â a gun I received earl in the game was better than any other gun I found throughout the rest of it. The novelty of infiltrating bases, killing high value targets or escorting them quickly wears off once you discover that [i]Wildlands[/i] basically reuses the same few mission structures throughout the entire game. And considering that even though the environments look different, many of the bases, camps and hideouts do not, all of your infiltrations or shootouts will quickly turn into a blur. Even though I spent 54h in the game to tackle all of the available story missions, I wonât be able to name even one location that stood out to me â in fact, the many, many locations you visit are so generic that I wouldnât be able to draw you a map of even one of them.

That said, especially in coop, the basic gameplay loop works solid enough that the generic locations wonât matter much at first. Itâs fun to use the variety of gadgets & approaches [i]Wildlands[/i] offers in order to accomplish objectives just the way you want. You could use a helicopter and a parachute to drop into an enemy base, barge in with a tank or sneak your way in by stealthily eliminating guards in your way. Especially the missions tasking you with killing a specific target allow for different tactics â sometimes a well-timed sniper shot from a nearby mountain is all it takes, sometimes a full-on assault with allied rebel NPCs might be a better choice.

[i]Wildlands[/i] offers two enemy factions, the Santa Blanca cartel and Unidad, which sort of work like the police in the [i]Grand Theft Auto[/i] franchise. Both factions got normal goons with guns as well as special types (snipers, armored enemies). Sometimes youâll also encounter enemy vehicles, like helicopters or tanks. However, as the enemy variety is pretty low and vehicles are only used in certain cases (e.g. enemy convoys), theyâre rarely more than simple gunfodder. If you want to infiltrate a base you might want to take of snipers first, but you wonât have to change your approach because of certain enemy types - disappointing. It would have been nice to make plans based on the enemies present, not just on the location alone.

Speaking about the variety in approaching objectives I previously praised, I also have to point it that this sadly doesnât last forever. Especially on higher difficulty (or the âTier Oneâ-mode available after reaching max level), [i]Wildlands[/i] becomes a much different game. Enemies can kill you almost immediately now and their locations arenât hinted at on the map anymore, which basically makes stealth approaches the only viable option if you want to complete missions. Considering [i]Wildlands[/i] is a tactical shooter after all, this isnât surprising, but Iâm still mentioning it for those who donât want to sneak around guards all the time.

My biggest gripe with the stealth approaches in [i]Wildlands[/i] concerns the enemy AI, which can ruin your well-planned approaches to a mission in more ways than you expect. Throughout most of the game, the AI is solid enough: enemies arenât particularly smart, but they do take cover when shoot at from afar and call for help if needed. What makes them so annoying in terms of stealth approaches, however, is their unpredictable spotting. Sometimes enemies are able to spot you through walls or other solid structures (the snipers in particular), sometimes they donât react to corpses of their friends but at other times they immediately sound the alarm instead. Theyâre also very good at âcoincidentallyâ heading directly to your location when searching for you: One time I had an entire truck of reinforcements spawn directly behind me even though it was only my coop partner they spotted. These AI issues can make stealth approaches quite frustrating, especially as mission checkpoints can be quite bad as well.

Anyway, even while stealth doesnât work as well as it should be, getting spotted is less frustrating when you got a coop partner to help you out: [i]Wildlands[/i] opens up a lot more if you got friends to play with. Especially on lower difficulty, you can simply go wild while approaching missions, which is a lot of fun. Maybe one of you is piloting a helicopter transporting another, who is using a sniper to take out a target from above. Or youâre participating in a great car chase, with one player driving while the other is trying to take down your pursuers. But even on higher difficulties itâs really entertaining to infiltrate a base with each player taking care of a different corner and I canât think of many games allowing for all these moments at once.

That said, while the generic locations and missions as well as the general repetitiveness of [i]Wildlands[/i] donât feel as bad if you play this game in coop and I highly recommend playing this game with friends, coop also comes with additional problems. These are mainly of the technical sort, like progress sometimes not being properly saved when finishing missions together. Especially the âSilent Spadeâ mission was bugged, with me receiving the rewards for finishing the mission together while my coop partner was stuck at an earlier checkpoint according to the game. Additionally, while the game ran fine once connected, we encountered many issues trying to join each otherâs lobby. This might be thanks to Ubisoft Connect, which is required if you want to play this game â online or not.

Lastly, letâs talk about the story of [i]Wildlands[/i]. The basic set-up of [i]Wildlands[/i] is basically to take down a big bad cartel boss, however, in order to approach him you have to take down a dozen of his underlings first. Of course, it shouldnât be surprising that the story of [i]Wildlands[/i] is quite cliched and doesnât feel very coherent, as you can tackle the story missions in any order you want. Considering you also donât encounter the big bad until the final mission, apart from a handful of previous voice lines, the big villain doesnât receive much characterization beyond âheâs evilâ. Frankly, the entire story set-up feels like itâs just window-dressing for the open world activities anyway, so donât expect it to be more than that.

Concluding, [i]Wildlands[/i] does offer a solid gameplay loop thatâs especially great when experienced with friends.

Rating: â­â­â­â­ (4/5)

Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Wildlands offers players an expansive and immersive open-world experience, combining tactical gameplay, cooperative multiplayer, and a vast and visually stunning environment. With its dynamic missions, strategic combat, and a wide range of customization options, Wildlands delivers a thrilling and memorable adventure for fans of the tactical shooter genre.

One of the standout features of Ghost Recon Wildlands is its massive open-world setting, fictional Bolivia. The game offers a diverse and breathtaking landscape, ranging from dense jungles and towering mountains to sprawling cities and salt flats. The attention to detail and realistic visuals create a believable and immersive environment that begs to be explored. The sheer scale of the world, combined with the freedom to approach missions in various ways, provides a sense of authenticity and adventure.

The tactical gameplay in Ghost Recon Wildlands is a true highlight. Players take on the role of elite Ghost soldiers, tasked with dismantling the Santa Blanca drug cartel. The game offers a wide range of tools and tactics to achieve objectives, including coordinated team maneuvers, stealthy approaches, and intense firefights. The ability to customize loadouts, unlock new skills, and gather intel adds depth and strategic choices to the gameplay, allowing players to tailor their playstyle and approach each mission with precision.

The cooperative multiplayer aspect of Ghost Recon Wildlands enhances the experience even further. Players can team up with friends to tackle missions and take on the cartel together. The seamless drop-in and drop-out multiplayer functionality allows for a seamless transition between solo play and cooperative action. The collaborative nature of the game encourages communication and coordination, creating memorable moments of teamwork and triumph.

The game's mission structure is dynamic and non-linear, providing players with freedom in how they approach their objectives. The open-world nature allows for exploration and discovery, with various side activities and collectibles scattered throughout the world. The inclusion of an AI squad, which can be controlled by the player or left to autonomous behavior, adds an additional layer of tactical options and support during missions.

However, Ghost Recon Wildlands does have a few shortcomings. The story and characters can feel somewhat generic and lacking in depth, which may not engage players on an emotional level. The AI behavior, both for allies and enemies, can sometimes be inconsistent or prone to occasional glitches. Additionally, while the open-world setting provides a sense of freedom, some areas of the map may feel underutilized or lacking in meaningful content.

In summary, Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Wildlands delivers an exciting and immersive open-world tactical adventure. The vast and visually stunning environment, combined with tactical gameplay and cooperative multiplayer, offers a thrilling and dynamic experience. Whether you prefer stealthy infiltration or intense firefights, Wildlands provides a wide range of strategic options to cater to different playstyles. While it may have a few minor flaws, the overall experience of Ghost Recon Wildlands is one of excitement, camaraderie, and strategic mastery, making it a worthy addition to the Ghost Recon series.",1685554722,1685554722,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

     Its alright I guess, good cookie cutter game but it REALLY needs some working on in terms of driving, flying, and MORE. All cars are basically 4x4 200% traction offroad machines. You can't turn your airplane's rudder ( no turning left or right ). Side ops need more purpose rather than just for helping you unlock skill perks that require food or oil. Marking EVERY SINGLE crate of supplies is sort of ridiculous. You basically have a lifetime supply of beacons. Although destroying headlights on a car, light will still be emitted through the grill of the car, which is very silly. The customization for your character... it needs to be more in depth really and also needs A LOT more gear to choose from; sorta like Rainbow Six Vegas 1 & 2 did. Also you can snipe with a vector smg from 300ms away, lel.

Note: The Gold edition does not include the year 1 pass like the Ultimate edition does.

The game's a load of fun even single player if you like this niche. It can take some fidgeting to get working on Linux, but it works wonderfully. I was past the 2 hour refund window when I finally got the game working well though, so you'll have to commit to it. I haven't tested multiplayer.

What it does have going for it is the beautiful environment, careful detail of characters, props, weapons, and so on. You can't fault Ubisoft for skimping on the artwork for its titles. Likewise, the map is large and the game allows you to explore it however you choose; there is no set path, but obviously the harder opponents will likely need better gear to beat than what you start out with. 

The main criticism I have is that the AI of the enemies is poor. They have the amazing capability of pinpointing your location (and relaying this information to all of their mates) perfectly should you get caught out. The AI doesn't seem to notice that their friends are missing unless they discover the body, but only within a critical time because the bodies are rapidly claimed by the earth soon after death. Moreover, like Far Cry 2, areas you clear are repopulated by the same band of cretins you killed earlier, but there's no indication why this happens. Did I fail to clear it properly?

Your own team is hindered by poor AI and a number of contrivances to seemingly work around the AI limitations. For a while I waited patiently while my three teammates carefully lined themselves up, opened vehicle doors and sat down. Then I realised that it doesn't matter if you just drive off because they magically teleport into the vehicle anyway. 

There are loads of weapons, but it's a confusing mess of restricted choice. You'd think that unlocking (via a pick-up on the map) an attachment for assault rifles would work on all assault rifles, but this is not the case. Some require purchasing from the Ubisoft store or trudging around additional locations on the map. 

Speaking of weapons, the design of the game seems to imply that sniping beyond 500 metres is off limits. The game world doesn't seem to render beyond a certain distance and luckily so, because the gravity in this game is pretty strong. So strong in fact that shots over 200 metres require a lot of compensation to connect. And you do want them to connect because alerting the enemies to your presence means the magic pinpointing of your location to everyone all the time.

I gave up after completing the first area. Too many annoyances and too much trudging around for widgets. It all felt very familiar in the Ubisoft tradition of recycling ideas and assets into new games. I felt like I had played bits of Wildlands before in Far Cry 3 and I'm sure the voice actors sounded familiar. 

In short, if you've played any Ubisoft open world game in recent years you've basically played this one already. I'm just glad I bought it in the sale.",1531308894,1685271081,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

-Vehicles dent SUPER easily (like, c'mon, why does my ARMORED vehicle DENT when I hit a TREE)

+ good gunplay
+ lots of gun and character customization and personalization
+ massive, diverse map
- distance between everything makes travel often tedious
- the grind is real - this game takes a _while_, even if you don't plan to 100% this game
- a few random missions are weirdly hard/unforgiving
+ civilians (and strict orders to not attack them) keeps gunplay interesting and careful, prevents turning the game into a shoot 'em up

Graphics/Sound:
+ gorgeous world
+ smooth, natural character animations
- this PC port doesn't feel too optimized. Even on a desktop RTX 3-series, I changed to lower settings and still had occasional stutter.
- some long load times (especially with Internet on - see my note at the end)
+ gun customization sounds are oh so satisfying
+ voices and ambient sounds enhance gameplay

Story:
+ good characterizations of enemies
- ...the protagonist, not so much
+ refreshing seeing ""playing the long game"" in stories, where results come with time
- in my personal experience, I felt little investment in cutscenes and individual characters
+ some fun cameos from the ""Ubisoft cinematic universe""

Overall: great third-person RPG shooter that requires a lot of grind. If you have the time (and can figure out how to play with a friend), it's worth it.

Other notes:
- I only played offline - no friends connected, no co-op. I heard some had issues with it. Even then, the Internet connection makes load times longer. I just put the Ubisoft launcher in offline mode, that fixed it.
- this review is from someone who's only other Ghost Recon game played is ""Advanced Warfighter 2"" on the Xbox 360 (solid game btw). So I can't really rate it on whether it lives up to the rest of the series or not.
- high profanity warning - both in cutscenes and gameplay, your character swears often when things go wrong. The most you can do is mute _all_ voices, including cutscenes, enemies, other characters, etc. So if you are unsure about profanity, it's either all or nothing.",1684349057,1684349057,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

The game offers an extensive and immersive experience, allowing players to explore the vast open-world environment while engaging in thrilling tactical combat.

The game's story is engaging and well-crafted, with a variety of missions and objectives that keep you on your toes. The main campaign is divided into multiple regions, each with its own unique terrain, culture, and storylines. The game also features side missions, which offer additional challenges and rewards.

What sets Ghost ReconÂ® Wildlands apart from other games is its emphasis on tactical gameplay. You can choose to take on each mission with a different approach, whether it's through stealth, sniping, or full-on assault. The game rewards players who take a more strategic approach, using gadgets, drones, and teamwork to take down enemies. The game's graphics are impressive, with a realistic depiction of the Bolivian landscape, including mountains, forests, and deserts. The attention to detail is also evident in the character models, weapons, and vehicles, which are all rendered with a high degree of realism.

One of the standout features of Ghost ReconÂ® Wildlands is the cooperative multiplayer mode, which allows up to four players to play together in the open-world environment. This adds a new level of teamwork and strategy to the game, as players can coordinate their tactics and take on the drug cartel as a cohesive unit. While the game does have some minor flaws, such as occasional glitches and AI issues, these do not detract from the overall experience. In conclusion, Tom Clancy's Ghost ReconÂ® Wildlands is a well-designed and immersive tactical shooter that offers hours of engaging gameplay, with its tactical combat, open-world exploration, and cooperative multiplayer mode, making it a must-play for fans of the genre.",1512232224,1684246422,True,236,6,0.905825972557067871,0,True,False,False

You have a lot of freedom to approach missions in the way you want thanks to the many vehicles you can drive or pilot and the vast open world. It's true that side missions lack variety - there are a set range of side missions and they are essentially repeated with minor variations in each province. However, the main story missions I found to be very compelling and varied, and the moment-to-moment stealth gameplay is addictive and satisfying.

But remember that this is a Ubisoft game, which means: bases/places of interests, bosses/mini bosses/micro bosses for areas map is divided into. If you like other Ubisoft games, here you will basically get their grind part, which will become the main thing.
Biggest positive part of gameplay is co-op, so in team of 4 everything becomes much more interesting.
And unlike other of their games, it is more interesting to capture bases or assassinate targets, using various gadgets, tactics, planning with your mates etc.
Story: it is somewhat interesting. Not brilliant, but serves it's purpose and can have some twists sometimes. You are a part of special group called Ghosts. And your target is to destroy the Cartel, starting from the ""little people"" and revealing their bosses, bosses of bosses.. until you will get to the main bad guy.
As an overall package, I really liked it, but it can start to be boring after half of the game, just because the gameplay formula does not change at all :)
World: this is the best thing in the game, because you have basically everything here. Jungles, deserts, snow, moderate climate, mountains, swamps. It is beautiful!
I'd say it is 6-7/10 depeniding on things you like.

A problem i have with this game: No manual save function; it just auto-saves at certain mission points. 

All in all worth to get, when on sale. No regrets here.

Subjective pro points:
- Gameplay: Ghost Mode (a must for me, everything else much too easy); it needs then manual save backups* outside the game.
- Protagonist start: Plenty options (male, female, etc.).
- Settings: Very very plenty available (FX, HUD).
- Story, the world and overall: Alright.
- Bugs, technical: Personally haven't experienced them, except: In Character Creation window, you cannot go back into menu, you are forced to create a character and save it.
- Ubisoft Connect offline play.

Subjective contra points:
- Start equipment options: Much too much.
- Progression (protagonist): Way too easy.
- Loot: Feels like always the same, should be much more rare and random.
- Side missions: When not successful, they spawn back in the same manner, just too easy to make those objectives sooner or later. A failure should be a failure.
- Locations: When cleaned one of enemies, they spawn back. In this matter, no progression. Immersion bummer. They should be kept quasi liberated.
- Challenge: With the former points in mind, a feeling like ""finally, we got it"" is very very seldom. 
- Permadeath in Ghost Mode: There should be an option to enable/disable the feature in this Mode.
- Ubisoft Connect.

* recently i wasn't able to restart a save backup, for whatever reason the game does not consider the save backup, although formerly it worked that way. This is very annoying and stops me possibly to play on.

Subjective resumed judgement, gameplay etc.: This game has or could have more potential. Fe. Needs, like fatigue/breaks/sleep and of course food (drinks and edibles). Then it would or could be a shooter masterpiece with RPG elements. As it is now, it won't keep me playing for longer.",1683134100,1683763873,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The gameplay is top tier and you will find yourself addicted right away. The main story is nothing amazing but it is decent and was enough to keep me invested in taking down El Sueno and the Cartel. Customization is pretty awesome. Sadly some of the cooler stuff is locked behind a paywall or loot boxes that you can buy but also earn through gameplay and challenges. The way you and your squad (AI or real players) communicate with yourself is pretty similar to how actual soldiers talk to each other. Most of the gear and weapons have actual real names and are actual gear the the real military uses. As a combat vet myself I came to really appreciate this personally.

I havent played military shooters in a while, got burned out during the 360/PS3 days. But i was looking for another open world game, killing dudes, upgrading, finding the things etc. Since this game was 80% off i figured why not. And this game delivers. There actually may be *too* many things to do in this game. I spent a good portion just doing side missions, exploring and doing some of the main quests. But then it started to feel too repetitive but in a negative way. Not sure why. Thankfully though, the main story missions are pretty damn good, same with the voice work. 

As a fan of Far Cry, i wanted more of that feel here. So i played in Arcade (easy) difficulty, which isnt exactly easy but is way more forgiving. However, if you want the full tactical experience you can ramp up the difficulty and turn off the hud, waypoints, and more if you wish. You can play with an AI squad which is what i did, but you can also remove them completely and go solo which i thought was a nice feature. But there's some big downsides to that too. You cant get revived, and you lose the ability to have your squad mark targets and kill them instantly with a perk called sync shot in which they do it silently and is very helpful and fun because they do it silently. 

Anyways, i had only about 3 or 4 generals(?) to kill before killing the main bad guy. I decided to wrap things up and beat the final boss and got what i suppose is the ""bad"" ending, but i thought it was pretty good. Then in typical open world fashion you get booted back to the game to continue on if you wish with a notification that i beat 80% of the bosses and if i do them all i'll get a different ending. So I figured why not and spent a few more hours killing all of them and then the main bad guy. The ending was different, but tbh i kinda liked the other one better. Alternatively, if you do things a certain way you can actually kill the main bad guy pretty early on if you want as well, although all the cutscenes afterward will still go on as though he never died which sorta ruins consistency, so dont do that. 

Theres tons and tons of weapons, parts and things to find. The weapon parts annoyed me the most though because a weapon part is only good for ONE specific weapon instead of its class. So you can go on for dozens and dozens of hours collecting parts for weapons you either dont want to use or for a weapon you dont even have. Plus, you can only carry two weapons and your side pistol. No upgrades for an extra weapon slot or two which was a bummer. I got to the point where i found a good assualt rifle and sniper rifle both with suppressors and i was doing just fine with them and never bothered with looking for all the other crap out there. 

Upgrades are good, but i wish there were more, especially considering theres SO much you can do in this game. It got to the point where i upgraded everything i wanted to and didnt care much to upgrade anything else.  Side missions will reward you with one of four types of resources that you need to upgrade a certain skill. Since i upgraded what i want enough i stopped doing side missions and banked over 65 skill points which i couldnt use at all. It would have been nice to use them for something extra like a 1% bonus to something like in the AC Origins/Odyssey games.

Overall though it was a decent shooter.",1683642445,1683642445,True,21,0,0.703180670738220215,0,True,False,False

- Game came out in 2017, in 2023 still having server issues.

Ok, now to the meat of the game:

This is one of those rare games where I can and have to wholeheartedly recommend that you play co-op either with strangers, or better yet, with friends. Why?

If you play alone, it's standard Ubisoft open-world fare: massive areas, paper-thin exploration, outposts to clear, loot to collect and forget about yada-yada...There are interesting repeatable tasks such as convoy ambush, rebel support, and multiple approaches you can take to complete them, which is very neat. Most of the items in game you can earn by completing missions, doing challenges, so no real money required - which is very strange for Ubisoft.

HOWEVER, with friends, that's where the game truly shines: tactical mishaps, failure of coordination, helicopter crashes, accidental killings of VIPs...Wait, you might be asking: why is this guy listing stupid stuff that you generally would hate in a co-op environment? Trust me: failures are fun, because with a team of functional primates, you will learn - get better - and once you and your teammates get the hold of things, it gets really, and I mean REALLY badass.

Mostly my issues were with the controls, specifically controller support.  In games with drivable vehicles I prefer using a controller.  But button mapping was weird and was registering incorrectly and the option invert-Y axis option wasn't consistent across camera modes.  And the final straw is having to wait (forever) to connect to the Ubisoft servers just to play single player (never connects).

I know some of these complaints may seem old fashioned, but as an old fashioned player it frustrates me when a triple A level developer can't get things right for years (even correct them after game launch) when so many smaller and indie developers provide better quality games.

I remember playing the original Ghost Recon, Desert Siege, and Tropic Thunder that I was so much looking forward to this game, and I was hopeful that years after launch it would be ok.

All of that aside.

The gameplay is amazing and even worth it today I also think the Unidad system is good it can get irritating at times but I think it's great cause if you think about GTA and it's 6 star police system then this suits this game very well.

The enemy characters get decent characterization from the cutscene videos & collectible audio logs, text, and trinkets. The gunplay is OK but the enemies are silly, being perfect shots with x-ray vision once you're considered ""spotted"" (no matter who spotted you or how long ago), but completely oblivious to a stealthed player picking them off. Still, it is fun to ride around in helicopters, scout out a place by drone, and then blow everything up. It's not the most heavily-optimized game and doesn't have modern features like HDR or RTX but it does look pretty good and runs OK (and there's plenty of settings to fiddle with, including the required FOV slider).

I do wish the cutscene videos didn't have the obnoxious ""zoomed in way too close at an oblique angle"" style that just makes the details hard to see and a bit nauseating. I know it's not really the Ghost Recon thing, but I also kinda wish they'd taken the angle of showing the real-world influences for this fictional game, like cocaine production in Bolivia (it is a thing), worship of Santa Muerte (this is a real religious movement), or the origins of some of the characters (like El Pozolero, who at least in modus operandi is based on an actual Sinaloa cartel killer); it is fascinating to look into the details, but you'll have to dig through the wiki and search for info yourself.

I haven't beaten it yet but I'm about halfway through full completion and it's a fun ride.

To be honest, I used to hate Ghost Recon. When it was first announced in 2015, it just didn't appeal to me, and I kept confusing it with other Tom Clancy games like Rainbow Six Siege and The Division, trust me it was the Tom Clancy name, lol. I know it sounds embarrassing, but I just couldn't get excited about it. At the time, everything was turning into an open-world game, and Ghost Recon just didn't seem to fit that mold. 

 Around the time Rainbow Six Siege was releasing, I found myself coming up with numerous excuses as to why I wouldn't get the game. I would purposely confuse the game with Ghost Recon, a completely different game. My friends would attempt to correct me, but I stubbornly clung to my delusions. I vividly recall saying things like, ""Rainbow Six Siege is an open-world shooter, I'm not interested in that kind of game."" To which my friends would say, ""No, that's Ghost Recon! You should really give Siege a chance, it's going to be so much fun, just buy the game.""I was too insecure to admit that I didn't have a next-gen console and was only debating with them to hide that fact

I would eventually get a PS4 in 2017. In the years that followed, Ubisoft would drop banger after banger. From Far Cry 5 to Assassin's Creed Odyssey, and even made a comeback with games like Siege and For Honor, The amount of hours I spent playing those games was insane, with Odessey being the peak of my enjoyment. I would eventually platinum it and move on. 
That's when my friend would recommend Ghost Recon Wildlands as our next playthrough. I really treasured our friendship but I was opposed to the idea. After some thought, I agreed, because this was the same friend who game-shared me Odessey, and man, did I love that game. So in return, I bought the game and game-shared him. We would play it but never really got into it, going as far as the end of the tutorial mission. Our lives would move on, with him and work and me and school. Unfortunately, our friendship would eventually fade when Covid hit the globe. 

Fast forward to 2021, and I'm a workaholic who plays Rainbow Six Siege in my free time. Long story short, turns out playing Siege with brain-dead teammates was taking a toll on my mental health, so I took a break from gaming and started working out. That's when I got in touch with that old friend from 2019 who I used to play with. We caught up, and he told me he was getting married. We played a game of GTA Online together before going our separate ways. Grieving with nostalgia I looked at my game library. From GTA 5, Injustice 2, Fortnite, R6 Siege, Assassins Creed, and Ghost Recon Wildlands. Ghost Recon? I couldn't help but notice that Ghost Recon was the odd one out. I had no memory of playing it with him, so I downloaded it and gave it a try.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

REVIEW:
I don't know if it was my disdain for what Siege had become, but man did I fall in love with Wildlands. The story hooked me from the start, the UI was clean, and the game had such a deep and well-crafted weapon and cosmetic selection. In the past, I've played tactical games like Operation Flashpoint and Insurgency Sandstorm, but Wildlands felt real. it was modern, tactical, and clean. And the gameplay and story just further enhanced this


Gameplay:
The guns and gunplay for the most part are consistent. The guns sound and feel great, I only wish the game gave them more scopes. The way our character moves and interacts with the world is amazing as well. From having deep convos with the crew, hit firing when taking cover, removing/adding the suppresser, and shooting from their back while prone. I just love and appreciate the attention to detail that when into the gameplay. (There's a lot I'm leaving out but you get the gist)

Story:
You could definitely still feel that Ubisoft formula in the story but it somehow just works. I got fully immersed in the game's story, primarily because of Bowman, loved her character. The story combined with the world felt real and the way the music complimented everything was just amazing. 

But what really made it all a blast was the co-op. I played it with my brother, and we had a great time customizing our characters to suit each biome, grinding the skill tree, stealth infiltrations, role-playing, and just messing around and having fun. Unfortunately, all good things come to an end, and my brother eventually drifted away from the game. I still completed the game without him, but I couldn't bring myself to platinum it, because of how much of a grind it was. 

Overall, Ghost Recon was a lot of fun. I loved how it immersed me in its story and its world and how futuristic and tactical it was. It really made me feel like a mercenary, especially with no HUB. I'm honestly grateful for the attention to detail and care put into creating such a tactical and immersive game like Wildlands. I sometimes forget that Ghost Recon is a Ubisoft IP. And It's clear that Ubisoft can create amazing games when they take the time to do so.

PS I bought Wildlands on PC for the performance and graphical improvement and have resumed playing it with my brother. It's still a blast, but only this time it's beautiful, smooth, and clean.",1682233207,1682233854,True,4,0,0.560000002384185791,0,True,False,False

Fortunately, Ghost Recon Wildlands was released soon after, featuring the same character movement and controls as Splinter Cell Blacklist. Ubisoft has since adopted these gameplay mechanics and controls in their modern 3rd person shooters, including The Division 1 & 2, which I found enjoyable as well. 

However, there's something remarkably captivating about Ghost Recon Wildlands that has me returning to it time and time again. The game offers a perfect balance between relaxation and exhilaration, making it an ideal companion for listening to podcasts. Although the story may not be the most enthralling, the gameplay itself is what truly transforms this game into a classic, engaging experience that never fails to entertain.

AI is slightly stupid and messes up some sneak missions, but it's not a big deal. You learn to deal with them if you want to play with AI companions.

The game has many customizations which make the gameplay more personalised which is nice, but not essential.

The only downside is that you can only play campaign and ghost mode as everything else is always down and doesn't work. Ubisoft as always barely works so you have to deal with occasional server errors too.

Good points its what you saw in the trailer, 
- preparation ahead, 
- its has some story, 
- multiple enviroments and events happening, 
- the world somehow feels alive, 
- a lot of choices of weapons, 
- nice skill tree, 
- alot of content for a long time

Bad:
- Perfomance.... its bad... i don't care that i only get 55-65 fps... as long as its stable, its the stuters that accour so frequently.., i have actually pretty good specs compared to when it came out... should run amazing...
- Controlling car/bikes with a keyboard... is a pile of s##t
- Online always, even to make a offline session is annoying, takes multiple attempts and its slow to do it
- Missions sometimes just bug out and make you lose progress. 
- AI is sometimes bugged, both on your team and enemies...
        - your team is walking casually in the middle of enemies as you marking them to be killed, literally with guns pointing at their faces sometimes.. 
        - enemy 1 on the ground behind a wall saw me... when i am outside far away trying to kill enemy 2 on top of a tower, same base... barely seeing enemy 2, which is much closer to me...
       - Your team, after you get into a car, gets into the car and as the last teammate goes in... everyone goes out and back in again... happening once or twice... OK... but it happens so frequent, it gets a bit annoying  and with no enemies around, in the middle of a mountain even...
       - Ubisoft launcher... Why after closing the game, you disconnect yourself, tell me i got disconnected from inactivity and ask me to login back... also... i check the ""Trust this computer"" everytime but keeps happening... 

Overall i could bare the bad points except the bugs that make you lose progress.

The last trigger: 
Went for a big base, gotta help a npc for the story which needed a code from an npc, so not only did i went to help him, got code, i killed all enemies even tho was not required and being detected is an instant fail. All good, very satisfying... Went for imediate follow-up mission that is steal an helicopter using that code, they tell you to not get detected and when they make it on porpose so that you get detected you gotta kill the 3 helis that are after you. Killed 1, Killed 2.. pointing at third one... and out of the blue... a loading screen... mind you, i didn't die or anything... just a normal casual loading screen as if i am loading into an area... i pop after on a random locally and tells me to go back to same place to do it again... did i just lose 20min of progress??? wtf??",1681755375,1681755375,False,1,0,0.5078125,0,True,False,False

I'm not interested in military, but I've found this game really interesting. I think the game is good because the user-friendly and realistic elements of the game are in harmony. Personally, I liked the outfit and weapon customization.

The story wasn't quite interesting, but it was good. The twist in the second half was also very fresh.

The background and graphic description are really great. They've put all of Bolivia's natural environments into one map. Thanks to Ubisoft, I enjoyed my trip to Bolivia! I don't think Iâll go on a trip to Bolivia in the future.

Regarding the price of the game, when I first bought it, I thought the price was a little high even if I bought it at a discount, but after playing it, my regret disappeared. I thought the amount and quality of the game were very reasonable for the price.

It took more than 100 hours for me to play, but I think it depends on how others play. In fact, it was hard to play the Ubisoft-style open world game because of the great amount of its play time. I understood the concept of knocking down a huge enemy by cutting his arms and legs one by one, but I thought this was a little too much.

Gameplay follows the usual Ubisoft formula. I usually hate it but what makes up for it is how the game feels to play. Playing stealthy and tactical is very rewarding. Getting in sync with your teammates and taking down enemies one by one then getting even better at strategising and executing your plans is super satisfying.
You can also go guns blazing in almost every mission though i wouldn't recommend it especially in harder missions.
Story seems very basic at the beginning but as you progress, it becomes better and sets itself apart from being a shallow mindless shooter.
There are of course some things that it does bad. The first one being the world design. It is massive and unfortunately very empty. Apart from key locations, the world consists of roads, foliage and vastness.
One big issue is the glitches and bugs. The game is riddled with them and you will encounter atleast 2 or 3 of them on each of your playthroughs. While some are are funny and harmless, a lot of them require you to restart the mission or die to get out of the bug.
Ubisoft launcher is another big issue. It just doesn't work most of the time and makes playing with friends a huge hassle.
The last one will be a mixed opinion which is the mission types. There isn't enough variety to keep it interesting. I enjoyed the game thoroughly but most will surely find it repetitive.
After all that negative there still are fun times waiting for you and your friends in Ghost Recon Wildlands.

The game can be played solo, but it really shines when played with friends. The co-op mode allows up to four players to work together to complete missions and take down the Cartel.

- Garbage, bloatware software launcher.
- A buggy mess (takes ages to join friends, buggy lobbies and errors every 5 minutes). 
- Terrible UI system.

- No steam workshop or mod support.
- Very long respawn timers.
- Missions WILL FAIL you if you do not follow it 1 to 1. i.e If it is a stealth mission and you do as much as break a kitkat near a guard it will fail the mission and make you reload the entire map/mission which is very long even on an ssd and you need to wait for everyone in the party. 
- Bad mission design.
- No fast quick and easy fast travel.
- Enemies have near aimbot precision, not realistic and unfun to die to a janitor with dual mac-10s over 400 meters away (he used iron sights).

It is very stealth focused, and the stealth mechanics are both intuitive and satisfying, much like those in the Sniper Elite series. It runs very well on my basic computer. Only significant issue is that I and apparently many others have had issues getting the game to launch. It gets stuck in a loading screen. The YouTuber TellMeHow has a 2 minute guide on how to fix this issue, should you have it. All in all, very highly recommended. The game was just on sale for less than 10 bucks, so if you are fine waiting, that sale may come back.

HOPEFULLY FINAL EDIT: manually clearing the Ubisoft cache has been consistently fixing this problem for me. First close all apps. Then make sure nothing Ubisoft related is running using Task Manager, then open files. Go to Cache under Ubisoft, and delete the files. I have to do this every time before launching the game. It has not affected my save data in any way, but to be sure, follow another guide on how to clear the Ubisoft cache. After clearing the cache, launch the ubisoft app as administrator. It should work. Maybe.

An edit: I have had problems starting the game every single time I have played since my first review. Disabling all overlays (steam, discord, etc.) helped once. This time, clearing my download cache on steam seems to have worked. Others seem to have had success by just uninstalling and reinstalling the game. Look around for other tips on how to run the game if this doesn't work. 

Ubisoft, if you see this, your game is practically unlaunchable for me and many others on Steam. Please fix this. It makes a great game a royal pain.",1679002091,1680472660,True,1,0,0.51086956262588501,0,True,False,False

This game is great fun. It is a truly enjoyable experience and provides enough of a challenge to not suck. Kudos to Ubisoft for creating an absolute unit of a game.


EDIT:
My sincerest gratitude to Ubisoft for reaching out and trying to help resolve the issues I had (crashes). Fortunately for Ubisoft, the problem was on my end. Whenever I do something that is graphically intensive (even other games), my system would reboot. The simple fix: disable C-States in the BIOS. Whenever my system rebooted, event viewer logged it as a Kernel Power ID 41. After 'applying' the fix, I can now comfortably enjoy an awesome game without any crashes. 


~~IRRELEVANT~~
Having previously played this game on the Xbox One S, I really enjoy this game.

The game is good, fun, and can provide one with more than enough of a challenge; therefore I WOULD have recommended it, if it were not for the multiple crashes that this game has caused me. My PC is more than capable enough to run this game at full specs with a lot of room to spare, but despite all that, it would not allow me at all. (Ryzen 5 Pro 4650G with ASUS RX 6600 XT)

After validating, reinstalling, updating every driver, disabling all graphics settings, running without game overlays, and going completely offline, it would still crash at random.

If one can live with regular crashes, this game is a great time investment. Otherwise, I recommend to stay as far away as possible.",1680227150,1680289581,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It seems one day, you will play a modern Ubisoft games, with it's shooting a birdshot into a map-style layout and the seemingly slightly increasing stats that are very minute in the end for its ""RPG"" mechanics, or the simple sandbox gameplay that had too many things to held; which makes it basic for all of the things?

Either way, playing this game is the quintessential modern Ubisoft title. Ghost Recon! A game where, at the beginning is an essence of a classic Tom Clancy game (AI that is dumber than rocks but kills your entire team within seconds, a game style that revolves around making the perfect plan, and US troopers some backwaters somewhere within the Eastern Europe or Central Asia/Counter-Terror unit hunting some big name Terrorist), becomes something different at the end of the 2000s; more akin to a pseudo-sci-fi military shooter that is en vogue during those times.

Obviously, Wildlands is a departure from that formulae; since now its a standard Ubisoft sandbox but with third-person shooter mechanics. You have your choices of stealth (at higher levels, its mandatory) or loud (means you screwed yourself). The story itself is, uh.... something. It's obvious that aside from novels written by the late Tom Clancy himself, the games that are made with his name aren't exactly the pinnacle of storytelling. Ghost Recon Wildlands isn't an exception. Sure, it's fun hearing Diana Burnwood swear every other sentences, and hearing Male Nomad (whom, if I remember, is a Major and should be in his mid to late 30s) sounding like a teenager who learned every single swear word in the vocabulary and combining them to become cooler (Shitballs) is always funny for me.

The actual story itself, while simple, isn't the main drive of it. I don't think it is. The main drive is with the gameplay loop. Yes, it's as standard as apple pie with Ubisoft for putting Combat Outposts like its candy, but the fun part begins on how you tackle 'em. Nomad moves pretty well, any weapons you use is an auto-kill when hidden, and at higher levels; the game becomes your little plaything, especially when you have all the tools at hand (which you will need on some locations). Some weapons are build equally, others aren't. Shotguns are really bad in this game; since SMGs fill their role better and can hit targets above 50 meters. LMGs are always a treat to carry on loud missions, but they took forever to load, and using a M4A1/TAR-21/Famas with 50 round mag is better at that case.

There are many other complaints I would give. The car and bike physics felt like the cars have their tires sanded out, and the bike felt like driving with a very obese man on the back with how erratic it responded sometimes. But, my biggest complaint yet is with Unidad.

In the game, there's three factions: Kataris, Santa Blanca and Unidad. Kataris is the rebels you're working (and throwing their people into fire if you play 'em like me) with, Santa Blanca is the funny cartel people with the world's most annoying DJ and Mrs.""IF YOU'RE NOT BOSSY, YOU GET WHAT YOU DESERVE"" (Perico can you stop putting Nidia every 5 minutes you simp, I wish I actually shot her instead of dragging her into a chopper so Bowman has a Bosslady to Bosslady talk to her), and Unidad. Full stop.

If there's words I can describe Unidad is ""swarms of rats"". GTA V cops ain't got anything with these people. They have essentially a wanted mechanic, where if they spot you for more than 30 seconds, they will send a patrol at you. If that doesn't work: 2 patrols. No? APCs. ""Oh, is that all"", you may ask? If that's all, then it shouldn't be a problem! Sadly, the one thing that LSPD doesn't have with Unidad is the SHEER QUANTITY that they can throw at you. During one of the missions in Media Luna (the penultimate one), they send an entire platoon at me. Sure, you can just walk around 'em (and in fairness, that's what you should do), and you SHOULD have an Anti-Materiel Rifle at the ready for helicopters (if you don't, then you're screwed), but it does get really annoying at times when their patrols spotted you and you have to do the whole song and dance.
Don't get me started about the only-Unidad territories (Media Luna and Fior de Oro), those are an exercise of pain, patience and ""AGAIN?"" once you get spotted by a Unidad patrol and you didn't kill 'em fast enough. Admittedly, Fior de Oro has the best Assault Rifle in the game for me (M4A1 my beloved).

Sometimes, it's good that the AI is dumb as rocks. They only have two moods when spotting you: Laser-accurate shooting while in cover, or RUSH. Like, they will rush exactly at your location where you shoot 'em. Not even a 10 meters or two of deviation. Funnily enough, that's exactly how I take care of Unidad bases at that point. Since they're tankier than the average Sicario, the grunts are gonna rush in willy-nilly half of the time. So, you set up traps and mines for 'em. If not, and you already spotted 'em, just walk around and shoot 'em in the back. Sometimes, their cheating helps you since, like a Tactical Shooter AI, they're dumb as rocks.

While you may play the game without even leveling up or getting any weapons/attachment you want in the map is fine (P416, MP5 and M40A5 are solid weapons), the games does feel like it builds on the idea that you slowly build your Nomad to become a maniac with enough explosives to level an entire city, and carrying an entire arsenal that fits to their situation. Like, leveling up all your stuff to level 1 is a must for me, since you get all the tools you needed. When you reach to the point where you deal with Unidad, hopefully you already have a good LMG, Anti-Materiel Rifle and enough levels on Vehicular destruction. If not, then, uh, well, shit.

The customization in this game is uh... something. I kinda wish Nomad gets more than just four hairs, 12 faces and more gear that doesn't look off; but that's life.I guess that's on the sequel.

Either way, this game is worth playing.... on a discount. Don't buy it full price, you're an absolute buffoon if you do that.",1680137527,1680137527,True,1,0,0.520884513854980469,0,True,False,False

Released in 2017, the game is set in a fictionalized version of Bolivia, where players take on the role of a special forces team tasked with taking down a drug cartel.

One of the standout features of Ghost Recon Wildlands is its massive open world, which offers players a vast and diverse environment to explore. The game's world is filled with different landscapes, including mountains, forests, deserts, and cities, each with its unique challenges and opportunities.

The game's tactical gameplay mechanics are also noteworthy, as they allow players to approach missions and combat situations in various ways. Players can choose to take a stealthy approach, using silenced weapons and carefully planning their actions, or opt for a more aggressive playstyle, using heavy firepower and vehicles to take down enemies.

Another aspect of the game that stands out is its multiplayer mode, which allows players to team up with friends or other players online to complete missions and take on the cartel together. The game's co-op mode adds to the game's overall replayability and provides players with a fun and challenging experience.

However, the game's story and characters are somewhat forgettable, and the game can feel repetitive at times, with many of the missions feeling similar to one another.

Overall, Ghost Recon Wildlands is an enjoyable open-world shooter game that offers a vast and diverse environment to explore and fun tactical gameplay mechanics. While the game's story and characters may not be its strongest point, the game's co-op mode and replayability make it worth checking out for fans of the genre.",1680125973,1680125973,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

The game offers an expansive and immersive world that is both breathtaking and believable. From the deserts to the jungles, every inch of the game's map is well designed, offering a realistic experience.

One of the most impressive aspects of Ghost Recon Wildlands is its responsive and satisfying gunplay. The weapons feel great to use, and the sound effects add an extra level of immersion. It's easy to pick up and play, but it still offers a challenging experience that keeps you coming back for more.

Stealth is also a major highlight of the game, and it's incredibly well executed. The AI is intelligent and challenging, making each infiltration unique and engaging. The game allows players to approach objectives in their own way, whether it be through stealth, brute force, or a combination of both.

Finally, Ghost Recon Wildlands is one of the best games to play with friends. The game offers a seamless co-op experience, where players can team up and tackle missions together. This adds a new level of excitement and fun to the game, making it an unforgettable experience.

Overall, Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Wildlands is an exceptional game that deserves high praise.

Alas, you melt so much into it, that shortcomings start to vex. The guns barely differ or matter. The sniping is a joke with comical ranges and ballistics. The few missions that try to break out of the formula overcorrect into either punishing stealth requirements or absolute bloodbath.

In a sea of shameless copy-and-paste open world games there always has to be the one game that makes all the others look bad.

So this is an open-world (uh-huh,) co-op tactical light RPG shooter (mhm,) made by Ubisoft (Oh boy! THIS GAME IS SHIT!) That's actually worth the money.

-The Good-
The gameplay is feels amazing, the guns feel impactful and the roster is solid. Play this game on Advanced or Extreme and you will not regret it.

Ghost mode is meant for players who want more challenge and brings perma-death, no squad members and heightened difficulty for players seeking a challenge. In ghost mode, you start with a level 1 character with only the basic equipment*, and the reward you get for beating it is really special, I won't spoil it, but it sure is cool.

Co-op is where you take all the positives from this game and add your friends into the mix, making the gameplay experience more fun, and if you don't have people to play with, and don't like to play with randoms. The base game is still fun.

-The Bad-
You may have noticed the ""*""'s I've been putting around, and that's because this a Ubisoft title so there is going to be some *'s attached to things.

* - In Ghost mode, you start with the basic starting equipment plus all the DLC and micro-transactions you bought.

The story is mid, you are taking down a drug cartel called ""Santa Blanca"" that has taken over the free country of Bolivia through violence and political dealings, who is shipping cocaine to the US and Canada, and who has also formed their own pseudo-religion and their leader is an extremely violent drug-lord that kills civilians and anyone who opposes him. 

But no rush, take your time.

The Ghosts have a very transparent personality, probably because they don't exist.

The main character ""Nomad"" is a blank piece of paper as a character, and every second word out of his mouth is ""shitballs"" so yeah have fun hearing that.

And that's all I can say about the Ghosts, I guess ""Weaver"" got Nomad into a car accident one time so that's why he lost his driving privileges, however this is never elaborated on.

All the cartel members are, actually I don't remember I'll have to get back to you on this.

-Conclusion-
Ghost Recon Wildlands is a really fun open-world light RPG tactical shooter that stands out, as it is actually good, the gameplay is fun on the harder difficulties and it offers the insanely fun ghost mode for those looking for a challenge, and the game is even more fun with your friends but is great on its own",1679889901,1679889901,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Game has bugs, micro transactions, and loot boxes. And an uninspiring and at times incoherent story. In general, I enjoyed this game. However, that comes with a few caveats. Firstly, I got this when it was 80% off. There is no chance that this game would be even nearly worth it at its full price of $75 AUD.For the base price of $75, youâre not even given everything, in true Ubisoft fashion there is still loot boxes and micro transactions. Also requires the Ubisoft game launcher (which can be quite annoying).Also, this is one of those games that requires mates to play with. In single player the AI companions are annoying at best and a big hinderance at worst. Fortunately, you can disable them in the settings menu, but be prepared for a difficulty spike over playing co-op.The story is also uninspiring and bland. If you want something story rich, maybe look somewhere else. On top of that some of the character's voice acting in a few places could use some, [i]work[/i]. Though for most characters the voice acting is pretty good. But the excessive use of 'tango' does annoy me. I get the use of it, being an elite recon team, but hearing it a hundred times in a single encounter, it's a bit over done.On top of micro-transactions and loot box mechanics, even after the age of this game, bugs are still everywhere. Gotta love falling through the map after exiting a helicopter and dying, getting spotted through vehicles, or failing a stealth mission because the rebels decided to start a faction warfare. But probably the most annoying is how inconsistent inviting people to your lobby is. My mate and I typically spend 15 min restarting the game trying to get the invite to work. A constant loop of 'in menus (unavailable)', and other features that are just broken. E.g., the prompt asking if you want to rejoin a game after crashing or quitting is broken, and always results in a message saying Ubisoft services are down, along with a couple other game joining features.Also falls into the common [i]go stealth or go loud[/i] games where if your going stealth, and the enemy is alerted (e.g., finds dead body), they can magically know where you are. Nothing is more annoying than being up on a massive hill sniping, someone finds a dead body, and then a few min later a patrol is just magically behind you. While this isn't game breaking, it is very annoying and is something you should be aware of.Also, toward the end of the game upgrading can get a bit grindy and tedious, constantly running around trying to get enough resources to unlock the next tier of a single skill. And of course you can also use micro transactions to skip the grind, thanks Ubisoft.Though overall I did enjoy the game, I still don't recommend it at it's full listed price.",1679285899,1679808975,False,6,1,0.587363004684448242,3,True,False,False

I mean i can understand if they have a headset phone etc. But the cartel members don't they scream much like that use to be done in WW II think ubi soft screwed up cause they were just being lazy again. I can understnad unidad can call for back up but i don't think the cartel can do the same it would require them to use a cell phone and you'd think they would consider jamming etc if an area has jamming don't you think they would have a hard time using their radios and all? good job ubi soft another poorly rush job to try and get some quick cash-2I give ubi soft a 3/10and Ghostrecon wildlands gets an 4/10 The game itself is fun and ubi soft did a pretty good job though they seriously didrush the game and content.  The gun selection is pretty good though to bad they didn't add more variants to the AK.such at the AKS  - AKU - AK-74 etc and even the gali.Would of been awsome to see the UMP45 as well and or any glocks there are a few shot guns though.Ubi soft trying to make money off replica's in their store.Some of the weapon packs are not worth buying as you can obtain some of them in game by exploring different area's (They got them there incase you are lazy and want to feed them money which is some what pointless cause they aren't producin the same quality games they use to anymore always a hit and a miss but its been more of a miss with them lately and they are putting themselves into deep debt they are going to be just next to atari if they can't get themselves set straight soon)Ubisoft is without a complete doubt the worse company in the gaming business. They do a all sorts of bull business practices like season passes, overpriced DLC, micro transactions etc.also remember Uplay? the online service that is trying its hardest not to compete with steam and orgin? Ubisoft is also a master of milking franchises.. they annually release Assassin's creed games, and they all look the same.. gee and they wonder why they are losing money..hmmI am willing to bet over 200 bucks that ubisoft will milk far cry as well.. far cry 4 was pretty much far cry 3 looked and played completely different from each other.well! it has lost all its charm hasn't it? not only is ubisoft doing all bull practicesthey are also an incredibly lazy company/developer as is evident with the annual releases that are basically the same thing different year...And they force their staff to come on here to push false hype salestheir games definitely have potential but they just infect everything they touch with micro transactions and quick grabs.Get the heck out of here ubisoft if you can not fix what mess you have created then you have no place in the gaming world.You guys can not keep up with the demand of gamingyou refuse to even listenyou refuse to even try and correct any kind of mistakes you make.",1546471434,1679723367,False,0,1,0.428265511989593506,0,True,False,False

There is this annoying cross mechanic where you can vault over things but the lack of jumping makes some movement and interaction with the world quite tedious. The stealth aspects are sufficiently arcade and limited that eventually you get spotted and most larger area more end game fights / infiltrations end up in a gun fight with you against insurmountable waves of vehicles and helicopters where all you can do is shoot until you run out of ammo and then run away.In the end it starts to feel like quite a chore and new weapons are very rare without real world money purchases.

As fun as the game can be, it doesn't matter much if you can't actually play it.",1679530243,1679530243,False,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

I've played ghost recon and splinter cell from the beginning. I was excited to play a stealth action game after the seeming death of the genre (although the original Ghost Recon was more strategy than stealth). This game however, is just not fun. It's amazing aesthetics and customization only raise your expectations to be utterly crushed.

I've maxed out my stealth abilities and tooled out my silent weapons and there's seemingly no difference in detection times or ability to stay stealthy. I completed the missions to get the stealth optic camouflage and it doesn't make a difference to anything. Enemies will still see you and alert the entire base in a second. I even turned down the difficulty to 'Arcade', the game's easiest setting, and there's no discernible difference.

For the enemy AI being so incredible at homing in on you and shooting you with extreme precision, your squad-mates' AI is hot garbage. They are constantly losing marks and getting caught by the enemy, often times costing you missions... which is made worse by the game's reload times. I can get up and go make some coffee while the game reloads. Even with my rig above recommended specs and Ethernet hard-lined in. Now I understand why old-school stealth games just had the enemies resume their regular patrol routes so fast.     
-That was a meme but here it would be welcome so we wouldn't have to reload the whole damn game.

You get some cool gadgets that just end up being worthless junk. You can't use mines because civilians run over them constantly. The fact that the quietest weapons still suck makes every other weapon utterly useless. Also, once enemies are alerted they become bullet sponges. I've shot a dude in the face, point blank with my M14, 3 or more times before they go down. Same with the Vector .45 SMG. Kinda weird how an alerted armored enemy is almost as tough as a vehicle, but you can one-shot them when firing from stealth.

Overall, this game is so close to being a beautiful masterpiece that could breath life into the now extinct stealth action genre, it just pisses you off they could fumble it so bad.

If the gunplay (bullet drop) in a tactical shooter is the weakest feature, it tells you how the game shines in other areas.

Missions or just base clearing never gets boring since you can apply different techniques from stealthy to heavy shoot out.
The Open World is extremely immersive. The world itself is not felt repetitive like Breakpoint, e.g.
During the Story you get also missions which do not incude shooting, stealing, planting evidence, getting compromat for black-mailing.
The banter of AI-squad members reminds you of Baldur's Gate.

RPG mechanics do not get get too intrusive and luckily it stays away from turning enemies into bullet sponges. One shot or a two or three bullet burst well placed usually do the trick.

Atmosphere and fun gameplay rule. As a tactical shooter it hits the sweet spot between MilSim and more arcade style or shooters or loot shooters.

There is roughly 80 hours of content in the base game should you take your time to complete everything the game has to offer. There are multiple side objectives to complete and collectables to find, with a large number of which providing accurate historical and cultural information regarding Bolivia's real-world customs and beliefs. The weapons on offer are all extremely satisfying to use, with attachments and new firearms requiring one to find them throughout the world. There are also rebel-assistive perks that can expand your options for tackling any situation, such as the command to request rebel infantry support, vehicle drop-offs and even mortar fire on a designated location. The process of scouting out enemy positions is conducted through the use of your personal drone, which can also be upgraded to become a portable EMP, a noise emitter or even a remote control bomb.

The game's storyline is interesting, with players tasked with taking down a powerful drug cartel operating in Bolivia. The game's graphics are also impressive, with stunning visuals that add to the realism and atmosphere of the game.

One of the highlights of the game is its cooperative multiplayer mode, which allows players to team up with up to three other players to complete missions and take down the cartel. This mode adds a lot of replayability to the game and makes it a great option for those who enjoy team-based gameplay.

The game's weapon customization and upgrade system is also well-designed, allowing players to tailor their weapons to their playstyle and become more effective in combat. The game's vehicles and gadgets also add to the variety of gameplay options available to players.

However, the game's open-world environment can feel overwhelming at times, with a large number of side missions and activities to complete. The game's AI can also be frustrating at times, with enemies sometimes behaving in unrealistic ways or being too easy to take down.

Overall, Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Wildlands is a great game for fans of tactical shooters and open-world gameplay. While it has some minor flaws, its cooperative multiplayer mode, customization options, and immersive world make it a worthwhile game to check out.",1678762367,1678762367,True,1,0,0.50205761194229126,0,True,False,False

I just have one issue.

First of all, the game is beautiful to look at, even six years after release. You'll explore Bolivia's salt flats, dominating snow-capped mountains, swamps, lakes, and fields of the infamous coca plant as you take down outposts, destroy convoys for precious loot, and pursue missions that have a decent variety that keep you intrigued. The open world is dynamic, though perhaps feels a bit empty, but if you stick to your modus operandi of striking unwitting opponents and disappearing before anyone was the wiser, it will suffice.

There are a variety of ways to handle each enemy encounter, but I find stealth to be this game's strong suit. Much has been made of the inability to move/hide bodies (a detail fixed in the sequel, Ghost Recon Breakpoint), but I love the increased difficulty this can add to the game's stealth encounters. What really unlocks this game's full potential is the ""Ghost Mode,"" or permadeath mode you can play with your friends. It amps up the tension, and is absolutely a serious challenge for gamers.

This game's strongest weaknesses lie with the AI, both your AI teammates and the enemies can be pretty bone-headed at times, and their behavior can be predictable. But, due to reinforcements coming if you alert the base, every encounter is difficult enough to take seriously. The story is also laughably jingoistic and ridiculous; don't come to Wildlands for a page-turner. But that's okay when you can get immersed in the world on your own, and get lost in the wildlands of Bolivia.

I love this game, I've probably sunk more hours into it than any game I've ever played, and I hope many more people can experience what it has to offer.",1678564935,1678564935,True,12,2,0.662271201610565186,1,True,False,False

Also there was a time where my teammate was downed, I had to shoot an enemy to reach my friend and when shot once, the enemy took the hit and disappeared and re appeared when I was reviving my friend, which killed me and caused a game over. This can be really frustrating when you're far in the game. Overall it's a great game to try and it's really fun and immersive but again, wasted by the bad optimization, it lags really hard sometimes but Ubisoft seemed to fix it in Ghost Recon Breakpoint. I'm really spitting on the game but it's definitely a game to try. It's fun :)",1678553165,1678553165,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

There are some minor things but not of them game breaking for me. Of course it isn't perfectly realistic it isn't a military sim but that can also make it fun.

The gameplay is fantastic: A huge campaign with parallel missions (in fact this is a tree you can solve in any order), taking place in a gigantic, credible open world. Everything is possible from your gun to flying helicopter. You can even play the campaign in coop, up to 4 players!

The graphics are superb. Its sequel Breakpoint is a notch higher, however, the feeling of being in a foreign country with all its colors and culture is incredibly well rendered in Wildlands.

The audio is great as well: from all tactical stuff to inhabitants dancing on the main square, celebrating stuff in towns. You really feel you are here.

Indeed, unlike 99% of other open world games, this one is really immersive: It feels like you are in a real country with real civilian people doing their stuff. While the bad guys are just a small part of the population. 

You can customize the difficulty to your liking. I played without any help (no HUD), just two weapons, ârealisticâ clothes, and all, and it was fun to drive down the roads, listening to the radio, reading the map, to know where to turn to reach the next town where my target was.

This game is half arcade, half simulation. Weapons are from real life. However, they are (un)balanced for gameplay. No weapon is really better than another, and they do not necessarily match their real-life characteristics. Now, that said, they are great fun. You can customize them to death, same for your outfit and loadout.

It is great to play coop, one player infiltrating with his gun and knife, while a sniper is covering him from afar. Even in solo, the bots, while not great, are fine. They canât break your missions, and do whatever you ask of them.

To date, this is the best open world tactical shooter I have played in a long time. While Breakpoint is a notch higher technically. Wildland campaign, characters and overall gameplay is better. I like how the world is full or real civilian people, not just bad guys, and stupid dronesâ¦

A pretty good game. Stealth is handled pretty well, shooting feels good, and the atmosphere of the world and story is done very well.

Some of the things it could improve on are the movement mechanics and mission design. The movement is very context-dependent like in other Ubisoft games. i.e. you can't jump unless there is an obstacle that you can press A on to activate the jumping animation. This works fine for the most part, but there are some obstacles in the open world which appear easily passable but that you cannot press A on. This can be really disappointing when it ruins your carefully planned stealth approach. As for mission design, there are some missions where enemies just spawn out of nowhere. This just seems like a lazy way to create a sense of urgency, and clashes with the stealthy and precise tone of the game. The convoy missions are another irritation. If I can shoot out the driver, it is very satisfying, but usually I can't do that. These missions often devolve into a goofy-ass car chase, which, again, clashes with the tone of the game. My final complaint is that the guns don't feel very unique from each other. There are several assault rifles that feel the same, and the same goes for smgs and snipers. I didn't find much use for shotguns. I guess the variety is just there for style/customization, which is fine I guess.",1678304844,1678304844,True,2,0,0.524617969989776611,0,True,False,False

- Accidentally kill your friends by landing on them with a chopper.
- Stop on your way to a mission just to enjoy the (even by 2023 standards) beautiful scenery.

The boss fights are ridiculously easy to the point I would recommend you play on the hardest setting. You really dont even need to bother collecting all the guns. You can kill everything with the first gun you spawn in with.

Gunplay feels clunky af compared to the other titles in the franchise...the cover system is almost non-existent and dont even get me started on the FREAKING camera that switches shoulders back and forth at random times, constantly making you have to switch perspective from one shoulder to the other.

After all this time still connection issues. Constant creating session window on screen have to cancel then start again. Connection issues in game.

Sill has loot boxes even after all the controversy. Creating plush landscapes is not a difficult task. 
A.I not the smartest.
This only got good reviews simply because you can play with your friends.  As with most multiplayer games.
Actual core game play seems to get missed. Go here collect or kill a few AI, rudimentary game play at best. Vehicles are bland, controls so basic, much more fun driving off a big cliff then off into the sunset.

Shoot enemy and the rest still patrol like a silencer cannot be heard.

Go help the militia as they are unable to steel a truck or helicopter. What about joining them as a raid or something?
Did play this some years ago as a timed trial was not a fan then. Picked up in the sale to see if it improved any.

Only have a few hours on steam, if you have been playing games for as long as I have you know instantly if it's a hit or miss. If you like stealth shooters you will probably like this one. The above is my opinion. 
Probably will put some more hours into the game now n then whilst waiting for something to play in a few months.

Support is atrocious on top of it. Put in a ticket Saturday and today is Tuesday and no reply. The problem is that Ubisoft wants 2 step to get into the account to deactivate 2 step. I was literally looking at my email and the 2 step authentication app with the correct code and I made sure it was synced. It's a problem on Ubisoft's end. All this headache, so Ubisoft can charge for micro transactions on top of already being paid for the game. The only fix can't be solved by support because Ubisoft won't do away with needing to be logged into an account to play an essentially single player experience. Log in for co op and multiplayer makes sense if that's what you want to do and you should be able to choose to log in if you want to, but for a 6 or so year old game with a limited player base it doesn't make sense that it's mandatory.

I have been coming back to this game for casual fun and especially compared to the sequel, this is a lot more enjoyable if you are looking for some stealth gunplay in an open world.

Positives:
- Open sandbox of Bolivia where you can have fun with up to 4 friends
- Graphics are very nice if you have the system for it
- Gunsmith mode is fun but gunplay is not changing that much with it

Cons:
- Story is mediocre at best
- Vehicle control terrible
- Missions are basicly the same zone after zone
- Enemies are spawning in closer then FOV would allow it

After many hours of the game, it didn't take me long to, once again, fall in love with it. The graphics for the release date are superior, especially now that I can turn up the graphics to ultra and so on. The story is good, but it could be better. I find it sometimes to be slightly jumbled within the storyline but otherwise nothing too serious to complain about. The Ghost Mode is extremely fun after becoming used to the base game template; it is very challenging but it offers a nice change of pace and requires a great deal of planning and patience.

""I am a 52 year old father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my son, who is now 16. My son recently started Ghost Recon and in less than a week, he had already played for over 20 hours. This was terrible for me, as it was already hard enough for me to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching videos on Tiktok. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, did the tutorial but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought my son and I closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.""",1676672760,1676672760,True,1,0,0.437074899673461914,0,True,False,False

Enemies mostly 3 shots you if you try to go loud while having damage resistance skills, so game will force you as much as it can to only sneak every missions, except stealth system is horrible- you can't drag bodies, enemies have awful AI and entire stealth pretty much is spamming syncshots with bots.

The team that worked on this game did so for 5 long years and you can tell. The world they crafted is extremely immersive and feels very authentic. It's the same feeling I get when I play the Witcher 3 and walk through Novigrad...you can tell the devs put a lot of love and care into making it. Every house has little assets here and there from candles to plates to just random clutter. That takes a long time considering how big the world is. Same with Bolivia. Every Sicario house you walk in looks authentic and believable. Every area you explore makes you feel like you are there. The game mechanics are familiar if you've played other tittles from Ubisoft, but there is a lot here you can play with. From having an up-gradable drone that you can use to pre-spot bases and hideouts and using it to distract enemies. You have a plethora of firepower from handguns to SMGs and LMGs, assault rifles and sniper rifles. Grenades, proximity mines, C4, regular mines, flashbangs and on top of all that, rebels that you can call in for back up, diversion or other tactics. This allows you to approach every fight in the manner that fits your play style. If you get the DLCs you can also get a knife so you can do stealthy take downs. The game is huge, the world is beautiful and very well crafted and the story is decent too. I think Ubisoft should stick to this formula, cause that Frontline battle royale idea they had is absolute garbage and will without a doubt ruin this franchise.

The further you get into this exploitative,  lootbox-based product, the worse the writing gets. It gets worst of all with the absolutely awful crossover missions which are quite literally intended to promote ANOTHER lootbox-infested Ubisoft product, that being [i]Rainbow 6 Siege.[/i]

[h1]Lootboxes[/h1]

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2924173593

This game has a monetization system which is WORSE than the [i]Far Cry[/i] games in that it locks popular weapons like the AK-74 ENTIRELY behind lootboxes. If you want an AK-74, you can buy lootboxes. That's it. There isn't even an option to unlock these lootboxes by grinding in the game nor is there an option to purchase the lootbox guns directly. This is literally WORSE than even [i]Call of Duty[/i] as of the last time I played that product.

[h1]Bad writing[/h1]

The writing for this game starts out bad... and then it falls off a cliff. The ending of the story is basically the worst part of the whole game with plot twists which quite literally make no sense and come out of nowhere. It also suffers from a bad case of ""F*** you for caring"" syndrome AKA ""Druckman's disease"" in that it goes out of its way to make you feel let down if you actually made the mistake of caring about the characters.

Oh... but then it gets much worse with the crossover missions intended to hype the ""characters"" in [i]Rainbow Six Seige[/i]... a game that literally doesn't have any characters because it is live service trash with NO story. 

[h1]More hateful, edgelord trash that wasn't even play-tested properly[/h1]

Not only is the trash-tier writing in the crossover abominations gratingly bad (being the product of the same minds that created an unlikable, Mary Sue war-criminal in [i]Far Cry 6[/i] and then tried to convince us that is was ""progressive"" because that particular self-absorbed psychopath was ALSO trans) the several missions this adds aren't even play-tested. 

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2924161803

One of them, about a Mary Sue torture-lady who literally wears a skull mask (this series is written by edgelord children) is riddled with bugs that literally create fail states. (I encountered two different fail-state creating bugs in a single mission in a single-play session that consisted of retrying the SAME mission repeatedly to try to get it to work.) 

Another mission (intended to promote another Ubisoft franchise) has a stealth system so badly implemented that you will literally fail it and thus get stuck in a loading screen when you AREN'T EVEN PLAYING IT! The trash programming creates a fail state that kicks you back to the loading screen the any guard in a HUGE area goes into combat EVEN WHEN YOU AREN'T DOING THAT MISSION and RANDOM NPCs can trigger combat in that area if you are anywhere near it even when you aren't detected yourself.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2926640301

Worse still, as you can see above, this mission even makes you wait until a certain time of day to start. You can't just skip it. You have to wait until the right time... like in Shenmue. 

Even if this worked on a technical level, the hateful, nihilistic and frankly childish writing for a series of side-missions which are basically just designed to promote other Ubisoft products would make them a dubious addition to the game. With the bugs and bad game design though, it actually makes the game WORSE if you buy this DLC because now you can fail missions in the regular game for no reason just because you got close enough to the DLC for the random NPCs to kick you back to the loading screen.

This garbage shouldn't exist. In fact, it was experiencing the horror of these crossover missions that finally motivated me to get around to reviewing this despicable product. 

[h1]This makes me sad...[/h1]

I honestly would have liked to recommend this game because with the exception of the rushed stealth system and the buggy crossover missions, this DOES have the bones of an unmatched military shooter. However, those are buried beneath microtransactions and writing so bad that it is almost ""iconic'. 

I can't recommend this game because between the microtransactions, the garbage writing, and the broken stealth system, this game made me very angry even BEFORE I got to the utter trash that is the crossover missions.

There is no tactic at all, enemies just keep spawning until you complete the objective, you are really under gunned and under powered. The no including of smoke grenades is really a miss, you have flashbangs in a game where probably %90 takes place outside in open fields but no smoke grenade?. Until you are detected every shot no matter which gun no matter which body part it is, is a one hit kill and after you get caught and all enemies start to take 4-5 shots ehhh? every gun is the same functions the same is the same gun, the look changes.
Ghost recon future soldier had these arena type battles where not only positioning but also load outs had to be specifically build, managing your squadmates to cover your flanks was pretty important Tactical shooting it was But here it plays like GTA games with tactical aspekts.

Far Cry itch -- but less guns blazing more stealk

Gunsmith makes no sense / acquiring new gun mods
You'll most likely use the same three guns the entire game, if not switching out the AR

But, objectively, this game is one of the least polished, most poorly made, and disappointing games I have ever played from a major studio. I am legitimately surprised that Ubisoft let the game go at this state. Well, maybe I shouldn't be.

Ignoring all the intentional decisions, one major issue with the game that you will likely notice is the impressive amount of bugs. I encountered some ""minor"" issues such as:

- Clipping textures
- Complete dialogue malfunctions (Voice lines playing from wrong character, wrong voice lines playing, same voice line playing multiple times, etc.)
- Needlessly far/oddly inconvenient vehicle spawns 
- Occasional stutters

And more. I can personally overlook bugs like those. What I can't overlook, though, is the absolutely mind-boggling amount of game-breaking bugs, glitches, and issues I encountered in my playthrough. These included:

- Missions disappearing from map
- Enemies detecting and shooting you through solid cover
- AI teammates/NPCs being stupid, (i.e. walking right in front of you while you are shooting)
- Vehicles exploding spontaneously, with no external damage

And many, many more. Unfortunately, my issues with the game don't end with the bugs (that are still not fixed, over 5 years after release). There are also some issues that come from conscious choices made during development, that reflect the lack of effort from Ubisoft to actually put real effort into this game.

The performance that I had playing this game on PC was laughable. Even on the lowest settings, I could only achieve 80-90 FPS maximum (In very rare cases) and in certain environments I would see frame drops down to the low 20s, with the stutters that I mentioned earlier. I had averages from 40-60 FPS, which is very low for my hardware when compared to other, similar games. Although I expected this game to be demanding, I see no reason that this runs so poorly even when compared to other Ubisoft games of similar (or better) visual quality.

The story of GRW I felt was very uninspired and generic. The characters can be forgettable, and the voice acting is HORRIBLE. Seriously. The main character sounds like a 17 year old doing his best ""generic military guy"" impression, complete with cringe-worthy humor. (If I hear the word ""s***balls"" come out of his mouth one more time, I think I might go insane)

The gameplay, while fun at times, really suffers from a lack of creativity. While you do technically have ""hundreds of hours"" of content in the game, it really only consists of hundreds of repetitive, mundane, and generic missions. Some of my least favorite were the stealth missions. You would think that the company responsible for Splinter Cell would have good ones, right? Well, I wholeheartedly believe that this game was just not made for stealth gameplay. Annoying enemy placement, bad AI, and no unique stealth mechanics make most of the stealth sections in this game either barely a challenge, or near impossible when combined with additional requirements like ""Do not kill any enemies"".

I also have to mention the multiplayer issues I faced. Due to Ubisoft's magnificent networking prowess, you will probably have better luck trying to scam Bill Gates with a phishing email than you will trying to get into a co-op session with your friend(s). We were CONSTANTLY plagued with random network errors every time we booted up the game, and short, 15 minute sessions quickly became 10 minutes of restarting the game and pressing random options, hoping the game would let us join each other. And that is assuming that Ubisoft servers are currently online, which itself is not guaranteed.

I can't end the review without at least a couple positives though. Ubisoft did an amazing job bringing such a large map to life, while still giving each section variety. I also do think that the ""mexico cartel leader takedown"" game format has a lot of potential and if adapted to be a more linear experience, (Maybe inspiration from Sicario?) could work very well.

Overall, even though I did have fun playing this game, I have to realize that it was probably only because I played the co-op campaign with a close friend. I have to think that if I had purchased this game for solo play only, I would have refunded it very quickly. For this reason, I can't recommend it to most people, especially at the insane normal pricing of $49.99. Get it on sale if you want some co-op fun with friends.",1674504298,1674688694,False,1,0,0.48098108172416687,1,True,False,False

but anyway overall its a very good game BUT the game was not polished in any manner 
you'll face tons of bugs,issues and such also enemies are ridiculously overpowered they wont miss a single shot 
at first i thought i wasted my money on this but after 20 hrs i actually realized how to play this game in the way it supposed to be played at, game offers a very astonishing and huge world to look at with vary biomes 
the game gunplay is nothing compared to breakpoint but the overall game mechanics are still better and the old classic flight mode is shining and wish i could have the same thing in breakpoint so surely use the classic settings 
IIRC you can't no longer get your hands on the pvp and online things because of the states of the servers but you can still play it as coop it can be tricky a lil bit since you can encounter some initial errors but it's still totally playable and if you want to truly enjoy this game make sure to play it in the stealth mode since chaos will only cause you rage quit and throw swear words at the developers also look for the top rated guns on the map to unlock them it will make your experience alot easier

it is mostly a boring game ,somethings seems very polished and somethings very much not, parts of the AI seems very wonky,your computer controlled buddies playing on the train tracks and then trying to revive each other while the train runs them all over, or the civilians when they are in vehicles they do not care about firefights

I have had a few glitches the soft-lockand stuff like one of your guns suddenly stop doing damage in a firefight but the other guns works fine?
I have clipped though the world in a few places some of them very close to places you are expected to be, as in right up against the wall of an enemy compound 
the vehicles looks nice there are lots to chose between but they feels like moving on ice most of the time at least the airborne ones feels okey, but then again up there you do not expect friction 

as for the story it is just as stale and empty as any Ubisoft / Tom Clancy game there is one but it might as well not be there, it feels very must like they just one there because there is suppose to be one

4. Terrible vehicle control

- the AI has wallhack after engagement and often shoots through walls/objects
- your car/vehicle will cause a traffic jam that spans miles
- AI will ignore a train crossing and drive right into it

- so much content
- ctrl+c - ctrl+v

The campaign has about 50 hours of solid gameplay, but is stretched out to double that. By the end it feels like a chore just to see the real ending, that's near identical to the one you're offered halfway through. 

The crossover content is neat but that's about the freshest parts after the 50 hour mark. It's just so repetitive! I recommend waiting till about 1/3 of the way through to play either of the [spoiler]Splinter Cell or Rainbow Six[/spoiler] missions, and play the other one 2/3rds through just to break up the monotony.

There was also too many issues for running on a high-end system. Task switching out and back caused major stutters until restarting, controller constantly dropping in and out, and crashing to desktop unless XMP was disabled. ([i]It was only in this game, my system runs everything else fineâ½[/i])

If you're comfortable with not finishing games, then its worth a go, otherwise it just loses the wind from its sails partway through and becomes a lacklustre experience with a disappointing conclusion.

The world is gigantic and diverse. It does quite an amazing job of capturing the beauty of Bolivia - as well as many different ecosystems. You can go from dense forest, to swamps, to desert, tundra, to a frozen snowy lake. The story is really intriguing, and makes you feel a part of it. It certainly has DAYS of game-play because the map is SO big, so many things to do (Collecting weapons, skills, badges, doing side missions, etc.) that it can be overwhelming. I've seen some comment on the repressiveness even, but I would say of course that is going to happen with a game that requires so much play-time.

I picked this up way before when couple of my mates recommended me that I should play coop with them. But I never really got around until a little over a week ago and now i'm at 75 hr mark. My background is that i played none of the ghost recon before and first ever ubisoft game that i played was ACO so i'm not one of those old kids who knew ubisoft at their heights.

I quite liked ACO for all its flaws so quite naturally, I quite like this game. Its still this usual ubisoft open-world bullshit where there's a lot of markers, wall banging mechanics and shitty dialogue, Just like AC:Odyssey you have your little drone and mark targets, go in and kill everybody.. rinse and repeat, again, not very deep. Run of the mill Ubisoft game. You stab people in their buttholes in AC:Odyssey; Here you drop them with guns. 

The part that sold me in both of those game is the world that we traverse in. Just like Greece, Bolivia in this game is beautiful from lush jungles to dessert and it brings a lot of role playing and immersion to the table. Basically the virtual tourism as the world, the terrain is designed very realistically and quite fun to explore. Because of this rich atmosphere, the role playing aspect is quite fun too. Not that one has to but if you wish to run like those green berets from ""clear and present danger"" movie, you can. If you want to run like Alejandro from Sicario movie? you can. 

Not so good parts of the games are present with every ubisoft games. Its bloated, too long at times so you might get bored if you're not very thrilled to walk and take in the scenery. Ubisoft games are basically the McDonalds of gaming. 

So, are you bored with games and dunno what to play? this game is the perfect side chick for you.",1673950404,1673950404,True,25,3,0.725507974624633789,0,True,False,False

Another thing that I hate about this is CRASHES 100% if you return to the menu from Ghost Mode, how do you even manage to do that??? For me, there is nothing challenging in the Ghost Mode, it just shows how retarted your are playing the campaign again, get serious like you're playing Arma 3, and hope you die for good. 

The store is a microtransaction with non-sense guns on sale that you can actually grind more or get chances to open Prestige or Spec Ops crates which completely useless. If you want to quick skip over your components or your guns you can always buy it when you enter Ghost Mode so you dont have to look for them again in the game.

What I can say from this is that if you want to have a family-friendly fun experience with your team, go for normal mode. Its better to do solo in Ghost Mode to grind for those exoskeleton things because the AI can teleport to heal you at any moment than your teammates (remember CoD: Advanced Warfare?) that doesn't look appeal at all because thats the only purpose that you must do. No comments on PvP. Anyways, absolute minimum improvements from DLCs and free missions. Although I only have average hours on this but I got lots of good and bad experience playing solo and with friends. I can't say if I recommend this or not to new people but it depends on your personal flavor.

[Update Jan 16 2023] I have finished the game before and decided to play a lot more Ghost Mode after getting a 3070 Ti laptop. Unfortunately, the game has been always somewhat performance issue and such since the day I played on 1060, and I was unlucky to have the game crashed so many time and each time after around 15-20 mins and I cannot figure out why. Like I love the game but holy when will things be fixed since ... forever and now 30 series having crashing issues are BIG PROBLEMS and its not even uncommon!!!",1511452951,1673935321,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Multiplayer, the shenanigans I've gotten up to with buddies has far outweighed the cons. Difficulty, this game is very easy unless you choose to add certain limitations to your own gameplay, I highly recommend playing with minimal HUD, on advanced difficulty to truly enjoy the scenery and atmosphere, being able to watch exactly where enemies are is simply far too easy, guiding my friend through a base using utility drone skills is truly satisfying.

Pros-
Multiplayer - seamless, drop-in and out, really a necessity in my opinion.
Customisation - Down to the trigger mechanism of your weapon, you can really refine your tools to match your playstyle.
Breadth - The game is massive, repetitive at times but the size and variance lies in the missions and regions.
Multiple difficulties - As you progress you will find it easier to enter and complete objectives in the higher difficulty regions, this is where the fun truly lives, it is challenging and rewarding.

Cons-
Ally AI - Garbage, not fun, more of a safety net than a tool at your disposal.
Repetition - The missions outside of the main objectives are copy pasted to different areas, they are brief however and doesn't detract too far into mediocrity.
Enemy AI - Stealth is a bit easy, but frankly, you can make this harder with difficulty settings.
Vehicle Physics - Batshit retarded, hilarious but awful, I didn't personally mind but don't expect much at all.

OVERALL -
Play this with friends, set your difficulty higher, minimize the HUD, don't take it too seriously and you will have a truly unique and immersive experience the way that I believe the game was meant to be played, this is Tom Clancy's Far Cry.",1517018652,1673858226,True,17,2,0.626163125038146973,1,True,False,False

You are an elite soldier in a foreign country and your job is to either kill the bad guys or steal their stuff because... well, they are the bad guys who must be stopped. No need for diplomacy, no need for asking any more questions. 

Tactical combat play is solid, some nice features here like the drone exploration. Combine that with generic story, generic quests, generic characters, generic dialogues and a highly detailed world, which would have been a great opportunity to learn something about not so far Bolivia, its people, its culture on the fly, but no. Detailed environments are just non-interactive scenery for the ""ultimate military shooter experience"". And shooting, sneaking, driving, flying you can, ""total freedom"" they say and even physical limits are not unviolable.

Wildlands is a fun game; however, it is very buggy with badly designed interface. It spawns vehicles that immediately blow up because the spawn point happens to randomly coincide with some other vehicle or obstacle. It uses save check points, which is the worst trop in video game design. In this particular game it will lock you in a fail loop if you happen to make a mistake during the mission. The game will fail you, and spawn you right back in to the point of failure, fail the mission, reload, spawn in to the point of failure, fail the mission and so on in a loop. The only way to get out of it is to completely restart the game. If you happen to not complete a mission (because you had to quit the game and leave the computer, or you fail the mission at some unlucky way) the game will keep spawning enemy cars on top of you immediately as you load and instantly kill you, or when you are locked in a preset dialogue animation and can't fight back. Reload, span cars and so on in the loop. This game requires you to be connected to Ubisoft servers that are no longer maintained and it gives you a connect error for about 80% of connection attempts. The support as usual blames that on firewalls or routers, but this happens even if you turn of all firewalls and put your computer in to DMZ. (Do not do that). This game will not be patched. All development is stopped on it. There are no fixes and never will be. So even though it is a lot of fun when it is working it is more trouble than fun when it does not. And most of the time this game is a load of frustration. Avoid this title and spend your money on something else.",1673465833,1673465833,False,0,0,0.452961653470993042,0,True,False,False

Long-awaited game as for me & it met my expectations. 
But due to the poor game support I didn't buy 2nd Season pass.

I think it could be much better than now if developers made their maximum effort.

become 3 not 4 because:
1. poor game support
2. a lot of BUGS and ERRORS
3. game crashes sometimes with multiple errors
4. PVP servers lags sometimes and game freezes

Unfortunately at the end of the day it is simply not what itÂ´s being advertised as - you do not get that much freedom on deciding the approach you take during missions apart from stealth or not stealth - no multiple solutions (or perhaps I misunderstood the promises).

Even after soon 5 years from it's release date on March 7 2017 it still has issues with the connectivity and game crashes.

I was booted from online session and could not go online until I found a reddit post mentioning that you first had to access the ingame store before you could go online.

On my second attempt during the 2 hour deadline steam has to be eligible for refund for any purchased game, my game crash right smack middle of the COOP mission and made us restart the entire session for us to continue from scratch.


For my third and final attempt to give the game a chance me and my friend tried a open world mission of stopping a medical convoy, and oh boy here you could really see the issues that still plauges this game to this day. Issue number 1: The objective was not showing at the same location when we tried to shoot it. My friend has the objective behind us according to the map and could not see the escort at all, while for me I could see the escort but not damage it.

Issue number 2: Glitching, when we found out that the open world mission was scuffed, we stole a car and immediately two AI vechiles with miniguns and 4 bots in each spawned, these we could bearly kill and that was due to I could not use any guns. I was still stuck in the car animation when leaving the car which prohibited any use of weapons and could only be fixed if both parties died and reset the checkpoint.

Issue number 3: Bad performance even on newer rigs.
Even with latest Intel I5 processor and 3070 GTX card the game run like garbage and both me and my friend and to downscale the graphics to high to be some what playable.

Conclusion: Not recommended even if it's on sale! There is no excuse for such a big game developer to not have fixed these type of issues even after soon five years from release.

Played exclusively in online co-op and this is downright one of the worst online experiences I have ever had with a game. 2 out of 3 attempts you can't connect to the Ubisoft servers, and when you finally manage to do it the desync between you and the ones you're playing with is mad.  To add insult to injury, the terrible spawn logic towards the later parts of the game makes you spawn in with hostiles just around the corner already spotting you.

Do not buy. Ubisoft will surely shut down the servers soon anyhow and that's a good thing.",1672948004,1672948004,False,3,0,0.507595479488372803,1,True,False,False

I started this game during the Covid. But this game kept me happy and didn't let me to think or worry much bout the pandemic. Man ...life was going so great for. 
Vast amount of missions , character , explorable areas and the mighty story itself was astonishing .
Every single thing of this game was mind chilling . The detailing is so accurate and the way it represented the country Bolivia was nothing but pure skill and talent . I came to know bout Bolivia through This game .
I truly want to visit Bolivia to experience the breath taking beauty of it.
        Back then Ubisoft knew how to make a proper game .
So , thanks a lot to Ubisoft for making some of my best memories of my whole life.
