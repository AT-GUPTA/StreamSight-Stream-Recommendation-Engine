-Muito foco no combate e, mesmo assim, é um combate chato e repetitivo;
-Puzzles que você resolve apertando botão. Não estou exagerando, o puzzle é ""resolvido"" apertando botão várias vezes bem rápido e se não for rápido, aparecem mais guardas para ter mais combate repetitivo;
-Estória (sim, escrevi correto), MEHH. Espero sinceramente que o livro seja melhor do que o jogo, pois a estória do jogo é muito fraca. ""Aí, perdi minhas memórias"", ""Perdi minha reputação"", ""Não conte para ninguém que o assassino do rei tem uma característica igual a minha, mesmo depois que eu já fui acusado de mata-lo"". Simplesmente não me impressionou nem um pouco. Até Baldur´s Gate tem estória melhor, sendo que Baldur´s Gate é focado em personagem, em equipe, não em estória.

Apesar de tudo que eu falei, o jogo tem sim seus pontos positivos, apenas não é um jogão memorável que você vai querer conversar com seus amigos sobre ele depois que parar de jogar. Se estiver em promoção, pode valer a pena para passar o tempo.

After much heard about Witcher, I decided to play. It's not a bad game (I wish there was a neutral recommendation in Steam) but very disappointing.

-Too much focus on combat and, even then, is a boring and repetitive combat;
-Puzzles you solve by pressing button. I'm not exaggerating, the puzzle is ""solved"" by pressing button several times very fast and if it is not fast enough, then appear more guards to have more repetitive combat;
-Story is mehh. I sincerely hope that the book is better than the game, because the story of the game is very weak. ""There, I lost my memories,"" ""I lost my reputation,"" ""Do not tell anyone that the king's killer has a feature like mine, even after I was already accused of killing him."" the story just did not impress me at all. Even Baldur's Gate has a better story, being that Baldur's Gate is focused on character, in a team, not in storytellying.

Despite everything I said, the game has some positives, it is just not a memorable game that you will want to chat with your friends about it after you stop playing. If it is on sale, it may be worth to pass the time.",1645812177,1645812177,False,2,0,0.453722357749938965,0,True,False,False

So far I played (Dude, I already played 100 minutes and am STILL at the ...dunno really: Introstory?), it runs a bit better. Even though its full of glitches.
The fighting system is still overloaded with more or less complicated and unintuitive actions. Sure its not a problem if you keep in mind what all the number keys do and can press them blindly in real time. 
The story might become cool and the world might become ""open"" later, but how should I reach this point if I bore my 455 off till then? Surely interesting for people who love memorizing the whole Lord of the Rings books word by word.

I like how smartly it is written, how logical everything is there. I can see what people mean when they say witcher is gounded, even tho it has elves, and dwarfs and dragons and magic etc. It's the world. Things follow their own logic it's nice.

Unlike witcher one, the fighting here is bit better, bit more responsive even tho I still have no clue how do I trigger the cutscene kills.

But anyways I basically play this out of curiosity. Same it was for W1 and it will be same for W3.

I do recommend if you have similar motivations, or if you like fantasy. This seems like the must game for fantasy nerd.

Oh yeah it freezes after the end of chapter one. Change memory from very large to large or lower and disable fullscreen, that did the trick for me - after rageuninstalled it xD",1645304617,1645371828,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

But overall I still recommend this for people who are interested in what happened before Witcher 3, but only if you are committed to learning Witcher 2's combat.

First off, this is the shortest Witcher game out of the trilogy, even when I took my time and did a large majority of the side quests. My first play through (dark difficulty, 2nd hardest) took about 17-20 hrs. However, the story that is here is really well written and the characters stand out as living beings with real motivations. The game starts off with a prologue, has three acts (with your faction choice in Act 1 impacting where you are in Act 2), and an epilogue. I personally preferred Roche as I found him more enjoyable than Ioverth, but to each their own.

Combat is the main reason there were times I hated this game. The combat once mastered can feel really satisfying, but I think combat falters in two main areas. 1) Whenever the game confines you into a small space with numerous enemies and 2) The prologue (first time play throughs). In small spaces you can see more prevalent how animations and damage do not sync up correctly. Even though it does not appear on your screen that an enemy hit you, the damage will often times still register on the battle log. This can be extremely frustrating on Insane difficulty as you only have one life, but it just teaches you that for most combat encounters, rolling and Quen are your friends. And as for the prologue, it's only really a problem when you first play the game because you're still trying to get accustomed to Witcher 2's combat. Just be prepared to restart your last checkpoint a lot during this part of the game.

Unfortunately, this game seems to crash more often than I would have liked. I think part of this is that if you have too many save files and try to go through them, the game will crash after like 3-4 saves deleted. Other than that, the game occasionally crashes during/after cutscenes and sometimes during gameplay.

Overall Witcher 2 is a good game and I did enjoy a vast majority of my time in this game. But again. for people who want to get into the Witcher franchise I would recommend Witcher 3. For many people they may be turned off by the combat and its a shame, because they should still at least read up on the story because it is a good one. Unless you want to play through Witcher 2 and see the events of the game for yourself, you can just look up the plot of the game and watch some videos from sections of the story.",1611633288,1645048463,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The witcher 2 saw huge improvement compared to the first installment of the game;  upgraded graphics, you can meditate whenever and wherever you want, dialogue decisions matter more....... and ..... I thinks that's it.
Now to the downsides of the game, which are a lot. 
I completed the game in dark mode, and I can clearly say that combat in this game is utter garbage. The sign cast animation nullifies your reflexes. Back-stab damage can one shot you. I don't know who set the hit-boxes in this game but he clearly did a poor job, you take hits even though you dodged and escaped, so you always have to keep a safe distance when fighting, cause the dodge is not a complete invulnerability.
Pebbles can block Geralt's advancement and deny rolls, so even if you see an empty space you can escape to when in a pinch, don't get your hopes up, a rock on the path may think otherwise.
Acquiring armor sets and such can be a tedious and annoying task because of the huge sums of money you have to collect in order to buy the patterns, buy or craft the missing ingredients you need and paying the absurd commission to craft an item.
Acquiring money in this game is quite delicate, since merchants won't pay good prices for your goods and will tore apart your pocket and suck you money dry when you try to buy something. The most effective method I found is arm wrestling.
Now that you have the armor set, every time you fight with a life-steal weapon, the game will put a black filter on the screen. Why ? I have no idea.
I won't rant about the quests/journal system, I did worse (*wink* *wink* morrowind players ;) ), but what I can say is that the game won't show you quests locations, so you have to talk to every NPC you encounter.
Traveling in this game is slow.

My recommendation would be to avoid dark mode, play on normal difficulty or less and just enjoy the main story.",1628282081,1644967447,True,2,0,0.520112931728363037,0,True,False,False

In this second part of the The Witcher saga we are going to find ourselves in a different situation: the plot becomes more political and strategic than in the previous game with the aggravating circumstance that our witcher suffers from amnesia, a situation that will complicate the decisions when choosing whom to trust.

It begins with the murder of King Foltest and his killer, to whom we will persuit until the end of the game.
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1887028187
This story will put us in uncomfortable situations where we will be forced to choose which friend to betray just to reveal a tiny part of a spider web made of magic and swords.

The characters that we will find will be more severe and cruel than the ones we've already meet, they will makes us feel that killing the Grand Master was just childs play.

Again we will have to choose a side: Iorveth and the Elves or Vernon Roche and his group of spies to the service of the king; both resentful beings and full of secrets. 

Each decision we make will make us reach only one of the 16 different endings that this game offers.

If you follow the path of Iorveth, you'll have the chance to play the story among magical beast and for more hours, while chosing the path of Roche you'll play less hours but the gameplay will be harder and enganging to the story line.
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1475597979
The best thing to do is to play it twice, choosing each time a different path this way you'll get to know the story of the characters that you find in each way.

This time Geralt is tired of the political arguments and the deceiving plans of the sorceresses, exhausted to try to stay aside of the neverending problems.

Remember this: everything that you did in the first game has its consecuences in the second and it will them on the third. The witcher personality is the one you build with your choices, forging his character and destiny.

En esta segunda parte de la entrega de la saga The Witcher vamos a encontrarnos en una situación diferente: la trama se vuelve mas política y estratégica que en la entrega anterior con el agravante que nuestro brujo sufre de amnesia, problema que complicará el desarrollo de los hechos al momento de elegir en quien confiar.

Comienza con el asesinato del Rey Foltest y a cuyo asesino perseguiremos hasta el final de la historia.

Esta historia nos pondrá en situaciones incomodas, forzándonos a elegir a que amigo traicionar para revelar solo una pequeña parte de la telaraña que se teje entre espadas y magia.

Los personajes con los que nos encontraremos serán mas severos y crueles que los que ya habíamos conocido, haciéndonos sentir que enfrentar al Gran Maestre fue solo un juego de niños.

De nuevo tendremos que elegir un bando: Iorveth por el lado de los Elfos y Vernon Roche por el lado de su majestad. Ambos seres resentidos y llenos de secretos.

Cada decisión que tomemos hará que lleguemos solo a uno de los 16 finales diferentes que este juego ofrece.

Seguir el camino de Iorveth nos brindara la posibilidad de vivir la historia entre bestias mágicas y tener mas horas de juego, mientras que al elegir el camino de Vernon Roche, el tiempo de juego sera mas corto pero también sera mas duro y comprometido en cuanto a la trama.

Lo mejor es jugarlo dos veces al menos para obtener ambos puntos de vista y conocer las historias ocultas de los personajes que rodean a cada uno de los lideres de bandos.

Esta vez te encontrarás con un Geralt harto del manejo político y las trampas de las hechiceras, agotado por intentar mantenerse al margen de los problemas que parecen nunca terminar.

Recuerda: todo lo que hiciste en el primer juego tuvo consecuencias en el segundo y las tendrá en el tercero. La personalidad del brujo es la que vos le das, son tus elecciones, tus decisiones las que forjan su carácter y su destino.",1644181075,1644181075,True,24,0,0.744170963764190674,2,True,False,False

The graphics are simply the best ever seen in an RPG to date, if not the best that we have so far in any game (compare to Crysis if you want to). The flaws are few if any. The stealth sections are not the best, but they are optional, and there are a few bugs and such. There is no ACTUAL character customization, but you can change what the protagonist is wearing with quite a bit.
The combat system works quite well. It may not be the best combat system in gaming history, but it does exactly what is is supposed to do. But all that is just beside the point.

The next time I tried it, it felt like one of the best games I've played and I can't put it down. Two things that really changed my experience with the game: 

1) The combat system is horrible at once. It feels clunky and awkward. Then you become skilled at it and it feels wonderful and dynamic. Stick with it. You're going to be constantly involved in 5 on 1 type scenarios where a few hits can kill you. You need to hit and run, immobilize, use traps, and generally be more creative in combat.

The game from the start tells well, allowing you to integrate your save from The Witcher and find out where some previous characters left, and current ones remain. You will be subtly reminded of your past through NPC's, reminding you of who you are and what you have done throughout the world. Although it was a great story, it did feel short compared to the Original and like it lacked much depth, but overall, it was delightful. 

The gameplay mechanics are fantastic; continue with a similar levelling system as the original, meaning you can choose if you want to be more assertive with the sword, wise with your signs or strategic with your portions. The fighting mechanics were great. Being able to pick your targets, place traps, and be sneaky was a fantastic feeling that made you feel a part of the moment. 

The graphics for a 10-year-old game are fantastic, considering this is the enhanced edition. The game felt well optimised, playing on my laptop with a GTX1650 on my 55"" HD TV. Also, with the combination of the Nvidia GeForce Experience,  it was immersive. 

The main fault I could quickly point out is the map on the game. It lacked detail and was confusing when trying to find your way around the cave in Chapter 1 and the entire map of chapter 3. But overall, once you do some exploring, you get used to the layout and find your way. 

I played using the Steam Controller. Switcher this to the gamepad mode and change the game controls to focus on a controller. The simplicity was fantastic. It took a while to get used to a touchpad as a thumbstick. However, it gave an advantage in combat after a while. 

Based on the gameplay, graphics and story, I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys Lore and is new to the Witcher series. 8/10.",1643973183,1643973183,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[url=youtu.be/GDYZDeBhF7A] The Witcher 2 : Assassins of Kings REVIEW [/url]

A decade ago back in 2010 & 2011
the AAA games of the RPG category were

[b] 2010: [/b]
i) Red Dead Redemption 
ii) Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood
iii) God of War 3
[b] 2011: [/b]
i) Batman Arkham City
ii) The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim
iii) Darks Souls
iv) Uncharted 3
v) Assassin's Creed: Revelations

[b] Introduction: [/b]

Now let’s come to the actual review it leaves me utterly shocked that The Witcher 2 had to compete with such a list of legendary games of their time back in 2010-2011, each one of the games mentioned above were major hits, minus one or two.

Being a crazy Witcher 3 fan in the back of my mind I kept on comparing it with its sequel obviously which is unfair, I kept on telling myself NO just NO, but the more I played the more I wanted to play it further. 

[b] Story: [/b]

The story of Witcher world is without any doubt one the best fantasy stories written from its lore to its smallest character. The same is the case of The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings. It seems as if you are actually living the journey and believe me playing its sequel beforehand numerous times, it makes so much sense. It's mind blowing, almost like huge blanks of the Witcher 3 story are getting filled in your brain, From the origins of The Wild Hunt to the rarity and dying professions of Witchers. Then something which boggles your mind in TW2, is the two extreme sides of Witchers, one being Geralt a chivalrous Witcher who is all for good deeds and as he claims choosing the lesser evil, then we have Letho, Auckes & Serrit ex Witchers from the School of Viper who have become assassins &  puppets of the power players of the Continent i.e. Kings & Mages etc.

I would give the story a solid 10 of 10.

[b] Gameplay: [/b]

When it comes to gameplay mechanics in the beginning repeatedly I would keep on telling myself again and again, stop comparing it with The Witcher 3 and the newer RPG games which came after it. The gameplay to my surprise was quite good actually, you get used to Geralt kind of playing dance with his sword and whirling. The way Geralt ran / Walked it seemed a tad bit unrealistic, the Witcher signs and how they worked seemed even better than TW3. The monster attacks were almost at par to that of the TW3 I would say way less annoying. I like the random TW2 monsters they're way less aggressive and deadly, especially the Drowners. It's kind of a let-down how Geralt doesn't jump, which RPG games of 2010 & 2011 RPG characters did jump, also I missed not having roach and no fast travelling, which meant a lot time was spent just walking but at the same time it is not a full open world game like the countless games which came after it. A flaw which used to frustrate me was that Geralt would use the wrong sword and you had to switch to your other sword mid fight / combat.

I would give the gameplay 7.5 out of 10

[b] Interface: [/b]

The interface of TW2 is probably the worst things about this game, don't even get me started how badly the map sucked. You literally had to zoom in and then it would be of no use would leave the player further confused and the legends / markers on the map made no sense what so ever. When it came to Alchemy, brewing & drinking potions it was not as easy as it should have been. Now let’s talk of the loot and crafting items. There was loot with you which made no sense what so ever as they were quests items which you needlessly held on even though that quest line was over ages ago. Thankfully crafting your gear was quite easy and not that complicated.  The journal was quite simple and easy to navigate, to figure out your Quests and other important stuff.

I would give the interface a 4 out of 10

[b] Optimization: [/b]

When it comes Optimization it's not just the stability it’s the entire graphical as well the technical aspect which I could understand or think off. My opinion is games and their stability / optimization should only be given a judgment upon on their initial release like a month or two Max, which is pointless after a decade. I have an i9 9900k, RTX 3070Ti & 32GB Ram, I play all my games at native 4K with G - Sync on. The game worked perfectly but in certain situations it felt as if it had a clash going on with my multiple monitor setup, then it has a bug in which after the end of chapter 1 the game gets stuck on the loading screen, it only gets resolved when you play that same quest on the windowed mode, then it never occurs again. Talking about the graphics they're really good for 2011. I am not going to dwell on the fact what I didn't like about the graphics as it's irrelevant my assumptions are totally based on my minds comparison with latest games. I would end by talking about the sound a bit, the Background music was truly artistic and never went out of synchronization with the visuals. A job well done by the creative and sound team.

I would give the Optimization 7 out of 10

[b] Conclusion: [/b]

I would recommend this game to every RPG player especially if they looking for both a storyline and gameplay. Mind you, if you play this then you have to play TW3 which is something else entirely. The TW3 players who haven't played TW2 you have to try it out but mind you, tune your mind and please think you live in 2011 otherwise you will compare it with newer games and would fail to enjoy. I am definitely going to go for another TW3 playthrough.

I am going to give the The Witcher 2 : Assassins of Kings a total of 7 / 10. I wish I could give it more but there are certain things which can't be ignored.",1643555005,1643555152,True,239,5,0.911653101444244385,38,True,False,False

The character development, dialogue, and quests are all so fulfilling and engaging. There were a few quests that felt tedious, but I honestly feel as though this game's pacing is on point. I almost feel like games have lost sensible pacing. This is definitely up there for me. It's firmly next to TW3, GTA V, RDR2, Quantum Break, AC Odyssey, and AC Origins. Those games to me are master pieces and are undeniably some of the best games ever created. There are very few games that I've absolutely dreaded completing, and this was one of them.

That's how I could describe this game in a nutshell. Of course, if you start playing Witcher 2 after completing the Witcher 1, then those stylish modern animations could easily distract you during the tutorial. But allow me to explain you what I liked about this game and what I dislike about it.

So, what I like about the game:
[list]
    [*]Plot. The game is incredibly ambitious. Despite its focus on Geralt's personal quest and not so much on a global conflict it still remains grandiose. Obviously it still is the good ol' Witcher with its critical choices. Those choices play the main role in the story as the entire Chapter could differ completely;
    [*]Locations. Every location is unique and rich with its visual storytelling and quests they have. You'll spend a great amount of time walking around and exploring every single turn. Each location in each chapter has its own atmosphere, its own colour-grading and its own ""landmark"", something you can remember about it;
    [*]Characters. They are incredibly complex. Every character you meet is played and portrayed as an actual human being with their own beliefs (Unlike some characters from the previous Witcher game). There are no good or bad people, they all have a story and you can and/or will explore.
[/list]
And what I did not like about the game: 
[list]
    [*]Mechanics. At first, I wanted to include only swordfighting, but then I remembered those horrendous hitscans, which connect when they shouldn't and don't when they should. It makes dodging absolutely pointless (It can be useful is you're speedrunning the game as those rolls are faster than running). And if you're playing the game on higher difficulties this can prove absolutely impossible to play with;
    [*]Skill-tree. Character levelling, sometimes, can prove pointless. I don't remember spending many skill-points into alchemy and oftentimes I resorted to only using Igni and Yrden most of the time, so I had no reason to upgrade most of those signs whatsoever; 
    [*]Bloom. Even though I kinda liked the graphics in the game, this ugly bloom effect is everywhere and its blinding. My light-sensitive eyes were oftentimes in pain, so I had to download the mod that could decrease the amount of bloom, but I, honestly, didn't see many changes. 
[/list]

I do recommend the game, but it is, definitely not perfect. Get ready to curse at those hitscans if you're willing to play.

The consequences of your choices were ok, though it was't feeling as tense in Witcher 1. I also liked the general fighting mechanic. The following design choices I did not like, but are mostly forgivable if the rest was brilliant and not a total BUG FEST: 
- bad tutorial/prologue (similar to W1 many people don't play past the very beginning, although I even liked the W1 beginning better)
- the potion timer does not stop at dialogues (you can just skip-click through it, but if you actually care about the story you are left without your buff if you have to fight right afterwards, because drinking in combat is not possible)
- the dark outfits (only available in dark mode). a few things: 1.  too expensive for the benefits; 2. not obtainable anymore after certain progress (if you bought only parts because it was too expensive to buy all at once you will have wasted your money); 3. the last one is literally for one fight (unless you enjoy farming, i.e., arm wrestling, it is useless to get just for W2); 4. the obscured visuals as soon as you draw your weapon even after wearing the whole set (very annoying because fastest travel is by rolling after upgrading the skill, which is only possible with a drawn weapon).
- I HATED every second of playing some NPC instead of Geralt

But the main problem is that this game is highly bug infested. Reasons I died: 1 % got attacked while in cut scene; 9 % bad player choices; 90 % because Geralt did not want to use signs with full vigor!!! This was the most annoying thing ever, especially on dark mode where you have to time your damage output before everything one-hits you. ""Oh I know this enemies move set, hit - hit - Aard sign and I should be fine. Or not, let's just stand here and do nothing while I smash all the buttons on my keyboard..."" I couldn't find a pattern. Sometimes they worked sometimes not. Sometimes moving a meter or rolling would ""fix"" it, sometimes not. When you rely on your signs (like when using the mage path) and you are in range of an enemy, just consider yourself dead. And according to several posts on the internet I am unfortunately not the only one with this problem.

Same goes for bugs that will make any further progress impossible. Like, how the hell should I know that somebody programmed Triss to not talk to me if I do not kill the last guy with  sword blow? The game told me the kill was fine but just deleted the option to progress any further...

The minor ""you or a NPC get stuck somewhere and can't move anymore"" things don't even seem worth mentioning now.

Very sad, I really wanted to like this game but there are just too many fatal flaws...

Better than the original game sure but you will get stomped on normal difficulty & potions aren't something you can just chug in a fight.

The Witcher 2 is much shorter than the first game, which is likely due to how much higher the production values are per area. The visuals are vastly improved, and there's a great attention to detail in the environments. They feel extremely realistic and fully envisioned. That said, I do miss the amount of content present in the first title. This game's 3 chapters left me wishing for more, particularly in the side quest department.

I played on easy because I had heard bad things about the combat system, and I'm glad I did. The combat sucks and is stupid, so playing on easy minimizes the amount of time you have to waste on it. I guess trivializing the combat sections might mean that I missed out on some hidden depth that comes with higher difficulty, but I really doubt it.

On a similar note, I used a mod to remove the weight of all items because the inventory management system also looked horrible.

The story is decent. It's certainly well thought out, but it often gets very confusing. It has a ton of names and places to remember, frequently of characters that are only seen once or simply mentioned in passing, but whom you're later expected to be able to identify instantly. This sometimes left me totally lost. The dialogue can also be rather dry in parts, particularly from geralt himself. His voice actor always seems incredibly bored by everything, which I assume is their attempt at making him sound ""cool"" or whatever. I don't think it works very well. The writing is quite good when it gets going, but those moments are sometimes far removed from one another.

There's also the caveat that you can really only experience half the story in one playthrough because of a huge storyline split partway through that completely changes the rest of the game. This is cool in some ways but just annoying in others, since there are a lot of unresolved questions after an entire playthrough.

So yeah, it's pretty good. Not a glowing review, but I'm glad I played it, if only as preparation for the Witcher 3.",1642580056,1642580056,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I get it. A ton of people have an undying love The Witcher 2 that will never be equalled. Let me tell you why, at least on PC, but probably console too, this game is TRASH!

Firstly, its just a terrible port to PC. Here's some of the things you will encounter.
-Game Crashes
-telling you it saved when it hasn't
-corrupted saves
-Freezing
-File integrity compromised
-I don't care if you have a top end PC you're gonna run this on all the lowest settings because REASONS
-Other misc glitches like cut scenes not going how they should, hair glitches, tons of other garbage.

so as if these issues don't make this steaming pile unplayable, there is a HUGE core game issue, that I understand is very divisive. Here it is:

Anyone who tells you the combat isnt COMPLETELY broken is a bold faced liar. They are too in love with the game to admit its faults. Obviously combat more or less IS the game so this is a giant problem. And yes, its possible to overcome the broken comabt system and get through the game. Does not mean its not busted. You'll read stuff online like ""roll around, quick strike and roll away. Think like a Witcher!"" Gimme a break friends. Imagine watching a Witcher or any other person roll around that much in combat. 
It would be ridiculous, and theyd quickly be killed dead. The reason rolling around so much is a must is because its busted ok. Broken. Just accept it.

The menus in this thing, the inventory and equip screens, are just a mess. You're gonna go into that screen to.. whatever.. read a book or equip a new sword, and first thing that happens is you're gonna accidentally unequip your gloves. Every time. Trust me.

The quest organization, mostly in Chapter 2, is super clunky. Different quests overlapping at different times to progress... sometimes resulting in missed steps and broken quests you can't complete cause you didnt do it at just the right time... needlessly confusing and not well set up. The little side quest I pulled off the bounty board shouldn't be able to be half done right away, but I need to progress a little more to finish the last half. I shouldn't need to question a person, thats in a completely different location, but if i stay where I am and question those people first... I lose my chance and cant complete that quest.... sound confusing? It truly is.

The game is backwards too. I'm not sure if this was intentional or not, but the start of the game is way harder than the end. Probably because you learn you have to basically roll your way through every fight more than a snowball rolls down the hill to hell.

The story is fine its whatever its Witcher story. I got through one playthrough on one path (theres two paths that are quite different from what I understand) but I just CANNOT go through the PC challenges you must overcome to get this thing to run and make it all the way through again! I can't do it! I shouldn't have to!

I even read most people can run The Witcher 3 better than this! Its just a hot broken mess with way too many PC issues and a terrible combat system. And yeah I checked the box to allow comments. I bet eventually I'll hear it...  ""its not broken just GITGUD you mofo"" I DID OK!? I DID IT! ITS STILL BROKEN FRIEND! KEEP ROLLING AROUND TELLING ME ITS ALL GOOD! It's not. And even if you do figure out the combat and progress, the other issues are just way too much to make this an enjoyable experience.",1642356772,1642356772,False,5,1,0.489779531955718994,0,True,False,False

- The game seems to take a stand on racism but sees misogyny as unavoidable in the context of the Witcher world. This is shown through various instances of Geralt's choices and actions towards women in the game, but also the portrayal of female NPC's and the scripts.
- The only interactable women in the game are mostly prostitutes and sorceresses, both of them Geralt can use for sexual purposes. The sorceresses seem utterly helpless once Geralt arrives and even need to be rescued at times (arrival in Flotsam where Triss's dialogue, of course, makes mention of Roche touching her ass while being rescued from the ship).
- Male NPC's have a variety of faces and body types, ranging from ugly to attractive. For the female NPC's they seem to have copied the same face and body for literally every character: they are always attractive, big tits, small waist, big ass. The ONLY females that are remotely unattractive or ugly have their main focus point of their interaction based around their appearance. 
- Many dialogues are FULL of sexual and degrading remarks towards women. It gets tiring. Really, it seems like it's the only joke they could come up with in the whole game. 
- NPC's and at times Geralt's dialogue is hateful and sexualizing towards female NPC's in the game. NPC's mention enjoying raping innocent women, countless degrading insults towards prostitutes are being made, also by Geralt. At one point it just becomes annoying.
- The cutscene with Phillipa and Cynthia.... I can't even begin saying how disgusted I am. And this cutscene is proof of CD Projekt Red having utterly no respect for women and dehumanizing them to a point of every woman in the game only existing for sexual purposes. Really, this scene made me sick. It didn't even have any purpose for the lore, am I playing an RPG or a soft porn game??

All in all, a waste of a great game. No wonder so many women get put off from playing video games. And don't say 'oh but it's a medieval fantasy world, misogyny was normal!' because the game actively takes a stance against racism and lets Geralt choose a side on that. But the hatred towards women is something normal? It's a goddamn fantasy world, they could have literally chosen how to portray women in this context.

I love the story, the choices and the characters, and the fact that some choices matter so much that the middle chapter plays completely differently, and you need at least 2-3 playthroughs if you want to know the full story is genious. The length of the game also supports this, it is shorter than the first episode and much shorter than the third. This can be a negative thing for some people, but I prefer smaller worlds and shorter stories than the quantity over quality approach of the Witcher 3 and open world games in general. Yeah, the maps are smaller but greatly designed and dense with points of interests without being crowded. Yeah, you don't have 2154 quests, only a few dozen, but almost all of them are memorable.

The concept of fighting mechanics are really good (unlike the first episode). The character progression leaves room for many playthroughs and really enjoyable. The dialogues and characters are well-written, and  no matter what some people says the game is beautiful even in 2021.

The problem is the technical issues and the clunky controls. 
There are tons of animations that you can't skip / turn off, and makes some gameplay elements frustrating, like the dice poker animations, drinking potions, climbing rocks, disarming traps. There are simply bad design choices like inventory management, waiting after battle so you can grab the loot, interacting with shopkeepers, et cetera.
The main gameplay mechanic is the fighting, which has a lot of possibilities (using traps, bombs, throwing daggers, magic, swords) but is a struggle to learn and it is really easy to mess up due to Geralt not doing what you want him to do. I blame the controller support for this, the developers didn't have enough experience to do it perfectly, but committed to some design decisions which limits the keyboard+mouse controls too (like autolocking, clunky targeting, etc.). The game could've been much more if it was PC-exclusive, but I get it, at the time of the release that would've been a suicide note.

My biggest problems are with the technical issues. From minors like disappearing/teleporting/appearing actors/monsters, to moderate ones like crashes or a few quest bugs to really serious ones: on my third playthrough, I've reached to around 70% of the story, and the game didn't allow saving games anymore after crashed during a load. I've tried deleting saves because I had tons of save files, but that didn't help. I've noticed that if I delete a save slot in the load menu, I can save once, but I need to delete one slot after every save, and the quicksaves/autosaved didn't work. I've reinstalled the game without success. I've tried some steam suggestions and in the end I've lost my entire progress. And no, it wasn't insane difficulty where the save files are locked if you die, I've just started a new game to get the last 3 achievements I've missed on my first 2 run.

So whom I recommend the game to?
- You simply love witcher 3, and want more? You'll most likely find this inferior, or even unenjoyable.
- You've played witcher 3, liked it, but stopped playing because the megalomaniac world size / respawning monster hordes / lacklusting quests? You'll love this game.
- You haven't played with any of the witcher games, but love RPGs+action, or watched the series and wants more of this world with more Geralt and no Ciri? This is the best episode for you.
- You play RPGs mostly for the world/story? Play witcher 1 then continue with this one.
- You are an open world game fan? This isn't for you.",1642286367,1642286367,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Technically it mostly still holds up 10 years later. The only visual issues which you might notice are common to games of that era. There are various mods to fix bugs and the combat if you really dont like it. This game was fully 3D when released but that may not be functional anymore.  

It's a 3 act game, with a prologue and an epilogue, which tells a tale of fantasy political intrigue. There is a faction choice in act 1 which chooses one of two act 2's. That choice also heavily changes act 3. To really get the most out of this game you would need to replay it twice. It isnt a minor replay where you see some other outcomes, you are playing totally different quests in a different zone so dont skip that because it will flesh out the characters and their motivations.

The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings picks up shortly after the events in The Witcher and follows from the attempt on King Foltest's life which occurred in the final cutscene at Witcher 1. Geralt will once again face the mysterious witcher-like assassins, who appear to be connected with a character named in previews as the Kingslayer. After the events that took place in the prequel, Geralt serves under Foltest the king of Temeria as a royal protector or simply as a bodyguard. However, due to an unexpected turn of events, the witcher was unable to prevent the king's assassination, and thus he became accused of the crime. Nonetheless, Geralt manages to escape with the help of Vernon Roche - the commander of a Temerian special forces unit known as the Blue Stripes. After escaping from prison, Geralt needs to go in search of the Kingslayer to clear himself of all charges.

[h1] The Paths [/h1]
In the second part, you have to follow the path of Iorveth or the path of Roche. The characters of the places and the story you see change according to your choice. As someone who has played on both sides, I suggest you choose the Iorveth path first.

[h1] My Thoughts [/h1]
It is an important event that the first game came out quietly and appreciated by the RPG audience, but Witcher 2 was the game that took it to the next level after the first game. Witcher 2 introduced the witcher series to a wider audience. The main thing that makes this game special for me is that it is the game that changes my standards regarding games. Witcher 2 shows me what to expect from an action RPG game. It is a game that you should not miss, especially if you want to learn more about the Lodge of Sorceresses and the political side of the Witcher universe.

Combat is fun and unforgiving at higher difficulties. Though potions are difficult to use, as you can only ingest them before combat, making surprise fights difficult to prepare for.

The story is linear; leaving little room for the player to explore at will and closing off gameplay area after finishing a line of quests, never to return.

Providing a save file, the actions you take in Witcher 1 impact what happens in Witcher 2, which is awesome, and the actions in this game will impact events in Witcher 3. 

For this reason, and to better understand the characters and events that take place in each subsiquent story, it is still rewarding to play through 1&2 before embarking on the Wild Hunt.

if you do it will ruin some of the experiences u will know who lives and who dies etc but that's not the biggest issue compared to the third instalment, Witcher 2 feels very raw and restricting even though open-world it is so linear that few thing that you took for granted like climbing and jumping have been taken away from you and overall it makes the experience so tedious the only open world game that forced to follow a strict path and this will be the first thing you notice, also the game is very short by witcher 3 standards it maybe a plus maybe a minus, I completed the story in medium difficulty with my character max 35 with completed skill tree within 17hours 
Now on positives 
RPG elements are great the choices you make matter significantly.
Combat is pretty similar to witcher too except few signs like yerden, igni i feel like were implemented better,
Also Geralt feels more powerful in 2 than he did in 3 in all departments
Also the story is pretty gripping and emotional and soundtrack is good too even though a bit too repetitive for my liking.
TLDR
Its Basically Witcher 3 but every aspect Witcher 3 was amazing or brilliant at Witcher 2 is Decent at that not bad.
Its a Step Down from Witcher 3 in every aspect as it should be that's why sequels exist to iron out the issues of the first game, But still Witcher 2 is a worthwhile game to play but isn't winning any awards.

First thing you need to understand is that the game effectively has two worthless difficulties that do nothing but turn the gameplay experience into hot garbage. I'm talking about the Easy and the Hard difficulty. If you think ""Oh, dark difficulty looks a little too extreme, and insane is probably even worse"" then you're wrong, but it's not your fault but the devs. Think of the difficulties like this, the developers created three actual difficulties. Normal, Dark and Insane. Dark came later and is my personal recommendation.
The issue with the balancing is that Easy, Normal and Hard are effectively the same difficulty, but stretched in either direction. Easy is way too simple and not the intended difficulty of the game. Normal is fine if you're not that strong of a action game player. Hard is a literal balancing criminal offense, it should not have seen the light of day. It was certainly never playtested and makes Dark and Insane look like easymode. That is the issue of number stretching, if you're curious about why Hard is such a horrible difficulty, let's put it this way. In hard, you take a ton more damage, but the game never provides you with the tools to deal with it properly (only dark mode does that) and so you will pretty much die in two or one hit throughout the entire game, until you reach max level and the strongest armor in the game, even then you will only survive about one or two hits. Enemy health gets upscaled, but your damage remains the same as it does in Easy or Normal, and you can't effectively increase it a substantial enough amount to pair with the increased health pools.
TL;DR: Play either Normal, Dark or Insane (which is a hardcore difficulty, meaning you only have one life and you can not save the game).

Anyway, you probably didn't come here to hear about the negatives. Witcher 2 is the most interesting of the three games. It has a beautiful way of never taking sides. If you side with the seemingly bad side, you will learn that the choice you made may have a more positive impact in the grand scheme of things. If you side with the seemingly good side at first, sticking to judgement based on moral characteristics, you may find that you made the worse choice in the bigger picture. The game never truly tries to put you in a box, never tries to preach about right or wrong. In that way, it does something unique that many other choice based games don't do.

Additionally, the game deserves two playthroughs to get the full experience. In chapter 2, you make a decision to side with the Scoia'tel or the Blue Stripes. Depending on your choice, the entire rest of the game becomes different, the story develops differently and you learn different things about your own past as well as the world around you and its history. If you want to play the entire game, I recommend that you try both paths for yourself.

Overall, I've always felt like Witcher games are the type of games you wish you got to play with a guide next to you, not the cheating walkthrough kind, but a friend who's just sitting beside you and already knows the pitfalls of the game. There are problems in this game, as well as the first and third title of Witcher, and usually you have to make a mistake to know what to watch out for. The second playthrough is always more giving and always more satisfying, and that applies to the entire trilogy. I wish there was some kind of advice available to avoid feeling that way, but it's just true. All of the Witcher games are better on a second playthrough, because you get a sense of what impact your decisions may end up having, and you know how prepared you're expected to be at certain points in the game.

Overall, this game is incredible and my favorite in the series by a long shot. If not just because Ves is the hottest babe in all of videogame history (in my opinion) and you get to flirt and romance her.",1641814343,1641814343,True,0,0,0.477001726627349854,0,True,False,False

I would recommend it to anyone, especially the people looking to play The Witcher 3.

Pros:
- Amazing storytelling
- Combat greatly improved over the first game
- Enough diverse content to keep you fully engaged in all the quests you do and not feeling like you are just grinding
- The decision making feel like it really has an impact on the story
- Never felt repetitive or tedious
- Easy to mod 

Cons:
- Some stability issues (having a lot of saves and the steam cloud ON seems to be reason for it)
- Some bugs (can be patched for the most part with mods)

I recommend you install some mods for graphical improvements and bug fixes, there are also some that will offer quality of life improvements to the gameplay and eliminate some minor outdated design choices as well. Also make sure to use nvidia's DSR (or similar feature) instead of ubersampling since it really kills the FPS.",1641187281,1641187545,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

[b]Rating: 6/10 - fine[/b]

This is the sequel to one of my favorite games ever. Sadly it doesn't fare quite as well as the first witcher game did. The story is good, very good at some moments, and while I only rushed through one of the two possible paths in order to get the achievements I can say that both are worth your time.
The world is beautiful as well with a lot of gorgeous locations and set pieces. Exploration may be limited due to the game not being truly open world but all three of the major locations you visit during the three chapters of the game have many locations worth checking out.
Side quests are pretty well done in this game with many of them having quite interesting and sometimes bizarre stories to tell (looking at you Elthon). Completing them is a lot of fun and doesn't feel like a chore.

The main problem I have with this game is the gameplay itself. Especially combat. Controlling Geralt feels clunky and weird, he will often get stuck on the ground (at least for me). If you play or have played the game you will quickly notice of shitty controlling Geralt feels, especially in combat where unsheathing your sword feels as responsive as a dead cat and where you sometimes attack an enemy you didn't even mean to target at the moment. Thrown on top of that is the piss poor balancing of the game. Even at a higher level and with the best armor in the game fully upgraded you will die in two or three hits from some enemies like the gargoyle. And that's on normal. Now, this wouldn't be a problem if the game wouldn't force you into battles against multiple of them at times. This and many other things make playing on normal or any higher difficulty fairly unenjoyable, at least for me and I do usually play games on the highest difficulty available.
Playing the game on the highest difficulty, Insane is an absolute nightmare since your health bar seems to sometimes just disappear because an enemy hit you with an attack that didn't look like one (happens regularly with some monsters) or because you were hit from behind during a swing.

The only reason why I recommend this game is because it is part of the witcher trilogy and because the story and characters, especially Geralt, are really enjoyable.",1641172789,1641172789,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Yes. 

So much yes. 

Even if you have not the open world experience like in Wild Hunt, you can't deny that the Wild Hunt has a incredible good story. One of the best i've ever played to be honest. And if you say that, you are ready for this game. 

Because the Witcher 2 is also great bc of its story. You have everything - Love, Sex, Violence, Blood, Kings, Death (much Death), Animals, Magic, Swords, Fights, Power... i can go on but you know what the witcher is about.

The gameplay is fine, but the combat system can be terrible at times.

You will randomly do a fast attack on an enemy in the backline that ends up taking longer than a strong attack. You will cast spells at the wrong enemies, miss, then have to retreat and try again. 

If you play games on easy for the story, this game is awesome. If you are a tryhard and like to play them on the hardest difficulity, you will end up getting stuck at 4 different fights due to the failure in the combat system. And only one of them is a real bossfight. 

this game is still awesome and you can pass it if you have played through the darksouls games. but god it can be annoying.

Now in 2021 - I cannot recommend it anymore. It is a good game, but before you invest money and time you have to consider it.
Yes, it is fun. The story and the characters are very good. Geralt is an awesome character who follows his own agenda and nearly all decision are based on his view of the world. You can quickly become the Witcher. 

But the gameplay is bad. The balance is very, very bad. The combat itself is boring or frustrating. They tried to implement a Dark Souls like mechanic (the roll HAVE to be from the game!), but without the deepth or the interesting enemies. You have multiple stats - but at the end I don't know if anyone had an effect. 

The overall story is confusing - so confusing that the final dialog contains a dump of ALL information you need to understand everything. You lost your memory - but your best friends don't talk about the love of your life or your children of suprise at all. They only mention it in one or two sentences. But nothing more! If you read the books or watched the TV series, every main character had someting to do with them. IN this game? Just a small word. 

All in all it is a mess that could be much more. There were multiple crashes, bugs and not completable quests. In the enhanced edition. With some community patches.

Only buy this game if you are in for the story of Geralt and some side characters. Don't buy it for the gameplay.",1640779124,1640779124,False,4,0,0.504345417022705078,0,True,False,False

Graphics are also pretty good, though the game is a decade old so manage your expectations a bit. That's about all the good I have to say about this game though. 

Combat isn't very fun. Enemies that have shields or can block don't take damage while blocking (but you do when you block which makes no sense), nor do they have any stamina that would lead them to dropping their block. Most fights that have a lot of enemies in them just devolve into you running in circles and trying to single one out. It's not hard, it's tedious. 

And on the topic of running around to kind of get the enemies in more favorable positions, it's very annoying how Geralt can't walk over roots or small rocks that happen to get in the way, instead he just gets stuck on them. 

Some quests just don't tell you where to go, which is like a major sin for me with RPGs like this. I don't mind a little exploration, but the world is large enough that there should be giant circles on the map telling you to explore this area to progress or whatever, like Witcher 3 has. You will want to have a quest guide opened up in the side for it.


This game has very bad windowed mode & no borderless fullscreen. Bad windowed mode because hitting tab on basically most games fullscreen or windowed will cause your cursor to appear over the window so you can tab out and do other things. This game was made during a time when most people weren't multitasking while gaming so I understand somewhat, but I don't understand why this isn't something that has ever been added. 


  
Overall so far in 8 hours of gameplay I'd rate this like a 4/10.

-vitality regeneration, even using potions you have to wait a lot to restore your vitality, so quite often i was just standing there using my phone and waiting for my health to regenerate
-this one is more subjective but i don't like Geralt's appearence
-boss fights, basically every boss fight is really annoying, they were conceived from a bad idea, and turned out even worse, I can't even describe with words how much i hate them
Pros:
-side quests, even if you spend a lot of the time running around the map because the side quests are really far from the 'hub', they are really fun (basically every quest) and add to the story/lore
-really interesting story, between the 3 games it's the closer to the books, expecially in terms of politics (which is really well done); it's also really intriguing
-envoironment, cities, forests and basically everyting you see is soooo good, I think it's the best in the series, and it really helps a lot the player's immedesimation (even though there are some points that are really too oversaturated)
-ending, I really appreciated the ending and basically the whole last act, expecially after a certain boss fight

In the end i definitely recommend the game, expecially if you are playing the Witcher trilogy because this story is a really nice addition",1640632972,1640632972,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Playing it I immediately felt nostalgia for it like other dark fantasy games I had played in the past like Diablo or Dragon age origins.  The story is great and weaves both a tapestry of mystery and a sense of urgency.  Combat gives you many options for what kind of character you want to play, the side quests are rewarding and the characters intriguing.  However this game comes with its fair share of problems.  Throughout the game are weird difficulty spikes which hinder the experience, for example when you arrive in floatsom the games first real town after the tutorial level you'll find yourself utterly unequipped to go after any of the side quests save for maybe some of the more mundane quests like arm wrestling and bar room brawling.  You should be able to go after the nekkers (the little goblin guys) however every pack of them contains an elite minion called a ""warrior nekker"" who will literally one shot you.  Other starter side quests are similarly harder than necessary and filled with cheap one hit or near deaths.  The first real big boss is also EXTREMELY difficult and then the game gets easy again, so much so there were only a few spots here and there that gave me trouble and ending with a ridiculously easy final boss.  without spoiling anything its a kind of ""round 2"" with a previously fought boss that had an INSANELY difficult round one, but the final encounter with this boss is a joke that can be won by exploiting cheap tricks and taking advantage of the terrine. Some challenges I feel weren't fun to overcome just tedious endurance rounds one was a castle siege you fight off that you are forced to repeat 3 times in a row in the same area with the same variables nothing changed.  Another is when you fight a massive squadron of knights that although less mindless than the siege is much harder, the camera fights you the whole way, you are forced to fight cheaply and cowardly or risk fighting the whole gauntlet over again.   I also encountered glitches galore, items i picked up would sometimes not spawn in my inventory, prices would not match in stores, music would cut out, the game would crash, if i paused the game some times dialogue would skip. The worst was when an entire quest disappeared from my quest log as well as the monster knowledge i paid to learn via a book to fight said monster.  Items would often be overpriced at stores which I felt was a hindrance.  It didn't make things unplayable but if certain items like armor were 500-1000 gold less they could be attainable  as is if I wanted the best armor in each towns stores I'd have had to spend hours grinding out gold doing the same bar fight mini game over and over, or sell items valuable for crafting and alchemy.  I get that your SUPPOSED to make money doing monster slaying quests, but I feel the game didn't offer enough of these to properly feed your character so to speak.  Certain combat actions felt sluggish or unpolished, i never found out how to raise my mana over 2 charges (luckily I rarely play a mage in games like this) the block/parry doesn't nullify all damage and the timing mechanic feels VERY ""janky"" and ""off"" hence I was forced to rely on the quen spell and dodge roll for most of the game instead.  the auto lock on mechanic also leaves a lot to be desired as at feels like I often hit the wrong target and swing my sword at air more often than I should.  I'm very harsh on this game, but also overall enjoyed it.  I hear Witcher III is a MUCH more enjoyable and polished game I look forward to playing.  Given when this game goes on sale it's usually only 3 dollars so I'd have a hard time not recommending this game, but at full price its hard to recommend unless your a die hard fan who loves the witcher and likes to play the previous games before picking up the next/newest entry in a franchise like me.",1640484797,1640563292,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The product won't work at all no matter what I do, from launching steam as Admin to creating reg entries. 
Witcher 1 Enhanced Edition does work, but for some reason on a brand new pc (3080Ti 11900k 64gb 3200 ram and WD ssd black) it just doesn't work. I'm on windows 10 if it helps to know as well. 
It's a shame though, the entire franchise doesn't exist if the middle isn't there. Bought this only because friends told me it's one of the best games of a decade. What an awful experience. Maybe it would work on older hardware? Hopefully this will get resolved soon or I will be forced to refund this broken product. 

Edit1: After waking up having some unconventional ideas in my mind to solve this issue, the game just seemed to be working as intended with and without changing launcher settings. It's highly important to know that I have reverted back any change or adjustment I have made trying to fix this problem. And as it turns out, I'm still convinced it was an issue with the game not being able to register itself through using the steam platform for some reason. I have tried every single solution I found online, and tired my own ones. None worked. And yes I have tried hard reboot, that bios and cpu settings, restarting, that incompetent official registry fixer. But for some strange unexplained miracle, after a night sleep the game just works. I'm not sure what made it to get solved without me doing anything different, but I truly hope it holds and I won't have to go through this nonsense ever again. Also it seems after researching, that there is a fair amount of costumers that have this same exact issue and some still not solved. So while I'm still convinced it's something to do with the game not being able to communicate in order to register properly, please make sure to recheck every single possibility before offering it to be sold. After all the work you have done, and people are well willing to pay for it (Me for example) It wouldn't be the end of the world to invest in a team that would create possible problematic scenarios with the product and solve them, so that you know for 100% the costumer won't come back with your product asking for a refund because it doesn't work. 
Still going to be weary about this entire franchise, since I plan to be doing a livestream in the future (After checking if it's legal to begin with as all titles have different rules). 
Thank you mysterious force that seemed to fix this issue, and no thank you for the one that made it possible. A question for steam: Why there is no option for Neutral recommendation? I can't recommend it after all of this without even experiencing it yet. This shouldn't have happened in the first place. But know that the issue is solved. I think we are entering a very dark era of the costumers having to go through so many checks right after buying a service or product.

The game is Great!
It contains Boobs, Monsters, Epic swordfights, Geralt of Rivia and all of this is put together into an epic storyline... What more is there to ask for?!

It of course has its flaws, but I would still really recommend this game, if you've atleast heard of ""The Witcher"" before, or just love RPG-games in general.

The game is not that long either, and you can easily complete one of the storylines, (Iorveth/Roche) in under a week.

It is hard to navigate, I got lost in more than half the levels.

The whole UI is annoying as well; looting is painstaking and time consuming, crafting is a chore, and even the plot is hard to follow and not very interesting. And its buggy, crashes frequently, takes too long too load.

The best thing about this game is that you can import save files from the Witcher 1, and it effects the story and your starting gear.

A tip: At higher resolutions the text is TOO SMALL. So I set it to a lower resolution and then it ran much better.

Combat tip: watch for the ORANGE SLASH of Geralt's sword, hit attack then to add on a combo attack. It's similar to combat on hard mode in Witcher 1.",1635396642,1640233561,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Back in the days, it was already a pretty poorly made game in terms of gameplay. Typical of eastern EU games in my mind. Other than that, well it's the Witcher. Aside from the gameplay, everything was top-notch.

However nowadays, after playing TW3, I find the game to be borderline unplayable.

I'm simply writing this review in hopes someone at CDPR sees it and adds this demand to their board or community feedback:

If you plan on making a remaster/next gen version for The Witcher 3, please consider doing so for TW1 and TW2 too. Those two games deserve to be more than just forgotten relics.
Although obviously remaking the combat system would take a lot of effort, i'm sure the community will follow and pay. Even with what happened with Cyperpunk.

You can finally settle in and focus on the story, and they do such a good job at telling a complicated, political story. Their ability to tell a compelling, sophisticated narrative, at the same time as making it appear you are making decisions that are changing that outcome, is a great thing.

I've got to say: I'm glad I finally got past that part. The rest of the game really ramps up and gets more and more interesting. 

The newfound hype around Sapkowski's world did a lot to get me interested again (the second season of the netflix show coming soon, which prompted me to read the book series summer last; though I'm still yet to finish Tower of the Swallow and the final book).

I never finished Witcher 1. I tried all the suggestions; the mods and whatever other means I could find to make it less tedious (especially in regards to the fighting), but I never really could get past how... wrong? Or rather, how off-putting, it feels to fight, move and interact in the game.

I can confidently say, you do *not* need the first under your belt to get a kick out of this one. Though, I did watch a more or less thorough story recap and picked a suitable endgame save that matched how I would've RP'd it, so that this game would start from a basis I was familiar and satisfied with. I recommend you do that too, if you, like me, choose to skip the first game in the series.

I played the game with the FCR2 mod and the fix/QoL patch for it, as well as a mod that made the HUD less intrusive and immersive. I actually think this decision was part of why I kept going past the intro and didn't feel tired with the game. The combat gets a lot more interesting and fluid with this one, so I really suggest you at least test that out too. Be warned, however: I did experience occasional crashes, which I think always happened upon saving. It wasn't that bad for me, so I never got around to investigate and fix it, but your mileage may vary. If it's even caused by the mods, that is.

This is also the first full game I played with my Steam Controller, despite buying the thing on launch and making extensive use of it in my living room when streaming (but never a full game from start to finish). I can wholeheartedly recommend testing it out -- much more enjoyable to play a game like this from a comfy couch, rather than sitting in front of your desk. It's very easy to get comfortable with the controls, though my config did end up being fairly weird in the end.

Now, this game shows its age from time to time, but in general it looks gorgeous. It's almost surprising how good it can look, especially in certain areas of the game. I installed a few mods that enhanced the visuals, most notably with upscaled and/or upgraded textures, as well as an applied shading filter (it was a bit finicky to get working and made the steam controller overlays laggy/glitchy, so I recommend either skipping this entirely, or carefully reading the instructions with each mod).

And, of course, I had a mod that made Triss' hair less red and more of a natural shade of orange/auburn, but I don't think most people would care enough to go there.

But, let's get to the meat -- I'll start with the negatives:

The maps are a bit too big. In general, you'd suspect a big map would be preferable (as one could deduce from the wild success of the third game with its open world and very large maps), but it's not working here in the way it would have to work to be enjoyable and exciting.

The main problem is the fact that there is no horse, and there are no quick travel options. This is fine for the first 10 hours you spend in an area, but after 10 hours of running back and forth in the same areas, it can get tiring. This is especially true for act 1, though I think I did things in a weird order there and could have been less tedious had I known beforehand that I could optimize things by doing multiple things at the same time.

However, this is another negative to the game; You can't view more than one quest in the map at any given time, so it's unreasonable to plan ahead for this sort of optimizations. In addition to this, the game does not present all the quests in one area at the same time (which of course it shouldn't do at any rate), so you'd have to know this and do certain quests before going to the area, to unlock another quests that could be done there. You could do this if you had an idea of what will happen, but if you go in to experience the story, you'll have zero idea of what's going to happen or when, so you can't really optimize there.

So, you end up running back and forth. A lot. How much, exactly, likely depends on how well you follow the order the game designers intended you to go through the quests.

Luckily, it's not that bad, because the quests and adventures you go through are generally inspired and interesting enough. There's some fluctuation between the quests, but in general, the quality of both writing and execution is very commendable.

Another thing you'll probably notice fairly quick, is one example of the age this game shows: The constant loading screens and rigid systems, and breaking immersions caused by those. If you are a neurotic collector of sea shells like me, you'll have to go through each and every building, door, path... everywhere you go. This means a lot of doors to open, even to the the smallest of apartments. Which means *a lot* of loading screens. Every time you go through a door, it's either loading screens *or* if you're lucky, a slow and rigid animation during which you lose control of the character. Feels wonky, either way, and rips you from the experience for that brief moment.

Luckily, this isn't a big deal either, because the load times aren't that bad, and the losses of control, while decidedly annoying, are something you get used to.

Then there's the fighting. I'm not a huge fan of 3rd person or 1st person fighting in RPGs, so I can't really say whether this is good for someone who likes those, but for me, it's all a bit boring. Don't get me wrong -- with the mods, it feels fluid and often very good to slash and leap and pirouette through the fields, but ultimately it doesn't offer much to the experience. The fighting just feels like the necessary evil you have to go through to get to the actual meat of the game; the story and the decisions and the characters.

Boss fights, especially, felt both uninspired and unnecessarily punishing at times. You play the game and have no problem dealing with the enemies, be they ""elite"" or not, but once you hit a big story point battle, suddenly you keep dying and restarting a lot. But, this might just be me, since I do not much care for the fighting in RPGs anyway. It's also not that bad, since there aren't many boss fights and certainly enough actual content in between to keep even players like me going. At times, I had to lower the difficulty to easy, despite being no stranger to games or fighting mechanics in general. At first it felt a little cringey, but I quickly found it was much better to get past the occasional tedious fight and continue the actual story. But this is entirely subjective, and you should probably read reviews from those that do actually care for the fighting aspect of games like this, too.

But, I think that's most of the bad stuff out of the way.

The story is great. There are some references to the books (though could've been even more, since I have the last book yet to read), but mostly it's very self-contained. Geralt is still suffering from amnesia, which is a great hack for the writers to really get a good story going without clashing too much with the source material.

Some characters are like I imagined or ""felt"" them in the books, but then some... not so much. I'll leave this to your own judgement, but if you haven't read the books, it doesn't matter one bit. All the characters are very well written and delivered, so it doesn't really matter even if you have some dissonance with the images you had had.

I ran out of characters here, but it's a great game. Do yourself a favor and give it a try",1639748421,1639748421,True,25,1,0.747975707054138184,29,True,False,False

Chapter 2 with Roche is less interesting in terms of location compared to Iorveth but opens up more opportunities in Chapter 3.

Surprisingly this game is really good. I thought since witcher 3 was so great and had way more spotlight, that this game was old and bad. But in fact it was quite the opposite. This game even though being dated and having old graphics has a separate tone than the witcher 3. It (separate from the witcher 3) got me interested me early before the story even really started. If you played the witcher 3 first like me don't worry just because it looks dated does not make the story that way.

The combat is great, the incorporation of signs with sword combat is great, and the story line is amazing at first

Later in the game, specially in Loc Muinne, the game suddenly takes a different turn, the third chapter is extremely short and the entire story thus far feels not only inconclusive, but pointless, as if it had been nothing but a wild goose chase. Not to mention the game feels extremely short in regards to character progression -- near the end of the game you feel as if you hadn't really had the chance to try out your most recently unlocked abilities

The game branches out and thus has good replayability, but with no New Game+ it's a little less exciting, and I wish the game was longer per playthrough. I Invested almost as much time as with the first game, but it still FELT as if it had fallen short

All in all, great game and will play again with a new playthrough, but with a few mods to compensate for the lack of New Game+",1639251817,1639251817,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Graphics: Good.
Gameplay: mostly good
Menus: Okay

The story is great. There's twists, drama, magic, politics, risks and stakes, mystery, eroticism (though unfortunately very little for those who prefer men), etc. It's not difficult to suspend disbelief and enjoy it. There are several choices that really change the flow of the story as well as the side you end on and let you see situations from different perspectives. This adds to replayability. The characters you spend time with are fleshed out with personalities, motives, competences, flaws, and pasts.

I have no complaints about the graphics nor the animations. They make the world feel alive. Environments seem varied enough. Monsters look monstrous. Characters feel real as opposed to everyone inexplicably having the same ripped body like in some games. Check the game's hardware requirements on the store's page and some gameplay videos for more info. Voice acting is convincing enough. Dialogues fit their characters. Multiple languages are available.

The gameplay is mostly good. Character development tree allows for change in fighting style, there's plenty interesting loot and crafting. The game makes you do more to win a battle than bash buttons. However, if you invest a lot of points into potions there may be a fight or two where you won't be able to drink them beforehand. You may also prefer some repetitive animations to be shorter, such as climbing ladders or otherwise. What frustrated me the most was that often during combat the main character simply wouldn't execute certain commands until one moves him a bit first. Losing battles and having to reload due to a bug is very frustrating. I also didn't like the dice poker side quest as it is too luck oriented. To complete it I made myself watch the (re)loading screen a lot. Don't be a completionist, skip those as soon as you don't enjoy them. There's less repetitive side quests to get good equipment.
I also didn't like the mutagens system. For one, it acts just like equipment, which is boring. Except it won't let you unequip, which makes it worse as when you equip a weak mutagen you're stuck with it. You can instead wait to see how good they can get, but then you're just waiting and hoarding, not using them until game end. It's not fun either way.

One thing I would complain about is that menus could be a bit faster to navigate. I don't want to have to exit one menu to enter another one nor wait for the fade out / fade in effects. I also don't want to wait several seconds for the same animation everytime I drink potions. All these things could be better done instantly or have animations only the very first time. Loading screen also takes a while to show up after a lot of saves are made.

Btw: If you go the alchemist way, ingredients can be important as you'll do a lot of damage with bombs, but I ended up with 150+ excess in many ingredients at the end. If you see yourself hoarding 100+ of something, don't go out of your way to pick more, you very likely won't need that much.",1638993642,1638995111,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

- Story based QTEs
- Save games are horrendous (autosave writes a new file instead of to a couple designated save files)

After playing both and starting Witcher 3 I cannot stress enough how you should play the games in order. However. There are a few caveats. Witcher 2 departs from the monsters, mystism and folklore of Witcher 1 and goes more into politics and socio-cultural events. This makes it so you actually feel less like a Witcher and more like an Assassin's Creed protagonist. You do not kill monsters that much here, which is a pity but perhaps politics are an equally important part of a Witcher's job - I do not know, I did not read the books yet. 

While the combat is Witcher 1 is weird but fun in its own way, the combat in Witcher 2 feels off. The hitboxes and damage frames are laughably misaligned with what you see on screen and the RPG progression is weak at best. The game is completely carried by the story and the characters. It makes up for it 100% though.

It should be played twice for best enjoyment and I propose you go with Roche on your first and Iorveth on your second. 

Building emotional attachement with all of the characters in Witcher 1 and 2 will massively improve your experience with Witcher 3. Meeting Yennefer after playing 60 hours of previous games instead of 5 hours of Witcher 3: I recommend it.

One thing that lacks is that the game's campaign is a railroad series of episodes and chapters, which I don't really mind at all. It's just it could be better if it's an open world.. I wonder if they have made it or not (pretends not to look at Witcher 3).

Triss is not as hot (and is missing most of the game), the graphics are more modern but blurry and hard to look at, the controls are dumbed down for console/gamepad (I used KB+M) with awful default key bindings for selecting and casting spells, and the combat is worse, plus they've added QTEs.

The lore and setting is fantastic, everything is more polished (the surround sound is fantastic), and there are less bugs, but Act 3 just suddenly brings it all to an abrupt close.  It's like they ran out of money and just needed to wrap it up one or two acts sooner than they planned - I had hardly touched the skill trees, with a lot I still wanted to open up (and I hadn't used a single mutagen yet, outside the tutorial).

- Stellar writing. Plot is great, fun to watch unfold. Always kept me on my toes. Characters are compelling as well, coupled with quality voice acting to match.

- Your choices do have a great deal of effect in your experience which is what matters. Yes you can change major story beats and yes, the ending is still binary in it's nature which I usually am against because most systems with binary ending play the good ending bad ending game. Here they're all just outcomes, you may like one over the other but there is no good or evil result. Just equally feasible scenarios.

- Good soundtrack overall. Some excellent stuff, a few meh tracks but mostly better than ""above average"".

- Hmmm... nice combat. Honestly, I don't get what the fuss about TW2 combat is but I got used to it quick and thoroughly enjoyed it. No I did not use the FCR mod. Moments of frustration do arise from the controls themselves being very dodgy at times but nothing because of the combat system. I think it's fine.

- Great level design, very reminiscent of classical fantasy literature. Flotsam is immediately what comes to mind when I think of a human settlement surrounded by a magical forest, all other locations befit their tropes as well which I believe to be quite endearing in.

- Has the single best boinking scene in all of video game history.

- Extensive mod support. I made Triss's eyes blue, Dandelion a blond and gave Geralt a more modern face.

Cons-

- In terms of bugs, we have two bugs. The game has a tendency to crash when you tab out, and that it makes every save, quick-save and auto-save in a separate new slot and when you pass a certain number of save files the game becomes unresponsive in the menus, you can delete the excess save slots to prevent the engine from crumbling under the weight.

- On the graphical side, I'd say the game has some stunning art direction but is held back by the texture and mesh work. Image looks way over-sharpened and if you said you had a headache from just looking at it I would be inclined to believe you.

Conclusion: Good game, excellent narrative. Controls can be wonky and graphics can be ugly, some of which can be fixed by mods. Recommend everyone to play this at least twice. [spoiler]Roche always best bro, fuck Iorveth. All my homies hate the squirrel.[/spoiler]

I started up a playthrough after my Witcher 1 playthrough back in August 2020, sunk around 30 hours by taking my time, being confused, and getting lost. When I returned this year, I just started all over.

Witcher 2 is something that took me a year and 3 months to finally get around to finishing. I did enjoy it however, I can definitely say that. There's a lot of QoLs from 1, like more balanced alchemy and such. 

I used these mods in particular with my playthrough.

I can't really say if full combat rebalance 2 made my playthrough a better experience, I think it just changes things up (sometimes in really awkward ways), but enhanced mod comp definitely makes this game a bit better.

It's a bit shorter than 1, but that's alright. I'm on the fence whether I like 2 more than 1, but for now I'll just say I like them equally right now.

Like 1, I loved Geralt a lot. The supporting cast was great as well. Looking forward to playing 3 fairly shortly, and hopefully it doesn't get delayed like I did to 2 after my 1 playthrough.",1400955245,1637036849,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False
20920,102854761,76561198012875723,0,20,635,0,635,1637024117,"I wanted to play the first two Witcher titles before playing the third one. I played the first title -- more than once now. I enjoyed the characters, the world environment and lore. I enjoyed even the strange combat system. Once you got comfortable with the combo chaining and picking the right fighting stance, you could defeat just about any enemy, with or without mutagens. Of course, if you went through the extra effort of preparing mutagens and oils, you would be able to accomplish the task much more efficiently. But it wasn't necessarily required.

The Witcher 2 however -- forget about it. Yeah, the story is great, the graphics are beautiful even in 2021. The engine is well optimized, and all the other surface level things are great. But the combat system *sucks*. It is one of the most unfriendly combat systems even by this title's vintage I have ever encountered. Don't get me wrong, I can understand where they were going with the new engine at the time. Trying to build in more freedom of movement and control while retaining the traits that made combat in the earlier title unique. But they clearly didn't invest enough time into it.

You might wonder, how could this game have a worse combat experience than the original? Well, if you played the original you might remember that the combat kind of on rails. However, once you got used to chaining swordplay combos, using the right combat stance and sword, it never felt like it was in your way. Mutagens and oils/stones were not necessarily required to win, but they made the task much more efficient. Trying to win without them was sometimes quite brutal, but as long as you were consistent with combo chaining and stance you could grind your way through whatever was in your path.

This game, on the other hand, attempted to give the player more freedom of movement and completely removed the isometric movement/combat system. The result is, however, a combat system that constantly feels like its in your way. Movement up and down obstacles that doesn't work in combat. Punishing pure swordplay combat -- something that makes early game very frustrating, as you will have few resources available to plow through the jungle with the traps, bombs, etc. Instead, you'll find yourself cheesing most mobs by poking them here and there, maybe throwing a fireball or two, and rolling around repeatedly until they are all dead. This is also important, even with mutagens, as Geralt is very squishy and vulnerable and a mob in great numbers can easily trap Geralt, stun him with a glancing blow, or inflict fatal damage by getting a little too close to a mob.

The stealth mechanic is also clunky, I'd even say worthless. Geralt in ""stealth"" missions will automatically choose to enter ""stealth mode"", but sometimes choose not to at all or seemingly exiting it at the worst times. You can seldom if ever move slowly enough to not alert guards in these sessions even with all the light sources extinguished, and end up beating them down anyway. There is an early game stealth mission where you'll probably find yourself killing everyone in your path and getting chastised by your friends for it as a result of this problem. Maybe this worked better with console controls, I don't know.

I would give this title a hard pass. Not worth your time or money. Find a TL;DR for the story online and go on to the third title instead.",1637027612,1637027612,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False
20920,102847301,76561199095988231,0,5,387,0,387,1637012250,"The Witcher 2 seems to be a game that is chasing the trends of the mid-late 2000s games of it's time. Combat is clunky and slow with a long delay between certain actions making it impossible to follow up on some attacks. The combat also doesn't seem to be designed well for multiple encounters as unless you have certain perks unlocked you will have three other enemies smacking you around while you try and hit one of them. This leads to encounters where you either have to run around and occasionally poke one of the enemies until they die, set up a trap before hand and lead them into it, or throw several stunning bombs making it so they can't retaliate. I tried the combat in the beginning areas on easy, normal, and hard with easy making you tank through most attacks, normal being the most ""balanced"", and hard and above having Geralt be nothing more than a role of wet tissues vaguely in the shape of a man.

One obnoxious part of the game is the out of nowhere QTEs that could have easily been replaced with a button prompt. There are parts where I have to spam left click on my mouse like a clicker game for a brief moment just to get Geralt to do something. The only saving grace with them is that you can disable the QTEs that kill you if you fail them. This has the side effect of having the parts where the a QTE is suppose to pop up become an interactive cutscene. 

The advertisement from the game that your choices matter is only half-true. For major story sections like the pivotal choice that splits the story down two different paths that is true. But for minor decisions that's not always that case. An example is in the prologue you have the choice to either fight and kill a certain character or to spare him. Not wanting to deal with combat and fight multiple opponents I decided to spare him. Near the end of the prologue the character I decided to spare chose to blow himself up at the end. This example is not the case for every decision in the game but it left a sour taste in my mouth for every decision after it. 

For those that say that my experience with this game would be better if I installed certain mods I would partially agree. Installing mods to fix certain graphical errors or bugs I have no problem with but installing mods to fix entire aspects of the game shouldn't be necessary. If you are interested in the story this game has to offer before or after playing The Withcer 3 I would recommend reading a summary online or watching some of the cutscenes. As for me this game did not hold my interest long enough to complete it. If you are still interested in this game despite reading this review I would recommend getting this game during a sale or just buying it outright as the game is not that expensive and is on sale for almost every sales event.

Coincidence? I don't think so.
Booba? Maybe.
Hotel? Trivago.

[h3][i]""My favorite type of magic, [b]Lesbomancy.[/b]"" - Skalen, a horny dwarf[/i][/h3]
After enacting his judgment on the Salamandra organization and saving the king from a witcher assassin, Geralt sought to spend his remaining years with his face firmly planted in the majestic bosom of the sorceress Triss Merigold, turned adviser for the king of Temeria, Foltest. But stuff happens, red-haired booba gets abducted, and many people die as a result. The reason? Well, the title of the game pretty much gives you a clue - [i][b]kings die.[/b][/i] But why are heads rolling? I guess that's a mystery only a professional monster slayer can solve.

Personally, I really enjoyed this story more than that of the first game. There was political intrigue, romance, the sex, and lots of revelations for our dear Geraldo. But above that, it's the characters and their personalities that give the story that [i]it[/i] factor. They feel unique, and it's super fun to interact with and listen to their wisdom. My favourite is the furry and the troll couple. Their dialogue was simply gold.

But, [i][b]your decisions also impact the path Geralt's story takes.[/b][/i] And believe me, they actually matter. While the overarching plot is the same, some characters, stories, revelations and events are ""gone"" depending on what path you walk. This gives the game great replayability, as you won't see everything nor experience the full story with a single playthrough.

[h3][b][i]Bombs away![/i][/b][/h3]
A drastic departure from its predecessor; From automatic attacks with a simple mouse click, stiff movement, combos tied to pressing the left mouse button at the right moment, to the 3rd person action RPG combat many mainstream games employed. [i][b]And, it's decent.[/b][/i] It's too reliant on rolling away and the restricted motionless guard for my liking. And yes, you heard correct - [i][b]you aren't able to move while blocking incoming attacks.[/b][/i] Thus, combat was more challenging because of the poor gameplay decisions made. The stances are also gone, and in their place, we got [i][b]light[/b][/i] and [i][b]heavy attacks.[/b][/i] Disappointing, not gonna lie. The system in the first game provided combat with more depth than simply pressing a light or heavy attack button, with the only difference being how hard you hit.

But, it's not all bad. I liked the way they executed sign combat. It's fast, easy to use, and switching between them doesn't interrupt the flow. They feel more actiony and no longer take half a minute to cast. Prep time is now crucial since [i][b]potions can't be drank mid-combat.[/b][/i] So to come out on top, you must use the bestiary and study your opponent before engaging them. Find their weakness and exploit them. But Geralt can now employ many different bomb variations in his monster-slaying career without needing skill points, which is nice. They can come in clutch when you are getting swarmed, especially those that provide a huge blast.

As for exploration, it's still pretty limited; Each level is a small semi-open area with plenty of NPCs to talk to, play dice with and complete notice board quests. There are a few points of interest in each area, all part of quests, so there is zero chance of you missing them. One new ""[i]addition[/i]"" is the sporadic stealth segments. They are pretty wonky, and you'll most likely get spotted on your first try. 

The equipment variety greatly improved. Geralt only [i][b]carries two swords,[/b][/i] one for humans, both for [i]monsters[/i]. You can find most of them through quests, but the best ones need a master craftsman who knows how to work a shaft. Besides new weapons, the armour department offers plenty in the way of customization. You can select individual parts that cover your head, shoulders, knees and toes, knees and toes. There are special [i][b]Dark items[/b][/i] tied to the new difficulty in the enhanced edition - [i][b]Dark difficulty.[/b][/i] I really liked them. They inflict passive penalties to your stats if you arent wearing a complete set. Sometimes even with those penalties using them might be beneficial, as they are quite strong. They are costly and require rare material, so wisely spend your hard-earned orens. And lastly, quests. They were excellent. Even the most mundane looking ones were a joy to complete, thanks to the games exceptional writing. I never felt like skipping a quest because they were boring or uninteresting. Each was like a small piece of lore revealed to me, and I simply couldn't get enough.

[h3][i][b]UberSaturation[/b][/i][/h3]
Looking at the time between the first game and this one, it's still mind-blowing what [i]CDPR[/i] achieved in such a short time. They weren't a powerhouse back then, and yet, they built their very own engine, [i]RED Engine[/i], and produced visuals that could rival some of the biggest AAA games at that time. And boy did they melt GPUs in 2011, especially that UberSampleing option. Like, who was that even for? There are some issues tho; Many faces are the same for fodder NPCs, pop-in is very noticeable, not just for textures, but colours as well, on grass most of all. And since it's, well, everywhere, it can be an eyesore. Saturation also seems to be turned to eleven, with colours way too bright at times, making certain situations appear cartoonish. But, the game still holds up great, even with some rough edges here and there. And I prefer its tone to that of the newer entry, [i]The Witcher 3[/i]. [i][b]It feels more gritty.[/b][/i]

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2655235408

The soundtrack and voice acting also improved, especially the latter. I can't even begin to explain how much this impacted my enjoyment of the first game. It felt wooden, emotionless. But here, the voice actors finally made these characters their own. Doug Cockle did an excellent job as Geralt, delivering an ""[i]emotionless[/i]"" performance. The supporting cast was great as well. Dandelion, Zoltan, Letho and Dethmold were the most noteworthy of the bunch. And with the games improved animations, combining these two produced great cinematic cutscenes. There is one tiny nitpick; Due to their budget, many NPCs had to be voiced by the same person. It wasn't that significant or immersion-breaking for me, but your mileage may vary. As for the soundtrack, it's fine. It's an improvement from the first game, but still, I don't remember many of its tracks. There is some nice combat and ambient music, but nothing that stuck with me, even after three playthroughs.

[h3][i][b]Final Thoughts[/b][/i][/h3]
Look. I am approximately 10 years late to the praise Geraldo party. But you know what they say about those fashionably late to the party: That's right, they didn't leave on time, and that's why they were late. So thanks for reading, sweat dreams and buy the game.

They had all the setting, characters, and story, but the gameplay is rough--unplayable for me. It's not because I played The Witcher III first, and it's not because the game is 10 years old now that I'm playing it.

I can't play this game because of the movement and the controls. Geralt has no agility, owing to the fact that he can't interrupt his current movement to do another. If you swing, you can't do anything else until that swing animation is finished. His moves are sluggish, the camera is chaotic, and little things are just so janky, like how he teleports to open a door because the animations are hideous and jumpy. Fights in tight spaces are pure madness because the camera is fast and accelerates too quickly.

The Witcher III had all the polish this game should have had. No wonder it shook the world, and very few people talk about The Witcher I or II.",1636645773,1636645773,False,0,0,0.440000027418136597,0,True,False,False

The same elements are there, just in a more unrefined state. It can feel very clunky and unfair at times, but the combat does have a similar flow to W3. Without going into too much detail, there are aspects of the game that are superior to releases today, but there are also some not so savory aspects, and playing the game on the hardest difficulty is not the way to go on your first time. One thing that I can commend the game for in spades is the writing and the narrative. It is so well written and the characters are as vibrant and fleshed out as the best TV miniseries. It really shines in the story department and also has many key decisions that actually felt like they had weight in the story. CDPR should have used some of this cleverness in Cyberpunk for god's sake. The writing in W2 compared to Cyberpunk is miles better, and that's saying something for me because I really enjoyed the Cyberpunk story (just not the linearity).

I recommend playing the first game before you play this game because on my first playthrough of TW2, I was very confused on what was going on the whole time. I just finished my 2nd playthrough of this game and I can say that I have definitely enjoyed it a lot more than my first playthrough. 

I realised that this game was designed to be played at least 2 times to get the full experience of the game which was the reason why TW2 is the shortest of the trilogy. Your choices actually matter. Literally 20+ hrs of the game is locked out (includes quests and the locations you primarily play on) depending on the choices you make.

About the combat system:
The combat system is kinda broken. As in the hitboxes and character models does not match the animations of attacks of many characters in the game including Geralt. For example, attacks could register right at the start of an animation which could be very annoying. However, I found these issues still manageable and I still found the combat fun at the end of the day. 

If you are looking for an RPG and I definitely recommend playing this game. The writing and the dialogue is very solid. Please note that this game is not an open world and is pretty linear.

I will  say the PC version is far superior not just from Graphical standpoints (Which is to be expected), but from a Technical view this is a much smoother ride and Obviously if you Have started at 3 and never experienced 1 or 2 This is a great place to start as 1 is much different but still one of my all time faves. I personally think Combat is great in this game. The Witcher 3 is a vast open world game and combat takes up a hefty portion so it should be over the top insane. Geralt still flies from one enemy to the next. Silver and Steel still apply in 1,2 and 3 and this is what had originally attracted me to the White Wolf series when CD-Pro was a start up. Do yourself a favor and just get all of them experience some of the finest story telling, Views and just plain excellent creature designs (At least IMO). I would love to see 1 remade with updated combat but its still a real-time based experience just a proper timing and stance. I recommend this especially at 2.99 your getting a AAA experience that will leave you remembering it.

Characters are better and for the rest a game to appreciate for his story.

Update**

Played and Finished on Hard difficulty, can say that there is a huge improvement of graphics from the first game. Many bugs and Glitches, less crashes than the first game. Game style similar to Witcher 3 without sprinting and horse. Game became a Hit and Run, you can counterattack but that will equally deal you some damage even if you are a Witcher so i much prefered the first game. 

In the first game you were able to avoid fighting by jumping over a foe with a jump, here instead you can only avoid horizontally by going around the enemy. You can't deal with group with enemies you have to escape then plan your strategy using Witcher's signs. You can craft bombs oils and traps a huge improvement from the first game. Game is not Open World but a more linear Open Map, full of choices and consequences. And implementation of quick time events only during special boss fights. I still think that the first game combat was much better but we go towards a more realistic approach.",1509208153,1635511395,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I took breaks here and there, so I would often lose track of my progress and the events in the story line. I suggest going online and reading as you go along or even watching youtube videos about the story. Just like the first Witcher there are plenty of side quests and things to do that will keep you busy, and I love that you can choose how the story ends by all your decision making through out the whole game.
Just like the the first one you're out there banging all the prostitutes, drinking, fighting, and shooting dice.. What's better than that? 

Pros:

- Better battling/fighting
- Funny moments
- A lot more crafting
- Better graphics

I can honestly say I enjoyed this game way more than Witcher 3. The combat was fast paced and enjoyable for me even though the controls were clunky but I got use to them. The special cutscenes during combat are way better than those animations which just play in the third time in between fights. Geralt is far more brutal in this version combat and story wise. Also why are people complaining about magic being OP? Don't you eggheads know how OP rend, whirl and euphoria is in witcher 3? You can literally one shot a group of people with a single whirl, so why the hell does that matter? I loved the animated sequences of this game during Geralt's flashbacks especially the Rivia Massacre one along with the animated movies made for this game. YOU CAN PAUSE IN BETWEEN CUTSCENES IN THIS GAME which you can't in the third game. One time I had to take a leak during an important cutscene in witcher 3 but I had to sit and hold it in >_>. How did CD Projekt go backwards in this regard? The story is also amazing and well done in Witcher 2 along with the dialogue. The dialogue feels way more natural and human in this game as Geralt has so many options to have a fluid conversation with a person as compared to witcher 3 where he is just stuck with very limited options which are either insulting, joking or exposition but in this game when people talk, it feels like an actual conversation instead of being a robot. I enjoyed my conversation with Ves the most as each dialogue gave an additional dialogue during chapter 2.(Also we shagged ;3)  In Witcher 3, the main story line feels rushed and blood/wine also feels rushed with the exception being Hearts of stone. Witcher 2 has a much better storyline which feels more polished than the third one. Did they fire the writers of witcher 2 or something?
 I also love the sex and erotica in this game which was missing in the third one. Dice poker was way more fun than gwent as It actually feels like gambling than just playing a watered down version of magic the gathering. The game is dated but the graphics look visually stunning along with the character models especially with mods. If I played this game in 2011, I would've definitely been blown away. The game is also optimized extremely well. I only had one crash in my 25 hour playthrough which was loaded with mods and my FPS was 57-60. You can also mod your characters to look like their selves in Witcher 3 which I did and it made geralt and triss look so much better. 
If you want to have the time of your life, please follow this mod guide: https://www.nexusmods.com/witcher2/mods/969?tab=description . You won't regret it.

My old ass computer could easily handle The Witcher 1 (a janky ass game that had decent plot, questionable porno cards, and YMMV combat), but it could not handle The Witcher 2. It could run it, at low graphics, at 15 FPS. 15 FPS! It was like playing a PowerPoint slideshow.

And I still finished it. The game was that good. It got to me at the right time, so to speak. Game of Thrones was popular (so dark, gritty fantasy was in vogue) and I was a horny, edgy teen. So the combination of The Witcher 2's grim world + Triss motivated me like nothing else. 

I now have a better computer, I can hit modern AAA games at 100+ fps or more, but this game has aged well. Sure, there's still some jank. It has weird difficulty spikes. The graphics and textures show their age. Controls could be better. And Witcher 3 had better dodging. 

But The Witcher 2 had a more focused plot, had more use for its cast. And surprisingly, the dialogue funny as hell. Seriously, it's a riot. I never realised how funny this game was because I was playing it in 15fps (pain). Now when I think about it, this game has more one-liners than a Marvel film. And it's all the better for it.

   I Humbly retract my earlier review of the game. This game is my Witcher 3 Prequal story. And I am truly invested in the world of the witcher now and have a renewed perspective on it. The story is more streamlined and unidirectional compared to TW3 And the politics is engaging.

The graphics inherently are good in the enhanced editions but some re-texture mods should elevate it. I still stand by that the combat and movements are clunky- if you are playing using a controller that is. I found on reddit by the community that I should play using the Keyboard and mouse setup and boy I was very surprised and glad. The war torn backdrop of TW3 makes so much sense now that I have finished this. Motivated me to stop B&W and restart the Base game. 

This game is very cool, it has a stealth mechanic, a mission with a troll as a battle buddy and entire quest lines that you divert from based on dialogue choices. That affect Witcher 3

Verdict: Play Witcher 2 Assasins of Kings if you are tired of waiting for TW4 

**** ORIGINA POST****
The game graphics are good for its fantasy setting. It is good. Sound design has aged well. But for someone like me returning from Witcher 3  (Finished it twice and once on DM) and playing Witcher 2 in 2021. The combat and movement seem clunky. Sign effects aren't fun (unfair comparison with TW3) Inventory is cryptic. Which says a lot for TW3. I won't recommend this to anyone returning from TW3. But  if you have to, suggest heavy modding. All other things are great about this except for combat and movement.",1621705976,1634166097,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I wanted to visit the older witcher games before playing much of The Witcher 3, to see where the franchise had come from. The 1st game had a much too dated style of gameplay so i abandoned that quickly, but this game is much closer to what i remember from the little i played of 3.

This game however is crap. Crashes every few hours, horrible gameplay all around. Big environments that you navigate with a light jog makes travel a snore. An awful map that opens up zoomed out too much and not even on your location, so you have to zoom in, and find yourself on the map first, every time. 

Combat overall is a nightmare. Game automatically draws your sword, which prevents other actions from taking place, and even entering a cutscene with your sword drawn still makes you draw it afterwards, so when the enemies that you waltzed up to in the cutscene charge at you, ready to kill, youre standing still, drawing your sword, already taking hits. The has a roll button but forces the ""Double tap to roll"" movement that some other games have. It's not an option, you have to live with it. Rolling is also extremely slow and will rarely help you dodge an incoming attack. If you try to roll away, you may get hit ""in the back"" resulting in double damage taken. The game also has no sprinting. ""Blocking"" called parrying ""reduces damage but not all of it, also takes vigor away, which you use to cast spells. Casting signs is also a slow action. You can ""Riposte"" and counter an enemy attack but you can still be injured during the animation. if you Riposte enough times, you get a passive that gives you a chance to auto counter on block. YES, it can and will, auto counter, sending you into an animation leaving you vulnerable to attack, and you will die from this. I feel trapped in my own idiot witcher character.
You pretty much have low mobility, few defensive options, nearly no crowd control unless you make a bunch of bombs. It's not like you can just freely Respec your talant points either, in case you wanted to try a different approach. 
The screen shake is next level, like being on a pogo stick, making it near impossible to have any idea what youre looking at.

Bosses are even more miserable. loading up from your checkpoint, you slowly draw your sword while the boss that you spawn in front of gets a free hit. Has many unblockable attacks, your slow rolling will likely not dodge them.

AI is terrible. Often times when you have to ""follow NPC to destination"" you have to give the NPC a nudge every now and then because they just forget what theyre doing. Sometimes you can just walk into an area with people and look around, you'll see NPCs just stuck on each other tripping out.

Game is riddled with typos, from misspelled words to near entire paragraphs being repeated.

TLDR; The world is nice, the dialogue and characters are good and funny, the quests are interesting. But with crap movement, combat, and controls, I just dont wanna....ya know......play any of it.",1633333313,1633421208,False,0,2,0.472440958023071289,0,True,False,False

Yes, the combat is difficult and very different, especially if you come from Witcher 1 but its feels its the most punishing during the intro-section of the game. Once you're past that and levelled up a bit to get some good skills, its definitely managable. 

Graphics are absolutely stunning, even all these years after release. And like all Witcher games, the story and lore is top-notch. My only remark in that department is that Chapter 3 feels really rushed compared to the rest of the game.

- choices are a problem here: in Chapter 1 you choose path - and almost 60 % of the game is completely different, it means different maps, different quests, different story, different consequences, so I recommend playing twice. Elven path is much better to enjoy, but with less affect to W3.

Witcher 1 is a good 'old style' RPG, dated and flawed but nevertheless an engaging and interesting story.  Witcher 3 is, of course, a masterpiece.  (I played 1, 3, 2, then 1, 2, 3 and finally 3 again).
Unfortunately Witcher 2 tries a lot of experimental things and while it succeeds with most of them, it ends-up as a very confusing mess.  You really have to play through it twice, to take each of the two main paths, to make much sense of it at all.  It's short enough to tempt you but frustrating enough that it's hardly worth it.

Combat was more repetitive and souls-lite than I remembered. The music is very forgettable. For a trilogy with very good music for the most part witcher 2 stands out by not having any music that stands out. It has been forever since I played Witcher 1 but I can still remember a lot of the tracks.

Graphics -

☑ Beautiful
🖋 Man, the graphics are just so beautiful in this game. All the locations have so much depth to them, a lot of passion has been put in. Some of Geralt's outfits look so cool.
☐ The epitome of perfection

Gameplay -
☐ Terrible
☐ Bad
☐ Average
☑ Good
🖋 The combat is pretty complex, which makes it hard to get used to at first. Probably the most difficult Witcher game, but once getting the basics of it down, it becomes exhilarating to play. Tactics are essential, especially on those harder difficulties. Having to figure out the best way to utilize and balance your signs, bombs, potions, etc.
☐ Incredible

Story -
☐ There isn't one
☐ Bad
☐ Average
☐ Good
🖋 Really incredible, intricately woven story. It has all the elements people love about the Witcher world and sets up a lot of the storylines that are then explored in The Witcher 3. It also does a better job of balancing other characters. In the first game, side characters disappear for hours at a time and only return when the plot needs them. In the second game, it's balanced a whole lot better as those characters have a more significant inclusion in the story.

☐ Short ( 3 - 8 hours )
☐ Medium ( 8 - 20 )
☑ Long ( 20 - 40 )
☑ Very Long ( 40 - 60 )
🖋 The Witcher 2 took me around 40 hours to complete. I completed a lot of the side quests, did some extra exploring of the world, so the main story itself might be closer to 30 hours. It's a pretty long game, but one you'll find yourself completely immersed within.
☐ Extremely Long ( 60+ hours )
☐ Endless

When should you buy? -
☑ Full Price
🖋 The Witcher 2 is already really cheap at full price, and the amount of content and joy you'll get out of it make it 100% worth buying.
☐ Wait for sale
☐ Don't buy
☐ Refund if you can


Final Rating -
9/10. The Witcher 2 is a masterpiece of RPG storytelling. There's a ton of stuff here that everyone should see.

I didn't really like the changed art style compared to the other two games in the series and the lighting too. The fighting is alright but one part in the end missions has you just repeating moves over and over again, spamming left click and swinging your sword as you fight off wave after wave of a whole army. The relationship with Triss is a thing of beauty and what the game does well also is, having multiple scenarios to experience in different playthroughs, that are more split completely off in terms of the direction your story heads. Whether good or straight evil. Meaning you will experience complete new locations and a path and choices that have great impact not only on the end of the game but in the middle and also carry over, as characters will remember and reference events in the past when you play The Witcher 3. This is really incredible when you break it down and some characters you can even wipe from even existing in the next game.

I really liked an interaction that happened between two npc's you speak to that leads to a dungeon that has a really nice and dark setting. It was really gloomy and dark at the entrance and it was raining and I just loved that whole quest. These characters from this side mission are even referenced in the Witcher 3, [spoiler] by the characters giving you an elixr to cure your side effects of being a witcher, should you choose to take it, and not being able to have kids, [/spoiler] in a note on the ground if you happen to find it in a broken down library in that game. Which just explains the depth to the experience. 

Also I may be dumb but there were multiple times I didn't know how to solve a Quest and Failed a few from the first Troll mission and to not knowing from which vendor I had to buy a book that was a quest item. I felt like certain things were not explained correctly or I just didn't get them but I never experienced this in the witcher 3. Also, maybe I just legged it for the finish, but this was the only time I didn't care to even attempt the boxing missions that I've played in all the other games and even in cyberpunk 2077. But, maybe the way the mission/Quest was delivered to you was just really dry and uninteresting. Like, [i]'hey there's these three dudes, if you beat them you become champion, woopee.'[/i] Oh and you can also miss out on good loot if you are unable to or forget to/skip looting a monster, and you miss out on the best sword in the game. But even still that's really at the end of the game so what's the point.

In the end I realised why this was such a beloved title from the xbox 360 days and after hearing about this game being talked about in that light, this just before or after playing the witcher 3 for the first time, I found it funny that I never really heard about it growing up.",1632128416,1632128416,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

TW3 is one of my favorite games of all time and, because of that, I decided to give this game a shot. I am so glad I did. The gameplay is challenging (at least at first), and I definitely felt that using my full arsenal (signs, bombs, potions, oils, etc.) was necessary at higher difficulties, whereas this is untrue in TW3. As far as the atmosphere and world are concerned, due to the world being relatively contained (it is divided into three Acts, each given a unique location and plot), the devs were able to put more effort into making the world feel alive. I remember in Act 1 specifically when the villagers gathered around a fire at night and the leader started telling stories. That was pretty epic. Finally, the game in general is very dialogue centric. I loved spending time talking to characters and listening to what they had to say. This is especially important considered just how political this game is. In that, it definitely has the Witcher 3 beat.

As for the cons, at least when compared to the Witcher 3. Well, there are a lot of obvious ones due to this game being older: combat is less fluid, the graphics are worse, etc. To me, all of those things were secondary.   Personally, my largest complaints lie with the characters and the story. That is not to say that they weren't good (they were), but this game falls far short of TW3 in those categories (imo). I found the political subplots to be pretty engaging, but there was no point in this game where I was just 100% invested in what was happening. I never reached the point where I was like ""I gotta know what happens next"". The story just didn't do it for me. As for the characters? Atm, I find that I cannot really articulate all the reasons they fell short, but needless to say they did. I liked a lot of the characters, righteously disliked a lot of villains, and genuinely enjoyed almost everyone in this game. BUT, I never loved them. No one ever felt as real, complex, or alive as many of TW3 characters. The characters in this game were good, but far short of what CDPR was able to accomplish in the next one. 

Overall, I think this is a great game. If you are at all into the Witcher series then 100% give this game a shot. And if you are not currently a fan, 100% still give it a shot. Then go play TW3. 8/10.",1632043801,1632043801,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

After playing the Witcher 3 there were a few questions left unanswered due to their inclusion in the prior games, playing in this order I was able to have questions then seek answers which I ended up preferring over the alternate option.

To some up the game in comparison to the Witcher 3, it's mechanics are overall less refined although, present unlike the previous title, whereas the overall game loop I feel is much better, yes, it's much shorter than the Witcher 3, but, I feel as it's design is less repetitive, versus the exploration and looting loop found in The Witcher 3, while it's mechanics aren't quite as in depth nor as grandeur the link between the two games is quite clear. 

Some mistakes were made in the sequel, but overall, is an major improvement, story-line, and quest-wise. The scope of the branching story-lines present in the base game and its expansions is not even remotely close, I do feel they took effort away from pursuing Geralt's main pastime of clearing nests and killing monsters, to an extent, with the new system introduced in the sequel, I much prefer this games alternative approach to quality over quantity, this game felt less like the ever so common Action RPGs available today, and felt like a more classic take on Action RPG genre, unlike the third instalment which admittedly set the tone for copycats that followed its creative loop at the time, which has now become the standard for any game with RPG tagged on it regrettably, tainting the once unique and innovative genre.",1631949102,1631949102,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Sure, the story is good, but the game mechanics is dreadful. Here`s why: there`s no open world, just paths you have to take. There`s no swimming, riding or some form of teleportation, so you lose a ton of time just by endlessly walking around. The camera is too close to the character and it can`t be changed. Mouse it`s either too fast or too slow, even after carefully selecting sensitivity. But the thing that I hate the most is the fact that the character reacts so slowly to keyb/mouse inputs that all battles become unbelievably frustrating. The animation when entering meditation is particularly slow and annoying.  The game just feels sluggish and unresponsive.

The game offers a lot of choices, nearly all of which have an impact on the rest of the game, or are at least reflected later on.

Kill or spare? I've watched movies. Kill, obviously. Kill or spare again? Kill. And kill again. Kill everyone you can, no one can be trusted, they're all part of a grand conspiracy against you. Just because you're paranoid doesn't mean they aren't out to get you. Have sex with her, or her, or her, or not? I view love naively with rose tinted glasses so no, I didn't cheat on a fictional character in a video game as another fictional character in a video game. 

But yes, decisions. A non-linear plot. And a compelling storyline with well developed characters in general. That's the strongest aspect of the Witcher 2. Geralt's a cool enough, likeable MC, albeit having been painted on a somewhat generic mannequin in the world of fantasy fiction.

The boring part of the review: graphics were great (for my standards), ost was fine, and the voice acting was quite good. All in all, the world was pleasant to play in and the cutscenes were extremely well done.

Now, the gameplay itself has its flaws. You wield the power of 5 magical signs, ooooooh, except you'll be using the same one for 95% of the game. I didn't use Axii a single time. Maybe I don't have the experience or full knowledge of their uses to have a significant opinion, but no one is going to spend ten hours experimenting with the signs and recording frame data as if this were smash melee, so face value and first impressions are more important when it comes to practicality. 

The sword fighting is pretty simple. For the most part after using quen, potions and oils in preparation, you roll then attack, repeat and use quen every time it gets used up. You do have a strong attack and a light attack, but the light attack felt inferior in every way, so I pretty much used the strong one exclusively. Not much to think about. The few oils in the game had very basic effects and offered really nothing to experiment with. It's a ghost? Use the ghost oil. It's a bug? Use the bug oil. Some of the potions had a bit more depth to them, but there's not much to talk about. Those are the downsides, the upsides being that combat feels fair and hitting an enemy makes a very satisfying sound. I mean that counts for something.

All the above considered, I'd give this game a 8/10. BUT there's one more thing. The game crashed frequently. Like 8 times in total. That's a crash every 5 hours, which is one more crash than should be happening in 5 hours. The game autosaves often enough and I quicksaved enough such that they weren't much more than a mild annoyance, but I'm still penalizing the game for it.

TLDR 7/10 great story, non-linear with lots of choices, ok combat and it tends to crash. This game to video games is what The Red Jumpsuit Apparatus is to music; good, but when someone asks for music recommendations, it's not the first thing to come to mind.",1631640911,1631640911,True,1,0,0.496183186769485474,2,True,False,False

Given my hours in both games (W2=125+hr & W3=1,250+hrs), I can tell you, with certainty, that playing W2 first will give you a better gaming experience. Many characters and items in W2 make their way into W3. This way you'll have a better understanding of their backstory. You'll actually take part in these stories, rather than just reading about them in some journal(W3).

I'll give 3 points:
1)W2 is definitely harder than W3 (both on hardest setting).. W2 on 'insane' mode gives you ONE life, and no in-game saves. The combat mechanics in W2 is a little clunky, and less forgiving. But I personally liked W2 more, because you have to be more calculating.
*one note: you're not bound to weapon/armor levels like in W3, but to obtain the 'optional' cursed weaponry (only avail on dark difficulty).. be prepared for a serious grind.

2)Alchemy in W2 is more realistic, you can't drink potions during combat(W3). You need to pick and choose prior to combat, and need to factor in 'side-effects'.. something not present in W3.

3)Finally, W2 'decisions/choices' transfer over to W3. If certain characters die in W2, they won't make an appearance in W3. Playing W3 first, you'll just get the 'default' setting.

So yes, W2 is a must(regardless of order) if you enjoy these type of lifting curses/monster hunting adventure RPG's.. and playing W3 first will tone down the experience(just don't nitpick everything in W2 afterwards, obviously W3 is more refined and polished). Hope this helps!

Pros:
1 - In my opinion the combat isn't as bad as everyone says it is. Still miles ahead of Witcher 1's combat
2 - Story and Characters (what else could you expect from a Witcher game?)
3 - Graphics are okay for 2011 and most of the scenery and architecture is beautiful to look at
4 - Choices matter
5 - Most non-linear Witcher game of the entire trilogy
6 - Playing this game makes you understand The Witcher 3 more

Cons:
1 - The tracking for quest objectives can be non-existent forcing you to look up a tutorial on YouTube which is annoying (this problem is awful in Iorveth's path which is one of the many reasons why I prefer Roche's path)
2 - The Kayran boss fight is awful when you're first learning how to beat it
3 - Lack of auto saves. There was times where the game didn't allow me to save in a long combat scenario and I end up dying or crashing before I could manually save

Personally I'd wait for a sale to buy this game. it's around 3$ which is very cheap!

I loved the graphics (all the details and the way the game looked).
I loved the steep learning curve, making combat rewarding.
I loved the length of the game (wish it was longer).
I loved the voice acting.
I loved that it wasn't 100% linear (I'd say 75% open, 25% linear).
I liked the fact that some quests sent you into the right direction from the start and others you had to discover by yourself (no hand holding).
I disliked the ending (no, I won't spoil it).
I hated that it ended.
And I wish an expansion comes soon, or that they're working hard on The Witcher 3 already.

Everyone should own this one, yes, even for €50 !

The combat is leagues better then its predecessor.  It plays like an actual game which was a nice change of pace.  The game plays most akin to Dark Souls but a lot jankier.  You have a light and heavy swing along with a dodge roll and a block.  The block doesn't do much as you can still take damage while you block so you'll be predominately rolling across the battlefield.  The game has you only focus on one enemy at a time and I mean this quite literally.  A small cross appears on the enemy of which you will be attacking, this sounds fine until you have to fight more then one person.  Sometimes Geralt will become so infatuated with a target he won't attack another enemy even if you change the cross to someone else.  At times it feels inconsistent, really it feels like a worse version of the Witcher 3's combat.  All in all it isn't bad but I wouldn't call it great either.

The game itself is absolutely gorgeous.  Sure some of the textures and lighting can be off in places but for 2011 it looks really good.  Comparing it to modern titles isn't really fare but if it had come out 5 years ago rather then 10 you'd probably not notice.  This, however, seems to cause problems with the game.  As good looking as the engine is it has quite bit of jank.  Most noticeably with the characters.

The Witcher 1 had this same problem, where when the characters just feel off.  Let me be clear the voice acting in this game is top notch, save a few side characters all the actors do a very good job, that's not what throws me off.  In fact as the game goes on you sort of get used to it, just like in the Witcher 1.  Its just how they interact in cut scenes, it's very hard to explain you'd have to see for yourself.

The last thing I wanted to mention here was the story which is the games saving grace.  I find the gameplay mediocre and the game itself is pretty linear.  The story is what makes you want to play on.  I could go on about what happens but I think it's worth it to just plunge in, I promise if you enjoy a good story driven game you will love this.

Overall a solid game that, despite some awkward decisions, has still aged remarkably well.

Since I couldn't fit my entire review here I uploaded it to google drive, link here; https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cP346pm-hPqvk0xTIoxWZzHWTLSrF4nV/view?usp=sharing

Out of my 70 hour game time I'd say that at least 25 % of that went to loading screens, crashes, backtracking due to weird glitches, corrupt saves and design in quests and general unnecessary downtime. If I spent a quarter of a game just waiting in frustration and another 25 % working around the problems with Dark mode, then indeed I am only half enjoying the game for what it was meant to be.

You may pick it up on sale and enjoy it for what it is, but I genuinely don't recommend Dark mode as it shows more of the game flaws than the other difficulties. The fact that it was only added in a later patch should tell you enough, the game was not designed for it.",1630337239,1630337805,False,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

If you are not going to play the first witcher game in fact I suggest you not to instead just watch the story of the first game from youtube. It's not very necessary but it won't hurt.

Graphics- This game looks very beautiful at times. It gives you the feel of being there. It has some flaws like some walls or stones are way too much bright for their own liking. I think devs were going for that mystical vibe. Playing around with the gamma and brightness setting may somewhat fix it. I have also used some mods to improve the game, Better Texture Environment, Full Combat Rebalance 2 v1.2, FCR2 Fixpack and QoL compilation.

Gameplay- The gameplay itself is very good. Every item in your inventory has a use. It's up to the player to find a use for that item. Going to fights without potions has some serious punishment especially in the harder difficulties. The AI is good all around the game but sometimes some last enemy will totally lose hope and stand there giving up. This does break some of the imersion.

Story- the story 7/10. Done.
I mean it is all over the place. They are making references which can only be found in notes and books hoping you can find those. Overall the story is good but not the best. It had to be good when you can have sex with a Succubus. The story did keep me interested to finish the game. Some of the side quests have a really good plot.

I have unlocked all 52 achievements for this game, and if you are going for them too you will have to train your mind and body for the rage that will ensue, and as the achievement says if you are among the 1.6% of people who have done this you are a madman, good luck fellow completionists.  
But with all of the negatives out of the way. This game is incredible, the story is really well written, a lot of the times while I was replaying the game I would still sometimes listen to the dialog because it was so good.
The characters are so well written and the dialog and voices were so memorable even the side characters were so interesting fun, and sometimes on the path I can still feel the faint scream of ""OOODDDRRIIIINNNN"" as I now walk in the Witcher 3 world.
finally the gameplay is good but not great, the amount of options they give you in this game on how to approach combat is impressive but needed some polish, this has very standard combat of light/heavy attacks and a sprinkle of magic, great stuff but I feel as if something is missing a small bit of pizazz to somethings and a be less from others, but what makes it good and not great is how the enemies are in combat, there are no invincibility frames in this game, which is fine as you do get something to compensate for it and it is more to the games style, but the problem comes when you have to deal with the fact the attacks are determined before they strike, so you can see the enemy that is about to attack and before the animation is even done 
 damage has been calculated and you have already lost half of your HP, and this gets extra frustrating when you have already dogged your way out of an attack and you still die, this was so especially frustrating in my dark mode playthrough. At the end of the day the combat is alright and still learnable, even exploitable if you know what you are doing.
Over all my final thoughts on this game are that, the story, characters, and combat are amazing, definitely leagues ahead of the first game though I have already said my piece on that, if you want a new world to dive into I would highly recommend The Witcher 2: Assassin of Kings.",1630106759,1630106759,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

Given my hours in both games (W2=125+hr & W3=1,250+hrs), I can tell you, with certainty, that playing W2 first will give you a better gaming experience.  Many characters and items in W2 make their way into W3.  This way you'll have a better understanding of their backstory.  You'll actually take part in these stories, rather than just reading about them in some journal(W3).  

I'll give 3 points:
1)W2 is definitely harder than W3 (both on hardest setting).. W2 on 'insane' mode gives you ONE life, and no in-game saves.  The combat mechanics in W2 is a little clunky, and less forgiving.  But I personally liked W2 more, because you have to be more calculating.
*one note: you're not bound to weapon/armor levels like in W3, but to obtain the 'optional' cursed weaponry (only avail on dark difficulty).. be prepared for a serious grind.  

2)Alchemy in W2 is more realistic, you can't drink potions during combat(W3). You need to pick and choose prior to combat, and need to factor in 'side-effects'.. something not present in W3. 
 
3)Finally, W2 'decisions/choices' transfer over to W3. If certain characters die in W2, they won't make an appearance in W3.  Playing W3 first, you'll just get the 'default' setting.  

So yes, W2 is a must(regardless of order) if you enjoy these type of lifting curses/monster hunting adventure RPG's.. and playing W3 first will tone down the experience(just don't nitpick everything in W2 afterwards, obviously W3 is more refined and polished).

The Witcher 2 is an excellent RPG that manages to be both better and worse than its predecessor. It tells a much tighter, more personal story with much better narrative reactivity (to the point where an entire third of the game will occur in a different location--with different characters, quests and stories--depending on player choices--at the expense of some of the ""witching charm"" of the first game. One of the best elements of the first Witcher game were all the sidequests, typically involving interesting monsters, interesting dialog, and interesting characters.... those are all gone. In Witcher 2 you spend very little time being a witcher, and most of the quests are simple fetch quests.

But on the other hand, combat is a lot more fun.

The environments are also MUCH smaller in Witcher 2 than Witcher 1, and more linear--you won't be spending much time exploring... anywhere. But the improved action combat, stellar writing and narrative reactivity more than make up for these deficits, and easily propel Witcher 2 to ""classic"" status. It's no exaggeration to call this one of the very best CRPGs of all time, right up there with Baldur's Gate II, Planescape Torment, Ultima VII, and so on.

Keep in mind, however, that the game is rather poorly optimized, so expect framerate and texture issues on anything less than a top-of-the-line machine.

I will assume that all the people out there overyhyping this piece of garbage are fans of the franchise, fans of the books, characters, themes, and/or lore. Quite honestly, awesome things this series has to offer. I loved the Netflix take on the material, I haven't read the books but I hear they are very good. Now, back to the game. 

If I wanted to absorb all those things I mentioned before, in the best way possible, a game built like this is not going to cut it. The GAMEplay part is awful. There are plenty of other action RPGs that surpass it in so many ways. The mechanics, combat, levelling up, improving gear, inventory management, all of these things, in a GAME of this kind, are what should keep you hooked alongside the story (because the story can be hit or miss depending on whether you get into the narrative or not, it is too subjective). Obviously, if we were talking about a more classic RPG style of game, with lots of dialogue, choices and turnbased combat, perhaps it could get away with a mediocre gameplay mechanic while keeping you really hooked in with the story. But this is not the case. 

Definitely would not recomment this to anyone. Graphics look ok but are a mess when taken as a whole, there's this surreal feel to it and it's not Lynchian, it's the bad kind of surreal. Combat is dreadful, you basically need a large area or it will get very hard. Aside from difficulty, its boring. Even if you use all your crap to prepare and cast spells all the time, it doesn't feel like there's a weight to the encounters. Animations, well, they're just annoying, Geralt making random moves with no control over them.

Overall, I see a great game lying beneath all this terrible amateurish execution and it makes me long for the day they adapt the Witcher series into a proper RPG where they truly let the story rise and dominate over everything. And where basically everything is up to choices that matter, permadeaths, omniscient storytelling, getting all the sides with all the lore seeping out of every hole. THAT is a GAME I would love to play. 

PS: There's no need to keep trying to defend this piece of garbage after CDPR last sci fi disaster. I get that Witcher 3 moved a lot of people and it is by far a superior game.

The Witcher 2 is a narrative virtuoso missing a combat hallmark it absolutely deserves.[/b]

One of the most elaborate stories in a game driven by consequential player choices and your classic RPG elements. The majority of the game's side quests are written with serious attention to detail which makes the overall progression really busy while being substantial instead of the usual long and bland experience in similar games. It's like you're really Geralt, suffering from amnesia, uncovering everything about the world — it's fictional facts, where and who you actually were in the compelling chronicle. The game's lore is that engrossing, keeping you engaged in its circumstantial storyline. 

The game unfortunately suffers from a poorly-designed fighting mechanics and a sloppy enemy AI. It can be so bad for you, you may drop it way too early and regrettably miss a good [i]Witcher[/i] story because the combat is that bad very early in the game so I suggest to give it time — a serious amount of time. It's one of those titles which could've been so much more if weren't for such horrible combat. It's a really good game if you manage to get past that. The intriguing characters, the meticulous story-telling, and a cohesive mythology that really caters to its theme. Plus the graphics is pretty nice for its age. Really give this a go.

Enter Witcher 2. I started it on normal and played for about an hour. After 2 minutes after the first cinematic, I was already cursing the legendary Witcher, seemingly unable to back out of a camp fire because he moves like a hamster on speed. I told myself it was probably my mistake: it had been a while since I'd played W1 and I'd been playing games with more dynamic controls.
Ten minutes later and Geralt stumbles onto the battlefield, only to be mowed down. Again, I tell myself it's my mistake. I'm simply not used to the combat system. I tell myself it'll be no problem since I tend to pick up on game mechanics reasonably quickly.
Nope.
After one hour, I've had it with the clunky controls, terrible camera, both in terms of Geralt taking up about 1/3 of the screen, thus making peripheral vision a luxury, as well as the camera angle - what fun rolling into the swing of an enemy because you have no idea where you're going! Add horribly limited hitboxes for actions like climbing - unless you stand in the exact centimetre, our master of combat will simply run into the wall time and again. Reaction times (remember, Geralt's supposed to have superhuman reflexes) are lousy, which means that dynamic combat is all but impossible. Wait for your opponent to strike, roll, strike, wait. Much fun, so action. Oh wait, there is action - because there are 2 or 3 more baddies waiting to smack you. Better keep rolling, then. Chamillionaire might sue, though. Oh, and for reference - I highly enjoyed Dark Souls, and I do appreciate a well-timed roll or two - providing there's a halfway decent combat system in place.
So yeah, I can't say much story-wise (although I was initially excited for it), but simply in terms of controls this is not the game for me. The inventory interface doesn't exactly help either. I'm typically willing to invest a fair amount of time into learning game mechanics, however counter-intuitive they might be, but I haven't yet had the displeasure of a game as unwieldy as this one.",1629758446,1629759070,False,5,0,0.476363688707351685,0,True,False,False

This is comparatively the worst game in the Witcher franchise.(TW3>TW1>TW2) But that does not mean it's a bad game...

Pros which The Witcher 1 didn't have:
• Combat was fixed from TW1
• Achievements
• Gamepad Support
• Story choices affect outcome in TW3

Cons:
• Generic Soundtrack
• Item Collection is terrible
• Completely Useless Map (no manual location tracking)
• Menu Navigation (everything is out of sight)
• No Bestiary Entry System (need to carry all scrolls and formulas at all times)
• Placing bets slider is slow
• Inventory and shop are annoying to search through (everything is out of sight again)

Since the game saves every autosave and manual save (which don't get over-written, it takes too long to load when you die and sometimes even crashes the game when you try to save/load more than 4 times a session. And everytime you close the game, the steam cloud saves sync takes hours to upload...

Went ALL THE WAY BACK to Witcher 1 and was mind blown with the vision they have had in their minds for decades. Still are blowing my mind with their vision. Bravo CDPR!

25 hours in and I've only completed Chapter 1. Compared to Witcher 1, the difference is night and day, an overhaul of everything. Verticality in environments, better 3d models and environments, better animation and cutscenes, better combat (except with the signs), better dialogue and more varied dialogue. I don't know what major/minor choices I'm making half the time cause it's so interwoven to track properly. Overall a beautiful overall and you can see the details they were able to add with the switch to their own independent engine.

Skill tree wise, I personally prefer Witcher 1 (and I see how they've amazingly refined and redone the W1 style skill tree in W3). The fact that signs are all under one skill tree triggered me a lil bit. The mini games are the same except for the QTE in fist fights. Looks cool but doesn't feel as cool, but much better than W1 by a long shot. Not exactly a fan of the dark items video and audio filter, but that's only cause the game looks amazing and their music always be banging. I genuinely miss Roach in this as well. It's fine to jog around if it's just the main quests, with side quests and contracts it got a little annoying. Would've liked the sprint option at least. 

Overall amazing game (so far) and a definite must play if you love the Witcher universe. And it's a lot more manageable than W1 so you don't have to worry all that much. 

P.S: You can basically play Demon Souls kinda game if you put in dark mode. If you hate yourself even more, try the insane mode.",1629115985,1629115985,True,1,0,0,1,True,False,False

Graphics are nice and detailed. outstanding for it's time. Characters also look good.

Story is mature and consequences of choices you make bear weight on you. Not all of them though.

The story is really good, convoluted plots and lots of twists. Bearing in mind this is an old game I'll try to be fair in 2021.
Pros - excellent story, combat is not as bad as internet pundits claim and Geralt is his usual pithy humoured self
Cons - worst mapping ever seen, not even an objective marker! Steam states I have played for 34 hours - this would have been reduced by half had I not had to dive out to look up where to go every 5 minutes; terrible inventory 'you are carrying too much weight' was a constant nag especially since you cannot store half the items you want to and having to sell all your crafting stuff to reduce weight is a total pain when you then need to craft armor/swords/potions/bombs/traps; game is very short for an rpg
I have given it a thumbs up because it's a Witcher game (I am very glad I played Witcher 3 first). My friends tell me to go back and play from the human perspective (I chose the other path), mmm maybe, not sure abut that, I didn't enjoy instructions like 'go to the right' but that comes back to the appalling mapping I guess. As in 'go to the right' ended up being about a 20 minute hike for no particular reason; there were a couple of funny bits - do the quest ""A bag of fluff"" if it comes up.
As it's an old game at most I could give it a 5/10 and tbh I don't think I'd have given it much more than that if I'd played it at the time, but since I wanted some more background to Witcher 3 it's 'adequate'.

Oh and one last thing - there's a small piece at the end of the credits - you can left click your mouse to make them move faster - I swear the credits were longer than the game but as a first run through I wanted to see what that entailed when the message came up onscreen.

This game fucking sucks. Fuck this game. Don't pick up every item. Don't go running circles around the map. Save at the slightest likelihood of failure. Don't play this game unless you can get it for $2. Which you can. 

But if you're truly desperate, here is the only real way to play:

There's a mod that lists all the character abilities, 'Weightless Enhanced Edition', that has a folder that (supposedly) stores a character abilities file from an earlier version. If you you know how to check files you probably should, personally I don't give a shit there's enough on my computer. Just copy the abilities folder into CookedPC (directory to steam game data: [drive Steam's installed on]/x86/Steam/steamapps/common) and it's done. Edit it in the magic of Notepad, or something fancy if you're into that. What you want is midway down, under the Various group. Change that max_weight to whatever the fuck you want, up to 999999. Fuck inventory. 
You can also go to story_s8, changing price_mult to 'true'. This decreases shop prices from ridiculous to slightly less so, at least for a short while since games are more complicated than that. You're supposed to unlock it by haggling and using Axi in the kayran: a matter of price... and at no other point. How're you supposed to know that? Fuck you, that's why.

Now the cons. The combat itself is bad (in my opinion). I feel like it's certainly showing its age a bit. It's not horrible to the point of unplayable, but it's just not fun. Add the fact that enemies have weird hitboxes and magic users having the ability where you can't hit them for a few second, it just becomes unfair at times. Other issues involve inventory management, I found it tedious, though if might not effect you as much. And finally, the game has some graphical issues. I'm not talking about the graphics in general. It struggles to reach 60 fps and sometime colours get oversaturated. From what I learned, when this game was made, the Red Engine wasn't as powerful, and CDPR pushed the engine to it's limits to make this. It's commendable, sure, but there are still some issues. 
In summary, the rpg stuffs are fun, exploring the world in enjoyable, and the story is fantastic.

The graphics are much more realistic, which most people prefer - I on the other hand am more torn between Witcher 1 & 2. The first games more game-like graphics appealed to me quite a bit. The fighting mechanics of the first game, albeit quite easy, were fun. Which is the total opposite for The Witcher 2, in my opinion. The inventory system is also much more tedious in The Witcher 2, as you constantly have to manage the weight of your backpack instead of having inventory slots and an easier access to an overlook of everything in your inventory, à la The Witcher.

The story is much more deep and filled with betrayal after betrayal and it somehow feels much more darker. The choices were also harder than in the first game and affected the story on a whole new level. Your choices even decide to which places you go and who you do quests for. The beginning was not completely engaging, but after a while the story really picks up pace. After all the build-up, the last chapter is truly superb.

The combat on the other hand... After starting the game I quickly became frustrated with the combat system. It was quite hard, but manageable, to fight an enemy. When faced with two enemies, at least the other one could quickly get a backstab at you, and take you down in a hit or two. And more often than not, you were fighting multiple enemies. The parrying system and especially the counter attacking part of it was the worst. It all had to be timed so precisely that I could barely do it in the tutorial, and never tried it again after that. I got the feeling that to survive combat, one had to roll and resort to only using hit-and-run tactics. I almost quit the game in chapter 1 already, but then I decided to set my pride aside and lowered the difficulty to easy - so I mostly just played through the game because of the excellent story. On easy mode the Witcher's opponents become, well, quite easy. Luckily it made the game quite fun though.

Excluding the combat, there were few big things to complain about. One very frustrating bug that comes to mind though, resides in chapter 2. The quests have a very specific order in which they need to be completed in order to get the outcome that I desired - and even though I loaded a saved game from quite a while back and did everything in the order stated on the wiki and the quests got the completed status, the quests were still marked as failed in my journal at the start of chapter 3...

Overall though, the game is very much worth a playthrough; if nothing else, then for the excellent story. I highly recommend playing through The Witcher & The Witcher 2 before starting The Witcher 3, because it gives you a whole lot of immersion compared to directly jumping into The Witcher 3 - especially regarding the characters.

I'd give this game an 6.5/10 if you're more into gameplay, and a 9.5/10 if you're in it for the story - like I was.
If nothing else, then quickly play through the main story to better understand all the characters and events taking place in The Witcher 3: The Wild Hunt.


[b]EDIT (8.8.2021):[/b] After four years I now decided to replay the Witcher 2. This time my experience differed quite drastically from the last time. Instead of 'Easy' I decided to try out the 'Dark' difficulty, which turned out to not be too bad. Apparently I have gotten quite a bit better in four years. :P

This time I chose a different path for Chapter 2, which made it feel like a whole new game. Even on this second playthrough and having completed The Witcher 3 since I last played, I still think the story is amazing. Afterwards I was missing only one achievement, so I decided to do a third run of the game on the 'Insane' difficulty (no dying). I managed to complete the game on my first attempt without too much abuse of the load button, so now I think I can certainly say that I have indeed gotten better since 2017. :)

All in all, as the combat system felt much better this time around, I will also give The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings an even higher score than I did based on my last experience.

SHORT REVIEW
PLOT:  Quite deep and involved but not easy to follow at times.  You can be following a plotline and run up against “Wait for things to unfold” and have to come back to the plot later.  This can make things rather disjointed.

COMBAT:  The controls are awful (might be better with a controller but with a keyboard / mouse it's pretty terrible).

GRAPHICS & SOUND:  Graphics and sound wise the game is now 10 years old but doesn't seem to have aged too badly.

REPLAY VALUE:  Excellent for second play through (actually essential to experience the whole game).  There is a major plot split at the end of Chapter 1 and dependant on the path taken Chapters 2 & 3 are very different.  Beyond the second play through its more questionable.

ISSUES AND BUGS:  Relatively bug free but innumerable graphics options which can cause trouble.  There is also a warning on the Steam page itself which says “Requires file system support for files up to 8 GB”.

ACHIEVEMENTS AND TRADING CARDS:  Full integration with the Steam platform, Steam achievements and trading cards for those interested.

VALUE FOR MONEY:  Pretty good as there are effectively 2 plots here so the replay value is excellent.  The game is very reasonably priced and there is no cash grab via DLC.  It does tend to get heavily discounted in sales so best to wait for a sale before purchasing.

LONG REVIEW
Now that I have completed the game I thought this review requires a bit of an update as, during the course of the game there are a few things I have come across which people need to be aware of in the way of game play and, what in my opinion at least, are a couple of really bad design decisions.

1:  Quick Time Events:  The game uses way too may quick time events.  These are basically a reaction test of “click now or die”.  These rapidly become tedious and are extremely frustrating.
2:  The game expects you to prepare for a fight by taking potions etc. beforehand.  This is fair enough as a style of play and rewards the player who plans ahead but, if the game then throws you straight into a major boss fight from a cut scene this is impossible.  You take potions in the “Resting” screen and oddly enough you can't rest while someone is beating you to death with a sword!

I completed the original Witcher game a number of years ago and got Witcher 2 but never actually got round to playing it so when it came up at 85% off in the Steam sale decided to treat myself to a copy already updated for Windows 10 rather than battling with an old disk copy.  I also wanted to play this before Witcher 3 which I have on PS4 as the plot from the three games is very strongly interlinked.

As I say the plot is very strongly interlined and follows on from the original Witcher game.  The continuity allows for much deeper immersion and characterisation than if this was a stand alone game but for those who haven't played the original game I would strongly recommend playing that game first to get the back story or as a minimum at least reading a potted summary on the internet.

The game is quite dark and definitely “adult” in nature.  These days nearly everything seems to end up with (18) stuck on the box but in the case of this game it is warranted as it contains both nudity and strong language.  Doesn't bother me but the politically correct might find this offensive so you have been warned!

This brings me onto my biggest gripe which is a problem I have with Steam in general and not this game in particular.  The original game came with both an instruction manual (33 pages if you discount the foreign language sections) and a 97 page game guide.  Why can't Steam bundle a .pdf of the instructions with the game?  Okay, the manual can be downloaded form the site but that requires a work around as the download function doesn't work properly (right click, copy / paste the url into your normal web browser and then save the .pdf file from there).  The game guide is nowhere to be found.

Graphics and sound wise the game is now 10 years old but doesn't seem to have aged too badly.  Provided you have a reasonably modern machine play about with the settings to get the best performance as the defaults are quite low.  This can lead to problems though!  I had an issue with the game hanging at the end of Act 1 and the cut scene not playing.  I resolved this by setting the graphics back to the defaults and disabling the full screen mode.

PLUS
1:  Plot:  A strong non-linear plot where actions in the earlier parts of the game have consequences and change the later parts of the game.  Results in good opportunities for re-play as there is a complete split in the plot at the end of Act 1.
2:  Storytelling:  Great storytelling and strong links to the world background.  (Also links back to the previous game which could be a MINUS if you haven't played it).
3:  Characters:  Again strong characters linked to the world background.  (Also links back to the previous game which could be a MINUS if you haven't played it).

MINUS
1:  Controls:  The controls are awful (might be better with a controller but with a keyboard / mouse it's pretty terrible).  I don't recall having any problems with the original Witcher game once you got used to swapping styles it was quite simple and never really caused me any problems although I know some people complained about it a lot.
2:  Difficulty:  The power curve is way off.  There is one VERY difficult fight in towards the end of the prologue.  This one has caused quite a few people to rage quit early on (just look on the internet).  Best solution is to drop the difficult to “Easy” for this fight, at least for your first play through as the controls (see above) really don't help.
3:  System Requirements:  The game is a bit of a resource hog.  Not too much of a problem on a newer PC but the game is from 2011 and back then it could be a real problem to get decent performance (or any performance) out of it.
4:  Crashes:  The game can hang instead of playing the cut scenes.  Seems to be dependant on the graphics settings which are unnecessarily complex.

CONCLUSION
Definitely worth playing and a great RPG but be prepared for frustrating combat due to the controls and the quick time events can really wear you down.  It is however the “weak” game in the trilogy.",1553284402,1628432485,True,9,1,0.646258533000946045,0,True,False,False

The game's narrative is great with many choices you can make along the way. Gameplay has been improved from first game tremendously but by modern standards it is clunky as all hell. And not to mention The Witcher 3 which is superior to this game in every way, if you're not aware at this point.

It's a great game for 2011 but by modern standards it is a mediocre action RPG. I would recommend it for sure but If you can't stand old game jank just skip it for The Witcher 3.

The thing i enjoyed most about the game, was Geralt trying to recover his memories. The Hunt and Yennifer never show up in this game, but it almost feels like the game is all about them. So much foreshadowing and having played the witcher 3 first, its been a ride going back to the older games. I cant wait to get into Witcher 3 right after this. 

The Hunt is so mysterious, they are elves from another dimension who for whatever reason were after Geralt and Yennifer.

I cant decide if the combat is good or bad, sometimes i would be enjoying it. Then other times i would hate it. I think dark souls and other superior action games have shown how these types of games need to be done. Its a shame. The combat is also really slow and enemies love blocking. Its just boring at times. 

Its hard to believe it came out 10 years ago. The graphics are amazing and so is the artstyle. The only real issue is the pop in graphics. Not seen pop in this bad since ps2 era... games like Vice City. Its especailly bad in the forest.

Brilliant game.

During the first chapter, the story starts slowly, but the second chapter is what gives this game that shine.
There are two totally different chapters and you can get them by choosing whose side you will be on.

- There are a lot of interesting things in the game, and one of them is a little funny and strange thing that I don't want to spoil, but I'll just say that you will be surprised by something strange on your body. Of course, you can avoid that ""surprise"", but discover for yourself what possibilities the game offers.

- There are a lot of mini games such as dice poker, arm wrestling and fist fighting.

- The combat system got a big improvement from its predecessor and I personally like the way the combat system works. It is though sometimes. The downside is that signs are useless except Quen and you will use it in 99% of cases.

- All side quests and contracts are interesting and very well done.

- The surroundings are diverse, so you will find yourself in a situation where you just walk around the city and do nothing but just look at the surroundings.

- Drinking potions has changed a lot, so you will not be able to drink potions during the fight. You will have to think of every move and drink each potion before the fight. That gives a bigger challenge.

- Horse riding is still not a thing in the game but it is not a big problem because this game is not open world either so it's not really necessary.

- You will often be rewarded with various things through research, so I suggest you to sit down and enjoy the game while playing slowly and in detail.

- The game is much shorter than its predecessor in terms of the main story, but the side quests are very original and well thought out, so the length of the game itself lasts almost the same as The Witcher: Enhanced Edition.

I love Witcher and played and loved Witcher 1, but this game is just so much unpolished. Dozens of mechanics just don't make much sense and are straight-up stupid. For example:

- When you upgrade a talent with a mutagen, it is stuck there for the rest of the game. Same with upgrades for weapons, armor, ...
- You can not reset your skill tree. Good luck when you are just learning the game and choose something bad.
- On Dark difficulty, you can get exclusive armor. But, bosses on this difficulty are more difficult than bosses at Dark Souls, plus the unpolished combat is just infuriating. I often get spawned and insta-killed. Wtf? So when I want to lower the difficulty for the story, I can't, because it would take away my whole outfit and leave me naked I guess. And naked Gerald cant punch a dragon to death, can he?
- Crafting is kind of solid, but at the same time, weird? You have to get so much silver for a new sword that the only option is to just go in and out of zones so your veins/vendors respawn. 
- Potions, oh god. Brewing potions is much better than in Witcher 1, but drinking them is just a pain in the f*cking ass. It takes like a minute to do and since you can not drink in combat, I often got suddenly thrown into a fight without the ability to drink potions with the last autosave 10 minutes ago. Just plain-ass stupid. 
- Merchants buy everything and have an unlimited amount of gold. Witcher 1 had it much more immersive.
- The UI is sh*t, probably because of consoles

The Witcher 2 has a focused plot and is semi-open world, with each chapter consisting of a large explorable area with lot's of running about and backtracking. I won't say anything about the story, for those that have the interest in revisiting this after forgetting or those that want to experience before 3, or after.

Just add phenomenal dialogue writing, excellent art direction and a bold and unhinged tone and you get The Witcher 2. So, the story of the game is good with a lot of possible endings and excellent surprises.Moreover, it is supported by excellent dialogues, a vast journal, and quite real human characters , all of whom draw inspiration from the vast amount of Witcher lore which was introduced in the original Witcher novels. This particular factor proves to be quite beneficial as it helps in giving the player the feel of freshness throughout the campaign.Keep in mind if you play this carefully crafted gem be in store for some of the greatest dialogues ever heard in a video game. Other than that the world of the game is just big,beautiful and sufficiently detailed for its time. The Gameplay mechanics are similarly awesome with no significant blunt edges. The Inventory system and the other Witcher mechanics like brewing potions and meditating are also simple to use. The Skill Tree is vast and layered and is supported by a system where it is easy to add your newly earned levels to existing skills or get new ones entirely. The Combat is quite fluid and fun once you manage to master it but before that its a nightmare,no two ways about it. Other than that the enemy AI and the musical score are not as good as they should be. At least the musical score is surely a step down from the excellent music of The Witcher 1. So, in the end, The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings is a great game with a much fun bold tone and a massive scale  which , overall speaking, does full justice to the Witcher legacy.

You dodge the signs and attacks he throws at you but he still hit you with them period. You hit 2 heavy hits and dodge and it consistantly works until the game decides you need to die then you are incapable of dodging like you've done so previously. I have stunned him with the Yrden sign and he gets stunned. I attack him and then move away and throw the sign down. He walks on to it and shakes like he's stunned and I move forward to attack and he hits me because all of a sudden the game decides he's not stunned. I don't know if this is common but I'm playing this on normal and dying 500x more than I ever have when I played it on Xbox back in the day.

[b]Cons[/b]
- Poor Difficulty. Easy is too easy and normal is too hard
- Combat is still worthless. There were only a couple of interesting fights.
- You have to walk to a specific point for the climb trigger to show up
- Shorter than I expected, but not too short
- I had to look up how to reach the queen harpy. You have to climb up 50 meters from the waypoint and jump horizontally, which never happens until that point
- Nothing is explained. Stealth, signs, looting, etc

The combat was smooth, sometimes a bit button mashy, but still very fun and flashy. There was a nice oomph when hitting someone with a sword, and the sound design complimented that well.

Combat is terrible, though. So astoundingly bad. Like a Dark Souls game but with bad controls and responses, the enemies given the ability to turn AND parry WHILE attacking (and you can't!). Thankfully there are mods that attempt to restore some balance and fix bugs. YAMC (Yet Another Mod Compilation) highly recommended.

Almost never needed to use oils, bombs, sword buffs in Witcher 1 even on hard difficulty, but this game has me doing everything to stay alive, which I kind of like. What I don't like is the constant limited combat space and time needed to lay a trap or throw a bomb before enemies hack me up lickity-split.

The Witcher 2 was my introduction to The Witcher franchise, I played it at launch on Xbox 360. I played through it once, not knowing of the different story paths. When The Witcher 3 launched I immediately picked it up and have played through it four times. Upon hearing about a next-gen release of The Witcher 3 I decided to pick up where I had neglected to ever begin, The Witcher: Enhanced Edition. I played through The Witcher 1 and eventually completed it, albeit with the help of mods, and found it rather lackluster. Despite this, I waited a short period of time and then began playing The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings to complete the story path I hadn't experienced before. 

The Witcher 2 is a total upgrade from The Witcher 1. The combat, voice acting, musical score, graphics, and pacing have all been vastly improved since the first game and unlike its predecessor it's actually fun to play. The story is told eloquently in The Witcher 2 and the player is never left feeling like they aren't on the same page as Geralt, a problem The Witcher 1 faced throughout its story. The combat is fluid, dynamic, and responsive. In The Witcher 1 I would constantly find myself avoiding combat encounters simply because the combat wasn't fun but in The Witcher 2 I found myself actively seeking enemies solely because I found the combat to be enjoyable. That word sums up The Witcher 2 rather well, enjoyable.
There are two different paths for this game and unlike The Witcher 1 they are actually very different. Because of this, one would miss out on nearly 40% of the content present in The Witcher 2 if they played through only once. This could be seen as a con but I list it as a pro because it adds replay value, something The Witcher 1 struggled to warrant. 

Overall, The Witcher 2: Assassin of Kings is a strong RPG with a compelling story and gripping combat. The characters, gameplay, and tone of The Witcher 2 are all vastly improved since the previous game while still maintaining the core elements of what it takes to be a Witcher game. Much like the first game The Witcher 2 revolves around three things: monsters, people, and choice. Unlike the first game, The Witcher 2 finds a way to make all of these elements compelling in their own way. I bought this game for $60 at launch and thought that it was worth it even back then. At $20 or less, The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings is a steal today and a real pleasure for RPG and Witcher fans alike. I highly recommend giving this game a try whether it's your first time playing a Witcher game or if you played it on Xbox like I did and wanted to relive the story.

The story is very complex and ambitious, which is simultaneously the game's biggest strength and biggest flaw. I played this game before reading the books or playing The Witcher 1, and it kinda assumes that you've done both (which I did end up doing in between my first and second playthroughs). The game doesn't do a very good job of introducing newcomers to the series into the whole world of the Witcher. I would recommend either just skipping straight to the 3rd game in the trilogy (because it's the best and probably the easiest to understand for newcomers) or reading the books first then playing through the games in order. It's not incomprehensible if this is your first Witcher experience, but there's a lot you'll be wondering about. But if you do have a decent grasp on the in-game universe, the story is much more digestible and very, very good, save for a few continuity errors. CD Projekt Red's writing is top notch as always. 

People give this game's combat too much hate. Is it flawless? No, but it's more than serviceable. Joseph Anderson does a phenomenal job in his WItcher 2 Critique video of breaking down exactly why many people hate the combat, but it essentially boils down to two main things: 

1. It's not true action combat. The damage isn't dealt by the attack animation itself; rather, it's a damage cone that appears in front of you with an attack animation (hopefully) synced up with it. This causes a myriad of issues that I won't delve into here, but that you'll probably experience if you play the game

2. The rules are different for the enemies than for you. They get invincibility frames, you don't. They can cancel attacks to block, you can't. If you try to attack an enemy in a group, they can block your attack even if they were in the middle of attacking themselves, leaving you stunned and open for the rest of the horde to fall onto you. 

These are obvious issues, but it really doesn't affect you all too often (save for a few sections that come to mind which are undeniably very frustrating). I have come to enjoy the combat in The Witcher 2 quite a bit. Does it stack up to the combat in the 3rd game? No, but is it fun when you realize the limitations of the system and learn how to get around them? In my opinion, definitely. 

Overall, the graphics have aged very well, especially compared to other 2011 games. There are some minor bugs, but nothing game breaking. The sides quests are very well incorporated into the main quest, which makes them feel much less like chores. A pretty good experience. 7/10.",1591125714,1626299381,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I finished the game on Dark difficulty with Full Combat Rebalanced mod.

Witcher 2 will consume a lot of your patience and time. You'll run around doing nothing most of the time. Side quest doesn't tells you the location. Movement speed is very very slow, feels like a chore to run around.

The combat is rather horrible, dodge iframe sometimes just doesn't work and can receive a game over in a blink of an eye as most enemy will gang up on you. Casting spell sometimes won't work either even though you spam the Q key. Just imagine it as a 💩 Dark Souls wannabe.

Now the question is does it make it better? Well, yes and no. There is some strategy in the swordfight, unlike before where you have to choose the appropriate fighting style to kill an enemy fast and effective. This time it has the strong and fast attack thing like Mortal Kombat. The enemies also seem to block your attacks more often than the previous game. That would be fine. But. The enemies block your attacks ALL THE TIME. No matter what you do to them there is like 70% maybe they will block it. Are they on flames? No doesn't matter, parried. These are normal soldiers we are talking about. Attacked by a witcher who is a mutant and is super powerful. So in summary the swordfighting is midly shitty at times. Enemies block your attacks way too many times and it kinda ruins the fun. It's ok for them to block but the thing is they do it way too many times. I don't know if it's because I played on a huge difficulty but this is what happened to me. Now let's also talk about the signs. They were present in the first game as well. Now let me give you an advice. Make sure to max your vigor all the way, you will need it. Witcher 2 is more about sign spam rather than actually swinging a sword around. So yeah, they focused the gameplay more into signs. To clarify the best signs are quen and aard. Ignis was nerfed in this game as it appears to do shit damage and even when it incinerates enemies the enemies don't care they will still block your attacks. So only use ignis if there is a lot of enemies. Aard is probably the best one for offense. Use it at any chance you will get. If you see it's not working then time to play defense and use Quen. So it goes like this: Aard, Strong, Strong, Roll back. And just keep repeating till the thing is dead. It's different for every enemy which is what might make this interesting, but it's not fun when all you do is just spam your signs and attack every now and again and roll back again and again. Talking about the story. It's definitely not as interesting as the previous game and I got bored of listening most of the time. Also the whole item system was confusing as well. Way too many unnecessary items. Speaking of items, the potions. You cannot use potions in a battle. Who came up with this idea? What kind of moron decided to do that? It's really inconvenient for the player because you can't tell when you might fight something strong. And you need potions in this game because of the difficulty.

So in conclusion: 
The game is kinda cool in trying to create something new to the original game but the ideas didn't work out as good. If you want to play witcher 3 which at the time I am reviewing this I haven't played I guess you can decided to skip or play this game as well.

I was really touched seeing the visual and mechanic upgrades, I clapped during the opening cinematic.
Combat was more efficient, although the sign hotkeys were unresponsive at some points but maybe it's just me.
Overall game length is rather short (50 hrs with a pretty chill pace. Can be less).
The quests and the exploration was kind of too narrowed.
It's also unfortunate that we lost the drinking mechanic. I loved that one.

(TLDR)
For a game of its own, it's still a good game with an immersive story focusing on war, politics, and magic.
This is personal but somehow, compared to the first one, I seem to enjoy the previous more despite being ultra jank.

It improves on a lot of things from the first game but also regresses on other things. First of all I would like to mention it is shorter than the the first game which is quite surprising but for me quality counts more over quantity. If you use no guides and try to do everything the game has to offer you could probably bump up the overall playtime to around the same as the first game. 

When you first play this game you may be deceived into thinking it is a much better game than The Witcher and whilst that is true in some regard they are about equal. This game should have been an upgrade from the first game in every way but it really does go back in some areas.

Some good things this game does:

The visuals: The graphics are very good in this game. It looks beautiful. This is one area where this game is 100% better than the first game. One moment in particular where I was really stunned at how good the game looks was when I arrived in Loc Muinne in Chapter 3. All of this considering this game is a decade old really shows how impressive and dedicated the team were into making the game look as good as possible especially with their limited budget. In a nutshell this game's visuals will still hold up today for most people.

The story: I won't get too much into it to avoid spoilers but this game has a really intriguing story. There are so many characters with their own problems and backgrounds that weave into the main experience and I love that about this game. It is also super complex and arguably you need context from the books to understand this game entirely. However if you invest that time into doing your research and finding out the lore then this game's story is really rewarding. The story isn't about Geralt. It's about the world and how it is changing and as far as I'm concerned Geralt is just along for the ride. It also has a decision about 1/3 of the way through which changes the rest of the game and you see an entirely new side of the story which is unique. I've never seen any other game do this or at least do it this well and have this many changes. 

Performance: Unlike the first game that had a few performance issues (not many but still a few) this sequel ran very well. With my rig I was running the game usually anywhere between 70 - 100 frames and had very few drops in framerate. In a nutshell the game is very well optimised with the only setting I had to turn off being the ubersampling since it was a little too taxing on my rig but I barely noticed a difference with the game's visuals. I also didn't run into many glitches and never crashed as opposed to the first game so kudos CDPR. 

Exploration: I really enjoyed exploring the world of the Witcher 2. There are 3 chapters that give you large areas to explore with monsters to kill and quests to pick up as well as talking to a lot of NPC's that have their own quests or services to offer. The Witcher 2 doesn't tell you where to go for every quest which encourages exploration and it ends up being worth it since this world is packed full of details and interesting things to find. Sometimes this could be to the games detriment since you would spend a lot of time running around looking for this or that and not feel like you are making enough progress but it feels really rewarding once you do. I tried to avoid guides and online help as much as possible and enjoyed the game a lot more for it even if it meant dragging out playtime to find the answers to riddles or certain areas. This is how I recommend you play any game.

The Quests: The quests in this game similarly to the previous game are all really engaging. They usually all have a story to them unlike other games that have generic fetch quests littered throughout them. The Witcher games don't feel that way to me. You can choose to ignore them but you would be doing yourself no favours if you choose to do that.  

Now I would like to move on to the bad stuff

Combat: This is by far the most deceptive thing about the Witcher 2. It's combat looks a lot better than the combat in the first game and whilst that is true in some regard I can confidently say that this game has terrible combat. The main reason for that is because the combat relies a lot more on player input than just standing there and timing your attacks. There are so many problems however that I can't list them all but some are: Hitboxes are broken to shit, they were gang raped by the developers, enemies have iFrames whilst you dont, you will usually get hit by enemies even if you dodge perfectly, even with the upgraded dodge you will still get hit. Enemies can turn 180 degrees in a single second and enemies can block your attacks at any moment even canceling their attacks or other animations to block you. This can be so sudden that they will do this before their animation catches up. The point is there are so many things that bring the combat down in this game that I dont have enough space to point all of them out. Sometimes I wish we still had the combat for the first game, theres some perspective as to how broken this combat is. All I can say is it is improved to an extent with upgrades but I will get to that next.

Upgrades: Witcher 2 boasts 4 skill trees for the 3 components of gameplay. Combat, Signs and alchemy. The fact that you have to upgrade the dodge in the first place is absurd. If you dont have the upgraded dodge it simply wont work, no matter what you do you will always get hit by the broken hitboxes until you upgrade this dodge. The combat is improved by getting the upgrades but you have such a limited amount of talents that you cant get all the upgrades in even one skill tree let alone all 3 of them. This game should have had an NG+ mode to fix this but alas no. Side quests rewards are pitiful not only in terms of money but XP. The lowest I got was 50 whereas main quests give up to 2000 XP which is enough  for two whole levels which gives you two talent points. There is also a fourth smaller tree for some reason that expands on the other 3 trees but they felt the need to have it seperate. You also cant unlock the other 3 trees until you have spent a few talents in this first small one. Overall the skill tree system is one of the most confusing gameplay decisions the developers made when making this game. 

Bosses: This kind of expands on the problem with the combat but the best way to describe the bosses in this game is to say that they are very frustrating and suck the fun out of the game. Two of the worst being both Letho fights and the Dragon boss. Fortunately there aren't many bosses in this game, around 5. The Kayran tries to be unique but also ends up being frustrating due to bad hitboxes and overall awkwardness with trying to trap it. 

Lack of instructions: I know earlier I mentioned this as a positive but it goes both ways. It can also be a negative for some. This game sometines refuses to help you with finding certain items for quests the best example being the mosnter contracts that you have to find on your own. I don't mind this too much since it encourages exploration but some people many find it annoying and resort to using guides online.

Last but not least since I'm running out of space, inventory: This game has an arbitrary inventory limitation. You start out with 250 capacity and can upgrade it but very rarely. I usually had to put everything away in the stash due to running out of space constantly which became very annoying. There is no realism to this limitation either if you're trying to defend it with that excuse, if Geralt can hold all this stuff then why not just make the inventory unlimited?

I have many more things to say about the Witcher 2 which I unfortunately can't fit into this review but know that this game is still worth going over for context and story and the combat is bad but tolerable. Play it once and done.",1625570268,1625638406,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I will try to refrain from making an overused joke about Geralt hating politics but in this game it's mostly all about politics, but the sheer amount of outcomes for decisions regarding different characters, specifically political figures, arguably most notably King Henselt, and Saskia, which can indirectly dictate the course of entire kingdoms. I also approve how starting off on the main quest-line if you've imported your save from the 1st Witcher, then you get to use the same weapons you had when you finished the 1st game. I read some of the reviews mostly from back then about this game, and to be able to really enjoy this game, make sure you have at least a decent computer/laptop and keep steam cloud disabled on the main menu, also try not to have an influx of saves, i played through the game really only keeping saves a little before a major decision was coming up and i got through it fine. Pardon me being an extreme fan a little more, but the fact that Geralt remembers a little more about his past the more the story goes on is a perfect set-up to the Witcher 3 in my opinion. Last thing i swear, but since i helped the Order in the 1st game i absolutely loved being able to see Siegfried again, he is such a bro.

In my opinion, you cannot just be satisfied with 1 of the 8 endings I've heard you can get, i personally have 4 and i think that is a good amount of endings to have. I chose to go with Roche on my first play-through and got the ending with me helping Roche with Temeria, but also the one with my saving Triss instead, and similarly, with me either helping Iorveth at the end or Triss. I think this game deserves at least 2 play-through's, one where you go with Roche and the other where you go with Iorveth, in my mind that is the minimum to truly get the most out of this story.

So let's dive in shall we to one of the greatest sequals i've played.

prologue:
So the game really kicks of with a good start in the prologue as you are involved in the siege for La Valette castle. Geralt and Triss are still in the court of king Foltest from the first game and you act as a bodyguard of sort for him. So you take the castle and either kill or make Aryan La Valette surrender this acting as the first decision of the game. After this you and foltest go to the castle tower where Foltest's basterd children are being held captured but on the way the castle gets attacked by a dragon. This sepirates you and Foltest from the rest of the soldiers.
It's a real shame Foltest was one of the first games best characters but as the title of the game states he doesn't stick around to long. So as Foltest meets his children he is assassinated by someone who also appears to have the eyes of a witcher, the killer escapes and you are framed for the murder. You are later being questioned by Vernon Roach the leader of Temerias special forces, you tell him that it wasn't and he believes you then you sneack out of the castle and you're of too find the kingslayer. 

Chapter 1:
You arrive near the small town of Flotsam which is the location of where Iorveth a memeber of the scoia'tael from the first game is and who might have ties to the kingslayer. Upon entering the city you meet youre best friends Dandelion and Zoltan about to be hanged so you negotiate with the town leader Loredo to set them free. While in town you learn about a monster terrorising the locals this is also where you meet Silé de Tanserville a sorcerres who's also plans out to take out the beast know as a kayran. So you set out to slay the kayran and on the way learn more of Iorveth and the kingslayer. Having dealt with the monster you find Iorveth via Zoltan who later leads you too the kingslayer himself Letho someone who knows you very well but you don't reconise him due to youre amnesia so a fight ensues between but he leaves you behind after sparing youre life. Later you find out that Letho has kidnapped Triss and is heading to Vergen, this is where the real big decison start you can either go with roche or Iorveth which changes how the rest of the game playes out.

Chapter 2:
Upon arriving in Aedirn right before king Henselt (king of Kaedwen) attacks the dwarven city of Vergen to gain control of Aedirn a mist appears and separetes the two groups. You learn that this mist is happening because of a curse cast during a battle which took place at this place three years ago, so you must lift the curse before finding Triss. So you lift the curse 
through finding different artifacts representing things like courage or death and enter the mist and using these artifacts as a sort of reliving the battle. After lclearing the mist you learn more of Letho and where Triss is and that Silé is behind the kingslaying. This all ends with the battle for vergen and you leaving for Loc Muinne to find Triss. Overall this chapter is a bit of a exposition dump atleast at the beginning and the mist battle is a bit of a let down ending very quick after being hyped up so much.

Chapter 3: 
You arrive in Loc Muinne where all the kings and sorcereses will decide the fate of the northern kingdoms. Here many decisions can be made either to find Triss or depending on what decisions you've done before resulting in different quests. 
At the summit you barge in and frame Silé for the king slaying this all ends with the dragon from the prologue attacking and burning down the city. You later fight the dragon but you can spare it or kill it in the end. 
All and all this chapter is really short and there's a real lack of quests and it's actually more of a set up for the next game and it's a bit of a disappoinment really.

Epilogue:
You face Letho and talk with him and find out that Nilfgaard are the ones who are really behind all this and that they chose Letho so that chaos could ensue in the northern kingdoms for an easy attack. You can then either kill or spare Letho.

Overall the story is great and really lends it self to multible playthroughs.

Gameplay: 
The combat is great and can seem a bit sloppy at first but really opens up for many oppertunities as you level up. It's really fun to be in combat and try diffrent moves and such. Magic is a bit useless in my opinion just like in the first game i really only use Aard to stun enemies. A much more improved inventory from the first game now allowing you to carry mutible weapons and armor at the same time. The game really needs a mount or a way of fast travel it feels at times that youre just running back and forth.
It suffers a bit like the first game of at the beginning of a chapter just dumping you with a 1000 quests at once this specially is in chapter 2.
Almost all boss battles are bad they basically stun you with the smallest hit and then take away most of youre health with a chain attack.

Characters:
There's a lot of great characters and this is a massive imrovment of the first game, almost all are well voiced this really shows in Geralt who's now more likeable in dialogue and not boring and uninterested like in the first game. Dialogue for the most part is very well written though sometimes it drags on for way to long. Letho serves as a good antagonist making good use of Geralts amnesia. 
Most of the main characters are good though i would have liked to see more of Zoltan and Dandelion:

Summery: 
The witcher 2 is a great RPG with multible playthroughs being recommended, great combat, good characters and soundtrack. Though it is a bit short for my liking i suppose quality over quantity, at the core it's an epic story with high stakes and more.

Anyways, lets get all the negatives out of the way-

- Very clunky, shitty combat. I mean it- I have played my fair share of games with bad combat ans oh boy this one's up there. My suggestion- just keep the difficulty at medium, when u seem to be in a gangbang situation just turn difficulty to easy.There's no shame in it, there's no achievement for beating at higher difficulty so really you'll not be missing much. And if you're coming first hand from Witcher 3 then you're probably gonna have a rough time, but srsly, just stick with it. 
A lot of mechanics will seem underwhelming like potions, oils etc which are significantly easier to handle in W3 but remember this is a decade old game.
- Graphics is pretty good, many high res textures and good looking environments and models BUUUUT- the contrast is tuned to 100, and it physically hurts my eyes- it might not be same for everyone but keep in mind, if you face similar ordeal, just use a reshade mod.
- A lot of boring side quests, you know- typical rpg fetch quests, kill stuff, etc
- No gwent!

A lot of negatives huh? But don't worry- the positives far outweigh
+ An amazing, grandiose story with a deep emphasis on war, politics and conspiracies.
I'm gonna be honest, and it might sound controversial but I'm not really a fan of W3's main storyline- It felt just a thin string just to attach all these smaller mini arcs. Sure, the side stories are interesting, and Geralt himself is very charming in W3 but the overall story felt pretty bland with characters just constantly appearing/disappearing so it was really difficult to care for most of them.
W2 on the other hand, is very less focused on Geralt himself but the world and characters- You'll really feel attached to them in whatever screen time they have.
Based on your choice you get to explore 1 out of 2 completely exclusive area to that playthrough. And trust me when I say this- the ending, the story, it completely changes from this- you won't even realise you're missing half half the story untill you play a 2nd time with the other path and then you'll get that 'AAAH I SEE' moment.
Really, incredible work.
+ A very much tight experience, since it's not openworld the main story is always in focus and so game can be finished relatively quickly.
+ Runs very smooth and can be played on low end hardware, with 0 to very minimal bugs (I'm playing W3 it has a lot of bugs- from small graphical stuff to potentially game breaking that can absolutely ruin your save file if you just use 1 save)
+ Official Mod Support via W2 Launcher.

So basically if you're coming from W3, or this is your first game- you're most welcome. It's a very good RPG, I've played through it back in 2011 and then 2 more times- and each time the story felt to differnt but my experience was really good.
Just keep in mind, the combat is absolutely horrible- better keep the worse expectations from combat so you won't feel disappointed. 
Anyhow, I give Witcher 2 is very nice 8.5/10 and I absolutely recommend it.",1625312600,1625335590,True,2,0,0.527585089206695557,0,True,False,False

If this is your first entry into the series, you'll more than likely be fine to jump right into it. All that's really needed to know is that Geralt of Rivia, our protagonist, has amnesia and is a professional monster hunter whose mutant abilities and appearance are often grounds for open discrimination by the general public. Story-wise the plot itself can get complex and is intended for a mature audience. What I mean by this is that the characters are often morally grey and may be working for many different reasons and/or have ulterior motives to whatever they may be asking you to help with or whether they are working in opposition to your own goals. The combat is average in my opinion. You obviously have your light attacks, heavy attacks, block, parry, and dodge. Throw in 5 magic spells for you to cast and that's the basics to fighting. If you do decide to play this game on hard and above or whether you are just facing a tougher enemy, meditating and drinking and crafting potions turns this basic combat system into a strategy game. Since you can only down 3 potions at a time, choose wisely for whatever kind of enemy you are facing and also for whatever fits to aid your preferred offensive skill. The choices involved in this game are almost entirely based on your own perception on the subject or action at hand.

Having said that, i unfortunately have to say that this game is ""fine"". 
The story is compelling and, while the writing could be better at times, it delivers a really interesting experience;
the graphics are overall way better than the witcher 1 (duh...) and even years after release they hold up quite well.
The thing that bothers me is the way Geralt ""feels"": i don't mean to say that he is bland or anything, it's just that the controls are GOD AWFUL.
Some will say ""but the combat system in the witcher 1 is bad"": first of all, no, the witcher 1 had a combat system that was perfectly fine and serviceable even at the hardest difficulty; secondly while a direct comparison can't be made between the two because of obvious reasons, you could compare the combat of this game with other games.
The first thing is that the controls feel ""sticky""whenever i push a button there's always a small but noticeable delay and every action feels like you are controlling a 90 years old man rather than a monster killer mutant, i still don't understand why there must be an animation that lasts for seconds and stops you whenever casting a sign.
Potions in this game are a joke, the effects of the potions are shorter to balance the fact that now you don't need an alchemical base and the toxicity lasts way less, however potions seem to do basically nothing and if they do something it's worthless, might as well save yourself the trouble and skip the whole animation of  someone getting on their knees and drink a swig, might have been cool to prepare first if the whole potion/buffs thing was worth the trouble.
The dodge button is wild, it either does nothing or it shoots you in the next town over from where the enemy is standing, also enemies can still hit you sometimes even if you dodge.
To conclude, this could have been a favorite for me, but it isn't, the controls are just too frustrating.
I gave a thumbs up only because steam doesn't allow for a third option of ""it depends"", get it for the story i guess, but be warned that if you want to play the witcher 3 you can just simulate a save.",1624545236,1624545236,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Attacking can be a little unpredictable because here a press of a button may result in one to three swings of the sword, but one can get used to this later on in the game. Enemies are pretty forgiving and wait patiently for multiple backstabs after their attack animation had ended. On top of that, Yrden can be used to trap them in place for easier backstabbing action, which unfortunately is not so in the third game, where it only slows them down.

For me, the fun parts were not the combat but the exploration and side-stories that flesh out the larger picture. The story stands up on repeated plays as you identify hidden meanings behind the dialog that you missed the first time around. The combat was uninspired and painfully frustrating. The combat does not scale well: certain enemies (or bosses) will crush new players until the player discovers the ""trick"" to win. When the trick is learned, the fights can become overwhelmingly easy but that learning process is not fun.

I am 41.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.
After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Throughout the campaign you are forced to take a side either, first it's either team Blue (Roche) or team green (Iorveth), then in support of ruler A or ruler B, or help a sorceress or not, but thankfully the player is given an opportunity to maintain the stance of neutrality as a true Witcher and that taking sides was merely choosing the lesser evil rather than wholeheartedly support one kingdom after the other, however all depends entirely to your chosen dialogue. In terms of gameplay this makes the ending showcases a different outcome depending on the results that unfold because of your choice, which might carry different dialogues on Witcher 3. 

In terms of story I say this is a brilliant, in my opinion. People most likely don't like W2 story because it's rather confusing for newer players and full of political intrigues and conspiracy, key events that shaped the story in W2 (like the Battle of Brenna, Thanedd coup, the dissolving of the Brotherhood of Sorceress and lastly the formation of The Lodge of Sorceresses) isn't shown in-game, and explained either by text or by a bit of dialogues with certain key characters which can easily be missed.

Gameplay wise, is a quantum leap from W1 but a step behind W3. It's a proper action now rather than point and click action Diablo style of W1. The world isn't open like W3, but one medium sized map each chapter (there are 3), but still interesting because it has quality quests, every quest has its own twists rather than uninteresting filler quests (like AC:Odyssesy) but the same cannot be said for contract quests because they are are not interesting not like Witcher 3, it's only for making money. Potions have to be taken outside battle, by meditating (a bit more realistic but more hassle), signs especially Quen is needed because you often had to fight in cramped space, other than quen, Igni is the most useful along with axii (for cutscene), Aard for shielded enemy and Yrden is basically useless (you can slash Wraiths without Yrden).

The story and writing is excellent, dialogues and voice acting are excellent, these are what I like most about the game.
 
I have more hours than what is shown, by playing on another platform. So 40 hours is about the length of a single playthrough (all quests done on one story branch).

So if you're a fan of Witcher 3 (most likely the entry point game for new Witcher fans) and liked the lore, and never played the other , buy this, recommended. Just wait for sales (Witcher Series are often on sale including W1, if it's not on Steam, other platform like gog) if you're in doubt.",1622791972,1622791972,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Logra elevar el molde narrativo instaurado por BioWare y que para la fecha de estreno de este juego representaba la créme de la créme en cuanto a WRPG's, dándole  una textura étnica, sabor y una atención al detalle apabullante que sigue destacando hoy en día.

Todas las elecciones ofrecidas  de cara a construir un hilo narrativo multinivel de primera categoría, resultando en un juego de rol e intriga política a la altura del universo concebido por Sapkowski, además de mantenerse mecánicamente interesante de principio a fin.

El sistema de combate, aunque polarizante, me ha resultado divertidísimo y sorprendentemente respetuoso con la agencia del jugador. De buenas a primeras podrá parecer algo simplón, a la vez que se las arregla para resultar obtuso: esto culpa de una interfaz que si bien no es terrible, si deja mucho que desear. Una vez superada la (penosa) fase tutorial, el juego se abre de cara a una multitud posibilidades de interacción sistémica que mantuvieron fresco el combate de principio a fin, aunque ciertamente no se trate de un juego al que se vuelve una y otra vez por su hack & slash.


Se trata de una experiencia increíblemente inmersiva: NPC's con rutinas creíbles, quizás recibiendo inspiración del trabajo de Piranha Bytes con su franquicia Gothic y su peculiar fórmula. Todo su universo construído y sosteniendo una de las ilusiones jugables más creíbles que he tenido el placer de disfrutar. Altísimos valores de producción (gráficamente muy vistoso, incluso para el 2021), buenas interpretaciones de voz y un sentido del gusto considerable.

Assassins of Kings es un juego denso. Narrativamente, las intrigas que nos presenta son difíciles de seguir; aunque sumamente satisfactorias, en especial para los seguidores del universo literario. Pocos juegos presentan conflictos tan matizados, con tantas decisiones y tantas resoluciones posibles mientras mantiene un sentido del espectáculo completamente AAA.

I feel like the developers were trying a different approach from the first one and it wasn´t always the best approach. But overall it is balanced, you can make a lot of visible decisions and the story was really interesting.

I liked: all minigames (controls really suited me and the animations were nice),
visual side of the game,
story was interesting and well explained in the end,
characters were convincing and I really cared about them.

I didn´t like:
map - navigating and map were horrible,
inventory - names instead of pictures (I somehow got used to it after time but still didn´t like it),
you don´t have a free movement, it is the same movement system as in 1st Witcher,
music was not bad but also not really memorable,
story choices could be more ""explained"" I would like to have more evidence to base my decisions on,
there is no Yennefer, still only Triss (I feel that she would deserve to be there. Geralt could go to find her after the final talk with Letho. It could also make the game longer as I find it really short.)

Gameplay 8/10

Playing for the 3rd time, this game never gets boring or repetetive. Especially after watching the show, and playing the third game, returning to the Witcher 2 was a welcoming experience. Seeing familiar faces and assessing them through a difference perspective with the knowledge of The Witcher 3, books and the Netflix show really add alot to the story. If you're new to the series, obviously your perspective will be more of a discover's, but if you're a returning player, you will be the observer and you will understand certain plot aspects even more comprehensively.

A must-play and defenitely worth a re-play after the third game.

Choices matter. Fun combat, a bit clunky and in your first time playing you'll be overwhelmed by the amount of options at your disposal to deal with enemies (weapons, magic, bombs, daggers, traps). Level cap is 35. You can choose between three paths: magic, sword, alchemy. There are three chapters after the prologue. It is an adult game, which means if you're a teenager you'll probably find the political and existential discussions to be rather boring. But it also tries to please teenagers by showing boobs frequently. It also has some violent cut scenes, one of which impressed even me (I'm almost thirty seven). It takes 30-40 hours to finish. Hard difficult is easy, if you didn't choose alchemy path you can just ignore potions (they may have some use in dark and insane mode). Geralt runs like a snail, you can travel faster by putting two points on ""Feet Work"" ability. You can fail quests (and you probably will fail some without wiki). The game is graphically beautiful, Floatsam is the best ""in-the-forest-by-the-river"" village I ever saw in a video-game. A satisfying reference to two famous philosophers. Too many saves and the game starts to crash when loading or saving. PS: I don't mind having a insane mode, but locking an achievement behind it is simply unfair.

The story is well paced, well told with no obvious plot holes, and not at all overloaded with meaningless side quests that exclusively serve the purpose of grinding the player's character.

The variety on how to develop the character is enormous and I am tempted to say there's a bit too much of that considering the length of the game.

The inventory management UI feels a bit overloaded and would require simplification. Thus I consider it a UI that requires getting used to. 

The graphics are nice considering Witcher 2 celebrating it's 11th anniversary. The voice acting (in English) is good.  The sounds in cities and woods are sterile. The places feel empty.

I have played this game on PC and Xbox and to be honest it's amazing! 
+
there are things unique to this game like, the Design, Mechanics, Combat, Attributes and replay-ability.
the design is very distinct from the rest of the games, though it's now 10 years old it's still very good looking (at least on pc).
the mechanics like, the medalion and it's cooldown, the potions, effect, places of power and the items. *every* single items looks amazing and distinct, armors are beautiful, swords intimidating, and the rest of the items believeable.
The Combat leaves a bit to be desired but it's fun, the talent builds you can make and specialise your geralt is huge, it's also permanent (depending on path).
now attributes are cool, from +10% exp on everything and +30% resistance to fire to quen explodes with fire and aard is freezing. sometimes it's worth it to look up which you can get and making sure you do.
replay-ability, the game has 2 paths with one common one [/spoiler save triss instead of helping roche or iorveth]. which itself is enough to play both, but these have variations themselves. When you count in the builds and unique choices and quests, it becomes truly visible that to get to expierence the game in full, you must play at least twice.
there are also many refrences and easter eggs in the game, try, asassins creed, lord of the rings. 
there is also a quest which is not named in the journal, the wild hunt, you can find notes on it in [/spoiler claws of madness - flotsam. the notes of an mistrel in the crypts - looking for the dunbanner flag - vergen. the sword ann deirrha (i believe that's the name) and the speech with it, - gargole contract and looking for best armor in game (no dark mode) - loc muinne.]
- 
the only negatives are ""bad"" combat, and technical issues.
the combat could be better but if you play on normal, you won't be punished as badly for inconsistances.
and the technical issues are, the max amount of saves, voice cutting out in memories and reflections, crashes and quests locking for no reason, but these don't happen too often.

all and all, it's a fairly good game. i would give it (keeping in mind it's 10 years old) a 9.5/10",1588344334,1621863891,True,0,0,0.472440958023071289,0,True,False,False

I mean the difficultly curve, interface and mechanics sadly limit the game's appeal. But maybe it's because the developers intentionally don't want to cater to the mainstream audience.

Okay, so Witcher 2 is basically Witcher 1 keeping all the amazing storytelling systems intact with a complete overhaul on the movement, camera, u.i., inventory/skill management systems. Yeah, all the things that sucked in the first part are greatly improved in the sequel. Albeit, some issues still persist, but quite less in regard to the prequel. 

10 seconds into the game (this applies for players who played witcher 1) you'll find yourself drooling with disbelief at the drastically redone u.i. I mean it. IT'S SO MUCH CLEANER AND ORGANISED. I know where the health bar is, my eyes could instantly spot the main objective, I could see where I was on the map, god! Yeah all this, in 10 seconds. Not joking. Leaving aside the pleasant interface, Geralt's face, oh my, he doesn't look like a dumbass clown anymore. (again, for Witcher 1 players) 
Am not gonna bore you with the good and bad for this one. Yes there are some flaws like the permanent weapon/armour modding, lame Poker mini game, unnecessary QTEs. ugh why, just why and my goodness, no sprint yet just a small increase in movement speed, Smart guys made the base movement a sprint animation to hide the absence of a mechanic. Ingeniuos. 

Anywho, I really enjoyed the overall gameplay, I completed most of the side quests, and they're truly engaging please do as many as you can. This was where the grey universe of Witcher started to carve itself. Most of the choices you make wouldn't feel good or bad. And that's the beauty of role-playing in Witcher 2. Your choices will define your ending but it will be a balanced one keeping in mind the decisions you made. The game finally encourages you to use potions and oils before combat and yeah you can mediate anywhere you wish, unlike dedicated meditation spots in Witcher 1. The story has high stakes, bonds are created, you learn to care for some characters and understand the true nature of others. Loyal Triss fans are born here.

Fluid combat with well crafted dodge and parry mechanics which fit perfectly together and overall a proper synergy between every system. This time over, you wouldn't need as much courage you required to play Witcher 1, but again, if you are a player who loves narrative games and enjoy role-playing then it's your love for them that'll make you appreciate this game. For these players I highly recommend it and for players who are new to this genre, I'd say give it a go! Although if you're a newbie I don't suggest Witcher 1 cause that might just create a bad first impression for you.

P.S. - Roche is an interesting character, but I don't care what you think, Iorveth is by far one of the coolest ally and side character I've encountered in any game.",1621666739,1621699911,True,2,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

●Was in the game for about an hour, but played maybe 10 minutes. The rest of the time is between the tutorial notes freezing on the screen and not allowing me to go any further in the game. 
●After beating the arena tutorial it wants me to open the character screen and spend my point for leveling up, but I had already done that (""LEVEL UP"" rolled across the screen so obviosly I went there immediately) before the tutorial note popped up and this locked up the game. 
●Controls are a pain in the butt with either Keyboard & Mouse or a Controller.

●Got passed the Tutorial mess and into the full game, but there's SO much talking. It's all mono-toned and boring. I'm just glad there's an option skip it for my next play-through (if it turns out to be good). 
●Fighting has it's own issues. Using options like throwing daggers and dropping bombs is such a chore with how clunky and slow it makes combat that I never use them. 
●Interaction with anything except doors is a pain.

This time with improved visuals, more refined character models and UI, should I mention it also has controller support unlike the first one. The controls are great, the only off thing about them in this game is Geralt's square movement and that he cannot move diagonally it is understandable for the game's release time. The Witcher 2 continues on the first instalment story with Geralt still searching to find his memory and finding who he is. I appreciate this game for not only its' storytelling but how the characters are so alive in their parts, although their animations might get repetitive at times, the overall telling of the story and difference in characters and their motivations stands out from the start.

I am 41.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 :hillary: :hillary: :hillary: :hillary: :hillary: :hillary: :hillary: minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.
After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Besides the constant unfinished jank in form of bugs (many of them game breaking) the core of the game doesn't know if it wants to be a straight-laced action game, or a complex action-less RPG. It's like two people couldn't decide what direction to take, so they took both, and accomplished neither. And this is unfortunately felt outside the tedious combat and idiotic leveling system. Some of my favorite games are slow and clunky messes, but this game isn't worthwhile.

Despite that, it is a Witcher story. It's hard to completely fuck up the world of Witcher, though it feels like someone tried. I imagine the good enough story is a nice experience in the backseat, if you skip the majority of atrociously dull side-quests, the grinding fetch bore that are the main quests, and the repetitive nature of it all.
You might as well just read the books, though. The audiobooks narrated by the amazing Peter Kenny are stellar, and the writing is easily digestible, yet satisfyingly intricate, something the games couldn't quite match.

It's like a toy made of glue and toothpicks that looks like a cool Gundam. Once you start actually playing with it, it will break constantly and get splinters in your hand. It's still a cool looking toy, but... just buy a Gunpla.",1621151955,1621151955,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

UI is really unorganized and just doesn't feel very user friendly. Graphics and performance are ok, a lot of pop-in though. I just wouldn't recommend it unless you are someone who is extremely into the lore and that sort of thing.

I also think it's way more brutal and gory, and not trying to please the masses as much.

I nearly uninstalled the game right there.

Besides horrible quest design, the combat is really bad. When you draw your sword, you stand there like a moron catching your breath for three seconds. When Geralt finally decides to respond, he might thrust, slash, or do a gigantic wind-up pirouette at the worst possible moment.

'relax' in his companionship and to enjoy his royal hospitality yet our Witcher knew it can never be that simple,
From an honorable guest to a bodyguard to an accused murderer, it seems like everyone has forgotten that our Geralt is just a simple Witcher and no men killer
Freedom then raised it's price greatly and Geralt found himself forced to get the real murderer to prove himself guiltfree or just flee this land but he couldn't do that, for many reasons, there are many an answered questions remain to be answered and more importantly his friends, his memory and... his Yennefer

The Witcher 2: Assasins of Kings takes a big leap from its predecessor the Witcher one in almost all aspects, visually, voice acting, gameplay-wise too its mechanics, combat, inventory management, abilities usage and so on, I, actually, find it very impressive that there are only 3-4 years between the two games and the difference between them is massive!
...yet nothing can be flawless and this game is no exception, two main issues this game faces, the skills tree and the economy in-game
in the previous game, Orens were perfectly balanced when it comes to selling/buying items so and so but you could manage to save and buy expensive stuff, etc. but in this game, it's almost impossible though worth mentioning that looting provides a lot of loot and items to sell but again, the buyers pay little next to nothing, oh well
Second, the skills tree, there is no major problem with it really other than the fact that you can never reach top levels in it, heck, you can't even reach medium ones across all of its 4 branches, there are many things to work on and develop but the game is too short to give you enough points to go through it, it is just a flaw in the design, plain and simple, unfortunately.
now other than that^, Everything I said regarding the first game in its review can be applied here too with one extra note: it all works better.

The Witcher 2: Assassins of kings deliver an if not equal but a very genuine and enveloping storytelling on its own terms and I enjoyed it greatly. It introduces new faces and lifts the veil from others, all in all to create a spectacular continuation to an already spectacular story.

This game is too good to be real!

Quick side note:

Raise your expectations because Witcher 2 features major improvements if compared to the first game. Witcher 2 is much more like Witcher 3.
It’s much more visually pleasing then the 1 game. CDPR made a giant improvement just in 3 Years. The Combat system has also improved, the combat system feels much better than the one in the first game. There is one thing that I hate about the combat system: BACKSTAB. Becareful because you can take EXTRA DAMAGE from backstabs. 
The Plot is also better (Personally I think so). The story and gameplay are accompanied by a good soundtrack.
The really really bad thing about this game are the DIFFICULTY SPIKES. I beat the game in Normal, which sometimes made it fell like a souls game. I suggest you set it to easy if you don’t want to frustrate yourself too much. It’s not always difficult but the bosses and semi bosses are difficult.

GO FOR EASY DIFFICULTY

Summary: Definitely worth buying if it’s discounted. If you like the Witcher genre it’s a must.

I wouldn't say it's a great game, but it's by no means a bad game, hence the recommendation. The combat has the flexibility of the third game and the repetition of the first. Some missions are enticing, others are monotonous. The story definitely benefits from knowledge of the books and the first game. Such knowledge isn't necessary but it definitely enhanced my experience. Choosing your friends and enemies is probably the best part of it all for me. As well as unlocking insane difficulties beyond your first playthrough, there is a large temptation to see what was going on the other side of the fight. However my eagerness to pick up the third game kills my desire to replay this game. 
The beginning of the game is the slowest and most frustrating aspect of it. There are some segments of the first act that are absurdly difficult even on normal (and this is coming from a hardened Dark Souls veteran), which definitely hindered me from playing it through it entirely several times over the years. You find that character animations and NPCs faces are copy-pasted several times throughout the game, making immersion in the story a bit difficult. The side games (brawling, dice rolling, arm wrestling) are boring as hell and don't progress in difficult at any point in the game.

God, the dialogues and political hints to real life events are just perfect.

The choices you have to make in game also are not most of the times black and white, and you can always count on Geralt to comment his neutral cold truth view on things. If you care about a rich story and great narrative in a game more than anything, definitely play this game!

On the other hand, some outdated gameplay mechanics, plagued with issues both technical and in gameplay sometimes show themselves too much. I played the enhanced edition, and it really runs so bad, although it looks so good for a game this old. The in-game menus like the inventory, the journal/missions, etc are sometimes so annoying. The bugs are plenty, and about the outdated gameplay mechanics, one of the most annoying things is the interaction button, which you have to use a lot, and every time you are going to wish the game doesn't ask you to interact with anything again anytime soon!

And I absolutely cannot imagine my life without Witcher games. So, speaking of The Witcher 2 - it was first game of CD Projekt Red which achieved not just vastly major success but really mainstream success. It mostly happened because of switch to the new engine (made by CDPR themselves and later used in ""The Witcher III: Wild Hunt"" and ""Cyberpunk 2077""), called ""Red Engine"", and such changes in gameplay like the change of combat systems. So, the combat system of Witcher 2 is not so extra-ordinary like of Witcher 1 but can easily described with one sentence - easy to learn, hard to master. Yep, this game actually hard, even on normal difficulty. But it is absolutely worth playing, of course. There isn't much so good single-player games like the games from CDPR. And while The Witcher III Wild Hunt is legendary game and a must play for everyone, the whole experience will be much more solid and full if you will also play The Witcher and The Witcher II first.

As usual, story is superb and combat is fine. I actually enjoy the additional mechanics here like the sneaking.

Prologue - Average
Chapter 1 - Average
Chapter 2 - Very long
Chapter 3 - Short
Epilogue - Not just short or very short but extremely short

20920,91025701,76561198015863219,0,16,1462,0,1111,1620067990,"This is a strange game, you are Geralt or Rivia, a famed or infamous witcher with abilities to kill monsters, detect magic anamolies and generally get the job done. Your quest is to find the kingslayer. You will meet familiar characters along the way from the first witcher too. You pretty much start in the fire and continue on from there quest wise. The initial first hour of the game has you knee deep in a battle while you learn your key layouts. It certainly throws you in at the deep end. Once you have started the game properly you get a few more options and can explore a bit. questing in this game is fairly standard stuff, but there are some timed quests which will fail should you leave them too long. Leaving the first chapter may prematurely end most minor quests. I dunno if you can go back after I have not gotten that far. 
As a witcher you have plenty of abilities, and hexs/signs you can cast to help you fight against your opponents. You can also buy or craft armor and weapons should you have the money to do so. You can loot plenty of armor in the game, but modding it requires crafting pieces. If you want top notch stuff, be prepared to pay for the parts. You can also mutate your skills to some degree, but these require top mutagen dna. Most of it can be looted.  You can also make potions, but you can only consume one or two at most otherwise Geralt will get poisoned.

The game does not really hold your hand so you are left to discover much about your own predicament. That being you seem to have lost your memory (helpful). Your companions tend to spend a lot of time around inns, so if you cant find them, try there first.  You also have other skills at your disposal, such as being able to block/parry blows, shield yourself from harm, breakdown walls, cast traps. Lots of stuff to explore and try. You tend to carry two weapons, one is silver for monsters, the game will remind you if you are using the wrong sword, but the text can be tiny on a ultrawide screen.

The game does suffer a few issues. It does have some peculiar mechanics, lot of them irritating at times. For example, the game can force you into a pretty linear path at certain points and if you do not do exactly what your supposed to, you will just die no matter how skilled you are. It has happened a few times. Stealth is mediocre at best and perilous should you stray from the scripted path.  This can be very frustrating but there are some chances to explore areas for reward loot and some un marked quests, some are quite funny and worth checking out.

Geralt apparently can light torches on the walls, but cant cast his own torch to see in the dark, for that you need a potion to see.  In several instances i am stuck in the dark and cant light a flame to see my way unless its a scripted moment or torch.  Your forced to drink a potion to compensate for this (cat).

Also some cut scenes will interrupt some combat and prevent you from looting some monsters. luckily this does not happen very often.

Some of the quest locations are marked correctly, but often to get to them you must go the long way round. There are few sign posts and some times you can walk straight over a quest marker only to realise its really not there at all. It does not always make this so obvious and I found myself getting lost even though the quest location is right ontop of me. (it doesnt indicate multi level quests, you just have to figure it out yourself sometimes).

The climbing mechanic is clunky, you can climb certain areas but its a bit too specific for my taste. It is entirely possible to get stuck in some parts of the game. 

At one point casting a sign and pressing escape caused the game to lock up during the stealth portion of a mission. You had to calm the chef to prevent him from alerting the guards. I accidentally pressed esc while using the sign, the game locked up (had to forcibly close it).

It is an interesting game, it has a mix of stuff you will find in skyrim and dragons dogma. It is a bit linear at times, but its worth investing just for the story. I just want to finish it so I  can move onto the witcher 3.",1619560366,1619565621,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

I didn't enjoy, however, how I had little incentive to use traps and bombs, after all, those are fine additions, but I personally didn't find a particular use for them, save for the boss fight in Chapter 1 (sorta), and also, the Chapter structure from the Witcher 1 is still present, so I still felt a bit pressured to double-check everything in fear of missing something cool/ important. while I don't mind it very much, most of the cast from the first game has changed (I think only Geralt and Dandelion have the same VA, but I could be wrong), so there's this detail in case you REALLY liked the previous cast, but again, for me, personally, it's a bit whatever

The Story: Really good i mean what do you expect from a witcher game i'm pretty sure that some people only play these games for the story because its that good, the story is captivating and the choices you make in this actually properly change your entire perspective on the game and these choices are pretty early in the game as well, it doesn't make you wait for exciting stuff to happen because it already is exciting,

the combat: an almost complete upgrade to the original and requires a lot more skill then 1 and even 3 because you can't just counter attack everything because the game doesn't let you do it constantly the game has traps which are, well traps, and it still has oils and potions and magical signs but now instead of it being like an OTS game its like a 3rd person action adventure RPG that it was meant to be.

The minigames: now i personally loved the minigames in the witcher 1 but these ones were like exact upgrades, the poker, the fist fighting and a new arm wresting was really fun!

And yes, it's beautiful despite the game's age. I often found there were cases where I would stop moving around and simply look around at the world around me to take in the world's beauty and attention to detail.  The game aims for a more realistic world with less magical items and that sort of thing, and does a fairly good job of that. Despite a few frustrations I had with the game, I haven't come across many better options for realistic medieval fantasy RPGs.

The gameplay in this game is essentially like a typical RPG, but with a bit more player-involvement.  I mean, in some RPGs, you pretty much just build your character on level-up, and then the game mostly handles the combat for you by using dice rolls and that sort of thing to determine if you land a hit in combat with your sword.  Not sure if the mechanics use that type of system in ""The Witcher"" games, but they are definitely somewhat different in the sense that the player plays a much more active role in the combat (if they're playing the game as developers intended), because the combat involves an attentive player waiting for just the right moment during swordplay to respond to a briefly flickering indicator on the screen by pressing a button or clicking the mouse to perform counterattacks, ripostes, and finishing blows and that sort of thing.  

Additionally, the game seems set up to allow players to use combinations of things in combat, which can make the gameplay more complex and satisfying.  For example, casting an Yrden sign (a magical trap spell), luring an enemy into it to stun them, then performing an execution on them while they are stunned in combat.... as opposed to just running into combat flailing away with your sword repeatedly hoping to land some hits. 

The game also features non-magical traps Geralt can use as well, but I can only think of a few opportunities I had to use them in the course of my playthrough (because using them pretty much requires that you know about a future encounter before it happens due to the time it takes to set up physical traps -- meaning you can't really set them up during combat), and even then I was only able to use them by loading a previous save before a fight I knew was coming (by metagaming), which detracted a bit from the game's realism.  The developers should consider either taking them out or else finding more uses for traps like these in the gameplay.  

The game also has a few minigames and side-activities... some of which were decently fun (arena swordfighting or fistfighting tournaments, and relationships with Geralt's various beautiful girlfriends), and some of which were pretty uninteresting (dice poker). Generally something you can skip if it doesn't interest you, but a small amount of dice poker was required in one or two cases I recall.

There is a pretty substantial portion of the game that revolves around crafting.  By this I'm referring to alchemy (brewing potions from herbs you find while traveling through the world to provide temporary boosts to your character's combat stats), and crafting weapons, armor, swords, gauntlets, boots, etc.  Many of the best items for combat in the game are acquired by getting crafting schematics (either buying them from a merchant or acquiring them as a reward for completing a quest), then gathering the components listed in the schematic, taking them to a dwarven craftsman, and paying a fee to have him assemble them into your new sword, armor, gauntlets, etc.

Potion crafting is similar, except you don't need to take the items to a craftsman to create potions -- you do it yourself in the meditation menu. It's pretty straightforward.  You just buy the schematic for a potion, click it in the menu, and the game pulls up the handful of herbs from your backpack you need to use.  Then just click the button to brew/create potion, and you're done.  Fortunately, herbs in the game are very low-weight, so I like to just pick any herb I happen to stumble across while playing, and doing this I never found a shortage of a potion ingredient I needed. 

That reminds me of one annoying mechanic that can cause some annoyances for players, and that's item weights.  Yes, it adds to the realism (and this is a game which emphasizes realism to a moderate extent), so it's understandable why the developers wanted to put it in the game... but you have an incentive to collect as many crafting components as you can because it's a significant part of the gameplay, which results in your character being slowed down if you are carrying too much weight in items. This is not unusual for an RPG, but the game's crafting system encourages you to carry around so many crafting components that you end up leaving behind a lot of loot you could carry into a town and sell because it's just too much to carry (in addition to your various crafting components), which is frustrating... particularly given that the amount of money your character makes from the sale of items at town merchants is so small to begin with.  

I have heard there are mods people use to reduce or eliminate item weights, but it would have been nice if the developers put something in the game options to turn item weights off.  Or else have magic bags in the game you can put items into that eliminate item weights or something.

The game also had an annoying tendency to penalize players for not buying/getting something that they later find they need later and can't get.  For example, a certain item you want to use with your sword might have crafting schematics available to create it in the first town you arrive at in chapter one... and then after you leave that town, you won't find any schematics for those items in all of chapter 2, and won't find any more until you finally get to chapter 3 (the final chapter).  Or worse yet, an item that is particularly helpful to complete a quest that you can't craft because you didn't pick up some random component required for that item looted from a chest or box in the course of some other quest you completed a while ago, all while the game prevents you from returning to that area to get the item later once you discover you need it. This seemed like it could have been designed better. Please developers... stop doing this kind of thing!  Granted, that only happened in one instance, but it was annoying.  Considering the annoyance the game imposes on you with item weights, I found this aspect of the game tended to encourage me to want to carry around as much junk with me as I could because of the small chance I might end up needing it later and be unable to get it.

Game maps to identify the player's location in the game world appear drawn in an artistic and realistic-seeming way given the setting of the game, but were often very difficult to read, which is another small frustration I had with this game.

The game did a fairly good job with making the world seem realistic (and thus more immersive) without making the realism seem tedious (like games that bother you with having your character eat in order to continue to play).  The Witcher 2 strikes a good balance between keeping the world realistic and immersive without having the game's focus on realism get taken too far in ways that detract from the player's enjoyment of the game.  I found the game's moderate emphasis on realism and immersion delightful overall.

Despite my complaints, there aren't many other realistic medieval RPGs I can think of that are better than this one that have been created recently, so I'll give the game my endorsement for people who like medieval RPGs with moderate magic and an emphasis on realism. The game is pretty decent overall and gets a lot of things right, despite the occasional nuisance and my various complaints.",1618805537,1618805537,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Performance was dreadful on my PC though, it started off allright, really solid framerate even on higher settings. After that, it randomly started to freeze, mainly in the menus and cutscenes. This really messed with my enjoyment of the game because everytime I'd launch the game to play it, it was a struggle to even load up my save file. That coupled with some of the unbalanced and unfun mechanics like the buy and sell prices, upgrades barely doing anything and some really drawn out sections in basically every chapter make it really hard to recommend this game to anyone that has not already had some experience with The Witcher franchise.

Despite some technical issues of Steam version (I experienced crashes way too often), I really enjoyed gameplay and story. It's really fascinating how developers make you to choose side in the Chapter 1 and how dramatically it changes your game later. I really enjoyed playing both branches since they both are filled with good amount of quests and tasks, well written and just great. I don't regret time spent going on both branches.
One concerning piece for me is that game doesn't change too much with difficulty level, and it's just the same, but harder on dark mode. I actually started my first game on dark mode. I was a bit disappointed that the promised legendary equipment was meant to craft, not to find.

The combat isn't just a giant learning curve. The first real fight against enemies is brutally hard. It is much like Shadow of Chernobyl's first mission, the one with just a pistol to take out [b]armed to the teeth[/b] bandits. But it is also broken, very broken. You can hit the enemy, visibly see the sword go through them, but because the icon wasn't focused in on that enemy they take no damage.

After Witcher 2s first few combat encounters, once you learn how to fight, (by quicksaving, Quen and rolling) you get more invested in the story.

I felt really attached to the story because I had finished Witcher 1 beforehand, carrying my save into this game. Which was really interesting as all my choices remained intact. 

There's a few fights where it is incredibly hard, even learning the patterns does little to no use as the combat system is unreliable and broken at times. However, the story is what kept me involved enough to finish it in less than a week. Not just the story, but the characters too. There's so many decisions and conflicts perfected properly, much to Witcher 1s attempt.

If I even finally finish a game, it means it's good. And I finished this in 6 days. Yep, pretty good.",1617857036,1618725424,True,1,0,0.526066362857818604,0,True,False,False

+
Steam trading cards (8 to create badge)
Steam achievements (52, require at least 2 playthroughs or 4 to play without any reloads or sections replays, non the highest difficulty)
The soundtrack is one of the best in gaming history 
The graphics are still holding on surprisingly well
The combat system is much better than in Witcher 1
Incredibly replayable - Chapter 2 and 3 are different depending on who you side with in the first chapter (unique locations, characters, encounters, romances, and quests)
A lot of meaningful choices (the game plays completely different depending on how you decide to roll
5 difficulties (and the last one is worse than anything else as it disables your game load if you die)
A lot of animations depicting the consequences of your stories (and I really loved the drawn ones)
Decisions between games (Witcher 1 - Witcher 2 - Witcher 3) - some unique lines of dialogue are present and characters that died stay dead 
Arena mode
You are able to replay the animations from the menu
A lot of playstyles and their combinations
Exp gain feels really good as it is always 1000 exp to level up
Game scaling is on point (you won't end the game dealing tens of thousands of damage and yet you will feel constantly stronger)
Incredibly mature story
The gags and jokes in the game are still on point and they aged really well (e.g. LotR references) 
The majority of the game is lore-friendly and there are a lot of connections with novels
It really improved everything from the first game
There are no sides that are strictly good or bad and you will understand the drive and motives of every character 
I loved the side quests 
A lot of side lore and fluff in books around the world 
All pieces of equipment are visible 
Save games are much smaller than in Witcher 1 and there is Steam Cloud 
Comes with extras - Soundtrack, wallpapers, world map, guides, comix, avatars, artworks ...

-
The launcher has an issue with some Windows 10 configurations (0xc000007b) and there is no easy solution
The game froze on me several times (~10 times) while loading new tones or alt+tabing
No way to skip the launcher 
All options are in the launcher 
The controls sometimes felt unresponsive 
A lot of open endings that are apparently not solved in Witcher 3 or anywhere else 
Scoia'tael players are screwed both in Witcher 2 (Yaevinn is completely missing) and Witcher 3 (Iorweth is completely missing)
Some dialogues options are really confusing and Geralt often said something I was not expecting 
If you are going into combat from dialogue your opponent ""wakes up"" before you which makes several combat sequences really frustrating (it is not that often)
I hate the fact that there is a max level (35)
The inventory is horrible to navigate in and there is a carry limit. It is partially solved by the player's chest but that is a pain as well.

+/-
The dark difficulty has some unique pieces of gear
Gear is present and yet not transferred to Witcher 3
You need at least 2 playthroughs (from the ending of chapter 1 onward) to get the full story 
18.49GB download

Due to 0xc000007b error, I had to run the game directly from the exe file, bypassing the launcher and steam.

A ploughin' beautiful game! 
Combat feels real good and the mechanics are a bit more... complicated compared to the original but I am not complaining
Music is a bit of a disappointment in my opinion compared to Witcher 1 but ok I guess? 
Really good sequel to the story in Witcher 1.

But one small catch.. The PLOUGHING SAVE GAME BUG 
In the beginning its fine, it messes with the loading times a bit
but nearing the endgame its ATROCIOUS 
I could have avoided this if I had followed another reviewer here who said ""Disable the auto save and the Steam-cloud sync, after 500 (or something) saves it becomes really bad""
Which it obviously did... 
What happens is the game freezes and crashes every time you do something with the saves (when loading, deleting and sometimes even when saving)

I had almost reached the endgame but I have saved so much that it just would not let me access my save files and would go down taking steam with it.
So you not only have to reload the game again which takes a minute but also restart steam 
Really glad I invested in a SSD, this problem with the loading times of an HDD in just unimaginable 

So I watched the last couple missions on YT. But I really wish I could play it myself, looked really fun...
but I just cannot wait for another 10 minutes to load my save file... 
Oh yeah and, sometimes if you are ""lucky"" the game can also take down the couple recent saves you made. Yeah... 

Don't do what I did, just disable the auto save and steam-cloud sync and save only when its necessary and don't excessively save after like every cutscene... 
Otherwise the game is really stable and I haven'y suffered any crashes due to any other reason other than this ploughin save problem.

Other than this problem the rest of the game is beautiful and awesome...

The combat is a bit clunky but not impossible to work with. Potions and oils as always help a lot in fights especially against multiple enemies. I also liked the addition of sequenced boss fights toward the end of each chapter. It was nice to see more Zoltan, Dandelion and Triss too. 

Importing my save from TW1 was a good idea because it really made things feel more consistent and like I didn't do everything in the previous game for nothing. I might play through TW1 and TW2 some day to take different paths because there's honestly a fair amount of decisions.

- The story is captivating and the pacing is spot on

- Character development throughout is great and lays some important foundations surrounding key characters and about Geralts past in general

- Combat is simplistic but engaging enough to not be boring/fatiguing 

- The game really rewards preparing before battle in a way the other games don't quite seem to manage, and makes pursuing all the different battle prep oils/potions feel really worthwhile and satisfying

My only main criticism would be that if you played this directly after the first Witcher game, the beginning seems a bit rushed to tie up where the previous game left off and left me a tiny bit confused

If you are a patient gamer like me then dont skip this one, Its more Witcher lore to enjoy. It's an old, but well made action RPG. It has effective choices that make you stop and think, before you decide on which path to take. Once you understand the combat (better with a keyboard & mouse = my opinion) it's great fun; challenging no doubt but you look forward to the next skirmish once you understand what to do.

The game is the shortest in the triology, but that is partly because of the big feature in the game: after the first act or so the story splits in two and you need to choose a side. Much beter than the first game, but still has some much needed polish missing. I finished the game on March 6th but only now got around to reviewing it.[/b]

The graphics are good, they holds up pretty well. You can tell graphics were a priority for CDPR as all games in the series look pretty good even after all this time.

Gameplay has become good, showing the first itteration of The Witcher 3 systems. Audio is also good I'd say, I don't remember any songs but I never switched to listening to my own music during the duration of the game (the game is also pretty short so that helps of course). The audience firmly remains adults. The game needs a decent PC to run and performed good on Nvidia Geforce Now.

As with all Witcher games, the game has some really difficult bosses that need specific techniques to beat them. As soon as you have Googled these techniques, the fight becomes easier. The grind isn't really there as I focused on the main quest and was pretty on-level for most fights during the game.

The story is a bit weaker with the main antogonist ending up {spoiler}, but it's still a lovely story that shows a real-feeling world that makes me excited to replay The Witcher 3. As said in the intro, I took 20 hours to complete the main game with a few side quests sprinkled in, so the game time is about average.

Together with the other Witcher games this game is definitly worth the price, though I'd advice playing The Witcher 3 to see if these games are anything for you.

I remember spending a lot of time, taking quest and lost a lot Oren for just playing Dice. It's really hard to jog a memory of a game that I owned in 2013, before even the Sequel got announced I think.

The story is, you play as Geralt of Rivia (NOT HENRY CAVILL OF SUPERMAN, yet), a Witcher, means you hunt and kill monsters for a living. You're a Mutant! Just like Wolverine from the X-Men. Since I only played the first one on GOG that I haven't completed and SKIP it to the third and second game, here's the story. Geralt is frame for the murder of a King Foltest, which he didn't. Your quest is to find the bastard and the rest is spoiler that I can't share.

So, combat. Basically, the game is simple. You Click with your Mouse/Press X & Y with a controller to kill some enemies from bandits, elves and f@#K!ng creatures. You'll take a large range and variety of quest based on your gameplay experience. From sparring or killing a b!tch elves for stabbing you in the c0ck and help a troll avenged his decease wife. You also gathered/loot stuff up from Oren (the game currency), upgrades, plants/herbs to make medicine and craft some armor.

Now, the PC version of this game is FAR SUPERIOR than the f@#k!ng console! There is modding from Indonesian language, Witcher 3 controller setting, Poker achievements and lot of other fun exploits. Problem was, the game exploits in PC often can get out of control and you'll get easily glitched out in numerous ways, unless you load your previous save files. Also, the game is ton of fun exploring just one chapter to take some quest on and playing DICE and ARM WRESTLING.

In AMD A12 9720p RADEON R7 / 12 COMPUTE CORES 4C+8G w/12GB RAM however, the game is only playable in 1280x720 with low setting. Also, if you set it to low, you can't see the details on Triss Merigold [REDACTED], so I guess I need a better PC from now on. I'm not gonna continue it, due to my specs, but if you're higher, then go enjoy the game if you must.

The Witcher 2 is one of the reason why I love CD PROJEKT RED. Even they f@#K!ng it all up with Cyberpunk 2077, which I know it's not ready. But if you felt bothered with that, just go back playing The Witcher 2 & 3! F@#K the first one, that game is really outdated.

Witcher 2 is an huge improvement over the first game, but it's really tough to get into it. Story is good, I like it, but the combat in this game is atrocious and most of the time makes me want to pull out my hair. Keep in mind I am playing on Dark mode (2nd hardest difficulty), but I've seen people stumbling upon these same problems on lower difficulties as well. As I'm writing this review of the game I'm at the Operator optional boss, who is (what I've heard) the hardest boss in the game but probably for the wrong reasons. As soon as you damage him to a certain point he summons two gargoyles to help him, while shielding himself completely off against any type of damage. If you near the sorcerer at this point he'll use an Aard type spell, dropping you on your feet while the gargoyles charge you. There's invisible pillars around the area as well, from what I know these invisible pillars are there because they got moved in the enhanced edition of Witcher 2. These gargoyles also deal insane amounts of damage, way more than any other enemy up to that point, even their brethren. Just like Joseph Anderson said in his Witcher 2 review, every single combat encounter can be added to a video compilation showcasing the janky combat of the game. Every single confrontation has jank, no exceptions. Anyways, here's some cons in the combat I found annoying:

- Enemies attacking you after a cutscene, without you even being able to move or do anything for a few seconds, just taking the hits in.
- Enemies landing hits that shouldn't even have landed (example being the dragon boss fight and Letho at the end of chapter 1).
- Enemies magically blocking and parrying attacks they shouldn't be able to (for example from their sides or almost behind their back).
- Ranged enemies' arrows and bolts tracking you like they're some sort of homing missiles, sometimes even hitting you through solid objects in their path.

Those were the MOST annoying things I've encountered, but there's more. This was CD PROJEKT RED's first engine, so I don't want to be too harsh on them, but it's really rough. Graphically speaking though, it's beautiful and still holds up easily.

I realized some people played both Witcher 2 and 3 because the Netflix adaptation came out. For the record, I have never watched an episode of that Netflix show and I don't intend to. Geralt's (Henry Cavill's) wig alone is enough to turn anybody off to how unrealistic and hokey that show is. I also have a review of Witcher 1 from April 2017 (over two and a half years before the show aired an episode).

I played Witcher 1 for 157.2 hours (I also reviewed it) and then I played Witcher 3 and its two DLCs, Hearts of Stone and Blood and Wine for 256.4 hrs total (I also reviewed it).

[h1]Positive:[/h1]

+Story is really good. It's as good as Witcher 3.

+Story split in two. CD Project Red really created two separate storylines that coincide and give you the other perspective.

+Continuation of Witcher lore and rich characters from Witcher 1.

+Unlike Witcher 3, Witcher 2 gave sufficient time to the freedom-fighting Scoia'tael faction/storyline

+Really beautiful graphics and world

+Replayability. You have to play this game more than once to get the other storyline/side.

+Your choices matter (as explained above, what you choose dictates what storyline you'll play)

+A lot of content. I surpassed the 100-hour mark after two full play-throughs. In Witcher 1, there are five chapters. In Witcher 2, there are 3 chapters but each chapter, especially 2 and 3 are elongated with content.

+Eng-game armor (Vran armor/Elder Blood armor) attainment is more favorable/practical than in Witcher 3.

+Even though the inventory in Witcher 2 could've used a few improvements, it's not as frustrating as the frozen inventory of Witcher 3 where if you have a lot of items in your inventory, the entire screen stalls for a good 5-10 seconds.

[h1]Negative:[/h1]

-There's a glitch in the game where if you have around 300-400 saves, the game no longer saves, so you have to delete earlier saves. Also, the game, especially the introduction lags. Plus, the more saves you have, the longer it will take to delete each earlier save. Not only that, but the more saves you have in the game and try to delete earlier saves, the more likely your game will crash when you try to delete an earlier save. For example, if you have around 300 or 400 saves, you're likely to crash if you delete every two saves whereas if you have like 100 saves, you're likely to crash if you delete every twenty saves.

-Some of the quests are complex to the point where you have to look up walkthroughs. The in-game compass only shows you where to go if the quest is one of the main quests. If it's a side quest, then you have to look it up.

-Slotting mutagens to skills is something I had to look up (just like in Witcher 3), it wasn't really straight-forward. Also, the majority of the sword, alchemy and signs skills don't have mutagen slots, only a limited number do.

-Dice poker (which I explained in my Witcher 1 review). In Witcher 2, your chances of winning a dice poker game are just as bad, It's common to not win a game in five games. And for people asking, ""what's the big deal about playing dice poker in this game, can't you skip it?"" There are two or three quests in two or three chapters where you have to play (and win) to complete the quest.

There are flaws but witcher will charm you for sure with everything they try to convey 💥.. 
Worth every penny i paid for this .. you will not feel like a 10year old game .. it is fresh

2 cons : 
1)You cannot drink potion while walking , you need to medidate for that. that is the thing bothered me much in some part of gameplay 
2) you will not able to predict that some items will be useful for quest or crafting .. it will not be acknowledgable before .. This made me lost a Harpy egg and gauntlets 😅..

Cons: 
-Not extremely well-optimized, you may experience some minor lag even on high-end PCs
- The game only uses a certain set of music, and features no unique situational music, so the sounds you hear in the game can get really repetitive
-same goes for the animations: Geralt has like 5 animations for conversation and switches between them during every NPC encounter and every storyline scene, which gets pretty repetitive and boring.
-Voice acting is a bit dull and at times lifeless
-Missing some features for controller support (no sensitivity adjustment or other advanced contoller options)
-A BIG con: not a FULLY open world; once you've finished a story in a certain area, you cannot backtrack to it after you've finished the game, so when you've finished the game, that's it, you can't explore any more.

Pros:
-Excellent story which fits right into The Witcher lore and universe
-Engaging environment, you can interact with every NPC you see, there are a lot of places to loot from
-Exploration is fun, maps are decent-sized
-Grinding for weapons and equipment can be a lot of fun
-Many side-quests to keep you entertained and your coin purse full
-The combat is very well executed, attacks seem smooth, enemies act as expected. Overall, the combat is the most smooth part of the experience
-Often goes on sale (I picked mine up for around 2 Euros, which is a steal

Overall, has its ups and downs, but if you find it on sale, I would definitely recommend it",1617545591,1617545591,True,2,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False

- Girl romances is almost absent.
- Important Main Characters have different aspect from the previous game.
- Alcohol has been removed and potion crafting now doesn't require it anymore.
- Fist fighting is worst, Poker-dice you can throw your dice out of the board, arm wrestling annoying => minigame less interesting.
- you have a diary but to craft a potion you need to carry a formula in your inventory, because Gerald now can't transcribe formula on his diary.
- Trading is completely unbalanced
- Various games glitches as the characters disappear and appear in different location based on the interaction with them.
- game is often buggy: mini-map, crashes, characters spawning in wrong locations.
- the BLOOM graphic settings is awful.
- mini-games can go on repeating them without breaks, like the adversary has endless orens at disposal
	
- Dialogue options have improved, just for the extra options to use special abilities.

- Combat is different, slightly improved with more action, but can't have a potion while in combat… but it is absurd as from gargoyle when highly equipped and skilled you can still have 100 damage hits and basically killed in 2 attacks. 
Adrenaline strike doesn't always work, bug?


The choices  on the main story are dividing the game completely in 2 parts make it feeling like not playing completely after finished the 1st time. 
To note that some side-guests could have been included independently from the main path chosen.
Instead the game lose consistency on places and no reason at all why some side-guest simply doesn't exists in one path or another where could be available as well as some places are inaccessible that could be instead designed and developed to have the full game and side stories to be accessed independently of the main choices, but just with minor differences.
 
This game design choice to split the game in 2 main different story lines, it just ruin it as it is unlikely to reply the game just to make the other missed choices: the 2nd time playing it is less fun and more frustrating as known already how the story develop and is a redo because it wasn't possible do it in the 1st time.


Overall is a good game though, just the Witcher 1 is better than the 2nd especially as it continues the story at least the characters should have had the same aspect as the first one and not completely having new faces. (voices kept the same for English version at least, but not all of them)

But for sure if started from this one, i won't continue playing the other 2 games. 
If starting from the witcher 1, this is still a playable game, for sure is the worst of the trilogy even if i haven't played yet the third one.",1617535850,1617541106,False,0,2,0,0,True,False,False

[b] Gameplay: 8/10 [/b]
- Combat: Huge improvement over the previous game, combat is fun and very challenging but perhaps too challenging sometimes. Skill trees could be a lot better and diverse tho (more mutagen slots, more actives rather than just passive stuff,etc.) 
- Quests: interesting variety and the side quests contribute greatly to the main quest-line.
- Items and crafting: very well thought out, and great designs for both weapons and armor, could use a little more variety when it comes to the boots, gauntlets, trousers. Menu design and UI is a mess though. 
- Other: The game desperately needs a fast travel option even if the maps are small, running back and forth to the main area every single time can get tiring really fast. 

[b] Story: 8/10 [/b]
The game has an interesting plot and many good characters, but it falls in the trap of focusing too much on one part of the story and ignoring other parts that seem more interesting i.e. I think the game puts too much emphasis and time on the political side of the story and not enough on other things. Also, the game tends to overwhelm the player with names and several new characters at the transition between each of the story arcs.

[b] Graphics/Sound & Art/Technical Performance: 8/10 [/b]
An absolute marvel for its time (2011); gorgeous environments, beautiful music, good voice acting, well designed main characters and armor, etc.

But there are 2 very annoying shortcomings here: 1. re-use of npc faces, and I'm not talking about npcs you don't interact with, I mean npcs which you have dialogs and up close encounters with. 2. Sound mixing is terrible, even when turning the music and sound volume to a minimum, sometimes you can't hear what your companions and others are saying, it can be very disorienting at times. 

There are a few minor bugs here and there such as Geralt not opening doors and game getting stuck, but I only experienced the latter twice, and a quickload would solve this. No quest-breaking bugs experienced here.

[b] Replay Value: Medium  [/b]
While I get that the game is re-playable and has multiple paths story-wise, I just don't feel like it has enough value in doing so, and the main reason for that is combat-related, there aren't enough differences between the combat skill tree builds to make it worthwhile for me personally, but I get that many people would enjoy multiple playthroughs.",1617278766,1617279745,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

It's graphics are way more appealing and you can feel that it is smoother the previous game.

The series itself are a masterpiece, keep that in mind. However, since this game is old, perhaps it would be best for you to start with the 3rd game (last one W3) before starting with this one.

Unfortunately, I have to give a slight thumb down here, even though I can recommend this game for the story, music and general atmosphere only. The rest of it, especially gameplay and mechanics is just bad. On few occasions I was close to just uninstalling the game from frustration but the story kept me going on.
I started playing on DARK difficulty, inspired to go deeper into theory crafting. I like challenging games and I thought this one can provide it after seeing talent tree, recipes for bombs and different potions as well as gear with various stats. I just couldn’t stand it and in the middle of Chapter 2 I just switched to NORMAL just to finish the game. 
Reason for this is atrocious, inconsistent combat with horrible hit boxes and enemies just fighting and hitting the air few meters away from you, swinging their sword at nothing, which is honestly sad to watch (and yes, you sometimes take damage from them hitting the air).
It is so dull and it is draining all the enjoyment from the game. You knock opponent down with the sign, hit him, and he is up in milliseconds to hit you back and you just die. Next time you do the same thing, finisher animation starts and you kill the opponent instantly at full HP. You dodge roll the enemy swings, get behind the opponent and try to hit the opponent from the back – guess what, he just instantly 180 to hit you back or just parries the attack with the help of the invisible hand of its guardian angel. And forget about the meaningful use of signs and bombs, because they don’t do much to be worth the hustle of stopping mid combat to switch to it. It adds another layer to non-fluidity of combat. This abomination is if you take all the worst parts of Sekiro (my favorite game) and Dark Souls and mix it together without idea what you are doing.
So if you are here as a fan of TV series or Witcher 3 I propose to switch it to normal or easy difficulty and play to experience the lore and story, because it is good and it might be worth it. The music and atmosphere is also on point, and graphics is generally good and can look beautiful at times. What it lacks is a deeper world building and attention to small details. It is mostly linear game and not much exploration to be done so conclusion is that If you are not a big fan of the Witcher series, just skip it.",1616598232,1616703044,False,9,1,0.468302100896835327,0,True,False,False

Con: You cannot maintain neutrality; the overall atmosphere is weaker than in The Witcher I; and the combat is more difficult to learn. No need to eat, no need to drink, silly potion making... The meditation and potion mechanics were better in the first part, I even liked the storytelling better.

Overall: This is probably a better game than the first part from a gaming point of view; however, the stories told have weaker atmosphere and therefore a bit lower emotional impact. But well...

The Witcher 2 tells a mature story full of mystery and intrigue which is made even better thanks to well written and well voice acted characters within a detailed and immersive world. It's not fully open world but you can explore off the beaten track if you want, which is worth doing as you may find better weapons and armour and even ingredients for stronger potions along the way. There are plenty of -mostly- interesting side quests to keep you busy and the main story can be affected by your choice of dialogue options which result in different scenarios for the story to play out in. The graphics also hold up pretty well despite the games age.

Combat is much better than it was before. It's no longer clunky and awkward. Instead it feels much more fluid and refined. One sword for killing people, a silver sword for killing monsters, traps, bombs, and a multitude of  witcher signs giving you different tactical advantages against a wide range of enemy types makes for very engaging fights. Some of these sections can be pretty tough though. The game doesn't hold your hand every step of the way. Instead it treats you like an adult and expects you to think and work things out for yourself, both during combat and for the story.

There are some things I don't like however. While I get the inclusion of alchemy and the ability to create potions, they can only be created and consumed by meditating and going through menus. This means there is no way to drink potions during combat, which if frustrating, especially when you're in the middle of a tough boss fight and low on health. The UI is messy, there's no fast travel and you will want to manually save the game at regular intervals as the auto save system is completely incompetent, sometimes putting you back as long as 20 minutes.

So the game isn't perfect but certainly improves on a lot of the shortcomings the first game suffered from. It's definitely a game I'd recommend and one that's worth playing more than once in order to see everything it has to offer.",1616621612,1616621612,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

By ""logical"", I mean that it seems the developers thought it best to be on the safe side and make it more ""cinematic"" in its approach. This means that they needed to take away some of the things that made the original game great, like a deep intuitive (albeit clunky) character development system, a rich card collecting side-quest by taking as many women as possible, and a wide variety of quests and side quests. What we have here in the sequel is a watered down version that seeks to make it more fast paced and fun. They succeeded in much better and fluid animations of fighting, but left me wanting more with limited and almost boring animations whenever he is taking women. This is an area in which fans almost expected an improvement upon the original, but unfortunately it was not in the cards this time around. I haven't played the 3rd game, but I expect it to be more of the same. Why am I droning on and on about this? Because it's not The Witcher without it. You might as well play Kingdoms of Amalur or something. Anyway, the meditation mode was an improvement I liked, which seemed easier to understand, but I never really made any potions, usually just depending on better equipment and spells when fighting. Another thing they could have done better was combining spells with attacks. It was just okay but could have been enriched with more animations and combos. You should be able to use his spells to your advantage in just about any way within the game - at least in my opinion. So in conclusion to my rambling, I recommend it but not highly. It's a lighthearted fun game that takes a closer look at Geralt's past, but ends abruptly and leaves you wanting more.

As should be expected, the prequel is the inferior product in every way. Witcher 3 is a masterpiece of masterpieces. That being said, there is still a great game to be played here, despite its linearity, offers deep philosophical choice and consequence found in no other games. There are probably only a handful of games you can play 40 hours to the final boss fight and instead of dueling it out, have a polite conversation and go your separate ways. This game will make you ask yourself those kinds of questions. Are my enemies' actions really so different from my own? Am I a morally righteous killer? Perhaps the most compelling feature of the game is that among the many choices you make, there's a big one that sets you on a completely different path to resolving events. You meet and work with entirely different characters and earn entirely different gear. There are hours of unique game play between them. The effects of the choice are so profound that you have to play the game at least twice to experience both paths.

Like probably many of you, I came to play Witcher 2 after Witcher 3. I wanted to know more about the backstory to the WildHunt and I thought Assassin of Kings could provide some answers. Unfortunately, that is not the case. Not a lot about Geralt is revealed in this game and the scope is pretty limited. Your character has amnesia and you get drip fed plot details until literally the final act. There are few interesting world state changes in Witcher 3 that can occur based on choices from this game, but none that have a major impact on the story.

Perhaps you'll feel downgrade if you played the Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, but definitely not if played only the 1st witcher. When you play both games, you can really see how much work the developers put into improving everything in the 2nd title. I would definitely recommend purchasing this title, but know that it comes with a few pros and cons. I would also suggest reading the witcher books in order to understand what is going on, however it isn't really a necessity. Just makes the overall story a lot more interesting

Pros:

- The graphics looked astonishing for 2011, and still look pretty good in 2021. 
- The story is great, with many intriguing plot-twists
- The game does a great job of conveying the atmosphere of Andrzej Sapkowski's books.

Cons:

- The combat system. I would recommend playing this with the witcher 2 overhaul mod in order to get a better experience. The combat does lack quality unfortunately. Dodging doesn't work that well.

- The difficulty level. I have never seen such a vast change in difficulty levels in any game, probably ever. And it's not a good thing. Easy difficulty is a total walk in the park, while Normal is occasionally harder than Dark Souls. 

- The game's economy. It is quite difficult to earn money here and the prices for most things are outrageous. As stated earlier, reccommend playing with the overhaul mod.

Unfortunately, the absolute linearity and scripting of individual episodes greatly spoiled the overall impression of the game.
Most logical tasks can be called logical only symbolically.

-Solid story.
-Good visuals.
-Triss.
    Cons:
-Short. Very short. Most of the time played, I spent grinding nekkers and harpies for Dark mode sets. Had dreams of nekkers after that. Never again.
-Game crashes quite often, even tho Witcher 3 works smooth as baby bottom. Save often.
-Bad design of playing other-than-Geralt characters. They have no dodge, and on Dark mode the gameplay... painful.
-Operator fight. Googling, I found insane amount of people who uninstalled the game after few tries. I perfectly understand them, after beating him on Dark mode.

This time it starts in the middle of a battle. And im stopping here due to potential spoilers.

    The game is from start superior of the first one. From graphics, to gameplay and combat, with the mention that alchemy works a bit different here, that u cannot drink potions during combat. You have to use them just before the battles, otherwise you cannot use them, except oils which works before them aswell as during battles. If in the last game the signs we're viable few of them, this time all signs have a purpose, but most of the time you will use the Quen one aka the shield. On easier difficulty you can walk through the game without a problem, forgetting about them or, enhancements, potions and so on. On harder difficulty, you have to use all available weapons you can have, from bombs, traps, signs, potions and so on.

    The combat is very different from the last game, its on another level and another learning curve, just roll 'n roll, parry, use shields and run arround to recover a lil bit o HP. Another point, the Geralt in this game is a little bit of cannon glass, you are pretty vulnerable to everything during early and mid game. I personally invest in swordsmanship talent tree and by the end of the game I was a tank.

    Again, dont skip cutsence, dialogues, books and journal, as the previous game, alot of the story and information you'll find here.There are much more to say about him, but I let you to descover it.

Definitely better from first.
Pros:
Minigames, similar to Witcher 1, so most of time spend playing on dice.
Better graphic.
More exciting combat, on insane lvl you need to do a tactic to win fight and not die.
Very good tree of abilities, so much ways to do Geralt stronger.
2 Ways of game, so to complete game in 100% you need to finish Witcher 2 twice time.
Very curious insane mode, I recommend everyone to try finish on this difficult, only at start it's harder. And when you die on this mode, you must start from the beginning.
Cons:
Much bugs, like character which one we must follow is blocking and reload only can help.
Closed location
Short game
Boss fight could be more harder

Theres no real way to avoid this unless you know what's coming ahead of time and and have alot of skill at the game because the potion system (your main source of buffs) is so obtuse and difficult to use.

Some battles are so ridiculously unbalanced that you'll have to replay them 1000 times on normal difficulty. In Chapter 2, things quickly get easier and in Chapter 3, they are quite easy. Also some of the quests are actually interesting, like the Mystery manuscript or whatever was the name. With puzzles and everything. 
So  the game becomes fun the better equipment you have. And the story really develops and becomes very engaging. And you get laid A LOT. Though they could have bothered to make different animations for the different characters you plough. 
But 1) hte difficulty level in the beginning is ridiculous. 2) there are some bugs, which is very weird for a game that's soooooo old. They certainly had the time the fix them, had they wanted to. They obviously didn't care about it. 3) There are problems with game-saves on Linux. For example, sometimes manual save won't work and only F5 will. I had to replay 1 hour because of that 4) I really don't like how you get some world-building only in Chapter 3. And you get to care about the characters only in Chapter 2. Since Chapter 1 took like 20 hours for me, that's 20 lost hours of very annoying grinding. I don't like that. 5) What is the point of having such a large skills tree if you can use only about 30% of it. Or even less. That was disappointing. 6) Game-play wise, it's super hard to use different spells than Quen. Whoever made this choice, to hide the skills in Ctrl or to shotcut them on the numpad didn't deserve his or her salary. Very bad choice. I've almost not used any other spells, while in TW1 I literally used them all (but Axii, what does it do anyway?) 
There are probably other things, but my point is, I still feel TW1, with it's worst well everything, told a better story. And I guess that's what most of us play these games. Anyway, I liked the game, played a lot of it, so I can't not recommend it. But a note for people who are now considering playing it - for F sake, play it on easy for Chapter 1. Otherwise it's very frustrating. Also, take the time to explore quests - some of them are super fun. Like the troll family one - their lines are hilarious. It's a beautiful game, it's sad they didn't make a better effort to balance the battles in the beginning and to fix the bugs.",1613935004,1614537300,True,0,0,0.474820166826248169,0,True,False,False

I consider it a recommendation if you are still living in 2011.

Any game in this day and age with these mechanics are simply impossible to play for me. I have been playing games for more than 25 years and I can stand the antiquity of a game for nostalgia, yet it was not the case for Witcher 2.

- Fast travel is not to be found and maps are not that small so you waste a lot of time going around. There is no mini map or a quick map key, so each time you have to stop the game go to the map and back.
- You can only view 1 quest on your map at a time so you do tons of backtracking in the same confined areas.
- Carry weight is ridiculous.
- No jumping nor sprinting.
- Menu UI is torture with a controller but the game itself is even worse with keyboard + mouse.
- Many day time specific quests.
- Monsters spawn indefinitely at some locations which if you try to do some research or other activity, it will constantly block your interactions because battling.
- Can not clear an area of quest givers due to ""1 quest on the map only"" bs.
- Maps are seriously restrictive. If you call this somehow a limited open world then so was Crash Bandicoot and Spyro.
- MANY inconsistencies within the so called amazing story line from start to finish.
- Entire game has this weird orange blue glow filter on it that it made it very weird and aesthetically unpleasing to the eyes at times.
- Story barely means anything and leaves you hanging in the air and almost has no real connection to Witcher 3. You could completely dive into Witcher 3 without playing 1 or 2 and would be doing ok.

Yeah, needless to say that it did not aged like fine wine. Back in its time this was a decent game for its price and an easy buy, not with todays standards. No.

More the time passes, more I think that CDPR is a company who made it all thanks to the master piece Witcher 3 was. Which they didnt had to invent much, considering their game lore, world and almost all of the characters came from Sapkowski s books. Witcher 2 was a ""good"" game for its time, nowadays, its a pass for me.

I returned to it after playing 3 and realised that its story was the BEST out of the trilogy. The combat sucks and it crashed too often, but all the pain was worth it...the story was that good. I loved how they made 2 different paths with two different stories, with 2 different maps to explore. The character development was deeper, and the political intrigue fascinating. This game should not be judged in its combat, as it utterly fails to deliver; but its deep story where choices make a difference.

Moreover, if you've come here from Witcher 3 and the books, you should definitely check this game out and download the Farewell to the White Wolf mod. That mod is a whole game by itself that uses Witcher 3 assets, but with a Witcher 2 engine. The story in the mod tied up so many loose ends from the entire trilogy and the books, making the mod one of the best I've ever encountered.

Combat is VASTLY improved over the first game.
Graphics look great for their time.

Actual branching dialogues and path choices are a nice touch

Voice acting is pretty good

Once again, the devs treating their playerbase with respect and having nudity and adult themes in general in the game is a plus. Because, we're old enough to decide if we want to see breats, ass and blood. thanks.

The Meh:
Crafting is a mixed bag, it's often cheaper to outright buy stuff than it is to buy the diagrams to craft items and equipment.

Quick time events were and still are a bad idea. Making the boxing matches QTE's is bareable, but adding them to bossfights is not.  3 times I ""died"" because There was a QTE when I assumed I was watching a cutscene.

The level cap. It's 35 in this game as opposed to the first game's 50. And worse yet, in one of the branching paths, you CANNOT reach max level even if you do every single sidequest UNLESS you get a HIDDEN and MISSABLE ability in the VERY BEGINING of the game. Frustrating.

The Cons:

The DLC adds little to this game and short of the mysterious merchant can be completely ignored.
Your item carry overs from the first game are also completely meaningless. They give a VERY small bonus at the very begining of the game and then are worthless beyond that.

Enemy AI isn't the greatest but i've seen worse. Still, I can't give it a pass.

Well, I tried to anyway. I dropped the first witcher game after about five minutes as soon as I saw what the combat was like in it, and promptly downloaded this one. I had actually been advised to skip them both and move straight to The Witcher 3, but I simply couldn't see the logic in that decision. After two playthroughs of The Witcher 2, which are needed to get the entire story (you're forced to choose to follow one of two factions near the end of chapter one, both of whom get about half the overall plot), and having finished most of The Witcher 3, I now understand. 

The Witcher 2 is not a bad game, it's just so terribly disappointing. I was expecting far too much from the narrative, which here is barely serviceable and delights in forcing you to make hard choices by making sure that each option you have sucks pretty much equally. There were maybe five times throughout this game where I made a decision and actually felt okay about it, with some negative consequences being unavoidable entirely. To be fair, this was my very first experience with the world of the Witcher, having never read the books or watched the Netflix series, and had no clue what I was getting into. Had I known, I probably wouldn't have spent the money on these games as this just isn't enjoyable for me. I'd imagine most people looking at reviews now have seen the series and are aware of what's in store, but I'd like to try and give somebody the warning I would have liked to have received. However there is one story related flaw I simply can't forgive: Out of all the hard choices you make in this game, only two have any actual impact on the third game if you import your save, and as far as I know you can get by just fine choosing the ""bad"" options in the Witcher 2. This made me feel like I was forced to sit through hours upon hours of B.S. only to be told it was all a dream or something. It sure helped me understand how angry the fans of HBO's Game of Thrones series were with that last season.

The gameplay, however, saved me from completely hating this game. It's pretty basic RPG fare, but it's very fun and the combat was super satisfying for me. Might be because I'm bad at video games and played on the easiest difficulty setting, but I had a great time beating the crap out of anyone and everything dumb enough to attack me. I only have two gameplay related complaints: One, the chapter one boss battle is awesome and really well designed while the other boss battles just aren't. They're no different than regular enemies, just stronger. Two, it's pretty tough to save up a decent amount of coin and if you don't know when you're getting an upgrade ahead of time you'll waste it all and be screwed. There are only a handful of items actually worth getting once you know where everything is, and you can loot most of what you need for them. After I knew that I didn't mind so much, but that first playthrough was so frustrating I almost dropped the entire series.

I'd give The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings Enhanced Edition a 6.5/10, and recommend it for informed folks who know what they're in for. Such individuals would likely get more out of it than I did. Otherwise, either skip straight to The Witcher 3 or don't bother at all.",1613385478,1613385478,True,19,0,0.678673148155212402,0,True,False,False

I went through the games in chronological order. Therefore, this game felt very enjoyable in my first run. However, when I visited this game again after finishing Witcher 3, I realized that this game has numerous shortcomings that really reduce enjoyment. The meaningless time limit on using the Witcher necklace, the completely senseless combat mechanisms and so on. This is still a very beautiful looking game (in highest game settings I can't believe how a game this old could look so good still). But the fun is definitely not there, anymore. I'm slugging through the game simply because I want to explore an alternative end, but it feels like work.

First Review: Incredible game. I can't describe how much I loved it even though I found the fighting mechanism much more difficult than Witcher 1, even at the easy setting. The inventory control was not very easy, and crafting was mostly useless. The story (and the overall adult theme of the game) was very pleasing to me as I hate games which are aimed towards children. I'm very happy that I played Witcher 1 before this; the first game gives a lot of context. I played the enhanced edition, which was one of the best looking games I've ever played at ultra settings. This game has a lot of replay value, thanks to the many impactful choices you have throughout the game. I intend to return to it after I get a taste of Witcher 3, as well.

The flaws of the first one can be forgiven, it's an old game made by an inexperienced and fairly small team and was an ambitious game, the Witcher 2 as none of this excuses.
The gameplay has always been the weak point of this games, the first one had a simple and a little uninspired gameplay but as they say ""it just work"" but the second doesn't work. You can't control the animation of your attacks cause they are random, so you don't know how fast your attack will be and when it will land, this coupled with an absence of a combo system makes the combat system a button mashing. To be fair the first game was too, but it was an old school RPG, the second one want to be an action game RPG, something like a souls game if you want. Hit boxes are a problem too, your attacks will sometimes miss the target even when you're supposed to hit them, this can happen often when fighting short enemies like the Nekkers. Like this wasn't enough, the game difficulty is poorly balanced, enemies can swarm you very quickly and kill you in matter of seconds, especially by using the X2 damage bonus they get by attacking your back, you can't stun lock an enemy by normal means and most of them are damages sponges. This will force a boring and unfair hit and run tactics and will drag most encounter. Some of this problems can be countered somehow by levelling, there is a skill that improve the distance covered by your dodge rendering it usable, and another one that negate the bonus back stab damage monster get, making the game more fair but boring nonetheless.
Another problem of the gameplay is that has lost it's personality, now to follow trends has a crafting mechanics for near everything, there are a lot of boring and silly QTE and as said before the combat now is a bad ""wanna be souls like"". The dialog choices most of the time don't reflect what you expected them to make you say, so you have to be something of a mind reader, the potions now are near useless, you can't drink them during a fight for...""reasons"" but only when meditating (you can now do that everywhere if you're not in a fight) and they last like 5 minutes, so unless you are replaying the game you can expect to use them just for boss fights, now most quests are not indicated on your map and don't contain proper indication to where and how to do them and the controls are bad...like really bad, it's clear the game was made for consoles, near all of your actions will be tied to the same mouse button.

It provides the usual crafting, skills and attribute management, which is still entertaining and working flawlessly. However, the Witcher is like a bastard sibling of the Elder Scrolls. It's supported by often complicated, confusing and completely schizoid writing. To read and get into the Witcher's background is like witnessing a group of teenagers trying to describe the financial market after ingesting sugar cubes saturated with LSD.

This game is mostly a reckless on screen delivery. The characters are uninteresting pieces of animated clay. I can normally live with that, but in this particular game, it just leads me to lose attention if anything is going on for more than a minute. Add to this that the combat in the Witcher is limited to mashing the same key over and over without any specific aim. There are combat skills and fancy moves sure, but why bother?

Just mash your single attacks a few times, then don't touch anything and watch Geralt's figure skating moves do the work. It's dumb, boring and gets annoying real fast when it seems the scene you're stuck on isn't ending. Why would it end? I don't know, maybe some lousy quick time events could have been implemented better? Why though? It's an RPG game, why saturate it with lousy game designs like quick time events? Geralt has several skills which I've never been bothered using or even developing because the entire combat game is simplified enough for a cat, stomping on a keyboard, to succeed.

The Witcher 2 or any other Witcher branded product, isn't recommendable. Unless you're bored or out of money and can't play anything better, don't bother.

It might also be in your interest as a reader and consumer to read my review of the first game for additional context.)

Part of the reason I was excited for Cyberpunk was having fond enough memories of this game when I first played but never finished it. That said, I still think Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings was a step in the right direction for CD Projekt Red, whatever its flaws. The creation of their own engine certainly lent the game a much better look than some old engine they borrowed from Bioware, with much better physics, graphics, and general presentation (I noticed a few oddities, but nothing overly distracting like in the first game). The combat is a little more Souls-like and is a lot more fun to do than the first game. I did appreciate that the game makes your choices in the first game matter in small ways, mostly in dialogue but also one particular incident where a character I remembered from the first game sent somebody with a gift for me. 

Witcher 2 also has a far more engaging story overall, with lots of memorable and interesting characters, action set pieces, and compelling drama and dark fantasy. Choices feel like they matter more here and you'll be hard pressed to think that no previous decisions will turn around and bite you in the ass. The music is probably also the best in a fantasy game I've played yet (though I'm sure the third game has some good tunes).

The only issues I have are these: They somehow made Dice Poker even more insufferable than the first game, which is a feat, the level design of Chapter 3 made attempting sidequests very frustrating, and for whatever reason, the game really struggles when there's a lot of save files in the game. For a good while, I had the game crash very frequently when I tried to save scum or reload saves, something the design of the game trained me to do, all because of a backlog of saves from my 2015-2016 playthrough. If you're playing for the first time, this probably won't be a problem, but you will have to be vigilant in deleting all but the most recent save files.

The game is a major improvement over the first game. I see people comparing it to the third witcher game in a negative light  which is completely unfair. This game should be compared to games of its time and the previous witcher installment

Improvements. Voice acting is miles better than the first game and i like the character tree better. Potion creation is more robust.
The combat is definitely much better than the first game and you can play one of several ways depending on play style

The major negative for me is you need to know when you are getting into a fight before hand as you cant take potions in some of the boss fights which is a major disadvantage if thats how you decided to play. I have no idea why they changed this from the 1st witcher.  The save system could definitely be better as well

I thought the difficulty was sufficient as i played this on hard as was pretty well challenged in a good amount of fights

Unlike the first game where i thought it was worth playing just to get the whole story i feel this one is worth playing on its own merits and if you like witcher 3 you should like this one as well all the combat wont be as smooth as that game is. I do wish the game was maybe about 5-10 hours longer though

I must say this game is very impressive considering the other titles that came out that year, specifically Skyrim and others. If you’re looking for a cure to an RPG itch - give this game a go regardless of the age!  

COMBAT:
The combat system still is very clunky even after the huge overhaul from the first title.  I think it has done some things right and made it easier to play through. But if you are coming straight from the Witcher 3 Wild hunt the combat system will seem not as polished. 

GRAPHICS:
The games textures look really well for 2011. 

STORY:
The story is very fascinating as someone that knew very little outside of the Witcher 3 main story. It has many turns and twists that the player is left with choices to determine the overall outcome of a majority of the story. It overlaps well and definitely worth at least two times to see each outcome. 

NEGATIVES:

Melee combat is a timed system mashing keys can become frustrating. 
Not able to properly jump, and move around terrain. 
Autosave feature through steam can become broke and corrupt, you can bypass this by saving directly to your PC locally and avoiding this issue from the start.

After watching and enjoying the Witcher TV series on netflix and having the first two witcher games sitting on my steam library for a few years I finally gave them a go, playing both W1 and W2 for the first time this late in 2020 may show a few obstacles along the way which I had many with W1, I understood that W1 was a smaller game budget-wise and CD Projekt Red was still quite young back then, theres a lot of limitations because of age as W1 was released in 2007 but I felt that the gameplay was kinda crappy and hard to get into, I had no fun and I dropped it, I didnt want to start W2 without finishing the first game but I had no choice, so I watched a story recap to not get too lost on the story and then I started my playthrough of 2 with a sour taste due to the offputting experience that the first game was and I had a huge smile because at that moment I knew I discovered a truly good game.

Witcher 2 delivers a really good story with interesting characters, it embraces its RPG-side, theres a lot of decision making that alters the way the story progress and similar to Mass Effect you can carry your save across games, a game mechanic I absolutely adore and wish more games used, unlike the first Witcher, this one has much better gameplay with a combat system that while it has a few issues of its own is much more entertaining, packs a lot of weight and feels satisfying, theres some issues with the targeting system and a few enemy encounters being kinda unbalanced but still I enjoyed this combat a lot, the skill tree gives a lot of options for you to build your character and I enjoyed the alchemy system, the game takes place on open-environments, 3 of them across 3 chapters and a prologue, each area was memorable to me, had a nice atmosphere and the game shines on both sound design and voice acting, soundtrack was amazing, altho the gameplay can get kinda repetitive theres a lot of intrigue on its story to keep the player attention focused on the game and who doesnt like Geralt ? he is a very likable character and theres nothing better than a game with a great protagonist, supporting cast is really good too, no complains here.

Witcher 2 may not be like the best RPG out there but It was a great experience to me and memorable at least, had a lot of enjoyable moments and after hearing so many good things about W3 I cant wait to play it, I cant wait to see how they would improve what they did with W2, I didnt really like the first Witcher game at all but I knew that the franchise had potential, I knew that this franchise was famous for a reason and I knew that some sequels truly managed to not improve the formula set by its predecessor but raise the bar and achieve that hidden potential it had and I dont regret playing W2, I enjoyed this experiencce, I am recommending it and I just cant wait to start W3 and see Geralt again.",1605496616,1612454381,True,12,0,0.643243253231048584,0,True,False,False

So, I write this a few months after The Witcher series dropped on Netflix, which seems to have sparked an interest in the series as a whole--which is good, because as a whole, the games are outstanding and Witcher 2 is no exception.

The second tale of Geralt of Rivia opens with him in service to King Foltest of Temeria. Unfolding events end with Geralt being blamed for the king's murder and the game is off and running. The game unfolds in three distinct acts, set in three different areas as Geralt keeps trying to piece his memory together and discover the identity of Foltest's actual killer.

Unlike the first Witcher game, which used a licensed Aurora Engine from Bioware, Witcher 2 was developed with CD Projekt Red's in-house engine, REDEngine, and the difference couldn't be clearer. Character animations are (for the most part) clean, smooth, and natural. Ditto facial expressions. I noticed this best in a scene where several bandits suggest vandalizing a certain relic and one character's face reflects such dismay and disbelief at the idea that I was genuinely impressed. The graphics in general are quite excellent, and an enormous step up from the first game. I think they still hold up well today.

The graphics are also quite bloody. Gameplay and cutscene alike display some rather stark violence, not to mention swearing and nudity. Hookers are available, in vivid detail. Geralt doesn't seem to be the gigolo he was in the first game and the number of possible love interests is less, though the cut scenes of...ahem...""romance"" are quite a bit more intense. The (potential) liaison with a certain red-haired sorceress might be the most graphic thing I've seen in a video game that wasn't modded or outright porn from the start. As with the first Witcher, not a game for children.

The overall interface was easy enough to use and pretty simple, though the control scheme is quite a bit different from the first game. The player can select a number of skills from trees that emphasize the character's skill at combat, alchemy, or magic. There are good takeaways from every tree, though depending on the character's play style, some will help more than others. Still no jumping to be seen, so once again, Geralt is stymied by waist-high fences and shrubbery, though climbing short cliffs and ladders integrates smoothly with the character's movement.

Like most good RPGs, choices and consequences matter. Seemingly small choices made early on can have repercussions later in the game. Decisions made in the first act will even affect the flow and location of quests and events in act two and three and there are multiple ways in which this story ends, all based on player choices. Fights can be avoided through dialogue choices (or picked, if the player has a grudge against one of the NPCs) and the consequences for both are there. There is even at least one fight that can be avoided if the player played the first game, made certain decisions, and imported their save file! This branching dialogue/decision tree seems to be something CD Projekt Red is excelling at. The story is excellent and many of the cutscenes are well-executed and gripping.

The voice acting, music, and sound effects are all well done and I scarcely noticed any issues, though Geralt's stock pile of combat catch-phrases quickly grows repetitive.

The combat took some getting used to, especially after the first game. Choices between swift and strong attacks, signs, parrying and dodging, tossing bombs, drinking potions--all those tactics return. But it's significantly harder than the first game. It's not ""Dark Souls difficult"" but it is quite a bit harder than say, Skyrim. The player must master the art of the dodging roll to evade strikes and on anything other than Easy difficulty, must do it well. Damage taken in the back can drop Geralt in one swing if the foe is strong enough, so constant movement and re-positioning are critical and the player should never, ever let themselves get surrounded. Think tactically, keep Quen (your temporary force field) up, never stop moving, and plan your strikes. Despite the rather unforgiving nature of the combat, I found myself enjoying it and I looked forward to it every time I saw a significant fight coming.

You'll need two at least partial runs to get all the Steam Achievements, since some come from one side of the quest line, and some come from the other. I favored the human side over the elf one; not for solidarity, I just liked the quest flow better. (By the way, if you take the human side and let Hensalt live, you're a better man than me.)  I finished two play-throughs with all but one achievement done, which requires beating the game on the hardest difficulty--with permadeath. Knowing my questionable skill level and how many times I died on Normal, I didn't even try it.

There are a handful of other nitpicks. Sometimes, lining up on an object to loot it requires the player to shuffle around a little until the games ""radar"" picks it up and highlights it with the interaction button and mis-clicking that button can easily lead the player to exit a building or climb down a ladder when they were trying to pick something up. The dice poker minigame from the first Witcher returns and is equally as annoying--more annoying, actually.

But those are just that: nitpicks. Witcher 2 Enhanced Version is a fun RPG, with consequential choices, a deep multi-layered story, and solid gameplay. It's a few years old but no RPG fan should pass this up.

Pros
- Deep RPG experience
- Good graphics and voice acting
- Exciting combat

Cons
- Going to challenge some players

Graphics, gameplay, voice acting.. Basically everthing has been hugely improved!

Downsides in my experience: 
- Missing an 'enemy lock'  system, which would help a ton. 
- The 'persuation/intimidation' thing is pointless, you don't have control over it, it's not like Fallout that you have an atributte for it and you level it up to gain more in this aspect. In Witcher 2 it's completely random, i really don't get the point...
- The AI (human) continues terrible, freezing, almost not moving when attacking (so you can take advantage fron this and strike in the back) and so on..
- Chapter 2 is shorter than 1, and Chapter 3 is almost like a demo. Really what's the point of reaching the final chapter to finally being able to use certain abilites, awesome swords and armor, if is so short???? I felt like i improved my Geralt, spent thousands of orens just to fight Letho, at max.

Veredict: The game worths every penny, even with these downsides above, doesn't take the fact that the story, characters and gameplay all together delivers a better package than the previous title.

Starting with the bad: in the first title most of the decisions are very personal, with Geralt doing his best to stay out of politics. This isn't the case here. The plotline is interesting, but less personal, much more political. This is not bad in itself, but I felt like Geralt lost part of his identity.

This might be a spoiler to you, but [spoiler]you will start with Triss regardless of your choices in the previous game[/spoiler] which is quite disappointing. I felt like this could have been made better. Regardless, there are enough choices to make in this title that will have consequences (or at least small nods) in the third game.

In spite of that, the pros far outweight the cons. The game is story rich with more than enough action, a balance that most developers are still struggling to figure out, but CDProjekt Red has long mastered. Just like in the first title, you'll be forced to face moral dilemmas and try to choose the lesser evil - which kinda hurts.

The combat system (argueably the worst aspect of the first installment) improved into a proper action RPG. The RPG system was completely revamped and it is quite enjoyable too, with a myriad of combos supporting different play styles. Poker dice is back. Fistfighting and arm wrestling minigames are there too, but are very mindnumbing. No drinking contest anymore :(

Linux port was flawless - thanks for supporting the penguin! Achievements were natural and fun, encourage players to explore different paths and builds. The exception is ""Madman"", as permadeath is never fun to me. 

Assassin of Kings is a worthy successor of the first title, but hardly the highlight of White Wolf's trilogy. Take this as an enjoyable and necessary step towards the greatness which follows ...the Wild Hunt!

A boss fight where you have to lay traps on the ground so that when you're swatted by tentacles they do the boss fight thing and you chop them off. But not if you're standing in say, the front 60 degree cone of the creature. Because the front two tentacles are immune to these traps. There's a sorceress constantly yelling at you during this fight ""THE TRAPS GERALT, USE THE BLOODY TRAPS"". So you stand there, trying to lure these tentacles onto traps wondering why the hell it's not working while being yelled at to use the traps that you're using! 

So, after countless reloads (Those tentacles kill you after a couple of hits) I eventually googled it and found out how the game had failed to mention crucial information. But I prevailed, and after much effort, made it to the next part of the boss battle, where you're given no direction whatsoever and the boss throws rocks that 1-hit K.O. you.

Reload, play through this tedium, 1 hit KO. Reload etc etc. Reload. Reload. Google what the fuck I'm supposed to do. Oh, just run over to the side, up a broken column and then the fight ends with a cutscene. Hooray.

I even kept playing for a bit after that, but I wasn't really invested. Turned the difficulty down to easy, since the ""challenge"" seemed pretty unfun.

Cd Projekt Red managed to achieve a significant leap in quality. While I love the first the Witcher game, it was limited by Aurora Engine. The Witcher 2 seems like the first proper CD Projekt Red game from start to finish.
The story is both interesting and twisted, so, much like in its predecessor, you won't know what's really going on up until the very end of the epilogue.
Once again you have two main paths that you choose in the end of chapter I, but there are even more possible endings depending on your decision. Compared to, for example, Mass Effect games there is no clear choice between being a ""good guy"" or a ""bad guy"". Each one of your decisions may affect positively one group of people, but prove fatal to another.
One of the aspects of this game I liked the most is secondary quests. They are not only well-written, but there aren't any boring ""filler"" quests (kill X monsters or bring X stuff). Even the hunter contracts are a bit elaborate as they usually involve using traps/bombs or some additional action.
Well... Actually there is one quest that consists in collecting tons of harpy feathers, but it is really meant as a joke.
The biggest change compared to the first game is the combat system. Instead of a ""click-click-click-kill"" system the developers introduced a proper action/RPG combat that forces you to block, evade and use your signs in order to succeed. It is especially true on higher difficulty levels, which demand a high level of concentration and precise timing.
The graphics are great (the game aged really well) and the soundtrack has a lot of memorable tracks that really set the mood.
I played the Witcher 2 with original Polish voiceover  and subtitles(I did the same with the first game), because it helps me feel the atmosphere of the game world better. The voice actors of the Polish version did a great job. I'm not sure about the other versions.
My only complaint about this game is that CD Projekt Red didn't use a lot of different faces for NPCs, so there are quite a lot of them that seem like twins.
The Witcher 2 is not a long game. Especially compared to most other RPGs. I managed to finish it in about 40 hours doing all the secondary quests available on my path.
Though, I don't think it's necessarily a bad thing. Modern games tend to be too long, and, as I already mentioned earlier, The Witcher 2 has no ""filler"" content and no grind, so you enjoy the game from prologue till epilogue.
I definitely recommend this game not only to the Witcher fans, but to everyone who likes their role-playing games with great story and characters, but also with combat that provides some challenge.",1611431336,1611431336,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Witcher II Enhanced Edition is definitely an improvement. I enjoyed the combat system and often need to use the signs in order to win. Running around and the distances got better but still it's not very great. For example why can't I go trough bushes, why can't I cross a lake and a river from anywhere I want and opening doors is slow and frustrating. Games from 2001 were already better in that regard!

The story is told in a good manner, the side quests are also nicely made and told. Overall it's a enjoyable game but not a masterpiece. The game is also not really huge. In around 30 hrs one can be trough all the chapters.

The first few hours of the game may put you off. You're served a huge, badly explained lore exposition, but don't be fooled by it. Everything after the introduction is juicy goodness.

The Story, narrative and direction are, just like the first installment, absolutely amazing. Environments are stunningly made, and even the minor characters that inhabit them feel alive and real. Quests often multiple solutions (with no real 'good' or 'bad' way of doing so), and these solutions often have an impact on future events. Real decision-making is definitely a thing. The audio is quasi flawless, as the voice acting has received a major upgrade, and everything else has retained its quailty from the first game. The gameplay is unfortunately not without flaw, but many of the horrendous wrinkles of The Witcher 1 have been ironed out, and it is a joy to play the game. Combat has improved with leaps, and the mechanics involving alchemy and meditation have received various QoL upgrades, making them enjoyable to use. I had a few crashes, but those were really minor setbacks in the overall experience.

9/10 Would recommend with all my heart. I'm not sure what today's price is, but if you can get this for €15 - €25 you'll be doing yourself a favor by buying it.",1611375277,1611375277,True,1,1,0.523552894592285156,0,True,False,False

Besides simple swords, you now have knives you can fling during combat and all sorts of bombs - not to mention the ability to place traps so you can cleverly lure baddies towards you. All this combined makes it a real joy to engage opponents.  One little flaw compared to the first Witcher, is that you can no longer drink potions during combat which does mean that you'll often end up in a combat situation where you wish you had used a potion before-hand but since you can't predict how hard a battle will be (and a seasoned gamer will conserve potions as much as possible) it does make it feel a tad pointless. 
There seems to be a lot of running back and forth between places as the game has no quick travel, but this works well as you can herb and fight along the way. The alchemy mechanic is fantastic; you can make potions and bombs if you have the correct ingredients which are mostly collected from herbs around the game world. Crafting weapons, armour and traps is left the the smiths around the games worlds town and cities. As for drinking the potions, they each have a unique Toxicity level and if you exceed this limit there are certain side effects.
The story and setting is very fleshed out as well. The game feels very grim and more real than other RPGs in general - it's not afraid to tackle subjects such as racism, sex, politics and putting you in the middle of it all. The occasional nudity only confirms that this game doesn't hold back compared to other games. The characters have a lot of spirit as well and avoid the typical stereotypes that usually inhabit RPGs. Most characters you meet have a certain edge, a hidden agenda and aren't at all superficial.

Being an ARPG now instead of CRPG is not exactly a bad thing. In fact I enjoyed it as much as the Witcher 1 both in gameplay and story. In The Witcher 2 you now have a stamina bar which is very different from the first game, the gameplay now becomes more action packed and makes the encounters a bit more challenging. However, The Witcher 2 didn't exactly improve some aspects from the previous game, especially for me who incredibly enjoyed the Fistfight and Dice Poker. In this game those, at least for me, became lamer. The Fistfights are now QTEs instead of actually fighting your opponent and as for the Dice Poker, the NPC's odds are better than yours. From an article I saw online ""the system that calculates the dice values is modified to favour the NPC, with the NPC having a greater probability of getting a better hand than the player"", the NPC is basically cheating which makes Dice Poker frustrating to play in this game combined with it's confusing UI.

Besides that, everything is great I just really didn't like that the minigames became lamer.

Your general goal is to gather all enemy in front of thoran. This could be accomplished by Eironn, Kelthus, Nara. These three heroes will pull enemy hero from there back line to your front line.

Thoran's main damage comes from his ult after he unlock his sig at mythic. It's good if you can get him to +30 sig, but he's totally usable as long as his sig is unlocked. (I have'nt get him to 30 sig yet too, would greatly appreciate if someone could lend me thoran 30 sig for hard stages like kt305)

I'm currently in chapter 24 with an ascended Thoran, level 240, sig 20.

Pros:

-High damage, burst and AOE.

-CC/debuffs at revive-Curse an enemy upon entering battle

-Strong SI - his SI is extremely strong upon unlocked, and is what make him a valuable carry.

-Can Frontline/DPS - if all of a sudden you decided to not use Thoran as your main DPS, he could also work well as a good frontline tank.

-Easy obtainable from lab points

Cons:

-Takes some thinking to play

-Requires some RNG for him to be able to deal massive damage to enemy

Best team comp :

Eironn, Kelthus, Lorsan, Lyca/Rowan

I use this comp at average level 220 to push through half of chapter 24

Possibly sub-ins

Brutus, Ezizh, Athalia, Nara, Shemira.

How to beat :

Enemy team are full ranged attackers

pulls KT 299

courting envy CH24-32

Enemy team are full Physical attackers/ Thane invulnerable attackers

get rid of your Weapon and Armor AFK 24-25

get rid of your useless other heroes KT 300 ( If you check nothing else out, please check this one, beat this with only 3 champ)

Enemy team has Brutus

Nara KT 303

Solo Brutus CH24-11

Lorsan CH24-17

If you're still a believer of Shemira over everything, try check out my videos on Thoran CH 24 first.

Dialogue, paraphrased from memory, act 2.

In act 2 the game is pretty good, act 1 is so-so. Act 3, however, is annoying (maze where you have to click to get through a door every 5 seconds).

So Witcher 3 is definitely the better game. This one has not aged well, some of the problems: 
- Annoying quick time events, 
- clunky combat handling (you will often get stuck on invisible barriers and die), 
- a pretty unstable game in general (got several crashes or once I could not open the menu any more and had to kill the game and restart..) 
- you cannot even drop down a small step - you have to click to do it,
- if you want to pick up loot after a fight, you have to wait 5 seconds, because the game needs to get out of ""combat mode"" to switch the left mouse button from hitting to picking up.

The only positives are the characters with their very good voice acting, and to some degree the story-telling.",1610495774,1610542005,False,9,2,0.523069441318511963,0,True,False,False

If you want to play for the story, which i am assuming most of the ""very positive reviews"" on Steam were based on then do so on easy mode. Its a great story, great characters, and incredible improvement from the first game.
But even moving up to normal mode, makes this game incredibly hard. I managed to reach the end of chapter 1 on Normal, and had to change to easy. The difference was as follows:
Enemy Damage dealt on Normal: 41, included bleed effect for 3-4 seconds which was another 10 health per second. Thats basically half of your health if you are hit once, which is pretty unforgiving due to the ""clonky controls"" (which i still love).
Enemy Damage dealt on Easy: 7, rarely inflicted ""bleeding"" and i could string an attack together that didnt consist of three blows before a half arsed role away before being poked in the rear by his sword.

Witcher 2 is a game where Lord of the Rings meets Game of Thrones, except it takes [spoiler]100 hits to kill the dragon, and not just 3 arrows.[/spoiler] It has elves, it has dwarfs, it has politics, betrayal and of course sex scenes and a lot of boobs. Humans are the most dominant race, dwarfs and elves are living among them, however they don't really have same rights. So that's why there is Scoia'tael, organization of nonhumans trying to cause civil war, or stuff like that, and fight for their rights. It's basically USA in 18th and 19th century. Now let's get to basics. 

First of all, story. Story is good. You play as witcher, Geralt of Rivia. He has lost his memory and he is trying to recover it. You work as bodyguard for the king Foltest of Temeria. Game starts with civil war, and before that there is sex scene, cause there are 2 things that Geralt knows to do. He does killing and he does women. In Witcher universe, there are 5 important kingdoms, 4 at north and 1 at south, which is bigger than all these 4 together. There are few important choices, but I would say that only two choices are really important, because depending on those choices you will get 2 completelly different games. Sometimes you have only few seconds to choose, sometimes more. Story is good, but I can't say that I've found many other interesting characters. Main villain is pretty cool, Geralt is cool, but not many others.

Now gameplay. Gameplay is okay, it's not bad, but it's not that good either. Geralt has 2 swords, steel sword for men, and silver sword for beats. He can cast 5 signs. Aard - stun, Yrden - trap, Igni - fire, Quen - shield(the most powerful one), Axii - control opponent and Heliotrop which you must develope. I played this game on hard, it wasn't really hard game, but without Quen it would be way harder. I didn't feel like not using Quen since it's in game, but that shield is really OP, so I started feeling like with Quen, Witcher 2 is easy, especially after leveling up a bit. You can activate Quen as soon as you have enough vigor(autogenerate or with potion) and when activated you can take one hit without taking damage, so basically every 10 or so seconds you can activate Quen. It's extremly useful. Except Quen, Aard and Igni are useful too, and Yrden sometimes(Igni is crap in Witcher 3). Before big battles, or whenever you want, you must prepare for battle, by making potions and using them and those potions you make from herbs that you find around, and they increase your attack damage, renegerate vitality etc. When killing monsters you will get your loot, that you can use to craft stuff, or just sell. During whole game, I had a lot of problems with inventory, cause I would fill it up quickly. 

Bosses. First boss was interesting, but the second boss fight was terribly hard for no reason, it was too early in the game and the hardest boss fight in the game, it requires a lot of attacking and dodging in the small place. It's pretty boring fight that gives you little space to make a mistake, I don't mind challenge, but this wasn't fun challenge. Same goes for boss before last, and that one can one shot you, and you have to hit boss like 50+ times, before you reach second phase. Other boss fights are okay. I wouldn't say that Witcher 2 has good boss fights, but they aren't terrible either.

Graphics are good even today. I've heard that Ubersampling kills FPS so it's suggested to turn it off). Music during intro cutscene is indredible, and later on soundtracks are nice. Problem is, it's kinda buggy game. I encountered singleplayer lag, which I've never seen before in my life, where I hit some enemy once and then 2 seconds later it got hit once more and then once more without me doing anything. Random stuff like that happens sometimes. Also interrogation at the beginning really feels like it's off sync. 

Witcher 2 is a linear game, which is probably problem for a lot of people, but not for me. I've always liked games that are more focused on story anyway. When you reach some city or village during main quest, you have one big area that you can wander around, where you can loot stuff, do side quests, buy stuff,  etc. However when you reach part of main story where you must leave area, all side quests will no longer be available and you can't travel back. There is no fast travel here. Chapter 1 is really interesting and pretty good, chapter 2 is the longest one, but I would say less interesting and chapter 3 is just closure. Took me 26 hours to finish the game, while barely playing side stuff.

[h1]Verdict:[/h1] Pretty good story, okay gameplay, good graphics even for today's standards, meh boss fights, and slightly buggy game. Story is focused on one thing, unlike in Witcher 3, and I've found that pretty good. It's pretty good game overall.

By the end of the almost 70 hours I spent with it, I was sizing up a trio of bandits with a smirk on my real-life face, knowing even together they were no match for my steel and the extensive training I’d received under some of the toughest knights in this beautifully recreated medieval land. This wasn’t merely a change in stats and equipment. Without a single spell or magic sword, Kingdom Come gave me the abundantly satisfying feeling of transforming from doe-eyed scrub to stone-cold killer.
Warhorse’s tale of tribulation and betrayal shines brightest in the little ways it sells the fantasy of living in the Late Middle Ages. Not only are there survival mechanics that track hunger and fatigue, but every aspect of your character’s appearance has an impact on how NPCs perceive you. The biggest example is how clothes will accumulate wear and trail dust as you traipse through the wilderness, leaving nobles less than impressed with your scruffiness.

NPCs' reactions to your appearance extend beyond BO simulation.

This required me to frequently take baths, visit the laundry, and have my outerwear mended by a tailor to make a good impression. Keeping relatively clean isn’t a chore because bathhouses are easy to find, and you can always dunk your head in the nearest trough of water in a pinch. This extends beyond BO simulation: if, for example, you’re trying to be sneaky, wearing clothes that don’t make noise when you move and are dark in color to blend in with the shadows decreases your chances of being detected. Likewise, walking into an inn covered in blood with a sword drawn is a good way to intimidate people into seeing things your way.

All of this takes place in a large chunk of wooded, medieval Bohemia that shows significant attention to detail and is filled with little historical touches that help it feel like a real place. Towns, farms, and logging camps are all laid out with a strong internal logic and built on a scale that makes sense for a real place, as opposed to the standard RPG city in a game like Skyrim that’s designed to feel large, but really isn’t. And there are no loading screens between areas anywhere unless you’re using fast travel, which I always appreciate quite a bit in open-world games.

The fantasy breaks down a bit too frequently under the weight of bugs, though. Some are of the goofy, largely unobtrusive sort you’d expect from an open-world game of this size, like a shopkeeper’s head loading in after the rest of their body. But others are less of a laughing matter because they got in the way of gameplay in significant ways. There seems to be a tendency for staircases to randomly decide, “You shall not pass!” and moving between areas of different elevation in general too often results in getting hung up on invisible walls or even stuck entirety.

Worse, a handful of quests in the second and third acts had either broken triggers or missing quest markers, sometimes requiring me to backtrack to a save I made an hour or more ago and choose a different path through a mission to avoid the roadblock. That’s not unusual for a big RPG, but it’s exacerbated by the fact that just about the only ways to save in Kingdom Come are drinking a rare, expensive type of alcohol or sleeping at an inn or brothel. Autosaves are unforgivingly infrequent. Crashes were rare, but when they did happen the autosave system sometimes set me back just as far.

The combat behind it all feels kinetic, precise, and polished.

To Kingdom Come’s credit, the actors, scenery, and textures do look fantastic on the highest detail level – but unless you have an extremely beefy system, you probably won’t be able to enjoy it that way. The PC version (which I’ve played on exclusively so far) isn’t particularly well optimized. To maintain a stable framerate in all situations, I had to turn down the graphics settings to the point where low level-of-detail models would remain in the scene for certain people and objects for a couple seconds even when I got up close, which was distracting. My PC (a Core i7-4770K with a GTX 1070) can run The Witcher 3 smoothly with everything cranked up, which made this especially surprising.

Luckily, the combat behind it all feels kinetic, precise, and polished. There is a significant learning curve, but I’ve found it to be a lot of fun the more I got the hang of it. Warhorse’s designers seem to have struck the right balance between realism and practicality. Sword fights have a nice tempo and reward technical skill, quick thinking, and most of all patience. Over time, I got the same feeling I experience when I’m starting to master a new shooter or real-time strategy game. My character became a force to be reckoned with because I mastered the systems, not necessarily because my strength stat kept increasing.

The realism extends to the sorts of trade-offs you have to make for certain gear, which added some interesting strategy elements. Plate armor (in addition to making you stick out like a bear in a seafood restaurant as mentioned above) is very expensive to maintain and counts against your encumbrance, so a scrawny character can't even safely wear a full set. Full-face helmets protect better against often deadly headshots, but restrict your field of view and make it more difficult to keep track of multiple enemies. My gear choices were often as much based on what made logical sense for the situation as what offered the best stats, which was another welcome departure from the standard RPG playbook.

Mounted combat feels like an afterthought – ironic, considering the studio’s name.

A few parts of the combat system don’t work all that well, though. I never got any good at the fiddly archery system, but thankfully, I was never forced to. Mounted combat also feels like an afterthought, in that it’s functional but clearly not something Warhorse spent much time refining (ironic, considering the studio’s name).

The story is gritty, engrossing, and complex, though it tends to fall back on some old-fashioned ideas of medieval historiography in a couple of places. Notably, the Cumans, a nomadic Turkic people from the Western steppe, are treated as token foreigners at times and faceless, Stormtrooper-esque bad guy mooks at others. Characters go well out of their way to refer to them constantly as “barbaric” or “savage” – which is certainly how most of the native Bohemians would have seen them. But without ever being given any indication that it’s not that simple (literally every Cuman I met was an enemy who couldn't be reasoned with), it comes across as trying to paint the shades of complexity that made up relations between steppe and settled societies in this era as purely black and white.

By and large, Kingdom Come does the medieval era right.

Verdict
There’s a shining suit of mail underneath Kingdom Come: Deliverance’s authentically medieval grime. Strong characters and storytelling, one of my favorite first-person melee combat systems ever, and special attention given to building moment-to-moment immersion come together as a mighty alloy that ranks among the most unique, memorable RPGs I’ve played in years. While a lack of technical polish occasionally caused me a good deal of frustration having to replay areas due to a bug or poorly-communicated quest objective, it’s the kind of adventure I didn’t hate replaying",1609853189,1609853219,True,3,1,0.189987257122993469,0,True,False,False

The storytelling, writing and characters are as good as ever, and a worthy sequel to the first game. 

Negatives: combat is still rather awkward, and I'm not sure about the quick-time cut scenes. The Tutorial is laboured and introduces mechanics not used at the start of the game. Conversely some things are not well explained, like some of the mini-games like arm-wrestling. Finally, some quests deposit you a ways outside of town, requiring minutes of backtracking, although sometimes you're given the option to fast travel back into town.

This was my first Witcher game. I liked it a lot for the plot, many optional quests (sometimes affecting the main ones), a couple of future-impacting choices during the whole game. I rather liked how the characters were drawn (especially their beards and mustaches, though, not their hair, unfortunately). The game has a pretty soundtrack, but the main theme starts annoying towards the end. And I was pleasantly surprised about the fight mechanics quality (remark: it was pretty cool when playing with a mouse and a keyboard. I didn't like playing with a game controller, though I'm not sure this is a game issue, probably it was uncomfortable for me just because it was an unusual experience for me)
[h1]Technical issues[/h1]
Unfortunately, there were some technical issues. Here are the most important of them to me:
- [b]Impossible[/b] to play [b]on Linux[/b]. Though developers claim that the game should run on Linux well, it does not. When playing on Windows I get 30 to 60 FPS in the game on Ultra presets. When playing on latest up-to-date Linux Mint 20 (based on Ubuntu 20.04) with the latest GPU drivers (nvidia-driver-450), I can only get about 15-20 fps on all the graphics quality presets.
- After playing the game for a while and creating some saves, I started having the saves list being loaded slowly. It didn't really affect the game experience, but it was a bit unpleasant to wait each time I wanted to load a specific save
- More time later the game started crashing! Fortunately, this was happening rather rarely, but there were some times when it crashed right before I was going to save, so it was upsetting me a bit. I'm certainly sure that this problem relates to saves too: the game won't crash unless I load saves, and it will crash very soon if I reload the game many times in a row (for example, when fighting with a boss). But this will also happen if I remove a couple of sets in a row, so I think the problem is in the saves list loading (probably something like a memory leak)
[hr][/hr]

The combat is incredibly dated: floaty, janky, unresponsive and unsatisfying, its difficulty spikes at random parts. The story is hard to follow and not very good: most characters are not built upon enough at all. I didn't enjoy any of the side missions: I did all of them in chapters 1 and 2, but just rushed to the end in the third chapter after so many disappointments.  

It's a shame. The Witcher 2 is a very atmospheric game. The art style is fantastic, the mood is gripping, and the graphics are top notch for 2011. Even the music is incredible. But the experience hinders on the frustrating gameplay systems, awful combat, boring and ambiguous quests, sluggish world traversal, and tedious backtracking. 

I played this with a lot of prior knowledge of the Witcher series world and to get ready to play The Witcher 3. After 10 hours of the third installment, it's already immediately spectacular, and what this game should've been. For comparison, I really enjoyed Mass Effect 1, so it's not like I detest older RPGs. Still, if you can look past Witcher 2's flaws there's definitely value to be found here. It's a very ambitious game, but the developers lacked the time, management and resources to make it work. Fortunately those were provided for the next game in the series.

Following the events of the previous title, players once more step into the shoes of that infamous witcher, Geralt of Rivia. Framed for the murder of King Foltest, he must go on the run to clear his name and bring the murderer responsible, another witcher by the name of Letho to justice. At first blush, it's honestly a pretty hefty, serious affair. Players are immediately submerged into a world of medieval realpolitik and clashing ideologies. Between the nonhuman factions vying for equal treatment, the political machinations of those aiming for power, and the not-insubstantial lore of the game, it's easy to get overwhelmed by the ups and downs of the game's plot. Thankfully, though, the core of the experience is simple: you are a witcher, and you slay monsters. At the end of the day, everything else is secondary. In fact, treating Geralt as a tradesman who's gotten involved in matters way over his head actually makes the game's plot vastly more engaging.

The game is divided up into chapters, each of which acts as a hub zone from which players can venture out to partake in various quests and monster-slaying contracts. And it's here that the cracks begin to show because [i]The Witcher 2[/i] absolutely [i]loves[/i] withholding critical information. One early quest requires Geralt to track down a bookshop to research a type of monster; however, the game refuses to give any kind of direction as to the shop's location, nor the eventual monsters' nest. And this is endemic to the whole game's design - from spells to lore to basic combat mechanics, [i]The Witcher 2[/i] routinely expects the player to intuit the correct path forward. (This apparently was even worse in older editions of the game, which lacked any kind of tutorial.)

This might be forgivable if the game was fun to play, but alas, [i]The Witcher 2[/i] has maybe the single worst combat system in an action RPG I've ever seen. Geralt's swings feel weightless as he manages both his casting resources and his health; though the game offers potion-making and mechanical buffs to the player, they are completely barred off during combat, and in characteristic style for [i]The Witcher 2[/i], the game adores ambushing unaware players. Furthermore, the enormous hitboxes and lack of any i-frames when Geralt dodges make the nitty-gritty of combat feel arbitrary. More often than not, it felt like I cheesed my way through encounters rather than reaching victory through careful observation and precision timing.

Even the writing begins to wear thin after a while. Though the game wields a certain verisimilitude to its dialogue and politics, the artificiality of the experience often exposes itself in awkward times. From hamfisted references to other media (The ""Oh My God! You Killed the Kayran! You Bastards!"" achievement and the early Assassin's Creed reference in the prologue are both particularly egregious examples.) to the sarcastic dryness of the dialogue to the decidedly painful sex scenes, it feels like [i]The Witcher 2[/i] is trying to look more mature than it is. However, my frustration is really cemented in the handful of truly bad writing choices the game makes, choices which undermine the game's larger themes. For example, should you take Iorveth's path-line in Chapter 2 of the game, you'll find yourself on a quest to recover noble's blood because the blood of a royal is allegedly stronger than the common folk. It's an openly dumb plot-point in a game that is otherwise pretty anti-royalist in its leanings.

There are [i]some[/i] things in the [i]The Witcher 2[/i] that are worthwhile. The visuals, despite being close to a decade old, still look excellent, due in large part to superb art direction. The music is great, and when the writing and the choices offered to the player work in unison, the results are very entertaining. (The fact that the game has [i]two[/i] separate second chapters that players will experience based on choices that they make is frankly astounding.) But the sad bottom line is that [i]The Witcher 2[/i] just isn't very much fun to play. It makes some bold, demanding requests of the player, and the sheer tolerance players need to have for mechanical malarkey is high to get the most out of the experience. CRPG fans with a deep love for punishing and arcane titles will no doubt find something here worth diving into; however, for more casual CRPG fans or for those looking for an experience that synthesizes the mechanics of play with narrative elegantly, look elsewhere.",1609122664,1609132795,False,58,4,0.585270822048187256,0,True,False,False

+Combat is way more immersive with unique and actually challenging foes

2) navigation sucks you have work very hard to find out hidden stuff as the medalion is'nt very effective in bright areas you have lower your brightness or wait till midnight to find probable roads,traps and/or treasures

4)and also glitches badly sometimes like shitty hitboxes, long and uninterruptable animations during battle like drawing the sword or parrying or the staggered or knock back animation really disrupts the flow of the combat

The first thing I will say is this: I urge any players considering playing this game to have played Witcher 1 or at least watched or read a thorough synopsis. While the Witcher 3 heavily distanced itself from its predecessors, The Witcher 2 basked in its status as a sequel. After completing the Witcher 3, I can confidently say that this game im key in understanding the world of the third game. The Witcher 2 is responsible for setting up the political climate of the Witcher 3. Aside from its relationship from the third game, The Witcher 2 is probably the most unique, but mixed game in the trilogy. Here are some pros and cons:

Pros:
-The Witcher 2 possesses a strong amount of replayability thanks to the split path system. 
-The signs in The Witcher 2 are far more balanced than Witcher 1 or even 3 for that matter
-Witcher 2 Geralt has the most loyal appearance to the books in comparison to horseface-Geralt of Witcher 1 or Hot-Geralt from Witcher 3
-The Witcher 2's story kept me on my feet. Besides the droning woods of Flotsam, I was generally kept busy and anticipating new developments in the game. Dull moments were few and far between.
-While the swordplay is still imperfect thanks to jank like inaccurate syncing of choreography and damage-boxes, it is a much needed improvement over The Witcher 1

Cons:
-There are a nearly endless supply of continuity errors that come from the radically different events in the Roche vs Iorveth paths
-The game possesses a sort of burnt quality in its presentation. There is almost a strange saturation of orange wherever you go
-Some of the actions that Geralt can do such as holding Henselt at the end of a sword in the Iorveth path don't keep up to his character at all
-The game honestly places you at the divergence of paths WAY too early (end of chapter 1). The literal few interactions that you have with Vernon Roche and Iorveth before this point make deciding difficult, not because they are so unbelievably compelling, but mostly because you don't know a thing about them. 
-Geralt's amnesia is one of the most frustrating plot devices I've seen. The fact that he suddenly recovers entirely from one conversation with Letho at the very end is unconvincing at best and downright lazy at worst. It feels like CDPR barely remembered that he had amnesia in the first game but realized that they couldn't flat out retcon it so instead they just say ""he's cured"" to tie loose ends.
-The UI is clearly console-oriented, leaving an unoptimized and time-wasting experience for PC gamers
-The cryptic secret perks don't work to the game's benefit. Most of them feel unearned and a well-versed player like myself didnt even know of their existence until I beat the game.

In conclusion, The Witcher 2 was an extremely ambitious project that brought CDPR into the mainstream. Ultimately, I would say the game bit off more than it could chew. Still, this game is essential for any gamer who wants a complete experience in the Witcher 3. Although this game hasn't stood against the test of time very well, it still holds its own place as the game that shifted the environment of the Witcher. It acted as a transition from the highly-fantasized, even somewhat cartoonish world of the Witcher 1 into the gritty, morally complicated world of the Witcher 3. I believe that the Witcher 2 truly was an improvement from the first game in most aspects. For this reason I find it to be a good sequel.

While it garnered sales and praise at its release, it hasn't been consistently mentioned like other games from that year (Uncharted 2: Among Thieves, Batman: Arkham City, Battlefield 3), which is unfortunate, because the game is really good. This game is impressive even still to this day, with some caveats, obviously. But something the game succeeds immensely with is the immersion into the world. It feels lived in and like it could exist in a real place (ignoring the magical factors). The huge trees surrounding Flotsam, the warm beaches and mountains of Aedirn, and the ravished ruins of Loc Muinne creates an inviting motion to the surroundings. The music also helps invest the player in the world, which is bombastic during battle, and hauntingly somber during conversations and slower moments. Even though the character presentation is at best decent, the environments are truly epic, which also translates to the story. The intriguing narrative is focused and ambitious, yet clever and self aware. Playing as Geralt of Rivia hunting down the assassin of King Foltest, Letho, is riveting from start to finish. The story is so good much thanks to the characters. Geralt of Rivia is an all out bad ass, while Vernon Roche is a cunning operator. Dandelion brings in comedic effect with his funny remarks and King Henselt brings in darkness with his tragic family drama. Even the side-quests have some level of depth, not always being as straight forward as you might initially think. The game is based around you the choices make, which unlike most games actually have huge impacts on the narrative. You might never see certain characters or view people differently depending on the actions of Geralt, and it helps make your actions have more weight to them. Even though the ending might occur in the same place, the journey there and the character's positions might differ hugely. The writing is immaculate and impressive, captivating the player and not making the narrative too hard to follow. The only confusing part might be character's names if you haven't played the first game, but if you read the extensive journal, you'll be quickly caught up, and stuck in the game's politics. The only big issue I have with the story is the final boss, which fizzels out disappointingly, however you choose to play. It neither feels rewarding, nor impressive, but that's solely because of the build-up to that moment (during the epilogue). But that's a small nit pick, because afterwards it feels satisfying, and worth the time to get there, it's more about the build-up to the fight. When it comes to gameplay, it's a bit of a mixed bag. All the content is existent, from responsive combat, to dialogue choices, to preparation before battles (from potions and oils), it ties in with the character of the Witcher really well. The problem arises when it comes to execution. Character's might bug to actions, your character get's stuck in the environment sometimes, and brewing portions and oils is confusing at times, much cause from the questionable user interface. Even though the game world isn't massive, it could've helped with fast travel when traversing back to main areas, or level design could've been improved to make it go faster. I don't hate the gameplay, I quite like it actually, it's just rough around the edges and there's room for improvement. The game truly shines in it's writing and world-building, which raises it above some of it's rivals in the genre. The game just sucks you in, and keeps you engaged all the time. While the game lacks in polished gameplay, it makes up for in interesting character's and the interactions between them.

I played it on blind run on Dark difficulty without any guide because the gameplay looked promising for a tactical fighting style I wanted to explore by myself but got hugely disappointed. This game is really frustrating to play at high difficulties, and I say it as a Dark Souls veteran.

Positive:
+ Graphics have aged ok and are still somewhat enjoyable, surely better than the first witcher game.
+ Lore follows the style of Andrzej Sapkowski, author of the books. Even how events unfold, how characters play, it's all pretty much accurate with what the books have to offer. No big changes, even the plot made by CD Project Red to expand the story doesn't drift away from the initial intent in my opinion.
+ Good RPG elements to explore different paths and interactions.
+ Aesthetic monster variety.

Negative:
- I'll start from the main problem with this game: the combat system. Developers' intention was to make a realistic fighting game with multiple options and strategy to handle a variety of enemies in different situations. The problem is they failed horribly. There are some magical abilities that use the statistics ""VIGOR"" which, for some reason, is shared with the ability to PARRY enemy attacks. It means that, especially in the first half of the game, you are forced to choose between vigor to abuse of your spells or try to parry. Guess which one has less risks? 

The main tactic you want to use is to cast QUEN (a shield that protects from damage) then proceed to hit and roll away. Always. This is because there is no way to know if your opponent is going to deflect your sword hit, leaving you extremely vulnerable. This feature gets even more frustrating when an army of enemies surrounds you, you just end up being gangbanged without any chance of retalation JUST BECAUSE YOU ATTEMPTED A BASIC BLOW. If it's not abusing of QUEN, you just roll around spamming Aard trying to get a lucky stun on enemy to execute a deathblow. Just be sure to roll again after that because your position changes after it without being able to control it.

Furthermore there are several animations for your attacks but you have no control over which one Geralt is going to perform. Some attacks leap and are slower, others more straightforward, but you are vulnerable while attacking and therefore you just get punished by enemies even if you are choosing the right frame to attack. But let's assume you want to parry: I thought it would have had a similar mechanic to the most recent batman, making you somewhat invulnerable when performing the parry. But no, you can do it perfectly on an enemy but then the others might just continue attacking, punishing you for performing the right parry. Absolutely counterintuitive for the sake of a realism which doesn't hold anyway in other situations. 

The game offers you the option to craft traps and bombs to help you in these situations. The problem is that they don't become an aid, they become your main strategy to just spam bombs to keep hordes of enemies busy instead of being a supplement to your sword style. Huge downgrade from The first witcher which was a hack and slash which at least could be fun. 

Game of hit and run and roll as the best strategy, instead of a dancing fighter abusing of parries and different combos on the battlefield. I suspect the developers didn't even test it themselves because I can't believe they purposefully made it this bad.

- Bugs in the hitboxes, invisible walls, unclear interactions. Sometimes spells won't hit because enemies are on a hill or you'll get stuck in the terrain trying to roll. Especially in one optional boss fight in Chapter III. These make the combat system even more frustrating.

- Inventory is extremely confusing, the diagram system unclear cause it goes by alphabetical order and not categories. Either you remember what you wanted to craft or you gotta go through the list of recipes to find it. Let's not mention how annoying it is to deposit crafting materials at the inn and going to a blacksmith just to discover you missed 1 ingredient in the box, why not make the blacksmith show you all your ingredients even if you don't have them in your inventory? It's not like the blacksmiths can be found outside cities so there would be no hidden advantage in that.

- General annoying bugs with hitboxes and interactions but nothing gamebreaking.

Buy it if you really love the series but do not bother with the high difficulties unless you are a completionist.",1589645493,1608313402,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Game's a 3/10 for me. 

The worst of the trilogy. 

This game has the smallest world, a huge dwarven mine level that's so dark you can't see sh* t even with the potion, and has a story that's accurately represented by this statement: ""everyone betrays everyone all the time, oh and racism is bad!"".

It ruined the fist fights from Witcher 1 by making them QTEs, playing dice poker is almost impossible as it's very likely your dice will fall off the table never to be seen again.

It also has one of the worst boss fights I've ever seen/played.

Story wise Geralt becomes extremely inconsistent morally. One second he's all about preventing people dying for no reason, the next he's making jokes while literally pouring burning tar on people. This inconsistency also happens in the witcher 3.

Only those who are going through the whole trilogy should ever buy this and only so they can have the whole story.

 If a strong central plot, and a wealth of morally diverse choices are something that interests you at all, then it's a must play.

Now to be 100% fair, I can't give the developers all the credit there, as the universe wouldn't exist without the highly talented author of the book series they're adapting. That being said, it is no less an accomplishment from CD Project Red.

The only downside I can name is it's fairly linear compared to some other genre brethren (the sequel for instance).

I originally planned to play/replay all three Witcher games before Cyberpunks release but the first Witcher game was so bad I decided to slam my genitals repeatedly in a door in hope of causing enough trauma that i might forget the Witcher exists. I completely over estimated the size of my genitals and mainly hurt one of my toes so I had to play through the Witcher 2. 

My review is that it is OK. I liked the music. I was hoping that it would finally make the Witcher 3's storyline make more sense and basically I now know that that the entire witcher story has been written by a child that has discovered energy drinks and once hid behind the couch whilst it parents watched the first lord of the Rings, a bit of one of the Harry Potter films and then a softcore porno.

It's Ok, at the time it was released it was probably incredible, my main reason for leaving a positive review is that it's possibly better than the mess CyberPunk has been released in. Onto Witcher 3...

Difficulties are not well tuned as normal is very hard (in an unfair way) and easy is too easy. And I don't even want to say anything about the other 3 difficulty options higher than normal. Combat can be boring as you often have to resort to certain abuse to win eg. exploiting the stupid AI. Enemies are hard to kill so it can be very tedious. 

Story is very awesome with 2 major branches that are very very different from each other. Excellent cutscenes, voice acting, It has nice flow to the story that makes you want to play more except the first chapter in Flotsam where it felt too slow. Some sidequests are good (although not on the level of Witcher 3) and some are typical fetch/destroy certain number of enemies quest which are a chore to do. Dungeons are nothing really special and some can be tedious. 

Settings - Nice atmosphere, very colourful. The world is nice and small but has some good memorable locations. It is not open world but the small maps with every corner being different works really well. Music is average and forgettable.

After becoming more and more aware of crunch practises within the company along with increasingly hostile attitudes towards the LGBTQ community, I feel I must use what little power of expression I have to speak out.

I have been a long standing fan of the Witcher series and for all my fond memories of wonderful moments from these games I want to say thank you devs :). 

But I am also a Trans Woman and i have seen the harm that trans-phobia causes first hand. The fear, the abuse, the uncertainty. Innocent people expressing themselves for who they truly are only to be beaten down mentally or worse out right murdered simply for existing. 

The attitude at CD Projekt Red is ugly. In promotions for Cyberpunk 2077 they used imagery of an overly sexual trans woman, to garner attention whilst failing to show any trans characters with actual depth (wish they treated us trans people as people and not as objects of sexual fascination) . 

Then in their customisation menu your gender is tied to your voice (what a load of rubbish). It also pushes a gender binary model, not merely ignorantly, but clearly deliberately. This is clear as i understand it because they allow characters to choose their genitals ( even allowing you to have none if you so wish) and yet still demand that someone must conform to being a he or she. This stinks of trans-phobia. Mocking those trans people who are questioning their identity or identify as non-binary, gender fluid and non conforming. Its also made worse by the fact this all happened following promises of allowing gender diversity with character customisation.

I am used to not being represented in any way in any game. Unfortunately being mocked for simply existing is something many trans people have to put up with. But this is a direct attack against the trans community, wrapped up in a flashy game. It goes out of its way to define gender on its own terms, setting up damaging barriers that can easily be used by hate filled groups or individuals to persecute trans people who many people like to ignore are very real human beings! 

PEOPLE.... PEOPLE JUST LIKE YOU! 

REAL PEOPLE!

REAL LIVES!

Cyberpunk 2077 may be a game. CD Projekt may just make games. But trans-phobia is not a game! Its very real and people lose their lives over it! No game is worth that.

Firstly this game seemed to be around the time things tried to be cinematic, endless motion blur, lettbox format options so you can see about 1/15th of the screen so the bluured images look really nice and cinematic. So after turning all of that down/off the game doesn't look awful, but certain aspects remained.
The camera tries to pick good looking angles alot more than useful ones; or sometimes as part of starting a scene the game will pan the camera in before giving you control, or it follows you through a dooway as you politely walk through it no matter the situation.
I disliked the camera because alot of times i'd get attacked before i had really regained my controls.

Combat and basic mode are somewhat detached meaning alot of basic controls are locked depending on which mode you're in, this means if you wanna grab something and go, thats not an option if you're in combat, and you'll need to finish the encounter before its done.

Actual combat feels janky because its trying to look nice and therefore has its own psuedo lock-on going on where gerolt which just pick people he's attacking, and his positioning somewhat will determine who it is. It feels weird and sticky and the more clustered a scenario the more difficult it is to fix, now the game has a true-lock on but engaging/disengaging is also weird and costs you more time than its worth if you need to quickly change targets.

The leveling system feels disappointing mostly because you don't have enough points to really go outside of a single tree. And this is a shame because the swordsmanship tree is the best general-use tree, with alchemy and signs being very side-game because no matter how much you use them you'll always have to come back to swordplay, outside of 1-2 segements the game doesn't even really present enough scenarios to make signs worth it beyond breaking someone's guard; and i don't count the jedi-mind-trick sign because i've yet to determine if anything actually governs its success rate, considering i've never actually seen a indimidation or mind control fail in an conversation, maybe i'm just lucky.

The focus meter piece was boring, as you really could only use it on trash or mid-boss level enemies. Actual bosses it would actively disable itself, which was a shame because certain trees let you get buffs for using it; and boss fights generally swapped between rockem-sockem-robots and darksouls dodge-fests(with no real room to actually dodge most of the time), as alot of the larger bosses would ignore most signs and you were just expected to make a few hits, dodge away, and repeat; none of the parry/riposte/ect.. mechanics ever come up in boss fights, and i never saw a good reason to use them in normal combat because an aard would break anyone's defense and let me just strong attack them down.

The story was generally unpleasent, mostly because the route the game considers the ""good"" end requires generally dumb decisions on you part, and just about every decision that should come back and bite you doesn't, and all the ones that are sound/logical have some random contrivence come out to screw it up. the best i can describe it is a forced replayability scenario; where they seemed to expect the player to make all the logical decisions, get an awful scenario, and have to play again picking all the opposite decisions. It didn't help either than you never seemed to have natural dialoges with people, most of the time you'd be barely lead along just mostly following quest markers because the actual story has giving you so little to work with, and suddenly at the end of the chapter you can ask a NPC about 800 questions, grinding the game to an absolute hault as you now much decide how much you care or just want the game over with.

The game really only has a major choice in chapter 2 where you decide to side with the humans or non-humans. Both are awful. If you side with the non-humans you get a much more interesting cast of characters to work with and generally more story to work with, but it probably has the most awful outcome for everyone involved it seems. On the other side you join the humans and it nearly felt like this part of the game was unfinished, as it was so dull and uninteresting. Taking the human side is generally seemingly treated like the bad option also; even though really you're barely even taking the human side as both you and roche are just there to find the assassin.

The worst part is 99% of this game is the game where Gerolt really starts to remember things, and at really odd moments. The rest of the plot feels like it could've been skipped. I liked the 1st game even though it was a different beast, and plan to try out 3 as it was so highly rated, but i'm half concerned what horrible stuff is going to happen in 3 just because of how little i cared about fixing the consequences of anything by the end of this one and just wanting it to be over with.",1607544880,1607544880,False,0,0,0.456431567668914795,0,True,False,False

It just puts to shame all the AAA developers out there and also takes notice of the problems that arise from a AAA developer. Sure the graphics are top, system ok, but there is no spirit, this is becoming a usual sight be it in Andromeda, Anthem, Destiny and last but not least Bethesda. 
What all these companies have in common they are dying behemoths, Now you see a company like CDPR 
*(originaly a CD vendor) pud every dragon of the industry to shame, For to long they have used and abused the trust of their userbase/customers.  THATS OVER. CDPR is the new standard.
With the rise and release of CYBERPUNK 77, these behemoths, these ""dragons"" of the gaming industry should soon decide if warming their golden eggs is even worth it. 
A more ambitious, faster and eager developer generation is entering the scene and they aim for headshots everything they click. This are the kinds of CDPR and so many other 
Virtuosos that do not give a flying eF if you buy an article at Polygone or every politicaly motivated Game News outlet. 
THEY SHIT ON THEM ALL, With TALENT! Thats the true Golden Egg the once dragons of industry have lost. 
Its done now.  This is not a console next gen, THIS IS TRUE NEXT GEN, Ideas, Tech and a fundamental progression in the way we look at ""Gaming"".

Honestly the sex stuff is just not that enticing.

I mean, I thought I dumped that red-headed Karen, but she kept coming back - no choice in that matter I guess lol. She's the ex that won't leave. I later learned that it's because she's supposed to be the main love interest for the character. The game made her annoying and totally uninteresting (a sorceress who specializes in being a sycophant to kings, nags at you, has a holier than thou attitude, and she looks like she's had a lot of plastic surgery on various body parts - vain much?).

Then you get Witcher this game. Graphics are better. Story is nice. The problem is that game now sucks at it's essense, i.e. being a game.
Don't get me wrong, I like the expansion of gadgets (Which make perfect sense for a monster hunter, really), but everything feels horrible. 
Bombs take too long to go into aiming mode, which results in Geralt being finally shoved into it when enemy is already at point blank.
Lock switch is awkward, lingering when it shouldn't and dropping when it's not.
Swordplay is brutally murdered by always having different delay in hits, which are chosen randomly. 
Oh, let's help you a bit by having Geralt move as if he wore concrete shoes and strafe as if he wore concrete shoes for 10km sprint before said strafe attempt, that will make game more fun. Yet we will make it impossible to perform tiny steps, you want to get closer to the edge of the wall you hug? Let's eject you in the hallway right into a guard, that surely won't get in the way of your pacifism!
Also, let's turn every power into Charged Igni fireball from W1, why would you want to have crowd control with AoE cone?
Still here? Let's weaken the oils making you wonder why you would ever use these over grindstones other than being a cheapskate. Also, let's make them expire as if they were your ice-cream. Which you gave to your little brother to hold, so you could tie your shoestrings.
You love the fighting anyway? Why offcourse we have more ways to screw you over. Let's start with tying everything to LMB prompt (We were given an advice to have all quest items surrounded by long ladders you can climb, but see, we are not the villains of this story!), then realize that maybe some people want to swing their swords, so let's make prompt areas small, this will not get in the way of players, forcing them to spin camera AND PC as well to try and find that angle so you could finally fall down the ledge.
Let's tie in a lot of stuff to your amulet, yet give it a cooldown, force stop your movement if you dare to use it and make it randomly do nothing, sometimes several times in a row.

This game is awesome in terms of storyline, character depth, level design and atmosphere. It even rivals the third Witcher game in some elements. The linear storyline is great because it suits the tone of the witcher books but it still allows roleplaying choices and decisions.

Leisure Suit Larry (Larpers Edition)

Real Review:
I played Witcher 1, couldn't continue after chapter 1. W1 had a great story telling system but that game is just not playable in 2020 due to its combat and exploration system. Witcher 2 is a completely different experience. Same great story telling, very immersive and superb combat, exploration and graphics. It really held up well over the years. If you thought only Bethesda can make great RPGs, think again.

But make no mistakes, this is NOT a free roaming open world RPG where you can get lost for 100s of hours. You can't even jump in this game. It is not like the Elderscroll series. Witcher 2 is similar to the Final Fantasy type RPG where it is pretty lock-step in how you progress the story. You can't really do much exploring or re-visit old areas and the map is chopped up into ""chapters"". There are some side quests and trivial games to play but the most meaningful thing to do is the main quest. Once you leave an area, you can never go back to it.

However it has a glorious main quest and the story telling is phenomenal. If we are really only judging by main quest story telling, this has to be one of the best RPG ever made. Skyrim doesn't even get close to this level of story telling.

Bonus Review:
Absolutely all the women in Witcher 2 looked gorgeous. No more having nightmares after seeing one too many pre-generated female faces in Morrowind, Oblivion or Skyrim.

Oh and did I mention, you can't jump.",1601184999,1606381281,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False
20920,80198371,76561198857916645,0,16,3165,0,3165,1606378697,"This was a really hard decision. This game is by no mean a bad one. And I overall like the game, but in the end, I cannot recommend it to everyone. 
Let's start first with why it does right:

- The story: probably the one part that kept me playing. Characters are all interesting, they are complex and the narrative is interesting. You will often find yourself relate the characters you thought you would hate, or at least understand their motivations. The writing is good, funny and can be thought-provoking at time.
Also I'm kinda surprised at how many choices that game gives you and how it vastly affects the story.

- The music: Really wonderful work here, although the battle/ combat theme can become kinda repetitive, and it's probably the worst piece of music in the game.

- The graphic: Really impressive for a 10-year-old game, tho it's not half as good as The Witcher 3, the world can look really beautiful and mesmerizing at times, and the character models are pretty good. You can tell that the developers really put in the hard work and do their best with the technology available at that time.

Ok, now comes to what it does wrong:

- The difficulty: Maybe it's because this is my first Witcher game I've ever played, but the game is unreasonably hard. I played at Normal difficulty for the first 8 hours, and I can say that I was not enjoying it. I died probably about 25-35 times, and the game really felt unfair. The game does not explain what you need to do either, not after 30 hours into the game did I realize that silver swords deal more damage to monsters.

Only after switching it to Easy mode, can I really have a nice experience. But then the problem was the IT WAS TOO EASY, you only need to click your mouse repeatedly to beat the game. Meanwhile on Normal difficulty, bosses can kill you with 3-4 hits.

- The combat: the combat is not that terrible, but it feels kinda clunky with, combines with terrible difficulty system and you have a really unenjoyable experience. 

- The bugs: Tho I only encountered these bugs 10-15 times through out my whole 52 hours playthrough, the fact that I had to restart the game and sometime restart Steam itself really breaks the immersion. Bugs are often audio-related, like no dialogue or no in-game sound. Sometimes the game shut itself off too. That happened like 3-4 times.

I bought Witcher 3 on sale today and played it for a couple of hours, and I can clearly tell this is what the game wanted to be, and what it could have been, but alas, it is no Witcher 3. It is as ambitious but not half as good. 
Overall, if you want more of the story of this rich universe, and you caught the game on sale, and you are a really patient guy (or girl) then I'd recommend you play it on Easy difficulty and maybe go one a second run on Normal difficulty. 

I still think this is a good game, but it's not for everyone. So keep that in mind, before you buy it.

[*] Graphics are still good by modern standards and there is good mod support to improve them further.
[*] The voice acting is done well and improved considerably from the first game.
[*] The story branches about midway through the game, so it will take 2 playthroughs to cover it all.
[*] Should take anywhere from 25-40 hours depending on if you do both scenarios. Not bad value for money since this goes on sale regularly.

Cons:
[list]
[*] The combat is similar to the third game, but the potion system is awful. You have to heal before the fight starts which is really annoying if you get caught up in an extended section when you can't meditate or between cutscenes.
[*] Cutscene quicktime events are lame, but fortunately there aren't many of them.
[*] The mini-games (dice, arm wrestling, fist fighting) range from bad to average and really aren't much fun at all.
[*] I had some issues with game stability and crashing become a common occurrence near the end of the game. Save often.

Choices, being an integral part of the franchise, a player will find themselves in completely different hubs and zones depending on a few integral dialogue options. Witcher 2 is considerably darker, and, in many ways, far more brutal, than either the original or its successor. Cumbersome combat, near impossible stealth, and a frustrating potion crafting system are some of the dissapointing aspects of the title, but don't affect the impact of the incredible narrative, top-notch music and art design which the game offers in spades.

Overall I found it to be a fun and tight experience that I would highly recommend. It’s the second memorable series, that has forced me to play a main character who is an antihero. The story drags you from one shit show to the next, as selfish characters compete in a power struggle ,that pulls the player right along. The game layers in just enough ethical issues, and moral conundrums to make the encounters interesting while not totally enjoyable. I never felt like a hero, just another person wading through other peoples conflicts with my own personal motives directing my actions and driving me further onwards. Its hard to be an idealist in this game, the people in control are shitty, and the outcomes are terrible. While this makes for an engaging narrative, it strikes a little to close to real life for comfort.

Level and quest design was great. I found the UI and Inventory systems to be atrocious, seems like it was designed for console, and the PC port did not make any improvements here. The voice acting and graphics were super good. I am glad there was less utterly ridiculous and  ludicrous sex mechanics this time around but the game designers still like to layer it in heavily. I loved the Easter eggs and mythological references (assassins creed, xena warrior princess, trolls repairing bridges, etc…). The game neatly carried over my Witcher 1 decisions.

An excellent  story that actually affects scenario
3 systems you can improve main character (though  swordsmanship is the easiest)
good graphics even for 2020
works on linux

cons:
awkward fighting system - don't bother with blocking just dodge and hit (it seems they designed it for console)
horrible map (map makes this game painful sometimes, because it's impossible to figure out path judging by the map and since this is not an open world game, sometimes you can not pass in place where in fact you could have pass).

still broken save menu: to save your time disable steam sync and regulary delete old saves via in game menu.

recommendations on game:
improve swordsmanship
do as many side quests as you can
in chapter 1 buy grapeshot recipe before it's too late
read about mutagens and farm a madness mutagen for yourself using harpies in chapter 2 (it's boring and can take about an hour, but that will allow you to have best from the best).",1605755925,1605804421,True,20,0,0.688614368438720703,0,True,False,False

The pacing isn't as bad as Witcher 1 but it still has that long drawn out boring mystery section that turns a 25 hour game into a 40 hour game.  Just like Witcher 1 CDProjektRed has no idea how to put a quest together.  ""Here is a sidequest but we're not going to tell you where to go, what to do, or how to do it.  We're not even going to give you a quest marker.""  At least in this one all the quests are not tied up and jumbled together so you can do sidequests when you want to instead of when the mainquest allows it.  My main problem is the difficulty.  CdProjektRed doesn't know anything about balance.  Anyone who says they beat the game on normal with no difficulty at all is full of crap.  When you start this game you are just pathetic.  I know they have to start you out low so you can be built up but you don't start this game with the skills that you started with in the last game.  You have to add the basic skills back into your character from the skill tree.  The aggression and skill competence the enemies have at the start of the game makes the beginning ruff going.  Especially since the game throws a lot of new abilities at you and you have no time to learn them before going into the fire.  I don't have a problem with this in and of itself but you start off very squishy.  If you play on normal you get many many many 1 or 2 hit kills.  Certain boss/mini boss areas will kill you with 1-2 hits and you will have to restart every 15 seconds.  Ya thats fun.  You will have to use a walkthough or change to easy just to find out or live long enough to learn for yourself what to do.  However, halfway through the game when you can get new armor, weapons, and some skills it is possible to go back to normal mode.  SPOILER:  You must put 2 points into the skill that negates back stabs.  The game is unplayable without that.  Every less than fully successful dodge will be a 1-2 hit kill.  Much of the combat is an overwhelming number of enemies in a small space making back stabs and surrounds constant.  Ya thats fun.  When it gives you some space it is fun actually but thats all this game has.  Nothing about the combat is unique or clever.  Its just small boxes and overwhelming numbers.  Remember potions?  Ya they are useless now.  Maybe they were overpowered in the last game but in this one they are so weak they are not worth using.  Thats a shame since it was such an important part of the first game.  Even worse you can't use potions mid fight anymore.  You have to use it at a save before the predetermined fight and then initiate the fight.  At least it lasts a very long time.  SPOILER: don't put any points into alchemy skills.  With potions being useless alchemy skills are useless.  Last but not least, This game crashed on me like 12 times.  Thats not counting the 3 times I clicked on a ladder or ledge and got stuck on geometry.      

Okay now some good things.  The skill tree is a nice improvement on the level up system.  New skills and abilities allow for more options in combat but you won't use them much because combat does not have unique or clever ways to use them.  The combat system is a huge improvement from Witcher 1.  You actually fight them one click one swing instead of the odd auto combat system the last one had.  Dice isn't weighted against you but it still takes no skill to play or win.  

Only play this game if you want to learn all the back story before playing Witcher 3.  It might be better to just watch a lore breakdown.  Playing this game makes me worried about how good Cyberpunk 2077 will be.",1605717435,1605717435,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The choices you make matter and have visible consequences on the world around you.

You play as Geralt of Rivia, a monster slayer for hire, mutated and trained from an early age to kill savage beasts, who is caught up in a deadly intrigue that will shape the future of the Continent.

The story is mature and intricate, while the characters that fill this world are compelling, very well written and brilliantly voice acted. You will also face difficult choices that will radically alter the plot.

Combat is complex, requiring some planning and preparation by brewing potions and crafting blade oils, that will increase your odds of survival.

The graphics are pretty good, enhancing the overall immersion. The soundtrack is on par, with many wonderful songs.

More detail: I had previously played the first witcher game and will now finally continue with the third. As expected, graphics, combat system and overall feel of the game significantly progress with the second title.

I enjoyed the story very much. The world is interesting and the combat exciting. I experienced a lot less frustration with running back and forth within quests. And the way quests progressed is far more enjoyable compared to the first game. I feel like the first game concentrated more on the actual ""witcher job"" of hunting monsters.

The upgrade in presentation from Witcher 1 is staggering and distracts from the very start of the game, with environmental design that fully realises the ambitious scenarios. The world looks alive in a way that puts some present games to shame, a decade after its release. As such, it is easy to go into the game expecting a polished, smooth experience in line with a big budget title. [b]This is not the case.[/b] While Witcher 2 makes many improvements compared to its predecessor, it inherits the same level of inconsistencies. I can't stress enough that if you wish to play this game, you should be expecting a janky experience. That will probably improve your experience a lot.

I won't go into detail in this review, because if I would list all the problems I had with this game, this review would be even longer than it is (though I will mention that it crashed quite a bit and made my computer work a lot; take a look at graphics options before playing!). Instead, I will focus on what I found most important, both in a negative and positive sense.

First, we have combat. The combat of this game is quite divisive, and understandably so. There are misleading animations, with some of them so quick that it is close to impossible to react, which pairs with high damage on enemies to be quite annoying at times. You die quick, and yet you often don't have an awful amount of space to move around, leading to some difficult fights that would probably be almost trivial in an open field. Boss fights boils down to QTE:s or something close to it, ending up lacking choice in tactics. I would call this a difficult game, if it wasn't for the difficulty dropping steadily as the game goes on, making the enemies of the last chapter pushovers.

Overall, the combat has questionable design and a severe lack of polish. There is no arguing that. And yet, I didn't find it bad myself. It starts off rough, but you continually have a lot of options (with exception of the bosses), there is a lot of impact, there is good enemy variety, there is a lot of freedom in the movement system and... well, it just looks pretty good. Overall I found it enjoyable, problems and all, and that contradiction is not uncommon in this game.

Let's move to quest design. The game mainly consists of speaking to characters and fighting, which is contained within the quests. While I will applaud the way that quests weave into eachother, something that is left over from Witcher 1, I can't shake the image of a puzzle where the pieces don't quite fit together. Witcher 1 had quests and characters that interlinked in a way that felt somewhat natural, because of the character interacting with eachother and having their own agency and motivations. In comparison, the way that quests link together in Witcher 2 feels more based on convenience, with characters only being able to act in cohesion with the player or in accordance to the plot. Instead of giving characters the information that would make them act, you gather information from them so that you can act. Only the voice acting and dialogue writing saves the game from feeling like one where you're the only thing alive.

Then there is that plot, that story. Well, if you've read some about the game, you should know that there are some extremely impactful choices in the game, to the point that the game becomes completely different as a result of them. What this leads to, I believe, is a certain lack of depth. While dramatic in theory, scenes lack weight and pacing to make them actually interesting. The execution is almost comical at times, with characters dying for no reason, or dramatically falling to the floor poisoned within five minutes of entering the story. With few exceptions, the main story feels sped up, with nothing quite living up to what it could've been. Nothing is quite lacking enough to be bad, but it shafes constantly nonetheless.

But the biggest problem with the story is also its biggest boon. The entirety of Witcher 2, the core of the main character's motivation, consists of bridging the Witcher games with the Witcher books. What does this mean? It means that as a book reader, I cannot fathom how you can follow the point of this story, its references and its ending, without having read the books. It's not the only thing in the story, as there is still the ""political"" side of the narrative that has its own value. But the personal side, the thing that holds weight for Geralt himself? I think it's almost a requirement to have read the books to follow it. This is not good for a game to do; and yet, because of it, I ended up caring about the story and its continuation in Witcher 3 way more than I thought I would.

To summarise, I think that Witcher 2 is an overall fine game. I don't love it like I ended up loving Witcher 1, and despite being more polished, I think it's janky in all the wrong places.

I had previously tried to play this game first, but I felt very lost so I decided to give it another chance after beating the first game.

[b]Good:[/b]
[list]
    [*]The Z button is a nice addition to display interactable objects within a certain range.
    [*]Pressing 1 and 2 instead of Q and E for weapons rather than Signs is something I wished for in the first game.
    [*]The CTRL wheel is a nice addition to the interface.
    [*]The game runs better than the first game.
    [*]Mod support.
    [*]Despite preferring the combat system of the first game, the combat feedback feels good.
    [*]The inventory system is improved over the first game.
    [*]Weapons actually have comprehensive stats unlike the first game.
    [*]Excellent soundtrack, as always.
    [*]Allows you to import your Witcher 1 save file to keep some equipment.
    [*]Meditating no longer requires a campfire, and potions are more balanced.
    [*]The talent tree is an improvement.
    [*]The game is stable, even with mods. Only had 1 crash while alt+tabbing.
[/list] 

[b]Neutral:[/b]
[list]
    [*]The lack of coloured names above NPCs' heads makes it more difficult to distinguish quest related NPCs.
    [*]I do not enjoy items having weight in these kinds of games. Feels like an artifical handicap. Luckily, there's a mod for that.
    [*]A lot of the voice actors I'd become accustomed to have been replaced.
    [*]The Quen sign is very overpowered.
[/list] 

[b]Bad:[/b]
[list]
    [*]There are absolutely no settings available in-game. Nothing can be adjusted during gameplay, everything has to be set up before launching the game. You can't even check the keybinds.
    [*]The textures look grainy.
    [*]While a graphical upgrade, the artstyle is a downgrade from the first game.
    [*]I do not recommend starting with this game, as a lot of things learned from the first game are poorly explained, or not explained at all in this one.
    [*]The Signs have no explanation as to what they do, something the first game did better.
    [*]The map is at times difficult to navigate.
    [*]I miss the lack of combat stances (Heavy, Fast, Group) from the first game, which added some reactionary combat depth beyond spamming the mouse buttons.
    [*]The game has a lot of QTE events.
    [*]I am not a fan of corpses turning into bags when lootable. I preferred the Object Names in the first game showing the text ""Remains"" above defeated enemies when lootable.
    [*]There is no indication of whether books have been read or not.
    [*]Disappointing lack of quests involving monsters - feels like the whole point of being a witcher is ruined by forcing humans to be the main enemy.
    [*]Very little environment variation compared to the first game. You're stuck in only 2 areas for 90% of the game.

I'm nearly done with the game, and if anything I hate the combat system even more than when I started.  I understand it now, and I work within the ridiculous constraints it imposes on me, but most boss fights are pretty much the opposite of fun.  If you like large doses of arbitrary frustration then this is the game for you.

Pros:  The story is great.  There are a lot of consequential choices, sometimes kingdom ending choices.  I love the gritty atmosphere.  Profanity and debauchery abound.  Lots of dark humor.

Cons: OMG the bugs.  So many bugs.  Game crashing bugs.  The controls, expecially in combat, are awful and unresponsive.  You can't cancel out of moves that you should be able to cancel.  Many important game mechanics are never explained.  The minigames are stupid and boring.  You can't open doors or climb onto/jump off of platforms during combat, even if you're 30' away from your foe.  The inventory UI was designed by drunken monkeys.  The magical ""signs"" have very non-intuitive names and no other easy indicators of what they actually do in the interface where you select them.  I suppose that's fine if you've read all the books and seen the shows and already memorized them, but if you come into it blind it's yet another frustration.

Combat is improved, but geralt felt reaaaally slow compared to everything in the game and I did not like any boss fights.

I really loved the music and atmosphere, questioning witcher's neutrality all the time and game flow in general except for the middle part, where you basically talk for a half hour straight before it makes sense to venture out.

Ochłonęłam chwilę po przejściu dodatku i zgodnie z zapowiedzią podzielę się moimi wrażeniami. Pragnę nadmienić, że nie będzie to ocena obiektywna, bo jestem ogromną fanką całego uniwersum i bardzo długo czekałam na ten dodatek. Weźmy również poprawkę na moją nieskończoną miłość do Yennefer <3

Ale przejdźmy już do samej modyfikacji. Jak pewnie wiecie, jest to modyfikacja fanowska (od fanów dla fanów). Główny wątek to ślub naszej (mojej) ukochanej pary: Yennefer i Geralta. Jednak nie dajcie się zwieść! Podczas rozgrywki wcielimy się w różnych bohaterów (Ciri, Eskel, Letho) oraz poznamy nowe historie bądź rozjaśnią nam się wcześniej już znane (jest wiele retrospekcji). Jednak pomimo wielu zadań do wykonania, spędzimy cudowne chwile na weselu młodej pary.

Samo wykonanie dodatku to istny majstersztyk. Świat został odwzorowany perfekcyjnie, a kreacja bohaterów i dialogi to cudo. Oddają one w 100% charakter bohaterów, których znamy z książek czy gier. Wszystko zostało dopracowane na ostatni guzik i sami Redzi by się tego nie powstydzili!

Przedstawiona w modyfikacji historia jest nietuzinkowa i bardzo przemyślana. Wszystko się ze sobą łączy w niebanalny sposób, a dodatkowe zadania do wykonania jedynie podkreślają wyjątkowość tej przygody. Jeszcze bardziej przybliżają nas do bohaterów sagi, ukazują nowe wydarzenia i nową perspektywę. Na uznanie zasługuje także fakt wielu zakończeń (dokładnie 3).

Ja przez cały miałam na twarzy banana od ucha do ucha! Widząc nawiązania do sagi oraz gier, dosłownie skakałam z radości (naprawdę!) i śmiałam się do ekranu. Moje serduszko radowało się jak nigdy wcześniej. Było to istne spełnienie moich marzeń i znaczy dla mnie więcej, niż jesteście sobie w stanie wyobrazić.

A pod koniec łzy oczach. Wielkie krople zasłaniające ekran. ""Coś się kończy.."". Na pewno kończy się pewien etap. Chcę jednak myśleć, że ""coś się zaczyna"". Jeszcze nie wiem, co to będzie.
Odczuwam wielką pustkę mając świadomość, że to już koniec przygód mojego ukochanego Białego Wilka, Yennefer, Ciri oraz ich towarzyszy. Jednak nie mogłam wyobrazić sobie lepszego zakończenia tej historii. Pięknego. Wzruszającego. Poruszającego. A jednocześnie radosnego.

Dodatek jest genialny. Twórcy włożyli w modyfikację całe swoje serce, dzięki czemu stworzyli niepowtarzalną i unikalną historię. Historię, którą warto przeżyć samemu. Ale ostrzegam, nic już nie będzie takie same. Być może podchodzę do tego zbyt osobiście, ale taki mój urok <3 




[b]Farewell of the White Wolf - review[/b]

I calmed down a little after finishing this mod and as I said, I will share my opinion about it. I also want to say that it won't be objective, because I'm a huge fan of the Witcher universum and I've been waiting for so long for this dlc. Don't forget about my endless love for Yennefer <3

But let's focus on the modification now. As you may know, this is a fan expansion (from fans to fans). The main story is Yennefer and Geralt's wedding: our (my) lovely couple. But don't misunderstand that! During the gamplay we'll play as different characters (Ciri, Eskel, Letho) and experience new stories or get to know ones, that we already know (there are a lot of flashbacks). Despite a lot of tasks to do, we'll spend a lovely time at newlyweds' wedding.

The creation of the mod is masterpiece. The world is mapped perfectly and the creation of the characters and dialogues is wonderful! They mapped the characters we know from books or games in 100%! CDPRed wouldn't be ashamed!

The story's showed in the mod is unique and very thoughtful. Everything is connected in an original way and extra tasks just emphasise the specialness of this adventure. They bring us closer to the characters that we know from the books and games, they show new events and perspective. Let's also appreciate multiple endings (3 to be extact).

All the time I was smiling from ear to ear! Seeing the references to books or games make me literally jumping up and down with excitement (really!) and I was laughing to the screen. My heart was over the moon like never before. My dream came true and it means for me more, than you can expect.

And at the end tears in my eyes. Big drops covering my screen. ""Something ends..."". For sure a certain stage ends. But I want to think, that ""something begins"". I don't know what it is yet.
I feel empty knowing, that this is the end of my favourite White Wolf, Yennefer, Ciri and their friends' adventures. But I couldn't imagine better ending of this story. Beautiful. Moving. Touching. And delighting at the same time.

The modification is brilliant. Authors put their hearts and soul in this dlc, that's why they've created unique and touching story. The story worth experiencing on your own. But I warn you, nothing will be the same. Maybe I'm too emotional, but that's my charm <3",1603874599,1604306204,True,9,0,0.582973480224609375,2,True,False,False

You have to make various choices which would lead to the difference in the narrative of the world but won't directly affect the superficial storyline. Apart from that, there are many choices that would lead to different missions. Hence this game needs at least 2 playthrough to fully complete the storyline. Overall great game.

Ratings :
Story : 5/5 Much more mature storytelling, however there isn't the massive final twist like one in the Witcher 1.
Gameplay : 4/5 A progress from the original game in combat which is much more immersive. However, there is a bit of lack of polish (no pun intended) in the combat. Alchemy was also toned down from earlier version but the need of meditation in order to drink potion is much more lore friendly (although a pain).
Graphics : 4/5 It's a 2011 game so the graphics are not as great as the current generation quality. But is quite good for the 360 era.

I guess the only reason this gets so much attention is The Witcher 3, which is a much better game than this one in almost every sense. There are other old RPG games that are better as well, such as Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning ,Two Worlds 2, or the classic Elder Scrolls games. They have a deeper story, they have better graphics and a better combat system among many other things... Or, if you want something new, you can try Greedfall.

Now, the game has some good aspects, for instance, the gameplay, which is very fluid, the combat system as well, which  is fine for the most part, although I find it really annoying that you continue to be blocked into the fighting stance even after combat for a few moments, making interaction with objects, doors, loot or NPCs impossible. But it also has some really bad aspects, such as the blocking system, which very unintuitive, making the dodge and fighting components the only ones that you really use during combat.


I haven't played the first game, The Witcher, so I don't know how the story connects to The Witcher 2, but I found the story really boring during my 2.5 hour gameplay, and I really disliked that you suddenly find yourself in a dungeon and are forced to remember some events that connect the story somehow. And the fact that the game doesn't force the events in chronological  order, letting the player decide the events is even worse, making a complete mess of the story.  The choices don't seem to matter all that much either, sure, they unlock some dialogue options, but other than that, no impact at all. 

I'm not even going to comment on the graphics, the stupid 'medieval' humor, the mapping system, or the inventory system...",1604140157,1604140157,False,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

[h1]📝What is Witcher 2?[/h1]
Before 'The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt' released in 2015, there was 'The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings' in 2011. Not quite as successful or celebrated as its sequel, The Witcher 2 nevertheless stands out for its unique design and changes when compared to the first game of the series. The player controls Geralt of Rivia - a human who has been outfitted with mutant powers that is generally employed to slay monsters, otherwise known as a witcher. Shortly into the prologue, Geralt is falsely accused of assassinating a king, and must do whatever he can in order to catch the real killer and clear his name.

The Witcher 2 contains strong RPG elements including leveling, a skill tree, crafting, and gear. The witcher profession often requires preparation and knowledge of the enemy, which is utilized in-game by allowing for the research of monsters, deployment of bombs and traps, or the imbibement of potions that grant you a variety of effects. Geralt can also take sidequests and make different decisions in dialogue or cutscenes that will (greatly) affect various things in positive/negative ways, possibly much later in the game.

[h2]🎮Gameplay[/h2]

[b]🔎Interaction[/b]
The biggest focus of The Witcher 2 is on its story and characters. You will spend a lot of time in the game simply conversing with people, making decisions in dialogue, and dealing with the consequences. The biggest difference this makes for the Witcher 2 compared to other games is the potential to branch off quite wildly at certain points of the game, both for sidequests and the main quest. In the case of the latter, there is at least one decision in the game that will send you to an entirely different hub area with different quests and NPC's to speak with, which greatly changes the outcome of later events. This aspect is definitely the highlight of Witcher 2, and it's a shame that it might be the only good part.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2225031380 
[b]🗺️Exploration[/b]
Omitting the prologue, there are 3 chapters in the game that each contain their own hub in which to gather information, gather materials, take quests, and kill some bad guys. Geralt is heavily tethered to the ground, so you will mostly be exploring by walking around and using contextual actions to climb or jump when the game allows for it, though it's somewhat rare. Within each settlement you'll find vendors, craftsmen, and sidequests, all of which will require money and materials from the untamed wilds where monsters roam about. Cave systems and corpse-laden fields seem to attract all sorts of creatures, so you will have no shortage of hostiles to battle. Which leads to...

[b]⚔️Combat[/b]
This part of the game is garbage, and I really mean that. Combat is one of the core components of the game, and it's so broken in so many ways that it entirely turned me away from playing multiple times. In combat, Geralt feels very stiff to control, chooses his melee strikes randomly, and struggles to connect his attacks at all because of an alien sort of lock-on system. Enemies, however, have superhuman abilities that allow them to turn on a dime to block anywhere/anytime, damage you without hitting you, and track you like a heat-seeking missile. When you factor in equipment and the skill tree on Normal difficulty, the game begins nightmarishly difficult with the obtuse and sluggish combat mechanics, and then becomes exceedingly easy by the end as you tank blows and spam whatever you like to annihilate hordes of enemies. None of it ever feels right, and I could go on for much longer pointing out issues, but I think I've said enough.


[h3]✔️The Good[/h3]
+ [b]Interesting and varied cast of characters[/b]
This was my favorite part of the game without a doubt. There are a lot of different people that you can meet and speak to, and you might even miss a lot of them depending on your choices

+ [b]Expansive story with impactful choices[/b]
Many different branching decisions can lead you to view completely different events, people, and places from one playthrough to the next


[h3]❌The Bad[/h3]
- [b]The combat[/b]
Number 1 issue for me in this game, and you spend a lot of time doing it. Clunky, broken, messy, and straight up not fun

- [b]Most of Geralt's arsenal isn't necessary (on Normal)[/b]
Bombs, knives, and traps are sometimes useful, but you can often get by without using any of them. There are also potions and a skill tree entirely devoted to them, but they aren't remotely worth it from my experience

- [b]Tedious and unintuitive UI[/b]
The inventory displays information poorly and often caused much frustration. The quick menu on controller appears radial but actually isn't, and requires deliberate timing to actually select what you want. Combat log in the bottom right corner of the screen is so out of the way and updates so fast that I almost never got useful information out of it. Etc, etc...

- [b]Poorly explained and hidden mechanics[/b]
There are special ""talents"" in Witcher 2 that are cryptically unlocked by doing seemingly random tasks, often permanently missable, and are never really brought to your attention. Certain things like fatigue are explained maybe once, and you will then be left to wonder for the rest of the game if you missed it

- [b]And the kitchen sink[/b]
The Witcher 2 has too many other issues to go into detail about, but here are a few off the top of my head: awful and contrived stealth sections, Adrenaline meter doesn't always work, medallion highlights empty ""lootable"" sources, the entire bullshit Kayran, Draug, and ESPECIALLY the Operator encounters, Geralt can't help but interact with everything around him while you try to swing your sword... you get the idea.


[h3]❔Your Mileage May Vary❔[/h3]
~ [b]Lots of politics; not much witcher'ing[/b]
This game's plot heavily revolves around different factions vying for power while trying to sabotage or outright kill each other, and it gets quite complicated. Not a lot of monster related activities were available

~ [b]Minimum of 2 playthroughs to get the full picture[/b]
At least one major decision will completely cut you off from a large portion of the rest of the game. This adds to the replay value, but also means the experience feels like it's missing something if you only plan on a single run

~ [b]Fair amount of female nudity[/b]
Pretty self explanatory. I felt it was a bit gratuitous, at times

~ [b]Mod support[/b]
There are a TON of small issues with this game that can be eased with just a mod or two. Personally, I found the medallion and inventory to be unbearable as-is, and played the game with them slightly modified for quality of life

~ [b]Looks pretty good for a 2011 game[/b]
Aside from maybe the character models, most environments and animations look pretty good for such an old game, in my opinion

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2218980584
[h1]The Verdict[/h1]
Suffice to say, I think The Witcher 2 is entirely skippable as a game. Though it would certainly boost your appreciation for characters and events to come in later entries, I found it so unbearable to play that I think you are better off watching a video or reading up on the events of the game. If you absolutely [i]must[/i] play this game, then I advise that you load yourself up on mods to ease your experience. The Witcher 2 often goes on sale for only $3, but even at that price it took me months to push myself hard enough to see the end.",1603510864,1603513313,False,66,6,0.643436908721923828,0,True,False,False

My favorite thing about this is the richness of the story and conflict - complex enough for people liking political games and schemes but simple enough for others to understand and enjoy as well, all done in a way that makes you think twice before trusting or siding with someone.
As someone who hasn't read any of the books, I can tell you there will be quite a bit of lore left completely unexplained to you, so it would help to play the first game and read the journal entries in this one if you don't plan on picking up the books. The story is however made so you can still understand at least the most important bits, but if you know the rest of the lore, this is even more of a must for you to try the game.
I'd recommend saving the game regularly, as it tends to crash every now and then and you wouldn't want losing important progress. Saving before spending talent points or crafting a lot of items can also help in case you get stuck on some of the more challenging bosses and you need to change your strategy. Some of them can prove rather difficult even on Normal mode.

Would absolutely recommend it to anyone interested in a story-oriented game packed with action, violence, beauty, deep lore and political conflict.",1603492249,1603492425,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[h1] Personal Thoughts	[/h1]

'The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt' was my first Witcher game and I loved it so much I  played the previous games and loved them. 'The Witcher 2' also drew me in the same way part 3 did because the characters felt fully fleshed-out and the story-telling quality is superb. The story is driven by Geralt of Rivia who--despite reflecting emotions--shows a lot of character and makes me interested in his journey with the diverse set of characters. I played through the game twice to follow the different paths the game allows and was amazed on how different the game turned out depending on the choices I've made and who I sided with. This is something I feel a lot of RPG's are missing, a sense of direct control of the story that shapes itself to my choices and The Witcher 2 does just that. Overall, I LOVED this game and highly recommend giving it a shot!",1458338275,1603336955,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

As I am in it to slay monster and walk in the condom of the Witcher, I found those quests uncalled for and distastful.   

The cons in details are:

There is a common bug people experience. Where the game runs with more than dozens of saves, the game has a chance to crash everytime the player enters a new area through a door. This flaw is a critical problem in a story-rich and choice matter video game. Real fans would make saves at turning points in the story for future replay to enjoy what would happen  otherwise in the story. This known bug which never get fixed, it prevent dedicated players from enjoy this game the way it should be enjoyed.

The tutorial is poorly designed. I was stuck with the wizard that shoots fireball in it. The game asks me to press number 9 at the summoned beast, but it did nothing. Also the tutorial fails to explaine number 5 to 9 keys are preassigned to each of the magical skills, which are known as Signs in the game. So I was set up to play the game without a full understand on how combat works.

There is nowhere in the game that explains what each of the 5 signs do. No menu that tells you when pause the game in anyway during gameplay. I needed to search online to know what the hell every one  of those signs does. Once I found content that checked out in multiple sources, I printed it out, and then drew the symbol to tell my-self which is which. Because in the game, those magical skills known as Signs are displayed in symbols, and my Open Office does not display those PIC based symbol after I copied and pasted from a website.  That is a lot of evil homework for a video game. All the other games I play allow me to check my skills and their definition DURING gameplay. THIS ONE DOESN""T!!!!! God daXX MOXXXX FXXX!

Why the FXXX can't I remap my keys in game? WHY? Don't develop game if you can't program faeces. Just DON'T!

Hence the game does not allow you to check the list of keys during the game, I tried to learn it by pressing every key on the keyboard. The J key is for journal menu, but next to it there is the H key. If you pressed it, it disable all menu function and disable all the interface based information - map, health bar, skills, inventory, journal. The first time I pressed it, I didn't know what the fORK just happened, I thought I ran into a bug. So I relaunched the game multiple time in attempts to learn what triggered such a bug. Too many minutes later, I searched online then I learned that it was the H key function. What is the purpose of disable all the relevant interface in the game??? what doesn't it display fade in and fade out text that reads ""Press H again to bring back interface after photo is taken""????? Why? BECAUSE THEY CAN""T PROGRAM FAECES!!!!

Hours into the game, I have run into other problems in addition to design flaw in programing and its poorly designed learning curves. The side quests were designed to prolong chore-like gameplay. A good few side quests had me wandered aimlessly in a large area to run into subject of the quests by chances. Any other ARPG game has NPC that says to the protogonist  ""here, let me mark your map"", but not Witcher 2. Again the combat is not fun; its slow to play, and dull to watch.

The gameplay offer million crafting choices for the player to use, ranging from potions, trap, to bombs, to temp boost items. However the character can only carry so much. So the player need to spend a lot of gameplay time unload crafting components, and loading needed component after reading what are needed. It's a long list, and only a few items are really useful. A lot of chore, for the least kind of fun in a video game that focuses more on story than on combat gameplay.

THere is a combat roll move, that doesn't cancel attack, and it's heavily needed in the game. That makes me a better swordman than Gerald in real live. That makes any other combat focus game more fun than this one. By the silver sword, what a disgrace? 

The other problem is a minor one. When and where there are multiple NPC fighting along your side, they follow you and they block your path. Enter a new area and run into a few foes? If you fallback, one of the NPCs will block the door, thus disable you from engaging in melee combat. Walked into a corner to loot crate and chest? NPCsssss block you in every directions, good luck loading a save close enough to your current advancement in the game.

WTF is wrong with this game? How is this a good game? It's only good with cutscenes! Right, PC standard! Probably, I was born too early.",1602771581,1603269367,False,2,0,0.46192052960395813,0,True,False,False

However, here are few things which bothered me during the game: 1. Crashing. The game crashes quite often and randomly. It gets annoying if the autosave was longer time ago, 2. Not intuitive enough. With the 1st game, I had to google what to do around 10 times. In this one, it was maybe around 50. Not enough hints in the game that would be sufficient to proceed. It might very well be that I am just dumb but I compare it with the 1st game where it wasn´t necessary so much. 3. Journal - Monsters is a joke. I have completed the whole game and have maybe 4 entries. I know there is another screen via the character menu (still don´t understand why there are two different) but in none of them it was adding the monster entries automatically. You probably have to read the books but they are expensive and it is quite ridiculous not to have any information about the monsters you are fighting without buying books and you end up looking it up on the internet. 5. Incredible mouse lag that I was not able to fix even though I have googled several potential solutions, none of them worked. 6. Unnecessary long cut scene when drinking potions 7. No overview of the talents spent per section. Also, too many options to spend the talents while you only gain few. 8. Too long loading time (might be my system although I hope not because I have quite new rig). 9. I think it would be great to have an announcement before you enter a stage after which you will not be able to fulfill a quest (would save us time loading back).

The sound is spot on and the music is pretty epic, it definitely makes the game seem cinematic, just with the in-game cut scenes alone.

The skills system and socket system keep the game interesting and combat is smooth in part 2. for you can now pause the game and select your power signs and gear on the fly while pausing the game, a la Old Republic. Its a good change of pace, as the first game was pretty brutal and unforgiving, not to say Witcher 2 is a walk in the park.

Action RPGs these days are real iffy due to the fact that they tend to feel to formulaic. They usually have good stories, but the graphics are horrible, the combat is clumsy, and the quest system is yawn worthy. The Witcher 2 takes what was great from the first and makes it even better to form one of the greatest action RPGs of this generation.

You play, once again, as Geralt of Rivia, a Witcher, who got framed for assassinating king Demavend and must prove his innocence. The story is heavy in politics, but is also very deep and feels just like the novels. Triss Merrigold also returns with her beautiful red hair and all. You will also see other familiar faces such as Zoltan Chivay and Dandelion. The new faces are strong, likeable, and memorable characters that you will grow to love or hate respectively throughout the course of this 20-30 hour game. Geralt himself is even stronger this time around with more problems than you can shake a stick at. You learn to respect him more and see just how much this poor man can take. CD Projekt really shows you the roots of both good and evil in humanity in such a realistic fashion, and that's what really drives the characters home.

The combat in The Witcher 2 is better than the first game because gone are the timed sword swings and stances. You now just have light and heavy attacks, but can block, counter attack (when you unlock the skill), and you still use the steel/silver sword combo. Steel is for people and silver is for monsters. The combat was very hard to do when the game first launched, but patches as of late have fixed this for multiple blocking, and faster response. The combat isn't great and is clumsy especially early on when you aren't very strong and towards the end of the game. Combat will make you smash your monitor in frustration in the beginning because you have to learn to just hit once or twice, dodge, run around, hit another couple of times, rinse and repeat 50 times. Yeah, its one of those games in the beginning. After you level up enough you can cut down enemies in just a couple of swings and groups of 7-10 won't really bother you.

Of course you can equip better armor, weapons, and so forth, but The Witcher lets you do other things like equip trophies that are found on bosses that increase stats, use sword enhancements such as oils, whetstones, runes, and armor enhancements (kind of like Monster Hunter?) This adds a lot of depth to the customization to your load out which has endless possibilities. I think the biggest improvement is the resource gathering and alchemy because its so simple and easy now. Just gather resources as you go and you can meditate and create potions that increase your vigor (for signs; more on that later), vitality (health), a potion that lets you see in the dark, damage increasing potions etc. The only problem is you can't drink them from the menu, but you have to use them before a fight. This is my biggest beef with the game because if you are low on health in a fight you're screwed unless you took a Swallow potion beforehand. The premeditated potion drinking is a big flaw in the game, I think, but some hardcore RPG players may like this.

The Witcher is also famous for its Signs use because Witchers can't use magic like sorcerers or mages can. There are six different signs and they use chunks of vigor but recharge over time. These Signs are vital to winning in combat especially against bosses, so learn to use these in tandem with sword combos and you can win even the toughest fights. One last thing you can use in combat are Places of Power which you find with your wolf medallion. Activate it and you may find, out in woods or wild places, signs of power that give you temporary stat boosts. These come in handy early in the game (especially in Flotsam) when you are a low level.

The story also has moral decisions thrown in there that really change the outcome of the story. Of course there are multiple playthroughs (but no new game+ sadly) so you can see what each decision will bring. There are a lot of plot holes in the story that aren't filled until the very end during dialog which I found odd, so if you get confused just hang in there until the final moments of the game. Overall my biggest issue is the potion use, combat, and the huge difficulty spikes. The graphics are groundbreaking with gorgeous lighting, highly detailed textures, and amazing landscapes, as well as varied environments with nice weather effects. The character models look superb, and the voice acting is top notch. This game just shows that indie developers can make games look great. You do need a monster rig to run the game on high settings (especially with Ubersampling enabled you need probably dual GPUs and a high end quad core CPU). Other than that The Witcher 2 is amazing in every way and should not be missed by anyone.",1340875005,1602811055,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Unlike The Witcher 1 potions cannot be ingested during battle.  Not so much of a deal breaker except you don't know when battles will take place other than a couple of instances where the protagonist bellows to the effect that his medallion is active.  The number of times I had to reload a prior save to ingest potions before continuing destroys the continuity of this game.  I've read the developers reasons were to the effect that they ran out of time to implement toxicity or some other nonsense.  Deal breaker and a proper mention to the often non responsive combat controls. 

Game design is practically a disaster.  I wrote a detailed guide for new adventurers almost 10 years after the fact detailing significant issues in an important encounter.  You will find the guide in the guide section if you require assistance with the encounter.

Let's talk dice and fighting (hand to hand) matches.  The dice implementation is a huge letdown.  In W2 you manually roll dice where in W1 the dice rolls were automated.  W2 dice rolls can go off the board and you'll not see the dice again though a mod can fix this.  The dice board angle was also changed from W1 for the worse, though a mod can fix this.  In W1 the game told you both your hand and your opponents.  This is lost in W2.  See where this is going.  Fighting hand to hand in W1 was just about perfect.  In W2 the designers made fighting a mini game.  No, this is no joke.  W2 hand to hand fighting is a QTE.

It's wondrous how The Witcher 2 lacks not only the charm of The Witcher 1 but its forebear's design as well.   I miss just about everything that made The Witcher 1 the classic it is.  There are only bones here, not a true sequel.  Thumbs up for a play through but for all the wrong reasons.

Tip: For more seamless combat develop macro's for the signs.  Select sign and use sign and bind to either your keyboard or mouse depending where you bind your sign keys.

A big improvement in this game is the combat, much more modern and fast, but it is very punishing and the biggest problem is that Geralt has a wide range of animations for fast attack and another fr strong attack and the game decides which one to choose RANDOMLY! That means getting hit because the animation chosen was not the one the player wanted.
The fact that you can import your decision from the first game to this one is SO F****** COOL! Makes you feel that you impacted the world and now is just following the story that you began, it really feels amazing.
The story is a great mystery with a lot of thing to discover, and twists to unravel, all in all a very good story that feels grounded in this universe but still it is not as memorable or as good as the first one. It's definetely not bad, grandier and with more worldly impacts but less personal in a sense.
The music and sound keeps the same beat (hihi) as the first one. The voice-acting in this series is top notch and every character feels himself in this universe.
The graphics are the second biggest improvement, with more money to spend after the first one the team could focus a bit more on this aspect and makes this game a lot better to watch and appreciate.
The biggest improvement is definetely just a well rounded more polished game, a lot of risks were taken in the first one, and a lot could just barely be done to be noticeble, in this one all of them were continued and had much more time to develop, the details of everyday life or simply what already exists and will keep existing after geralt are what makes this universe so appealing.",1602221799,1602221799,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game is about Geralt trying to clear his name for a crime he didn't commit, basically. (I won't spoil anything).

 The graphics are really, really good when compared to the first game but there are some optimisation problems unfortunately. I highly recommend you to turn Ubersampling off if you don't have a powerful graphic card, I have a GTX 1660 Ti graphic card and the game's frame rates dropped to 50 FPS (sometimes 40) when the Ubersampling is turned on, (in The Witcher 3, I get stable 60 FPS on ultra graphic settings. When the V-synch is turned off, I get even more.). 

The combat is really enjoyable, it's like The Witcher 3's combat system in a sense but also unique and the finishing animations are really good.

 I also really liked the fact that they really enhanced the game in Enhanced Edition, I have this game also on Xbox 360 (it's not Enhanced Edition) and it's horrible; lots of bugs, horrible graphics when compared to this one, lack of animations and countless other things I don't remember.

- Camera controls during combat (playing with Xbox controller); 
- Delays in combat caused by long and inconsistent animations;
- Linux port is trash. If you have a modern graphics card, it is actually better to run the game through Proton! Also, remember to regularly delete old save games due to memory leak issues.
- Too many graphical effects ruin the aesthetic for me. Thankfully, it is possible to disable them in the menu (not in-game).

The story needs proper understanding of characters and continuation from the ending The Witcher 1.

The difficulty of The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings comes from just being designed to be difficult.

[b]2 Cents[/b] 

I was already invested in the Witcher lore because of the first game before I began to play The Witcher 2 - which picks up exactly where the last game left off. When I started the game, I was greeted by pretty mediocre mechanics and I wasn't sure if I was gonna like it as a game of its own. I was playing it solely to precede my gameplay of the Witcher 3. 

But boy, did this game come off as a fresh of breath air. The beginning had an AC Brotherhood kinda vibe - which is still among the most memorable beginnings of a game for me. It didn't take very long for the game to pick up, and I'm going to try very hard not to spoil something substantial which happens within the first hour of the game. 

This game follows Geralt's journey as he tries to prove himself innocent of a crime that has smeared his name across the continent - while also getting torn between a nation in the brig of civil war. The story is actually one of the best stories I've seen in a video game - and it doesn't hurt that the gameplay is actually pretty fun and challenging. [I played at Hard and plan to have a second playthrough on the hardest one available]

I loved the monster-hunting side content as well - whether it be looking for Endregas in the woods surrounding Flotsam or wading through the dark caves of Velen. There is a pretty decent variety in the kind of maps you play in, and the missions you do. I wasn't expecting to like this game so much when I began playing - but the lore and the environment successfully manage to submerge you in the world. 

The game is divided into three chapters, and one of the most surprising things in the game was at the end of chapter 1. I'll refrain from spoiling much - but you get to chose to side with a particular group in this civil war. They are not necessarily the polar opposite sides fighting each other - and none of them seems to be philosophically or morally better than the other. This is another incredible thing about the game, of how it keeps every character in the gray area. No one is right, and no one is wrong. Minor spoiler below.

[spoiler] So, what you chose during this point can send you to two completely different storylines. You get two games to play at the price of one, to be honest, and I've already planned to replay the whole Witcher series with a different set of endings and consequences. I decided to go with Iorveth because it felt very natural. I was having a peaceful meeting with him when Roche decided to attack without an afterthought. I handed Iorveth his sword, and it felt very natural joining him considering even Zoltan - one of my closest friends has decided to side with the Scoia'tael. I didn't regret it seeing how beautiful Velen was, and it was pretty fun doing the side missions available there and hanging out with a goofy group of dwarves. But I did feel as if I should have gone with Roche this whole time. He got me out of trouble at the very start and even helped me when I chose not to side with him. Definitely going to see what his side of the story had to offer in my second playthrough. [/spoiler]

Even as a standalone game, it is an incredible experience - even though I would suggest following the lore. Watching the Game Movie of Witcher 1 helps to catch up with everything that happens before this game, and gives you a very required introduction to the series. I suggest this because I know that the first game can be clunky and is not for everyone. 

Take your time to do side missions, they are fun and well worth it due to the upgrades and prizes they carry - get immersed into the world of The Witcher.

Story is amazing in this game, however...:

WARNING: the Saving System is absolute garbage: keep track of your saves and delete them every 10-15 minutes or so because if you don't, with the game autosaving at every door location and you clicking quicksave ever so often, you WILL have around 500-800 save files, in a couple of hours which will eat up your storage space (especially since every save also creates a jpg image of the screenshot as well). This happens on the Steam Cloud, and as far as I'm concerned, there is no way to prevent the game from saving to the allocated Steam Cloud space.

When I first started I found the combat system in Witcher 2 quite difficult to get my head around and found the arena-style tutorial quite difficult as I was also taking in a lot of other information too. However, after a while I really got into it, and I can say it's a definite improvement on the banality of Witcher 1 gameplay, making sword fights far more tense and requiring some actual skill. I played on normal mode as I'm not a great tactician, but I can see how this can be a good challenge for many players.

The story is an interesting contrast to Witcher 1. I haven't read the additional source material or watched the recent series at the time of writing so I have nothing to compare it to other than my expectations and I have to confess that the first Witcher game seemed closer to my expectations than this one - it's more about travelling around hunting monsters and exploration than this. I have to confess the plot regarding the assassination of kings was the least interesting one in this game and I wasn't particularly excited by massive battle scenes either.

The skill tree was also a little confusing at first compare to Witcher 1 but I soon got into it with the exception of the lack of mutagen options. Instead of mutagens being the end of the skill tree like Witcher 1 which you gain by creating and drinking specific potions, they are now attached to upgrading specific attributes which have a mutagen slot. This meant that due to my choices I only ever had one mutagen in the whole game. This seemed like a missed opportunity when it could have led to some interesting skill combinations if it had been thought of more creatively.

There's also a clearer sense of choosing two very different paths earlier in the game which makes for increased playability to my mind than the first game which largely involved deciding on three particular alliances later in the game. Witcher 2 gives quite a distinct experience in terms of story and quests based on the paths you take.

I still have a couple of unresolved issues which the story itself. I really don't understand why someone like Geralt would be so concerned to show deference or give assistance to kings, for example, but this didn't make sense in the first game either. All in all, however, it held together better than that in Witcher 1 with a much clearer narrative so it's a definite improvement. I'm also curious as to why a game which can include magic and dragons, can't stretch its imagination to include anyone who isn't caucasian - we know the Romans had many different ethnicities and there was plenty of trade between African and the Far East and Europe so even if this is meant to be Medieval there's no way everyone would be white.

Also decided for Witcher 3 that in order to up the difficulty I'm going to try as far as possible to live the life of a eunuch. There are far too many women who you can accidentally end up sleeping with simply by choosing one conversation option. I feel celibacy is the last real challenge for Geralt.

On the whole, really enjoyed everything except the stupid cutscene at the start of the game which you have to skip every single time you boot it up!",1600533934,1600533934,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Let's not forget that time when Witcher 3 GOTY was on sale for 14,99 euro/dollar on Epic Store. And Epic offered coupons of 10 euro/dollar for each game costing 14,99 or more, so we could effectively get Witcher 3 GOTY for 5 euro/dollar. And the coupons were covered by Epic, so CDPR would get the same amount of money, whether we paid 15 or we paid 5 and Epic paid 10. However, CDPR forced Epic to lower the price for one cent, so the price was now 14,98 and not eligible for the coupon anymore, so we couldn't get it for 5 anymore, but we had to pay full 15.
I repeat, CDPR was at no loss here because they would get the same amount of money either way, probably even more if the game was eligible for coupon, because than more people would bought it (me included). So they did it out of pure spite. 
Remember this next time you want to give your money to CDPR. 
Unfortunately, I bought Witcher 2 before all that, so I couldn't refund it anymore

And now on to Witcher 2 itself. And what an utter piece of crap it is. 
It's supposed to be an open world game, yet it is not. You are tied to one small area and you can just go back and forth within that area. I played just the first part, but I assume later you move to the next small area and it's the same.
Navigation is awful. Game is full of invisible walls. You can't go through slightly taller grass or jump below from small height, if the game doesn't want you to. I guess the game would take half the time to complete, if the walking/running wasn't so slow and you wouldn't suffer so much to find the right path that you are allowed to go through",1600508774,1600509385,False,1,0,0.438295543193817139,0,True,False,False

-Gameplay is good. Nothing much to say here. It is a bit of a downgrade from Witcher 1 where exploration was a rewarding gameplay mechanic. Here it is very toned down.
-Combat is shit. It does not work. It's broken. It may lead you to believe it is good but no. I completed this game twice on hard difficulty. Hit detection is shit, dodge roll doesn't dodge the attacks. Potions are toned down, and signs are to. Overall a major disappointment.
-Graphics are actually great for a 2011 game.
-Encountered some minor bugs here and there. Performance is really good. No complaints here.
Overall, even if I have some problems with the game I freaking loved it. Iorveth's path gives you a lot of story, while Roache is just a bro. I love his character so much!

I'm incredibly glad I did not skip this game. The story in Witcher 2 is very well done, with rich voiced dialog and a plethora of morally gray situations Geralt can get involved in. Not to mention some great plot twists! The telling of the story itself is fairly complex, with several branching paths you can take (including a branch fairly early on that will tell the story from two very different perspectives.)

Combat is fairly fluid with some sword play mechanics (the ability to parry and riposte) as well as the ability to dodge or throw knives/bombs. You have what amounts to a stamina meter which drains with each parry/riposte, so you can't block forever. The same goes with Signs, too. This limitation forces you to be strategic in combat, so you can't dive into mobs of enemies and expect to make it out alive, especially early in the game before you get some decent armor and weapons.

Character progression is straightforward. Each time you level up, you can spend your points in one of four branches (Witcher basic training, Swordsmanship, Alchemy, and Magic) and effectively build Geralt to suit your play style.

I played this after completing The Witcher 3 and I think I love this game more than TW3!

The monsters design, the location, the characters, even the graphics somehow seem more interesting and apt to the game lore. 
The monsters look terrifying in this game! Idk why they changed the models in the next game, they don't look that scary anymore when I started playing it again (Except for the arachnids) 
The story is great. It ended pretty quick though, thought there'd be more backstory in this game, but nope. I just wish there was more exploring to do. I finished the game in like 34 hours (playtime) on normal. I didn't really need to upgrade my equipment at all. I was saving up money to buy the best one nearing the end, I never got to!

The 3 games left me wanting more. I'll read or listen to the translated Sapkowski's books now, and also play The Witcher adventure game XD

And I highly recommend immersing yourself The Witcher 2 before proceeding on to The Witcher 3 for another momentous yet intense journey with our beloved characters once again. If you have enough time it is worth playing all games in the franchise [witcher 1,2,3] as the story connected to each other. 

Here are what I like and dislike about The Witcher 2. 

[b] Story [/b]
+ Very immersive storyline, choice matters so choose carefully 
+ Very well-written storyline, they had done a thorough research indeed 
+ For someone who said the game is too short it's definitely not, basically you need to play the game twice in order to get the full story 
- Too many names and places that I can't really remember lol But being a fantasy RPG game one must know this is the typical problem. It doesn't really matter though but if you need to know every single thing that is going on you probably need to listen to the dialogue twice 
- Everything is on the dialogue and journal. It's an old school rpg so this was pretty much expected, but sometimes you might got info dump pretty easily 

[b] Gameplay [/b]  
+ Vast improvement from The Witcher 1. The gameplay is now more interactive and action-packed, unlike its prequel that you need to timely click 
+ Signs and items (bombs, traps, throwing knives...etc.) are more easier to use with a shortcut 
+ Camera angle is fine 
- I just hate the potion system that you need to drink before the battle, you can't do that during the battle anymore which is frustrating cause sometimes you don't know when and where you might need the potion 
- The inventory interface. It makes finding stuff more difficult when you divide it into categories like this I prefer the old one in The Witcher 1 where the items are more clumped 
- I don't find the side quests interesting enough to do 
- Unstable FPS + Constant map loading in a certain scene 

[b] Graphic [/b]  
+ Massive development from The Witcher 1 
+ Beautiful cut-scene and animation. Animation is a great improvement ! 
+ Less reusable character models 
- The graphic is too bright and vivid it gave me headache, need to be adjusted 

[b] Sound [/b] 
+ Memorable ost 
+ I love that they blend the local folk song into the music, it really gives the exotic Polish vibe",1600073012,1600073012,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

DIFFICULTY:HARD
To be honest this isn't a great game.
It's a very good game and it falls just short of being great.
It's shortcomings are mainly in the gameplay.
For one thing the combat doesn't feel satisfying.
I did not have fun hitting a single enemy hundreds of times,slowly chipping at their health bar.
You don't even feel like you just cut them with sword.
On the contrary most of my opponents were able to kill me in three hits.
Potions do help with this,but the most important and prominent potions usually require one rare alchemical substance and it's hard to come by.
If you want to use these potions you have to look for this ingredient for a considerable amount of time.

The story and the way it is presented is very interesting and very good.
It got me playing through the clunky combat to see the rest of it.

In addition to that this game has character.
Most of the NPCs I met I liked.
Some I've hated.And that was likely the point.

Side Quests are interesting and but when I say this,do not expect a Witcher 3 level of writing.
The voice acting was okay.
I've encountered no bugs or glitches during my playthrough.

I give this game a 7/10.

After a few hours of gameplay it just feels like a chore to play. The game has it's moments for the first couple of hours, but that's about it. The most fun i had was gambling and fistfighting in bars, which isn't saying much. The combat is terrible, where you get bombarded by several enemies at once and a non-functioning targeting system which in my experience served to only get me killed several times. Playing on the hardest difficulty was a mistake. I love to challenge myself to play games on the hardest difficulty, but this is not one of those games as it is so bugged. I realize i have an excessive amount of hours to write a bad review but about 50+ hours were on my old laptop that couldn't even run the game so I inevitably gave up and honestly I wish I had just left it at that.

-story all over the place, characters one dimensional and not interesting in the least, voice acting is pretty damn cringe that I'm always hitting skip once I read the dialogue

I am happy to say that after quitting halfway through the Witcher 1, in my eyes a very flawed and inconsistent game, I gave the Witcher 2 a chance. This game turned out to be fantastic. About 30 hours of fantastic story telling and difficult to make choices that radically change the final outcome of the story, and influence the fate of many of its characters throughout. 

All in all, a fantastic game with incredible story and very good combat and rpg elements that you shouldn't skip if you're a fan of the witcher series.",1599935299,1599935299,True,1,0,0.518072307109832764,0,True,False,False

Thought about playing this again so got it about a week ago on Steam, and dear god... it still looks absolutely fantastic, but dare I say I enjoy this more than Witcher 3. The character movements aren't so robotic, they move so smooth and natural. I mean that as in during the cutscenes or during dialogue scenes. Witcher 3 had about three different emotes: that explosion thing with their hands, a hand outreaching, and a shrug. I love Witcher 3 but I doubt even the biggest fan could say that Witcher 3 has any environment that is more detailed than Witcher 2. I mean christ, the forest around Flotsam, although not as large an explorable area as what Witcher 3 has, is far more lush an environment. The tree trunks are huge and the trees themselves reach to the sky. I will say this though, it took a bit to get back used to the different controls of W2 after last playing W3. The spells working a bit different was also a struggle at first. But, I promise once you power though you will have an absolute masterpiece of a game on your hands.

A marked reduction in spicy ""maidens""!? 
Geralt tying himself down to ONE sultry sorceress?
Toned down gambling!?
Ninja Please. Let a player play.

Don't buy this game. It's bad. It is borderline broken and a Got-damb chore to play.

This game has three things going for it: Story, character development, music. 
The rest of this game is a mess. I am going to hit on the major points as there is just so much hampering this title from success. 

Travel:
Geralt is bound by the technology of his time. The entirety of the game play hours is done on foot. There is no fast travel back to the town hub. There isn’t a single mechanism, potion, or spell that enhances Geralt’s speed of travel. The resultant is that Geralt flails about the central township and surrounding medieval metropolis in a frenetic oscillation fetching this, that, and the other to push the story line forward. 

Combat: 
The combat is seemingly unfinished. Geralt swinging his sword does not obtain the results that you would expect given the animations shown. Geralt’s dodge roll, for instance, is only intermittently functional. Likewise, there is no perfectly timed block that can be executed by Geralt.  To block Geralt must hunker down into a static position and wait for the AI to take the hint. You may be given an opportunity to counter attack which may or may not happen if you attempt to follow through. The AI have no such troubles. An AI character can block while moving, block when not blocking and block whilst kneeling. There are several moments where Geralt has beaten a combatant into submission and, is unable to finish the job because the enemy is kneeling and is blocking attacks from all directions. 

The camera angles are not helpful either. Often Geralt's enemies are out of sight of the camera. You may think Geralt is done fighting only to lunge off the combat stage at a set of unseen enemies who have been delivering clandestine beatings from the stage left curtains. This is annoying on normal mode but, unseen enemies in hard mode mean instant death.  

Meditating:
Use of potions are not possible without meditating in part 2 of the Witcher series. This is not the only nonsensical mechanic Witcher 2 has to offer but, it is one of the more baffeling  ones. To this day I have not needed to sit in meditation to take a dose of cough syrup or drink a beer.  The meditation feature should have been better thought out; maybe meditation could give temporary buffs to magic, buffs to alchemy preparation, temporary improved vigor, or negate status effects. 

Leveling up:
The majority of EXP is gained from your quests. In general, combat earns squat experience points. That being said you will gain a few levels from all the running back and forth from town to forest. There are three major skill trees and one minor skill tree. There are a total of 51 skills and each skill can be leveled up 2 times; for a total of 102. Your max level is 35 which leaves you with 34 talents to populate your skill tree. By the end of the game Geralt only can achieve a 33% in Witchermanship. And MAN do you ever feel it.

On a vanilla run of this game Geralt is exquisitely remedial at his profession. Expect to die. A lot. There is little narrative reason for this. Geralt in bread, borne, trained, and neutered for the job of monster hunting. There is simply no good reason for him to suck so loudly. You are forced to put nearly all you talents into swordsmanship but, you will later find out that you can fireball your way out of trouble for almost the last 3rd of the game.

Menus: 
This game’s menus are a god awful mess. The save/load menus are the peak of ridiculous. Instead of having a save game slot that can be saved over, every save makes a new file. If you are like me, you won’t notice this high tech feature until the whole game slows down trying to load all your save files for selection. Do you want to delete the older files and keep the most recent one? No problem. You may delete them…I N D I V I D U A L L Y. 

Buying and Selling is no better. At the shops the buy and sell lists are nearly identical save for the actual items. The highlighting over the item you think you are buying/selling is almost indistinguishable from the surrounding screen. It is difficult to tell who has what, what item is going where, what the items do exactly, and how many items are being bought/sold. There are sub categories of items which attempt to organise items more coarsely for expedience; unfortunately, there is unnecessary overlap of items in each category which results in bloated subcategories of items making the system almost useless. 

The item selection in inventory is equally frustrating. As an attempt to select an item for use may result in you inadvertently unequipping Geralt’s pants or boots, and still not having use the selected item even though the item is highlighted for selection.   

Game play menus are hidden within game function menus. Eg Map and journal are with the save/quit/graphics/audio/controls menu. There is a whole bestiary menu hidden within the character menu accessible via meditation. 

The Economy:
Not only will Geralt be forced to be an incompetent witcher throughout the event of The Witcher 2 but, he will be broke as joke. Witcher 2 sports a savage sell back ratio of 1 to 24. Back in an era where a person could expect to only be able to afford one new set of clothes in his life time, Geralt can sell a sack of magical swords for roughly 20 Orens. Which isn’t enough for him to buy a pair of first tier gloves. The first Witcher had a sell back ratio of 1 to 5 which is much more manageable. 

As with experience, money will come almost exclusively from quests. Combat earns you next to nothing. The easiest way to raise money I found was to arm wrestle. (If that isn’t a euphemism, I don’t know what is)

Inventory:  (FML)
Geralt cannot haul more than 250 lb of crap. Which is strange because witchers need a wide assortment of crap to witch. Perhaps there is some sort of “bag o’ holding” Geralt could employ? NO. Some spell that could help? NO. Perhaps Geralt could hire a mule? NO. But a transdimentional chest that is present in one location per chapter? Brilliant, YES. 

Conclusion:
This game just got worse and worse to play, and by the end I hated it. I just touched on the basics of why this game is awful. I didn’t even get started the dialogue and how much agenda driven slogans are barked at you while you play.  Modifying the game helped with the look, and addressed some of the balancing issues. The game is passably functional once it is modified. I couldn’t recommend this game even if it was free.

The successor of The Witcher 1, The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings, is a 2011 action RPG developed by CD Projekt Red that continues the story of the Witcher Geralt of Rivia. 
The game is a great RPG, with multiple choices and paths that affect how the story goes. And even though the combat is clucky and most of the times frustrating, the story, exploration and overall awe of the universe are enough to make it a worthy experience. 
 
[b]  7.5/10  [/b]

[h1] Audience [/h1]

☐ Kids
☐ Teens
☑ Adults
☐ All

This game contains a lot of graphic violence, nudity and themes such as murder, rape and racism. The combat involves finishing your opponents with gruesome animations were you get to sever their limbs. Many women wear skin tight clothes with giant cleavages.  There are also explicit sex scenes, with nudity and very suggestive audio. 

[h1] Graphics [/h1]

☐ Bad
☐ Alright
☑ Good
☐ Beautiful
☐ Fantastic

For a game released in 2011, the graphics have aged well. Some areas look really pretty, with giant castles, dense forests and ancient cities you get to explore. Each of these locations are very remarkable and full of detail. 

[h1] Music [/h1]

☐ Bad
☐ Alright
☑ Good
☐ Beautiful
☐ Fantastic

I don’t think music was the focus in this game, but some tracks, like the combat music, are really good. It is a certain step up from The Witcher 1. 

[h1] Difficulty [/h1]

☐ Easy
☑ Average
☑ Easy to learn / Hard to master
☐ Hard
☐ Unfair
☑ Frustrating

The game can be considered difficult, but that’s because of some infuriating design decisions and lack of game mechanics. 
Geralt has a dodge action, but he doesn’t get invincibility frames during it and it is super short, which leads to you getting hit even if you timed the dodge perfectly. 
Various enemies, especially monsters, have lunge attacks that are super quick and have perfect tracking. They will literally turn midair and hit you during your dodge. 
From the start of the game, you can only hit a single enemy with your attacks, which makes no damn sense considering the existence of the group style in The Witcher 1, which lets you hit multiple enemies that are close to you. 
All of these three problems come together when you have to fight 10 monsters at the same time and it’s super frustrating.
The game’s animations are also very clunky and slow. Geralt is supposed to be super quick and agile, but his actions don’t really go well together. When you use a sign or item, it takes a while for to be able to attack or even move/dodge, and you will get hit during these pauses. 
The game does gets easier (or less frustrating) when you level up and acquire skills that should be base (like longer dodges and cleave attacks). It gets easy to cheese the combat by doing hit and run tactics. 
You can also use potions and several items to help in fights, but using them can be super bothersome. And items are usually not worth it, as you have to stop to use them, and mobility is key in combat. 
There is also the fact that after some cutscenes or conversations, the combat will start with Geralt getting hit where you can’t do anything. 

 [h1] Bugs [/h1]

☐ Way too many bugs
☐ A lot of bugs
☑ Few/minor Bugs
☐ Useful glitches and exploits 
☐ No bugs

I don’t remember seeing any bugs other than 1 or 2 times an NPC was floating or twitching, but these bugs didn’t affect the gameplay in any way. 
I didn't encounter any game breaking bugs. 

[h1] Story [/h1]

☐ There is none
☐ Bad
☐ Alright
☐ Good
☑ Very Good
☐ Fantastic

The story continues after 1 month from the end of The Witcher 1. Geralt is now serving the King or Temeria, Foltest, and they are in the middle of a siege. After completing the siege and capturing the city, Geralt and Foltest go after the latter’s children, that are being kept in the temple. 
Geralt and the king get separated and upon finding the children, an assassin takes Foltest life leaving Geralt to take the blame. Now, the Witcher escapes prison with the help of Vernon Roche, one of the deceased king’s loyal agents, to capture the assassin, prove his innocence and find out why Foltest and one other king have been murdered ¬– find out the mystery behind the assassins of kings. 
The main plot is really interesting and there are several choices you can make that affect how the story progresses. 

[h1] Gameplay [/h1]

☑ Frustrating
☐ Sleepy
☐ Boring
☑ Fun
☐ Challenging

The game can provide a good amount of fun, but there are some frustrating aspects. Exploring, you can talk to NPCs and do quests, collect alchemy ingredients and explore locations for loot. 
One thing that was made easier from The Witcher 1 is the meditation, that now is accessible without the need of a bonfire or inn. 
The odd thing is that now time goes much faster and (at lower difficulties) you no longer need to meditate to level up. You can only craft potions and items when meditating, but their use is so limited that I had almost no incentive to meditate other than to wait. 
Because to drink potions, you must be meditating, but you can’t meditate during combat. You will have to reload a previous save and drink the potion beforehand or flee combat. 
Also contrary to Witcher 1, potions are much weaker and a lot of times they have drawbacks (other than toxicity) from being used, which further makes them less appealing. 
The combat is super frustrating, as discussed in the Difficulty section. It does gets better later in the game, but even then, comparing to similar games, specifically Demon’s Souls (2009) and Dark Souls (2011), the combat is simply bad. 
There is no lock on to focus the camera on a single opponent and in the end, it becomes a hit and run game. You cast a sign, run up to the enemy, attack him once or twice and then run back, repeat. This also makes the combat fairly easy later in the game (on normal difficulty). 

[h1] Grind [/h1]

☐ No grind
☑ Isn’t necessary to progress
☐ Average grind
☐ A lot of grind
☐ Way too much grind

If you play every mission and kill every enemy, you will get sufficient levels and money to play through the game easily. 

[h1] PC Requirements [/h1]

☐ Any PC can run it
☐ Weak PC
☑ Average PC
☑ Good PC
☐ Very good PC
☐ High end computer

I imagine average PCs can run this game easily, but if you want to max everything and get high fps you will need a good PC.

[h1] Game Time [/h1]

☐ Really short (0 - 3 hours)
☐ Short (4 - 8 hours)
☑ Few hours (10 - 20 hours) [If you focus on the main story]
☑ Long (40-60 hours) [If you try to complete everything/Explore thoroughly; If you replay the game, making different choices]
☐ Very Long (61-100 hours) 
☐ Extremely Long (101+ hours)

Playing though the game trying to do every quest and explore every place, it took me almost 30 hours of gameplay. I imagine that if you rush the main quest, you should be able to complete it in 10 to 15 hours. 
Replaying the game choosing different choices and paths should provide more 20 to 30 hours of gameplay. 

[h1] Game Price [/h1]
☐ Free
☑ Full price
☑ Wait for Sale
☐ Don't buy

Being almost 10 years old, the game is sold very cheaply and goes on sale with high frequency. 

[h1] Tips and Tricks [/h1]

•	Don’t get attached to any equipment, you will quickly find something better. 
•	Mobility is key in combat – always be on the move
•	Unlock and upgrade the skill that gives longer dodges
•	Also prioritize getting the ability that gives cleave damage – there are many sections with dozens of enemies that can easily surround and overwhelm you
•	Abuse the Quen sign
•	Don’t be afraid to spend money – if you do every quest and monster hunting contracts, you’ll get a ton of money. By the end of the game, I had 10000 gold lying around in my pockets",1598740614,1598740614,True,1,0,0.505747139453887939,0,True,False,False

20920,75050503,76561197970552115,0,28,4490,0,4490,1598610665,"So playing this without having played 3. Witcher 1 was garbage. Obviously I may just be playing it way too late, but on every level I really didn't like the game. The voice acting was bad, the writing was bad, the combat was BAAAAAD. There was not a single redeeming quality in that game.

Having said that, Witcher 2 I believe is the game they had in their head as they were making the first game. I think that also includes the players themselves. Like, as the terrible dialogue was coming out of your speakers, there are just these fans who were willing to translate what was happening in the first game into what happens in this game. 

""Oh, Geralt is saying something so funny. It's not funny the way he's saying it, but in my head I'll just force it to be funny.""

So if you really like Witcher 3, and you're asking yourself if it's worth going back, I can safely say skip 1 and just start here. None of the choices from the first one really matter. None of the context does either. You literally spend the whole game struggling to explore 1/3 of 1 town in that game. This is the game that actually introduces you to the kings, lands, and world itself. I also have never read the books, but have watched the show. This game is the one that FINALLY sold this world to me.

So first the good. Story and world building. This game doesn't ACTUALLY have that much in it, but it somehow makes you feel like so much is going on. It makes you feel like each area is bigger than it is, and more fleshed out than it is. It's like a masterclass in believable world building. The characters also feel super fleshed out. If you've experienced other modern RPGs, especially Bioware ones, you know what to expect here. There's less dialogue, but the character work here is still fun and engaging. Unfortunately they don't hold up 100% because of issues in the last act of the game, but there's a lot to like anyway.

So the bad. The combat is bad. It's not Witcher 1 bad, but it's still very bad. It's clunky, stiff, hard to predict. Every 10 battles you'll suddenly have 1 battle where things kind of click and you can see what they wanted it to be. But the other 9 battles are just twitching nonsense. Dodging is poorly handled, parrying is dumb. Getting consistent behavior on attacks is just a frustrating mess. AI is dumb. Counterplay is all over the place. Boss fights are pathetic messes that just boil down to exploiting 1 or 2 of the same strategies over and over. 

The level up tree is just full of traps and bad choices. Like, instead of offering different playstyles, you just have good choices and bad choices. You could make the bad choice and have fun I'm sure if you really tried or are into that sort of thing, but it wasn't my jam. Oh, actual traps are some of the worst attempts at trap gameplay I've ever seen.

This game is sexist as fuck. Like, if that doesn't bother you, or if you actually enjoy that, good for you. I'm giving the game a thumbs up in the end, but this is just a fact. This game is super duper sexist, and if that rubs you the wrong way, do NOT buy this game. Ignore the fans, steer clear. 

Final bad thing, and I think this is an unpopular opinion, but the split path deal hurt this game overall. At first I thought it was pretty interesting. This is definitely the most divergent I've ever seen a story based RPG attempt to be. Chapter 2 on each path feels like 2 different games. 

But then Chapter 3 happens, and it's a steaming pile of garbage. I've played both paths, I know all the secrets, and I can tell you, this game would have been a lot better if they had just made it 4 chapters. Like, chapter 2 is Roche, Chapter 3 is the other guy, Chapter 4 was the finale. 

I think for people who like to replay games, this last negative won't really resonate with you. But for me, I personally don't like replaying games very much. Like, I used to do it more back when there weren't a million games in my backlog. But these days, committing to playing a game twice, especially back to back, just so I can actually experience the full plot... It was a huge turn off. 

ESPECIALLY since Chapter 3 was so obviously hurt by all of this. Through out the game you're striking this personal balance between crafting gear and finding gear while questing or as a direct reward for questing. Then you get to Chapter 3, and the best swords in the game are just lying around on the ground. Like every other room, there's just a dead body with Excalibur just sitting on it. Oh... does this replace the sword I spent 1200 orens on? Oh... Good I guess. Yay. I guess I shouldn't have bought that.

Characters and quests are the same thing. Each town has this arm wrestling challenge. You find yourself searching high and low, in taverns, homes, everywhere for your opponents. Until Chapter 3. It's just 1 guys, and he's just awkwardly standing in an awkard spot. ""Oh hey there, I'm in a Circus! I'm a super interesting character with a fleshed out back story! Don't mind that I'm just standing next to this crate though...""

Everything I said about world building goes into the garbage in the last chapter. There is absolutely NOTHING here, and they've done NOTHING to hide it. Like... Mystic River Quest. I won't spoil it, but that pretty much sums up how stupid Chapter 3 is.

So yeah, I hated a lot about the game. I said the words ""This fucking game"" a lot while rolling my eyes. But when push comes to shove I'm giving it a thumbs up. If I had to sum it up, it's like they had this really unique vision and really just wanted to go for it. They took risks. Many of them paid off, and many of them crashed and burned. I can easily point out 100 things I didn't like about this game, but the 10 things I did like... I REALLY liked, and I can't honestly say I've ever seen some of it before. And that's saying a lot for a game released 9 years go.",1598614224,1598614224,True,1,0,0.494809657335281372,0,True,False,False

You don't have to play this game to start Witcher 3,but there will be some minor changes if you do import your Witcher 2 save files to Witcher 3.
The environment and atmosphere is definitely good enough to make you feel immersed with its unique fantasy settings.
Expect some QTEs that come suddenly,and with the grimey yellow filter on some maps,have fun with your orange coloured UI which you will definitely not miss.
Combat system is a hit or miss,though it's a hit for me.
You might also encounter some translation errors (P.S: Beehive bomb is the same as Grapeshot Bomb).

Pros: Chapter 1 is alright.
Cons: everything gets progressively worse later in game.

Plot is not that interesting, with so much politics.
Level design is poor. Going from one corridor to another. Game feels empty, lifeless.
Map navigation is frustrating. Minimap is useless.
Quest tracking is woeful.
So much running around...
Potion crafting is a waste of time since every potion has so many side effects (penalties) now.
Signs. What signs?
Fighting is lame. But no worries. You spend more time just running around than fighting enemies.

Its a great RPG alone but if you enjoy the lore and characters from the world of The Witcher then this game is definitely for you! It can be challenging in some places and can take several attempts to beat foes but that's what makes it good - you learn as you go and and improve your skills for the next battle.

From the production values to the performances to the writing to the weightiness of the combat, it's just better. But there's also still a bunch of small things that frustrated me to no end, most of which just feel like outdated design.

While the UI is an improvement, it's still not as streamlined as I want it to be. Still have to go through different menus to get the information I need. Like why is the info for monster weaknesses tucked away in the character skill tree?!?? While there are more options for sorting inventory, it's still limited and feels like a mess. All the QTEs are just terrible and unnecessary.

I actually enjoyed how much delving into the alchemy in Witcher 1 made Geralt into such a beast, so I was kinda bummed out how CDPR nerfed it here by giving most potions significant side effects, so much so that I mostly stuck with a handful of potions that didn't have big drawbacks instead of experimenting like I did in the first game. Doesn't help that it was also changed that you can't drink potions on the fly anymore! I get the design decision to make it so you have to prepare for fights, but what made it worse for me is how I also don't like that there are many combat instances where you can just die virtually instantly.

The game loves to throw a bunch of charging enemies at you hitting you from all sides that also deal a ton of damage and lock you into deadly combos. There's a sluggishness to the movement and attack animations that never felt quite right to me, and it's mixed into this Arkham-style auto lock-on to enemies without the snappiness and control. 

There's also dodge rolling that seems pretty necessary for every big fight, and that doesn't feel great either. Never bothered to get the dodge roll upgrade, so maybe that would have helped, but I just didn't wanna spend an upgrade point on ""better dodge"". Although I guess the whole skill tree didn't really have a lot of outright new abilities to offer, so maybe I should have gotten that if that would have made some fights less frustrating. In fact, most of the skill tree is just ""get better stats and mitigate weaknesses"", so character progression isn't particularly exciting.

I'm a little iffy on the vigor system too that limits how often you can block properly and riposte and use magic. Aard is good, I wish Axii were more reliable, but Quen also felt like such a necessity just to get through the tougher fights. Found myself casting it just to get hit again not long after, so I had to run around a bit to recover vigor to cast it again to survive. Even got most of the vigor upgrades, but that only delayed me getting into that cycle. 

I dunno, I just never truly got into a great flow state with the combat in this game, even though i did have a good number of fights that I still breezed through.

The political intrigue, while kind of hard to get into from the start with all the proper names and storied histories, got me hooked enough halfway through. That stuff in the first game felt more contained and easier to follow, but wasn't super compelling aside from the struggle of the Scoiatel. I do think there's a conservative streak to the political themes of the game, even with its attempts at ""shades of gray"". Any attempt at changing the status quo is poisoned by ambition and racism and conspiracy that would ultimately lead to chaos. 

While not as directly male gaze-y as the first game (hey no more cards of naked women you had sex with!), the increased graphic fidelity seems to have also been taken advantage of to show off and leer at women's bodies, which isn't great. And yes of course there's no shortage of women here offering themselves up to Geralt!

I regret not letting the peasants dispense mob justice on Stennis, that haughty prick. Iorveth's a hoot. Saskia's cool (although i wish she had more of an active role) and Philippa's an interesting foil. Letho's... got a strange accent. Thanks for the exposition dump at the end, I guess? 

I feel like Triss is wasted potential in this game. I liked her attitude in the Witcher 1, and I was looking forward to her being more of an on-screen presence here but alas! I really hope she gets treated better in the sequel, but I suppose there's gonna be this whole Yennefer love triangle thing for her to contend with!

I'm guessing I would have liked this more had I played it back when it first released. The narrative elements are compelling, and if I didn't have a ton of other games to get through in my backlog, I could see myself replaying it to see how the story would unfold if I made different choices. That's always admirable in story-rich RPGs. It's just that there's also a ton of small archaic design choices that frustrate me, and comparing the action to other much better implemented combat systems in other ARPGs that I've played since 2011 *cough*soulsgames*cough*dragonsdogma*cough*monsterhunterworld*cough*, I didn't have a great time engaging with the game's demanding mechanics. 

While I enjoyed untangling the conspiracies and navigating the dilemmas, I don't think there is anything particularly insightful or novel about the story that makes the game worth heavily recommending these days, especially when you have to tolerate the antiquated gameplay to get to the good parts. Maybe if you are truly interested in the Witcher-verse and want to immerse yourself in the world and see how you can influence the warring factions, give this game a shot.",1597638994,1597638994,False,5,0,0.476745665073394775,0,True,False,False

-The Witcher 2 is a fantastic sequel to The Witcher, you can see how CD Projekt Red took what people loved from the first games story and incorporate it into this game. Amazing characters, set pieces, paths, etc. This game includes  a prologue, three chapters plus a epilogue. Took me less than 65 hours to complete the game doing main quest, contracts, and some side quest. *Played on Roches Path*
-The gameplay is not SUPER great, but it is manageable and quite fun. The combat is not as bad as I thought it would be going into it, it was fair for its time and holds up well today. The only times where I did have problems with the combat would have to be during boss encounters, the dodging was quite clunky and at times the hit detection from enemies would still hit you from a distance away. Your signs are your best friend in combat, same goes with traps and bombs.  
-The UI could of been better but again, it is manageable after a while of playing. I did not like how you had to go into the meditation screen to drink your potions, it was unnecessarily time consuming. 

From what I have seen, Iorveths path is not drastically different from Roches path so I really did not feel encouraged to go into a second playthrough immediately. Maybe a few months later when I have nothing else to play.

Things aside, if you played witcher 3 or not, it's a good game. The combat feels great, eventhough when you take damage it's sometimes sluggish or you have to figure it out yourself if you did or not. Or in other words, it doesn't feel responsive sometimes. I enjoyed leveling up, getting skills, new equipment, getting better. Gameplay wise, the game is just great. You get to decide what will happen. Things have effect, and there's a lot of choices in the game. Sometimes I felt as if I'm having a big dillemma there, which brings me to my next point. The Emerssion and Story, my lord it's f***ing awesome! it's so good. The story sucks you in and you just can't stop. I won't tell about the story, wouldn't want to spoil anything. However the game ain't perfect, and it also nearly falls short on very good for me, due to the amount of CRASHES. At somepoint you get fastruated. I believe in my 40h game, I got about I'd say 5-10 crashes. And it sure gonna piss you. Another thing I hate, why when I open the door I need to see a bloody animation?! I don't need animation to move through a door, heck EVEN if it's OPEN it does that. It's just ruining for nothing. Here's a big boner, the performance my goodness, it's AWFULLY OPTIMIZED. I'll just put it like that. The game is out for more than 9 years now. And I tell you, my GTX1060 6GB barely handled High on 45FPS, that's right 45!!. Despite it's big flaws in performance and a bit of unwise development choices, I overall Enjoyed the game. And despite it being fastruating at times, I had great fun. And I say it, it's worth the price.

I just have one criticism and that is the map in the game I just wish that the places in the map were named so that it would be easy to navigate through it whether it is for a quest or just for exploring the environment for hidden loot.

This game is the standard that all games should strive for. 

However there are some issues:
The Combat is lacking, really different than witcher 1.
Witcher 1 had stances and more
Witcher 2 got rid of that, made a tree of skills to unlock with 1 skill point per level. capping at 34, the entire tree has 102 skill points. 

Mods:
I would recommend mods to fix those two problems, which is super easy and does not impact Achievements. 

The graphics is incredible and the story is really well done. but if you want some ""common sense fixes"" the modding community has them covered. 

Conclusion:
Overall the game itself is a 8/10 with the mods made by the loving community bringing it to a 10/10 easily. 

The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings is a must have in your gaming collection.

The game has an amazing linear story filled with decisions that actually affect how things turn out at the games end. The story and investigations are well designed, so you won't need a guide or outside knowledge to figure out what to do. The game has diverging pathways that radically change the story. Decisions made at right at the start of the game will change the events of the story 20 hours later. 

The combat of this game is amazing, but for some reason this combat is not applied to some boss battles and encounters. The best combat of this game involves going into battle with prepared potions, specialized weapons, and an understanding of monster weaknesses that has been acquired from investigation and following storylines.  Monster hunting and most bosses require dodging, using signs, and exploiting learned weaknesses. On the other hand, QTE bosses are grueling experiences that revolve around pushing the right random buttons at precisely the right moment. Defeating most QTE bosses is required regardless of what story path is chosen and require complete restarts of the fight if failed.  

 Some quests and side-quests are tedious busywork that don't add much to the story. These quests usually involve gathering materials around a safe area or killing easy monsters that don't require any preparation or specialized knowledge. A lot of this is just the developers giving you an excuse to explore safe areas, but some of this is obviously padding. You don't have to do most of these quests, but most of them have minor stories that are worthwhile or offer good rewards that make up for the lackluster gameplay.

This is the weakest game in Witcher trilogy.

Story is not so interesting as in other games in the series, combat is not so good as in third game, alchemy is not as important as in other games.....

BUT! I still do not think this is a bad game.

I like how your decisions really matter and really change your story. Depending on how you choose in first chapter, rest of the game will be entirely different, so the game has great replayability. I like how quest are different from ""your usuall RPG"". In most other games you would just go and kill bunch of mosters, but it witcher 2, you have to learn how to get rid of them for good some other way then just killing them.

The story is great, intriguing with your choices having meaningful, long lasting consequences. Basically the Witcher trilogy is like Mass Effect done right. You can even import old saves from the Witcher 1 to continue the story as you left it.
There are good characters, some you actually grow to care about. Voice acting is very good as well (at least the English version).
There are many interesting side quests, but it is easy to miss them, and the game does not hold your hand, so you should explore and think, before moving on with the main storyline.
The fighting mechanics are different, and I think improved compared to the first game.
There are some problems though.
The game seemingly randomly prevents you from saving, mostly around cutscenes or scripted parts. Controlling Geralt feels a bit clunky.
There are some bugs, especially around quest scripting that were annoying, but I did not experience any game-breaking problems. There are a couple of misleading or confusing quest objective descriptions, and sometimes quests can affect each other, so you should save often. Some puzzles are annoying and felt illogical. There were a couple of annoying boss fights and QTEs, but generally the difficulty is not a problem on medium. If you want a challenge, you should go for hard.

Also, since TW3 is the opus magnum of the trilogy, it becomes necessary to know what the story is till before the beginning of TW3. If you play that game as your first Witcher game, it won't be as effective as knowing the story of the last two games.

Also, the end of this game transfers to the beginning of the next one.

Graphics have, i must say, aged well. Not very well. But well enough. It's like playing TW3 at low settings

Combat and movement is way better than the first game, but not near as good as the third one.

There is definitely a good replay value as it is impossible to play all the quests and know all sides of the story in one playthrough. I have only now completed it once, but don't really plan on picking it up again any time soon, but that might be because TW3 is waiting in my Library

Where in Witcher 1 you had to learn the logic of how the combat mechanics work in the game, in Witcher 2 there is hard to find a logic. There seems to be some sort of automation on which target Geralt locks on, unless you use the locking mechanism. Say farewell to fighting multiple enemies at once (at least in the beginning of the game), as Geralt jumps about the battlefield and you're left to guess where he lands next. When you attack an enemy, and see him attacking you at the same time, Geralt simply can't change the selected course of action, even under the direct order from dodge button. Best description I can muster for the combat is (mockingly) real-time turn based. You start an attack, see someone attacking from the side and decide to abort and dodge. That will not happen. Instead the attack is carried through until someone hits you and you stop. And then someone else hits you as well.

[h1]Story[/h1]
Set in the fantasy world of the Northern Realms, The Witcher 2 takes place not long after The Witcher.  An integrated save reading system will actually take your save file from the prior game and apply the consequence of the actions you took in that playthrough to the world of The Witcher 2.  None of those choices will serve the main plot of the game but they do help to personalize the world.  After an assassin nearly killed Foltest, king of the country of Temeria, Geralt of Rivia finds himself hired on as a personal bodyguard to the cautious monarch.  Geralt is a mutated superhuman and monster hunter by trade, preferring to march through the wilds of the world in search of paying work, but refusing a king's demand for service is often not wise.  Unfortunately for Geralt, though he was successful in stopping the first assassin, the second strikes far luckier and manages to frame Geralt for the regicide in the process.  Thrown into the nearest dungeon for interrogation, Geralt convinces his captors that he is innocent and is tasked with bringing the true king slayer to heel in order to clear his own name.  What follows after this point is very open to the player's decisions.  In many ways, AoK's story is a bit haphazard.  It's clear the writers wanted to both tell this large overarching tale of political intrigue and world changing magical events that the witcher has a hand in while also wanting to let Geralt do his thing: that thing being the slaying of monsters and breaking of curses in exchange for cold hard gold.  To this end, the game's main quest is often road blocked by fascinating but unrelated events that waylay Geralt's journey and while this makes the story feel pretty scattershot at times; enough of the overall narrative is woven in to each phase of the game to help keep the end goal in focus.  The tale has many twists, turns, and betrayals and even more impressively, effectively has two completely different stories to tell depending on choices made in the game's early chapter.  Friends become foe and vice versa and the strong characters are entertaining and likable if crude to the point of being obnoxious at times.  Perhaps the biggest knock against the game's story is that it ends inconclusively and feels very much like a middle act of a larger story that is begging for more closure than what is offered here.  Still, it's an entertaining ride chalk full of extensive lore and  narrative suspense.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
Easily the weakest link in the game, the gameplay of The Witcher 2 is divided between dialogue, exploration, combat, and minigames.  Exploration is pretty simple.  Geralt can mostly only really run around, but certain ledges can be scaled or leapt and weak walls can be knocked down with a magical shove of Geralt's Aard sign.  There's a massive variety of things to be found in the world from plants and alchemy ingredients as well as cash, weapons, armor, crafting supplies, and more.  Dialogue is the backbone of the game's story but many choices made in the game are actions the player chooses to make or not.  Combat is the meat of the game but sadly it's a bit rotten.  Everything the combat needs for success is here but lacking heavily in polish.  Geralt carries two swords on him at all times: one steel for creatures of the world and one silver for monsters and magical beings.  Pulling out the right sword for the right enemy is a rather brain dead operation as the two types of enemies almost never intermingle; a missed opportunity to be sure.  Geralt's swords feature light and heavy attacks for hacking away at foes while a dodge roll allows him to quickly escape danger or reposition for a new strike.  Magical signs can be used to stun, knock down, burn, and even hex opponents, and Geralt can find, buy, craft, or create an entire slew of bombs, throwing knives, traps, and deadly blade oils.  Potions can be concocted and then downed before battle giving a variety of buffs, often with drawbacks for the more powerful varieties.  Finally, Geralt levels up over time and points can be spent on his sword craft, magic, or alchemy skills.  Unfortunately the level cap is quite low and it pays much more to focus on one of these trees than to scatter points only midway down all three of them.  Even more unfortunate is the fact that, despite all of these wonderful ingredients, the combat fails on almost all levels.  Enemies come in a massive variety from regular humans of varying equipment and skill to swarming nekkers, hulking golems, and gargantuan boss enemies.  Geralt, although somewhat fluid, can often be awkward to control and many of his abilities seem at odds with their intent.  His Axii sign can turn enemies into allies, but the only time this is worth using is when fighting several at once, but the only way to use it is to stand still for several seconds while they descend upon you with violence as you try to hex a single of their many friends.  Janky animation will often see knocked down enemies standing right back up and already swinging or stunned mages managing to cast spells anyways.  Disgustingly massive hitboxes can cause enemies swinging wide of the mark to tear hefty chunks out of your health all the same.  All told, the game is best played on the Normal difficulty.  Anything higher is just putting yourself at the mercy of the buggy animations and insane enemy attacks.  The game is already tuned to be hard, and were it more polished, it has everything in needs to be a challenging but fulfilling combat experience, but alas this isn't the case.
Oh, and the fist fighting minigame is a joke even less interesting than the arm wrestling and dice poker.
The game also includes an Arena mode that spans several waves of increasingly difficult enemy compositions and would clearly be a lot of fun were it not hindered by the game's janky combat.

[h1]Presentation[/h1]
Good heavens these environments.  The Witcher 2's world, especially its nature environs are dense, colorful, well lit, and just beautiful.  It's honestly hard to describe just how genuine, ancient, and thick the forests, fields, and rocky crevices in the game feel.  Character design is absolutely excellent for the main cast and even the NPC's while often somewhat samey in appearance, feel personable and rustic.  The music ranges from acceptable to surprisingly head turning, but is implemented somewhat poorly; especially in most of the cutscenes.  The animation work, when it functions as intended, is quite good for the most part as are the sound effects.  The piles of lore entries are all written from the perspective of the game's bard, Dandelion, as are the paragraphs upon paragraphs of text describing each phase of every quest in the game; making them flavorful and fun to read.  It's not without issues, of course.  Level of detail swaps happen on a spectrum at all times so objects, especially foliage, seem to be ever shifting as you get closer or further away.  Smaller shadows are very dithery and the game even manages to include several spelling and grammatical errors.  Furthermore, NPC's often repeat the same, bloody lines again and again as you pass by them.  Finally, the game makes ENTIRELY too many save files.  Instead of having a few auto save slots, the game just keeps all of them, which makes opening the Load menu take longer and longer and longer the more you play.  Still, the game's overall package does far more good than bad and is well worth the minor bugs.",1587646577,1595755352,True,0,0,0,1,True,False,False

this game has so many technical flaws that eventually made me drop it for a while. By having such major problems, I sincerely would not recommend it.

Before I expose my reasons, I've to say that:
[list]
[*]Probably has the best graphics of 2011
[*]Beautiful landscapes
[*]Awesome soundtrack
[*]Remarkable story
[*]Lots of decisions to make that actually have an impact on the story
[*]Good gameplay length
[*]Good voice acting
[*]General big improvements to every mechanic of The Witcher 1 (potions, signs, runes, armors, weapons, etc)
[/list]

[i]Okay, it's an awesome game, so what are those ""technical flaws"" you mention that are such a big deal.[/i]

[b]Constant crashes[/b]
The game randomly crashes for no reason, sometimes after a cutscene, sometimes after a zone load and others just because why not. You may think ""well, then all I have to do is to save every 10 minutes"" but surprise! the game won't start if you have too many save files. And that's not it, neither the auto save not the quick save will work either.

So let's say you have been playing straight for several hours, you've been saving constantly cause you know it sometimes crashes, then it crashes, you try to open the game and it crashes again after the intro, next you delete some save files and finally manage to open the game just to realize that nothing got saved.

Sometimes the save file is just corrupted.

[b]Combat[/b]
I have to say that the overall gameplay is far better than The Witcher 1 yet has lots of issues. Many people has already pointed out that it feels clumsy but that is falling short. The animations are a mess, very often there is no visual correlation between the enemy's attacks and the damage received. The hitboxes are pretty bad, if you roll to dodge an attack, you probably will get stabbed in the back anyways. The enemy's ranged attacks are twice as wide as they look. Sometimes enemies will dodge every single attack despite being cornered and visually getting hit by your sword. The scene hitboxes are inconsistent, in some places you can go through vegetation and over rocks meanwhile in others a single brick is enough to block your movement.

-Several steps back from [i]The Witcher[/i]
-Awful combat
-Way too easy/boring on normal difficulty and in later stages also on higher difficulties
-Importing Witcher 1 saves have virtually no impact

Once again Geralt is thrown into the world of politics. His king is assassinated and he gets the blame. To clear his name he hunts the assassin and uncovers one plot after another.
Every part of the story is great: the assassins plan, the plots in the background, the politics and Geralts memories.
The game has two big routes, each has a unique plot and each gives new information about the overall story. The routes could be longer, even when doing most or all quests, a route takes less than 20 hours. 
The game features several more choices, most of them impact the ending of the game, but apart from that the game is pretty linear. Most quests and sequences have exactly one solution and those that give you multiple solutions are basically ""choose X or Y"".
You can import a [i]The Witcher[/i] save to gain some money and some special weapons and armor (if you have them in the save). Sadly the armor and weapons are not much better than your starting gear, which makes sense from a balance perspective, but it ruins the narrative of these pieces. Better give them to us later in the game instead of changing epic weapons with an epic story to have ordinary stats.

Like [i]The Witcher[/i] its successor features romances, this time with actual sex scenes. The dialogue leading up to the scenes is good and the actual scenes, albeit most being a bit short, look nice. One of them is probably one of the best love scenes in gaming history, you will know which one I mean when you get there.
While the romances are nice, Geralt seems to be a sex addict in this game. He was a smoothtalker and womanizer in the original game, but now he seems to be thinking about sex all the time, even in very inappropriate (not in a good sense) situations.
Also there are less available (and willing) women compared to the predecessor.

Combat in this game is just awful. On lower difficulties it is boring and on higher difficulties it's frustrating as long as you miss some vital skills. The old combat system is gone, instead we got an ordinary one. You can attack, block, roll, cast signs(spells) and use items (traps, bombs, knives).  Blocking reduced the incoming damage from the front and is generally useless until you improve it with skills, rolling lets you dodge some attacks but is of limited use until you buff it. Rolls dont have iframes and combined with a short input lag kills you more often than it helps you (thanks to 200% damage in the back... which also can be reduced with skills). 
Signs are great and essential on higher difficulties, but they fatigue. Fatigue decreases your damage output which unnecessaryly prolongs fights. You can reduce the fatgue gain per Spell by gaining vigor, which is gained by leveling certain skills.
Items are great as long as you have them, they are expensive and crafting is constricted compared to [i]The Witcher[/i]. (needed components are more specific)
Once you have the right skills, fights are less frustrating. There is just one Problem with skills: you only get 34 skill points with max level, with more than 100 skills in the skilltree.
If you get the right skills combat is easy, even on higher difficulties, if you got the wrong ones, you might as well start a new game.
If you play on hard or dark difficulty you will also notice that autosaves are rare, better quicksave every 5 minutes.

Fistfights and arm wrestling get boring very soon, but they are not worse than [i]The Witcher[/i]s fistfights. Poker got worse and it wasn't very good before.

If it weren't for the story, characters and dialogue, Witcher 2 would be a shitty game.",1563451117,1595507678,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I decided to replay the whole series and it is a welcome change from the gloomy graphics and awkward combat system of TW1, which is a good game in its own right as well. The graphics are the first thing to be noticed, but that's to be expected as the years go by. The main draw for me, was the combat. Instead of the antiquated timed system introduced in its predecessor, TW2 is much more akin to TW3 in how it handles combat and just felt more immersive and challenging in the mere fact that it gives you more options in how to attack and defend against your opponent(s).

As for the story, it really is great. The beginning absolutely reels you in from the start and doesn't let go. I won't spoil anything, but the way the story branches at a certain point almost guarantees a second playthrough if you want the full version of events. The characters are interesting, have reasonable motivations that seem to spiral and spiral on, and inspire you to learn more not just about them, but also about the world around them. The game's ending plays out based on your immediate choices in a way more tangible than TW1, imo, and has more immediate consequences.

The story starts out strong and takes some interesting turns, but the main antagonist is not a particularly compelling character, starting with his ridiculous physique. By the end the game has lost or moved away from the initial conflict and antagonist, to the point where it makes perfect sense to just let the kingslayer go. And no matter what you do as the player, the end is quite dark and makes it seem like a lot of what you did was in vain. It's not terrible but a better central conflict between Geralt and the kingslayer could have helped a lot. I compare this to Witcher 3 where the central conflict is much more focused and compelling.

I just finished it, after being released 9 years ago (...) and the game stands the test of time as a solid, mature RPG experience about choices and consequences.

Pros
+ A mature theme and topic where choices play a very important role. To such a degree that after about half way the games splits into two distinctly different sub-plots.
+ Excellent characters whether they are secondary or primary with well worked background and stories.
+ Nicely designed graphics and environments including character and monster models.
+ Very good music and voice acting. 
+ Using gamepad the control is good and battles, after you get used, flow in a natural way.
+ 3 different paths to choose, with distinct skills, variety of weapons, upgrades, crafts and armors.
+ Gerald is definitely one of the best protagonists to appear in a video game.
+ Very clever idea the existence of a [spoiler] non-combat [/spoiler] ending.

Cons
- Technical issues, prominent among them the memory overflow when a lot of saves are stored. Unacceptable not to have this fixed after so many years.
- The global story and politics with 1000 different names are very hard to follow to the point that I failed to understand them. Not that I bothered as I found the stories and conflicts between characters much more attractive.
- Some difficulty spikes, for the example the first time you encounter the arch-enemy the battle is way more difficult than near the end (well, one could suggest this is a plus point as it depicts the growth and strengthening of the character)
- Act 3 seems a bit unbalanced and rather unfinished as you end up finding a ton of armors and weapons one after the other only to realize that the best build has been used for 2 (or 1 depending on your last choice) battles. 
- Preparation is important but can happen only before battle. In many instances long sequences of events lead to battles finding you completely unprepared. 

All-in-all excellent RPG game, very highly recommended even after so many years after its release. Looking forward to play the final part.

2nd, I had to replay the very final part of the game like 6 times until the game finally decided to autosave after your final decision. No i wasn't looking in the wrong location, and yes i know how it orders it, and yes i did have it by most recent. It straight up however did not save, after about 5-6 times it eventually spat out the autosave file i could use to import into witcher 3.

8/10-Great. Enjoyed it more than the original Witcher.

Great:
-Story, very deep and interesting world that is fun to explore and learn more about.
-Combat can be challenging and fun.

Not so great:
-Some combat can be difficult. I gave up and had to look up a way to defeat a certain boss. Not necessarily a bad thing.

Geralt handles like a brick on a string, making basic tasks like walking around town or going through doors very annoying, nevermind moving around in combat and getting stuck on invisible barriers or the godawful forced stealth sections. 
Dialogue has options that have Geralt say things totally different to what's written, much unlike the first game. 
The game has a tendency of throwing you into immediate combat after long cutscenes. Granted, this is a sin the first game also commits. Not only does this leave you annoyedly skipping through if you die, but it means you're forced to flee or take on several enemies that are spawned surrounding you. Given how much less forgiving the combat is in 2, this can lead to pretty much one initial guaranteed death with each such encounter. 
Arm wrestling controls are incredibly floaty, and unfortunately this is required in the main quest if you don't want to give up a whole bunch of gold. 
For some reason, they totally changed the controls from 1 to 2 and transitioning from one to the next is incredibly difficult. You can no longer drink potions without meditating, and the game is stuffed with extra features which it honestly could do without. What's more, many of these aren't explained. The aforementioned arm wrestling is never explained, and many random symbols and aspects of the HUD are also totally unexplained.

Combat, minigames, navigation, HUD, journal, inventory and crafting are all a huge step down from TW1. The only improved aspect are the graphics (which do look phenomenal), and the story and voice acting (from what I've seen - and that's saying a lot). Story and cinematics alone can't carry it though.

A depressing step down from the first game and what I've heard of the third. Don't bother. Just watch a plot summary or the cinematics on YouTube and you'll get a better experience than this.

No visual, sound, physical feedback for being hit. The health bar is tucked away in the top left so checking your health is not natural. Dying by surprise is not uncommon. 

Sword play is garbage. I played for a majority of the game on hard, but the meta is to spam magic and roll around. It's not rewarding to interact with the block/parry mechanic. There is also not a stamina bar, so rolling around cost nothing.

Magic and blocking are tied into the weird combined ""stamina"" like bar, however running and rolling do not effect it. You can use a point of this ""stamina"" to block or to use magic. What this does is discourages player from using both dynamically, and instead focusing on pure sword play or pure magic. The meta is just to roll around and spam igni. 

Quick time events. I'm glad they fell out of favor. 

Boss fights are not rewarding or sporting, one is finished off using quick time events. Another boss fight randomly calls down off map abilities to pumble you, during those off map abilities he cannot be hit. 

This game story is great, meaningful choices are amazing and the graphics standup, however the combat is so annoying, meaningless and unrewarding you feel like it's a slog to get to the next part in the story.

All the chapters including excluding the prolouge first made no sense to me but at the ending where everything came together. it was great, a beautiful story indeed. 
the combat is fun and challenging. The big difference between witcher 3 and 2 is the sign system, here you can cast multiple signs one of the another until your vigor bars go down, but in wtcher 3 you can only cast one spell at a time and you can cast the other only after your vigor bar goes to normal.
but in terms of open world this game lack it. I dont mean to say like there is no open world at all but still the open world is far restricted than the witcher 3. anyways.

PROS:

GREAT STORY LINE.
GREAT CHARACTERS.
GREAT COMBAT.

-You have to wait till combat is over to pick up items, expecting different since this is a third person action RPG. Seems like a waste of time that you cannot do this on the fly, and if a enemy is off screen but nearby, you must find and defeat them
-Cannot level up to max skills
-Books don't show whether you read them or not
-Some locations have trouble interacting with when medallion tingles, and medallion has a small cooldown, which makes finding quest or local items more of wait to highlight them if you cannot find them
-Map is infuriating
The combat is more of a dance, timing your hits correctly and using abilities correctly. I enjoyed this after awhile. The story is honestly not that great.

20920,71614501,76561197970712072,303,39,2106,0,2106,1593065393,"Having heard such great things about the Witcher 3, and having played and completed the Witcher 1 with some enjoyment, I decided to give the maligned 2nd game in the series another shot. This was probably my 3rd or 4th start on the game, with me abandoning my prior runs primarily due to difficult gameplay that I didn't really understand. This time I made sure to use an Xbox One controller and keep some game guides handy in the event that I needed them. I'm glad I did.

The TL:DR here is this - If you've been looking for a ""Bioware-esq"" RPG with branching dialogue, choice and consequence, that cinematic experience with fully voiced characters and lines, and plenty of ""we'll bang"", then the Witcher 2 is exactly what you're looking for. Its on sale on Steam at the minute for a couple bucks and is really never too expensive anywhere, so buy it.

The game centers around Geralt of Rivia, a legendary Witcher (a modified human made to hunt monsters) in a pseudo medieval world that is rife with Game of Thrones style political machinations between numerous factions (The Nilfgard Empire, Temerians, Redanians, Kedwenians, Adernians, rebellions, dragons, elfs, dwarves, humans, sorceresses, and on and on and on). Geralt, using a well worn fantasy/rpg trope, is suffering from amnesia and looking to find clues to his past life, but given the ending events of the prior game has found himself in the service of a king.

The game definitely does not hand-hold on the story telling elements much, perhaps in a ploy to get the player in the same ""amnesiac"" shoes as Geralt, and I sometimes found it difficult to follow who or what the characters were talking about. The game really embraces the concept of ""this character knows you, and clearly has a history with you, but you know nothing about them"". Nevertheless, I felt compelled to keep playing as the plot of the game unfolded, as the intrigue from the GoT style politics as well as Geralt's past were cleverly interwoven to keep the lead firmly in hand pulling you forward. My only critique here is while the prologue and the first two acts are packed with things to do, the game does definitely run out of steam and really narrows the scope for the third act. I didn't really mind however, as by that point I was ready for the game to wrap up and reveal its secrets.

The game also has some entertaining villains, the best kind that possess some elements of nobility and logical goals that just happen to be in the way of what you're trying to accomplish, never devolving into ""I'm the bad guy because every game needs a bad guy"" and always feeding the core plot.

The plot also branches significantly after the first act, where you're forced to choose between two sides of the same conflict. My understanding is you still visit the same places, but get a different set of quests, dialogue, and options to continue the story.

As mentioned earlier, the gameplay had always been my biggest hang-up with the game. This run however, it finally clicked: don't try to play this game like Devil May Cry or another hack and slash, you'll get absolutely thrashed early on. It takes a much more deliberative approach to combat (although it remains third person and real time) involving a attack/block/parry/position mechanic. Dodge and roll like crazy, hit and run, and make clever use of your signs (magical abilities), and get behind the enemy to backstab to turn the tide of battle. Having tried to use the KB+M in prior runs, I found using a controller really suited this game well and felt much more natural to use.

Unlike many of the game's ilk, the potion system is also a bit unique. With regard to potions, you need to consume them prior to entering a fight (potions can have you deal additional damage, or increase you health regen, or even have you see in the dark) and which only have a limited duration (usualy 5-10 minutes). This can be a bit frustrating if you're just strolling around and suddenly get jumped by a horde of monsters. All the same, i actually kind of enjoyed the minute or two of prepwork involved in getting together a mix of potions to consume prior to descending into some horrible place where there be monsters.

In a somewhat frustrating nod to the RPG elements of the game, some very useful game mechanics are hidden behind the leveling/skill system. You cannot use throwing knives until you unlock the skill. You cannot parry attacks until you unlock the skill. Eneregy recharges almost pointlessly slow until you get some skill upgrades. Enemies backstabbing you will eat through your health in one or two hits until you get some skill upgrades. You cannot attack groups of enemies at once until... well you get it. After you've acquired these skills, and gotten some better gear, the game substantially eases up in difficulty and plays more like the hack n' slash you expected than something like Dark Souls.

Technically speaking, the game is an absolute gem. This is basically DX9 taken as far as it could reasonably be expected to go. The game is beautiful, full stop. The art direction is gorgeous. The environments, the characters, everything is richly detailed and an joy to drink in with the senses. The music, sound design, and voice acting are all generally top notch. The game was well ahead of its time, and easily stands the test of time in a way many games do not.

Occasionally, the environments did become a bit confusing to navigate. The gameworld is deceptively small, and to make the game look larger the devs clearly implemented some tricks to make sure that your view distance is always fairly limited (but they were smart enough to do it in a natural way). I also always felt that the game had us linger a bit too long in each of the environments given their relatively modest size, but never for too long. At the end of each chapter, I was always ready to move on with the scenery but was never completely burnt out on it thanks to the art direction and clever level design.

Performance on modern systems is great. Played between my laptop (Mobile i7 processor and mobile GTX 1050; 1080p/60hz) and my desktop (6600K and GTX 980ti; 1440p/144hz). Laptop handled high settings fine with some minor slowdowns, while my desktop was able to crank up to Ultra no problems, buttery smooth. I did encounter some crash to desktop issues on my desktop rig in during some very specific segments of the game (very end of the first chapter and very end of the second chapter) where there were substantially more characters/action on the screen.

So to reitterate: If you like the Witcher Universe, if you've been looking for another ""cinematic RPG"" in the vein of Bioware's Mass Effect in a fantasy setting, if you just want a good game to play and you don't have a bunch of money in your pocket, The Witcher 2 is right here, waiting to be played. By all accounts it has been overshadowed by the mountains of praise the third installment of the game has received, but it is a great pseudo open world game in its own right with a tight story, entertaining characters, and gorgeous graphics.",1593391095,1593391095,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[b]Completed in: 40+ hours(on XBOX)[/b]

[h1]Compared to Witcher 3: [/h1]
[list]

    [*]Same Story/character/mission quality just less of it

    [*]Basically same combat system, but witcher 2 is slower and more animation based akin to dark souls

    [*]Obviously graphics worse

    [*]Not open world, Hub based instead

    [*]Choices at one point give you two entirely different middle acts, which is dozens of hours of content, and different stories/quests and leads to unique endings

    [*]Not required to play Witcher 3, but adds so much in terms of lore and meaning to certain characters as a lot of the cast carries over, but story is self-contained and offers a lot of different experiences you don’t get in Witcher 3 like waging factions and choosing sides, lots of unique settings and enemies, and does tease Witcher 3 in a way at the end, that built hype for when it was announced and actually delivered on it, a rarity rarer than winning the lottery.

The Witcher 2 was a fabulous trip with a great story, good graphics, good fighting system and whatnot. For those who've already played it, I chose to go with Iorveth, and he ended up being my favourite character apart from Geralt. Such a great character developement. The graphics are incredible for the year it was released in, and the fighting system is many steps ahead of its predecessor. This game made me feel like I'm part of that world more than the previous one, not that the first would be bad, it's just that it doesn't quite live up to the next ones.

First of all, a sensible combat system is commendable, but that’s not really why I love this game. Witcher 2 starts you off in an epic battle that heightens the pace of the plot. Compared to Witcher 3, this comparatively short game has a more coherent and more exciting plot. It gives you an insight into the bigger picture, a more complete view of a world that is at its turning point. Although admittedly the plot could be expanded to more than having only 3 chapters, this short yet compact story is the soul of this emotional adventure. From the dense canopy of flotsam to the grand walls of Loc Muinne, Geralt closely follows and changes the fate of this world. As the herbalist in Vergen described, Geralt truly is the greatest contemporary hero of the Witcher universe, and journeying with him in the witcher 2 surely will not disappoint you.

What can I say about this masterpiece. CDPR surely outdid themselves with this game. When it first released, the graphics were astonishing and they still hold up to this date. The story is just perfect albeit shorter than the first game but in my opinion this is quality over quantity! Combat has been marginally improved since the first installment the voiceacting is much more believable and realistic and overall it's just gorgeous! I'll get a bit more in-depth into the pros and cons of this game but for those of you who don't feel like reading a wall of text, tl;dr at the current price you should absolutely buy it. It's literally a steal!

[b][u]Pros:[/u][/b]

- The story: It's a witcher game made by a pro consumer dev, what could go wrong right? One playthrough isn't gonna cut it. You can replay this game at least 2 times and you are going to see 2 different stories branching out in front of your eyes. It doesn't last long but choices really matter and it shows!

- The graphics: To this date, graphics have aged really well. I was really impressed launching this game for another run and seeing it really close to the Witcher 3. They won't disappoint!

- Sound: Lots of ambient sound. I play my games with music turned off and you should try a playthrough without music too! You will notice a lot of things from birds chirping, villagers chatting and tons of other goodies. Granted it does get repetitive especially with NPC dialogues and this issue also appears on the Witcher 3. For the latter game you can use mods to disable random NPC chatter which is a great workaround but I'll expand more on that on the cons.

- The combat: It feels like a different game from its predecessor, the combat is more fluid and if you modify your binds a bit you can also use insta-sign casting on your keyboard. I have used a similar layout to the Witcher 3 and it came really close to it. Other than that, Geralt has a wide variety of arsenal on his inventory, oils, bombs, potions you name it! Speaking of potions.....

- Preparation: Gone are the days that you could chug your potions mid battle, you can no longer consume swallow potions every time your health drops to a critical level. You want to be prepared at all times and think twice before engaging in an area which has unknown opponents.

- Customization: Armors have been improved a lot appearance wise, they feel really witchery and there's a vast variety of armor sets you can acquire. Dark mode also adds its own dark sets which have an interesting questline to back them up.

- INSANE difficulty: Perma-death, you die once your save is ruined. That's a great mode for the hardcore veterans who want to test their mettle in combat. You are going to have to be extra careful and know the attack patterns of each boss and enemy by heart. This mode can be unforgiving and quite frustrating as sometimes you can also die from pretty silly situations (attack missclick, getting damaged during dodges, enemies blocking your way etc...)

- Side-quests: Other than contracts, the side-quests of this game are very well thought-out. They do a great job following the whole gray morality that the series portrays making it very hard for you to pick a choice that feels best, because there isn't one!

- BUTTSECKS: What would a witcher game be without sex? It has less options from the first game but boy oh boy, this game gets waaaaay more intimate with your different romance choices. And even though I'm team Yen.... that Triss scene was something else to say the least back then! (Thank god no one walked in on me during those parts)

- Minigames(?): Some of the minigames are hit or miss. I'll focus on the best one in my opinion:
[u]Dice poker[/u] makes a return to the 2nd game. This time around is more interactive as you can move your dice around and overall control the speed of them, you also run through the risk of throwing some of them off the board if you aren't careful.

[b][u]Cons:[/u][/b]

There's no such thing as a perfect game and sure the Witcher 2 is no exception. Some of the cons can be very nitpicky but I'll have to include them on this review!

- Performance: If you don't configure this game properly, it can struggle even on a high-end gaming PC. The executable itself is limited to 2GBs of ram usage but thanks to 3rd party tools you can make it large address aware and increase the limit to 4GBs! Look it up on google. Another thing is the stutter, whenever changing regions this game hangs for a while to load the next chunk of the map. It can be really infuriating although, if you install the game on an SSD you can fix that issue for good.

- Loading screens: They are everywhere, there are tons of things you might want to explore but you'll think twice before entering every single house in game and waiting a couple of seconds for the loading screen each time you do it.

- Navigation: Unfortunately this game doesn't have a sprint button. You have this really sluggish jog and you have to be really patient if you want to go from point A to point B. Also backtracking will make it even more painful. Most players invest on footwork right off the bat just to spam that dodge button to cover the distance. It breaks immersion but it's the only viable alternative.

- Stealth: Honestly, this mechanic shouldn't be in this game. The NPCs during stealth segments are either brain-dead meaning that they won't see you even if you stand in front of them for a couple of seconds or they have bat echolocation abilities. You can literally turn off all the lights and they can randomly notice you even if you aren't in their line of sight! Another minor issue is when you leave from a stealth area and go right back the enemy markers disappear, another minus!

- Economy: Unless you play on Dark Mode and grind on those sweet dark sets, you'll manage to amass a huge amount of money. By the end of Act 2, I already made 10K+ and I didn't exploit any enemy spawns, I just sold all my junk to merchants.

- No contract bosses: This time around there aren't any special boss monsters you've got to kill. Sure you get to kill a couple of queen endregas in Act 1 and 3 trolls, but those are the only unique contract monsters you can find. Oh and the succubus if you count that one as a contract and end up killing it.

- Fist fights/arm wrestling: They might as well have removed those minigames as they don't offer any challenge. Fist fights at least have a very interesting quest in Act 1 and in Act 3 (on Roche's path) but once you beat your first opponent they become extremely easy. At least the animations are good so I give them that! Arm wrestling is just pointless. I have never, not once moved my mouse during arm-wrestling sequences and I ended up winning. If they made it a non interactive cutscene it could have been more dramatic and better looking in general (the game could check your intimidation skill and according to its level it would determine the percentage to win RNG I know but much more believable).

- Sounds (AGAIN?): Generic dialogues get very repetitive. They can drive you insane going up and down and listening to the same voicelines again and again. Even some scripted events like the blacksmith on Act 1 who is approached by a shady fellow, it happens all the time. Things like that should be a one-time thing and disappear!

[b]- BIGGEST CON!: CAN'T FRICK SASKIA! -5/10[/b]

[h1]Conclusion:[/h1]

This game is just great to play. Your choices matter and they will heavily affect the epilogue of the game. One playthrough won't cut it and this just adds into the replayability. It's a very poetic game and no matter what you do it will make you question your every choice. This game is definitely worth buying even from a player who is not acquainted with the books or the franchise.

On the one hand, the deep, immersive worldbuilding and storytelling CDPR is so good at is here as always, but on the other hand this game confused and frustrated me probably more than any game I've played. The story is given as huge dialogue dumps and cutscenes that reference things you may not have seen for hours, or not at all if you didn't play TW1, and I found myself coming out of cutscenes having no clue what had just happened and having to read the journal to figure out why I was doing anything, and even then I was still confused at the ending as to why I did or did not support certain characters. I feel like a second playthrough will definitely be useful to figure these things out, especially since the entire 2nd chapter can change based on a decision you make at the end of chapter 1. I likely won't be doing this second playthrough because of my second big problem with this game though: the combat. I played and completed this game on dark mode, the hardest difficulty that doesn't have a permadeath function, and my most common mission ended up being ""Game Over! Do you want to load your last autosave?"" I don't mind difficulty for difficulty's sake, because that's part of why I play games, but the combat system is really broken imo and it led to me dying due to random chance or things that weren't really my fault. Part of this has simply to do with the design of battles, with you often being thrown into encounters at a huge disadvantage because you are surrounded by high dps enemies without a group style attack from the first game, leaving you to lose almost all of your vitality before you even gain control after a cutscene and end up spending the rest of the fight dodging in circles like an idiot trying to get a single hit in. It's certainly difficult, but it didn't feel very strategic or lore-appropriate. Potions and oils were pretty much useless as you're so underpowered that a simple 10-50% increase in some number isn't going to make that much of a difference. Even swallow I found pretty pointless in this game because it's regeneration is a snail's pace compared to the last game.
Overall, I'm glad I fought through the combat mechanics, even after I got halfway through and realized you can't change the game off of dark difficulty because of the dark-specific armor sets that I crafted. The actual story and world of this game make it all worth it and after understanding it some more I feel like I'm ready to go into the 3rd game with a more complete knowledge of the series. So should you buy it?

The Witcher 2 possesses all the elements that make a game an absolute MUST HAVE!

Story wise, the plot continues the story from the first Witcher, where you, the famous Geralt of Rivia, is trying to uncover a conspiracy trying to eradicate the kings of the northern kingdoms. 
To that regard, I highly advise to play the first Witcher before hand, as several of the decisions made in the first game are showing consequences in the Witcher 2. Yet, if you are unwilling or simply don't have the time for it, you'll find some recap videos in the ""Extra"" menu, so that you get up to speed on the prior events before starting the adventure. 

The story unfolds itself in 3 chapters (+ an introduction chapter and an epilogue), leaving you with more or less 20 (if you rush) to 100 hours of gameplay (if you are a completionist) to finish the story from both paths. (follow Roche or follow Iorveth)

The characters are very interesting and far more developed than in the Witcher 1, and we get to learn a lot on the world in which the hero, Geralt, evolves in.

[b] Follow the witcher patch [/b]

The gameplay has also evolved compared to the first episode, and is way more responsive. The combat in particular leaves you with a very satisfying feeling of being a badass swordsman, cutting through your foes graciously and stylishly while casting here and there a few signs (magic powers for the witchers). 

You have basically the choice to develop 4 axis, being core competences, swordmanship, signs (magic) and alchemy. Each of those will deliver various benefits and abilities, so youz can shape your Geralt as you see fit.

Yet, some elements of the gameplay have been made too simple IMHO. For instance, in Alchemy, the first game let us explore the recipes and invent some more powerful version of the potions depending on the ingredients mix. Here, you can't do that, you can just do the recipe you have. 

Another simplified aspect is the combat, while being more dynamic, it also removed the possibility to develop a fighting style more than an another, like in the 1st game (fast, strong or group style).

[b] A beautiful journey in the realm [/b]

Graphically speaking, while being a game from 2009, the game is just splendid and can hold its own when compared to more recent rpgs. And of course, you can mod the hell of it if you want to push it further.

Regarding modding, I highly recommend going with the improved textures and most importantly the Master Witcher 2 Redux mod. It definetely improves the gameplay.

[b] Buy it, simply [/b]

The game features a similar style of combat and overall game mechanics to what you're probably used to, and the writing is just as superb as everything else associated with good old Geralt of Rivia.
The game is shorter than the other two in the series but offers a huge amount of variation based on choices made in the game. There are 8 endings, and you would need to play the game at least 3 times to experience everything. The choices made at the end of Chapter 1 make the second and third chapters wildly different.

The game looks pretty good despite being almost ten years old now, but it is not without it's technical flaws. It's still kinda clunky and buggy in some places and overall just not as refined as the Witcher 3 in a lot of ways.
The thing that pissed me off the most was the map. The overall map and the minimap is completely useless. At first I was wondering if this was because you could purchase or find map upgrades, but nope, it just sucks all the way through.
The inventory system isn't great either and the UI can be a little lacking. It surprised me that this game was made for PC first since a lot of this feels like it's more tailored for consoles. 

Also, the game is hard. Really hard. Which I'm not a huge fan of. I played through the Witcher 3 on Normal difficulty but even playing this on Easy there were a few fights where I was stunned by the difficulty. Some people love that sort of challenge in games, especially if you like how the Witcher games can force you to consider the monsters you're fighting (like a real Witcher) but for me, I wasn't a huge fan of the difficulty.

I haven't talked about the story much but it has a very different feeling compared to the other games or Witcher media. The whole thing is steeped in the politics of the in-game universe, and if you're not as familiar with the Witcher world, it might seem a bit off-putting, but if you are, there's a lot of good lore and story development to digest here. Also, this game really bridges the gap between the story of Geralt from the novels and the story of Geralt in the games, and answers the last few remaining questions I had coming from the Witcher 3.

Overall, this game is definitely worth your time if you're a fan of the Witcher, but if you're looking for an introduction to the series I'd recommend playing the Witcher 3 first.",1591645837,1591645837,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

While, it may not be as long and polished as its sequel Witcher 3 it is still a damn good game. I decided to replay the game after a long time wanting to see if it holds up even in 2020 and I can gladly say that the game still stands on its own. The story is fantastic with meaningful choices which affect the game endings and the characters are really interesting and multifaceted. The side quests though short are thoughtful and are well designed. Also the game is beautiful and the graphics are very good even to this day standards. 

The story essentially is divided into three acts with a prologue and epilogue. There is even a story focused tutorial and also an arena mode where you can spend time fighting monsters and honing your skills. Another cool thing is that the second act is essentially two acts divided based on your decision you make in the first act. This adds replayability and both the acts are well designed and interesting on their own.  

Regarding some the cons, the combat controls can be a bit wonky and can be a little difficult to get used to. The lighting in the cut scenes can be too bright and this can be quite jarring when you are suddenly brought back into the game. Also the finisher animations though cool removes the control from you and can leave you open to damage when you’re brought back.

Overall this is a must play game for those who have not played it. If I had to rate it, I would give it a solid 9/10. I thoroughly enjoyed playing this game again and would definitely recommend it!

On to the Review.

Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings is a 2011 direct sequel to the 2007 video game The Witcher. Like its predecessor, the game is based on The Witcher series of fantasy novels by Polish author Andrzej Sapkowski. Witcher 2 improves upon almost everything that was wrong with Witcher 1, and surpasses it in many ways.

The gameplay of The Witcher 2 is a very different from its predecessor. Player movement is accomplished solely through the keyboard, and the much hated combat has changed from the rhythmic minigame style of the original game to a more fast-paced action style. Combat now feels very smooth and natural and is a joy to handle. It also ditches the old game engine with a completely new in-house developed one. To be honest, it almost feels like a completely new game.

As for the story, while it is not necessary to play the earlier game to understand this one, it is highly recommended as there are little references that the NPCs make which will only make sense if you had played the original. The story now feels very cinematic and the whole thing feels almost like a movie. Those looking for a good story will not be disappointed, as like its predecessor, is full of plot twists and intrigues. In fact, there are 2 different branches which you can pursue, which has noticeably different plots and even locations. 

Art style, looks super crisp and sharp even in 2015, and it is still extremely beautiful to behold. Everything from the character faces, to the world environment has been given a 360 degrees complete overhaul, and the  whole thing looks like a fantastic medieval tapestry come to life.

The soundtrack is as epic as ever, but the most improved aspect has to be the voice acting. Gone are the bored actors that sound like they're reading off a script. The voice acting here is top-notch and high quality, and adds alot to the atmosphere of the game.

While the game is undoubtedly a hundred times more improved then Witcher 1,
there are some flaws to it.

The world may give an illusion that it is an open world game, but in reality, you are actually tied to the area and access is blocked off with invisible walls. The game doesn't even let you jump or climb unless you are at specific points on the map. 

Speaking of the map, I find it quite frustrating that the mini-map itself isn't very helpful in pointing out directions to objectives. Sure, I understand that the developers wanna let players experiment and discover by themselves but I feel alot more could be done to make quests easier to track. 

I also dislike that you do not get any mounts or fast travel in the game, and instead got to run on your feet all over the place, which is obviously used as an artificial way to lengthen its total gameplay time. It also doesn't help that Geralt's default running speed feels kindda slow.
Compared to the original game, Witcher 2 is a noticeably shorter game with lesser side-quests lasting around 30 hours or so and feels alot more linear.

This game is also somewhat buggy. Lots of times I will encounter character conversations to just simply freeze, and only a Alt-Tab back to Desktop, and back again to the game will solve the issue.

Overall Rating: 8 / 10
No longer hindered by a dated game engine, this is an excellent sequel that improves upon almost everything that was wrong with its predecessor. Its a perfect introduction to anyone who may be interested in the Witcher saga. While there are some flaws / bugs that hinder it from being a true great masterpiece, this is still one of the best RPG around.",1448360173,1591405014,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Tell an even better story, look better, play better… Which might’ve worked if not for all the issues this game had during the development, issues that are felt throughout the rather messy experience The Witcher 2 is.

They did succeed in making it look better, obviously, but the look actually aged a bit worse due to the colour filtering choices and the fact that for all the looks it achieved, the world feels smaller, more cramped, more boring to look at. Not everywhere, of course, act 2 has few locations that look nice and the opening scenes can be impressive, but most of the game just looks like a mess of drab colours.

It tells the story in a more interesting way, but the story itself is less interesting. It has more nuances, it has some very exciting global implications on the game world and choices feel more natural, are provided in a more personal way. It does bring even more wit and humour from the books, it evolves the characters. And it is the very best thing about the game. Although, it seems, that in Witcher 3 most of the choices are invalidated by events out of your control anyway. Oh and if you do play for story – just go with Iorveth. While Roche path has some pretty interesting (and also mostly invalidated in TW3) choices, all of Act 2 and most of Act 3 will be extremely boring, as Roche gets the most boring locations, quests and dialogues in his path, seemingly mostly due to the fact that this path was developed last.

As for the gameplay… If you play on Normal, it’s not bad. If you try the Full Combat Rebalance 2 mod it might make some things more interesting. If you play Dark mode or something like that, then don’t try the FCR2 mod… Actually, just don’t play Dark mode at all, or any other higher difficulty. Despite some attempts by CDP RED to make gameplay fun, gameplay is mostly pretty frustrating and is either simply not fun, or in some cases maddeningly broken. A lot of ideas, with recipes, crafting and such are just a mess (and Dark mode only “benefits” depend on those). In addition, all those small animation limitations, you encounter everywhere and things like that make The Witcher 2 to be not a particularly fun game to play.

The adventure became a whole lot grander…

Some key points that this game offers:

1.	Every DLC and game improvement is included in the Enhanced Edition.
2.	Dark Mode.
3.	Official Soundtrack.
4.	Game World Map.
5.	Quest Handbook.
6.	Digital Comic Book.

Gameplay & Controls:

For the PC players the game has partial controller support, enough to make use of a controller and to actually enjoy the use of a controller, but for the masters of the old ways the keyboard path is there as well, fully accessible and a wide range of keys for you to make use of.

Under the hood are numerous other settings that can be customized for your experience, such as the QTE difficulties for example. 

If you recall The Witcher 1, it experimented with a new combat mechanic, which at first required getting used to, but we soon master that way of the sword. The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings Enhanced Edition’s combat mechanics have been changed again, this time to a more hack and slash variant, once your weapon is drawn of course. 
The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings Enhanced Edition is a massive step up from the original with a much larger world and tons more to see and do. We still have a Fantasy RPG at heart here and this time around there are even more choices to make as you progress through the game.

Our inventory has also received a major update, giving us the ability to collect much more items, weapons and gear to sell or make use of, a feature we did not have in the original.  We no longer need to use flint or a fire to start the waiting or meditating progress, making things much easier to do on the go.

A lot has been updated and changed with The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings Enhanced Edition, and all in the right ways. CD PROJEKT RED did an outstanding job with The Witcher one, but they went and surpassed that standard tenfold with the release of this amazing sequel.

Graphics:

Beyond beautiful! The REDengine at its best here, providing a fully living and breathing world that comes across as so realistic that one can’t help but find the entire experience believable. 
Every location was given a great deal of effort to ensure that they were created with as much realism as was needed to sell this beautiful work of art. Whether you are running down the streets of a small town, or through the woods the experience is memorable. 

The architecture behind the cities and villages are so accurately done that the medieval theme is brilliantly presented with pin point accuracy, fully creating the atmosphere for you to explore and do your business in. 

The forest and wood areas have received the same amount of gorgeous detail. Woods never looked more alive as they do now. The tree branches dancing in the wind, the rain lighting up the skies as you hunt down beasties, the experience is beyond realistic and so memorable, one easily forgets the cause and simply pause to witness and enjoy the magical visuals that the game presents us with.

And that is far from it all, character design is just as stunning, facial features that change as the conversations mood changes, adds to the already realistic atmosphere that the game offers. That combined with the beautiful character designs makes for one unforgettable experience. This includes not only Important and Key NPC’s, but also general NPC characters, in their own ways they were all uniquely and beautifully created.
We have numerous settings to fully customize how this amazing game runs.

Sounds:

Making matters that much more is the stunning background and sound effects that have been added to the game world. Whether it is the falling rain, or the screeching of a monster in the distance, the sounds are there bringing your game to life in a whole new perspective.

Character voice overs were done brilliantly, on par with the high standard that the game has set for itself. The soundtrack is another winning choice here that enhances the overall experience of the game, whether you are out shopping or tracking down some monster, the music will never fail you.

Replayability:

This game has so many choices for you to make that you have to replay it several times to fully experience all that the game has to offer. There is a total of 16 different endings for you to experience.

MGR Gaming’s Conclusions:
Spoilers Ahead:

The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings Enhanced Edition is through and through a marvel of a game. CD Project Red took everything that was good from the original and used that as building blocks to ensure an even greater sequel.

Let’s face it not every sequel is always better than the original, it is just the way the cookie crumbles, however The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings is the exceptional exception here. This game has breached new levels of beauty, and realism, and that coming from and RPG Fantasy says a lot.

The story line with its numerous choices constantly changes how you play the game; you can make each playthrough unique and exhilarating if you make the right decisions and in return the game will provide you with different outcomes as you play through each act. You’ve never had this much freedom to a main quest line as you have now and it is one stunning experience.

The story itself has been beautifully written and the way it plays and pans out in the game is marvellous and dangerous, every decision has a consequence and more often than not it is that we were not prepared for it and that is what makes all of this so amazing. The game has numerous side quests to add to this already beautiful world and they share the same sense of choices that you will experience with the main quest line.

A new fun past time quest has been introduced into the game, Arm wrestling, granting Geralt another method to prove that he truly is the best.

The levelling system for The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings is a step up again from the original, a welcome and rather easy to get into system and grants you the means to fully customize how your Geralt will turn out and specialize in being a Witcher.

The change in combat mechanics is a welcome sight to any sequel, it might be completely different from what it used to be, but it fits in perfectly with what the sequel offers. The new inventory system is another welcomed sight which adds to the RPG look and feel. As long as we can carry it, we never have to leave good gear behind again.

There is so much more to mention and highlight on, but spoiling all the fun is no fun, experience it for yourself rather.

Pros:
+ The writing is incredibly sophisticated and mature, full of nuance and complexity
+ The story is complex, filled with moral greys, memorable characters, and branching choices
+ The visuals (stiff character models aside) have aged incredibly well with beautiful lighting, colourful locations and strong visual design
+ The game has tons of replay value because of how wildly the game splits after the first act.
+ Played in conjunction with Witcher 3 adds a ton of context to the following game's story

Average:
> The combat system is serviceable, but definitely nothing special.

Cons:
- The inventory system is absolutely godawful, and there aren't even mods to help it
- The map is barely functional, and most times incredibly unhelpful. 
- The story is complex to the point of being incomprehensible: many of the locations and characters that are referred to repeatedly are never seen, and the game doesn't even provide proper geographical context to the larger events. As such, many dialogue exchanges end up as mere gobbledygook, because the player is never given enough information to understand them. This is part of why the game warrants multiple playthroughs.
- Multiple mechanics are straight up pointless: crafting is never needed, because the results are only marginally better than what questing gives out. Traps are useless because combat is almost always sprung upon the player with no time to prepare. These might serve more purpose on higher difficulty settings though.
- Many combat abilities that are defaults in other games (like blocking and dodging) are gated behind skill points, meaning the combat doesn't even become properly functional until a few levels in.
- Some quests are ridiculously obtuse for no reason, giving the player practically no hints where to go.

(For those already on The Path, skip this paragraph, for what you seek is beneath.) 
It's entirely feasible that this might be your first Witcher game. Maybe the 1st game was too old for your liking, maybe you didn't like how it looked or maybe it felt clunky (I feel you there).
Witcher 2 is brilliant tale of a man investigating the murder of a king. It is also covers the story of world war, civil war and inter species war. It is also the story of a character, with many shades of greyness, shades that you choose. For there is no black and white in this world, there are choices, choices that sculpt the RPG character as per your taste, choices that affect the ending, the whole story, and choices that will make you regret for ever trusting your gut. Oh and did i mention, there's swordplay, magic and mythical monsters too? (And sex and arm wrestling and fist fights, if you're into any of them.)

The only downside of this game is that it has a little steep learning curve, when it comes to the gameplay and lore. But surviving through that, is worth it. So should you get it? Yes, a resounding YES. Play it, and then play its sequel, and then  try to find meaning in life post witcher. (there is none)

Did you like the a) Witcher Books b) Witcher Netflix Show c) Witcher 3 : Wild Hunt (if you played part 3 first, like me)
If you answered yes to any of those questions, then without a shred of doubt, you should be playing this game immediately. (Ofcourse if you even remotely liked Witcher 1, then you should be obviously playing this, coz The Path only gets much much better from here onwards!)

To state that the Witcher series changed the way I perceived video games would be a massive understatement. Witcher 2 is but a long, brilliantly structured teaser trailer in gameplay, heralding the masterpiece that is its sequel. Yes, you can play the Wild Hunt without touching this, no harm done. But by ignoring Witcher 2 (I know it's tempting to fire up the masterpiece called Wild Hunt), you make the grave mistake of skipping on the plethora of lore, backstory and character development. Unless you want Witcher 3 to have wooden characters, play this game. (Or play 3, and come back to 2, that's also fine, but tedious)

Not to mention, it usually goes on sale, almost all the time. At the current rate (84 INR), it's got the highest value for money ratio, ever!",1590871278,1590871278,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

A followup to the relatively (at the time) obscure PC exclusive The Witcher, the Witcher 2 Assassins of Kings outdid everyone.  Its world was more convincing than any Bethesda game, it did the morally ambiguous story beats Obsidian made their staple like they weren't even working up a sweat, dialog was fast, snappy and fun in a way a Bioware game hadn't been since Baldur's Gate II.  And it was gorgeous, top to bottom, in ways none of the big western RPG wheelhouses could even approach.

The Witcher 1 was a PC exclusive built in a fork of Neverwinter Nights' Aurora Engine, inheriting all the dreadful quirks of a toolset that never left pre-alpha, jawboned into trying to create a game miles away from what it was built for, in service to bringing to life ideas that didn't quite gel between production value limitations, script translation issues, mountains of bugs (see also: every other game ever built in a fork or mod of Aurora) and mechanics that were interesting to think about but so bizarrely implemented that it's impossible to talk about them in a straightforward way except to say, 'good idea badly put together'.

The Witcher 2 is the polar opposite.  Everything just works, and works so well.  The wonky animations, models, engine problems, glitches, translation issues, sound problems and all that are long gone.  The gameplay is a complete overhaul from The Witcher 1 with combat drawing from inspirations like Gothic and Demon's Souls, with the setting's own nature informing lots of unique spins.  It's not quite the breezy Arkham-with-more-difficulty of The WItcher 3, prep work is immensely important to surviving even average encounters, picking bonuses on level-up is a much more cerebral affair requiring some careful long term planning, particularly on the Dark difficulty.  The developer clearly wanted to show off what their team could do when they weren't beholden to the limits of Aurora and whether it's draw distances that would make Grand Theft Auto V envious, close-up detail that The Witcher 3 had to pare back for the sake of scale, soundscapes that feel expressive and alive and just right wherever the player goes, or future-proof elements like ubersampling it utterly dazzled and delighted gamers and blew the competition out of the water.

It is a TRUE rpg, And I don't mean in the case of only having dialogue options, multiple endings, or level-ups. It is an rpg that makes player choice matter in a way that twists the game so much you NEED to replay it again for seeing the alternatives, like going back in time to change history. A lot of triple-A rpg's fail at this aspects, A LOT, because it is like they need to make bull-crap excuses to work around alterations in the narrative. 

Take Mass Effect for example, you are forced to go through three whole games, some really likable character's die, some political figures get blown up, but what really changes? ""Oh, did Legion die? Well here is Not-actually-legion, but really looks like them although they aren't. Also, here lets see if you did enough to unlock your third ending choice."" It is so cheap and lazy. (Don't get me wrong, I still love Mass Effect. I just don't like it.)

This is why I have come to the conclusion than non-american RPG's are often the most superior. They let your decisions matter. You feel the impact, and the weight of your mistakes knowing you have to continue with it's cause and effect, and feel the satisfaction when your choices actually pay off. You DON'T get to pick an ending, you EARN one. CD Project Red doesn't coddle you with your decisions, and are willing to make you feel uncomfortable and learn from it.

A far more intricate and adult story than the previous game, Assassins of Kings is filled to the brim with political drama, betrayal, romance, and heartbreak. The main story is probably the weakest of the series, but that's not a negative mark in a series known for it's excellent story-telling. The only true weak-link of Witcher 2 when you compare it to its prequel and sequel are a distinct lack of side-quests. There are only a handful, if that, of side quests in each chapter, with the entire game 100% completion taking about 40 hours in my second play-through. 

The combat is far improved over the first Witcher, with a now action oriented combat system most gamers will find themselves familiar with. While not as graceful or effective as Witcher 3's combat system, the combat in Assassins of Kings is exciting enough, but in the end, nothing to write home about.

To say the combat and leveling systems are half-baked would be charitable at best; fights from beginning to end are often boring, unfulfilling, stunlocking slugfests with most combat skills being worthless without heavy investment of points. Most worthwhile gear items are acquired through random loot, with unique legendary blades being found in sacks while items you are rewarded with via quest are supplanted within the hour by the next schmuck you happen to stab in just the right way.  Even with frequent revisits to the journal pages (which are a pain to navigate with a gamepad, but that's just me), the quests are often frustrating to follow, so a spoiler-free guide would be your best friend if you choose to play this.  Crashes upon loading saves are common, and I had to frequently purge old save files to keep things running smoothly.  Bugs occur with regularity, with my favorite being the inputs either not registering or double-registering, so that's a fun lottery to take part in.  The only reason I can think of to play this is to experience the story and setting first-hand, which are okay and unique, respectively.

Critical commands have been moved and in the first hour i saw myself misclicking many many times. The graphics are so far from the first one as well.

An extremely immersive and well made game for what is now a fantastic price (it is on sale atm for £2.24)

Graphics are amazing (especially them boobies) and still holds up well even a decade later.

Story as I said is very immersive and actually choices matter which I always love it makes it so much more personal to play your way.

I absolutely hate Dark Souls which is what probably put me off this game with the swordplay but after a few hours i soon became able to triumph. Admittedly I used only the Quen sign.

Quick time events are sparse but easy enough and did not bother me too much.

It improves very much over the original game, the combat system for instance is replaced with a more action-like pacing, yet it still retains an RPG under the shell.

Unfortunately unlike the first game, it's farther from the story found in the books, but still a better story IMHO than Witcher 3 which was more mainstreamed and rushed. The choiced matter plot device works even better. The significant decision at the end of Act I decides what content the player gets Act II and III, locking the player out unless the player makes a new game afterwards. Provides new perspectives on the story. 
Unfortunately, the sexism got worse. Women as a reward are more ubiquitous. Does not help at all. Significant deviation from the canonic material in The Witcher saga. I'm not talking about the sex scenes though. I'm talking about the damsels in distress in this game. It's easily the stupidest quests in from the first game. The sex animations are same for every other sex scene so it doesn't matter much anyway.

The soundtrack is a more high budget, blockbuster stuff. Great for the most part.

Pros:
- Great use of the best mechanics for choices from Bioware games.
- Brilliant writing. Even better Scoia'tael perhaps. A shame it doesn't matter much in Witcher 3.
- Game is not as slow as Witcher 1. 
- Very good soundtrack.
- Best politics in The Witcher series ever. An improvement over Witcher 1. Witcher 3 simply downgraded the entire thing into a gross oversimplification. Your choices will have no impact on the world in Witcher 3. So, enjoy it while it lasts in Witcher 2 I guess. 
- Very solid story and atmosphere. More brutal than Witcher 1 in some respects.
- Achievements.
- Arena mode added in the Enhanced Edition to practice fighting and compete on the highscore leaderboard.
- Multiple endings. About 20 various combinations depending on choices.

Cons:
- Mediocre tutorial compared to the first game. Uninviting start of the game for new players.
- A good but very flawed try to make sneaking work in this game. It's frustrating, hard and unforgiving. Nonetheless, at least it helps make the gameplay more varied from plain combat.
- Combat still imperfect though many functions from the first game were simplified.
- The endings and the choices from the first game, don't really carry on to this game except for one of the three endings and a couple of isolated situations. No way to input the choices made in Witcher 1 so that they can be in force here if the player does not have the save file. In this respect the choices from Witcher 2 don't have much of an impact over Witcher 3 neither. Only a couple of character encounters. Some quests. That's it. Others are never heard from again. The Scoia'tael are the most disadvantaged in this regard in Witcher 2 and Witcher 3.
- The sexualization of female characters is way too overkill. One can argue that the game strays too far from the source material. But the player has the option of not giving in. As Geralt from the books would have. Occasionally.
- Disproportionally short final Act III compared to the rest of the game, despite a free update with the Enhanced Edition.
- All endings to Witcher 2 are abrupt and appear to be as rushed as Witcher 3 is. Nonetheless they are good if you have no problem with getting Witcher 3.

Story: The story is strong, as can be expectred from a Witcher game. The characters are very well written and you definitely end up ""knowing"" them by the end. The problem is that unlike the first one, this one gets too much into political power-plays and not as much on the main character. This means that the game expects you to know the names of rulers, locations, events etc. before sitting down to play and that can be a pain and can end up alienating the playter who is expected to be emotionally invested in things he is unfamiliar with. there is good story branching which means you can replay it a few times and you'll end up playing a very different game by making different choices which is a plus. Unfortunately the focus on ""witching"" is hardly there. It feels as if Geralt is just a pawn in a much larger world of political intrigue, and not really the hero. Overall I was let down especially bythe ending which is basically the same regardless of what choices you made and how you think you influenced the world, making it feel like your actions didnt matter at all.

The combat: I was very let down by this as well. While it is way more developed than in the first game, there are glaring bugs which made me roll my eyes multiple times. From your allies being completely impassable blocks and much of the combat taking place in restricted spaces (meaning you roll supposedly away from an enemy only to bump into your ally's outstretched toe and get hit anyway) to skills and stats bugging out making ""builds"" pointless unless you know all the glitches and can plan to avoid them. Then there's the potions. Unlike in the witcher 1, here they last for a very short while meaning you literally have to know when you're going to get into a fight to drink a potion. Not to mention that in many fights (including boss fights) due to the amount of cutscenes before ther fight you never get the option of drinking a potion so relying on this mechanic (which is essential to Witcher games) is bothersome. 

The achievements: Here I have a big gripe with the game. If you're a completionist like me you will be gritting your teeth a lot with this one. Luck based achievements to get 5 of a kind in poker? We got that! How about a ""beat the game without dying? We got that! I'd usually have no problem withthe second type of achievement but this game has the tendency to insta-kill the player in a variety of way - for example the floor and crumble under your feet with no indication (near the end of the game mind you), or you can walk up a path near the end of the map and suddenly warp to an insta-kill fog location. Or you can enter a cutscene to fight a boss, with your weapon drawn, only to end the cutscene with your weapons sheathed while the bosss is in mid-swing towards you. And on the higher difficulties bosses can easily one-shot you. Or entering a conversation where picking the wrong choice ends up with you dying in a scripted event. Overall it was not at all well thought-out. 

Then there's the smaller annoying mechanics. You can craft many things, but it is always cheaper to jusy buy the finished material from a vendor so after you figure this out crafting becomes obsolete unless it's for a legendary weapon/armor. The overall flow of the game is insanely choppy. For example the medallion scan mechanic is not bad but in order to use it you have to come to a full stop which takes a second. So if you want to scan an area you have to run, stop, scan, run, stop, scan etc. When you drink a potion you have to do it in ""meditation mode"" which you can not enter at all times. And once you do drink the potion Geralt has to either crack his neck, or wipe sweat from his forehead etc, which is unskippable and takes a few seconds. If you have a build which relies on potions (as Witcher games usually funnel you into doing) this get annoying very quickly. 

Yet, even after all of that the game does feel good. I think it is the story and strong characters which save it. It's definitely something you should pick up, but I strongly advise any future player to enter this playsession armed with a lot of patience. The second installment is definitely not as good as the first.",1589975787,1589975787,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[b] Story [/b]
I haven't known this game before Witcher 3, but I'm glad I finally did take the time to play it. The story is amazing and even better than Witcher 3 in my opinion. Player's decisions really impact the story. Depending if you choose to side with Roche or Iorveth, it will take you to a different area with different story arc/quests/characters. I played a few times to try all the choices. Game is relatevly short but it's the rich story that makes it so good.

[b] Visuals/Sound [/b]
Huge improvement from Witcher 1. Visually, it's really impressive and beautiful. Only one downside is performance. I had random crashes and lags at some areas. But it's still a great game to take some beautiful shots.
Voice acting is great, and music - well, it's witcher. 10/10

[b] Combat [/b]
Combat is a big improvement from Witcher 1, but it's still clunky and you can die randomly just from one hit especially early in the game when Geralt doesn't have enough stamina to block all attacks. But it gets better as game progresses and it has a lot of options.

If you're thinking about purchasing this, know that to get the most out of this game you need to be prepared to fully immerse yourself in the experience and pay attention to what is going on. This a game which deals with many adult themes such as politics, racism and sex to deliver a mature and complex game supported by rich lore and stunning visuals. 

The writing and storytelling is exceptional throughout and the moral ambiguity and choices are second to none. The gameplay, in particular the combat, is an acquired taste but offers a refreshing level of depth and potential for improvisation when compared to games in a similar genre. Sound design and voice acting is also of high quality, with the environments coming to life through impressive visual and audio support and characters each sporting distinct personalities and prejudices.

It is also worth mentioning that if you have played the first Witcher game, your choices and gear will be reflected via an imported save in The Witcher 2, however the choices have limited effect and it is not necessary to play the first game to enjoy the second (however you will be at a slight disadvantage in some situations).

In my honest opinion the experience as a whole is unparalleled, and The Witcher 2 is easily the most enjoyable and immersive RPG I have played in recent memory. I would also advise reading the books by Andrzej Sapkowski as these offer an interesting insight into the protagonist's past. But back to the game, overall I would highly recommend The Witcher 2 to anyone with at least a passing interest in the RPG genre, it is the definition of a complete gaming package with spectacular production values and a lasting impression.",1385473501,1589803893,True,898,1,0.939356148242950439,4,True,False,False

My intention was to play the Witcher 2 to understand the story before playing the Witcher 3, the game was really fun. I spent all this time on it.
in the span of 6 weeks, I'v seen all the endings, and I've taken every possible path, I've had multiple playthroughs including one without any side-quests (only necessary ones to get the main story completed), every run I encountered something unique that I see for the first time.

It shares some of this roughness with its predecessor, [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/greatjon_umber/recommended/20900/]The Witcher, which I find to be so rough as to be almost unplayable nowadays[/url]. The Witcher 2 had similarly convoluted, poorly designed levels which make it a chore to navigate to and fro while completing quests and exploring. The forest outside Flotsam is guilty of this. It's exceptionally difficult to get where you need to go without circling around hedges and trees and carving through numerous cannon-fodder caliber enemies. Additionally, looting and interacting with the environment is a huge chore given the cooldown on your amulet scanning ability, and the way the game locks out looting for what feels like an eternity once combat starts. Crafting and inventory management is a gigantic chore due to the obtuse user interface, which I felt like I had to fight with constantly. I also experienced a few lock-ups in which Geralt would get stuck in an animation, and a few crashes here and there. Transitions into different areas of the map are bothersome as well. There are numerous small complaints like this that show some of the roughness the previous game also exhibited, albeit far less of them overall.

But there are significant improvements, too. This game looks beautiful, especially when compared to the previous game. I was surprised by how high a quality some of the textures were, and the art design in general is noticeably improved from the first game. The character and monster designs are fantastic, with some of the sorceresses and Geralt's outfits being particularly stunning. Even just the background of the dice poker board, or the deranged drawings on the wall of the burnt out asylum are artistically impressive. Due to this mix of artistic prowess and a powerful new engine, a lot of the visuals on display in Witcher 2 still hold up today, nearly a decade after its original release in 2011. This is made more impressive by the use of developer CD Projekt Red's in-house REDengine, which they developed and used for the first time with this game, to glorious effect. Although I dealt with a few crashes, the game otherwise runs superbly (I'm near 150 fps at all times with max settings) and it still looks great despite being nine years old. It's a pretty impressive achievement for what was a small studio at the time to develop such a solid engine, and the game is made much stronger than the first Witcher, which used the ancient Aurora Engine, licensed from BioWare.

The combat is also substantially improved, ditching the previous game's ridiculous and shallow faux-rhythm system for classic third person combat which is far more satisfying to execute. It feels a bit loose to me, especially when compared to The Witcher 3, but it's still miles better than the first game's combat and far more intuitive. Enough depth has been added to make things more interesting throughout.

Where The Witcher 2 really shines, though, is in terms of narrative, quest design, and providing the player agency. The strongest thing The Witcher 1 did was weaving its quests together, so you feel especially detective-like once you begin uncovering all the pieces. This is also true of Witcher 2. For example, in Chapter 1 you very quickly obtain a series of side quests very early, simply by talking to people. Almost all of these quests turn out to be intertwined in some way: An incense-maker turned fisstech dealer and a drunken troll turn out to be related. Sounds far-fetched, but the common ground not only turns out to be reasonable and compelling, but also teaches you more about the political situation in the game's setting of the Pontar Valley. And if you're looking for a game in which you have the power to impact the story with your choices, then look no further—The Witcher 2 features perhaps the best example of ""your choices matter"" that I've ever seen in a game.

CD Projekt Red took a massive chance in the way they designed this game, because there's a significant choice to be made at the end of Chapter 1 that leads to two nearly exclusive routes through the plot. Meaning that no matter your choice, you will end up missing out on about a third of the story content in this game because the two paths moving forward from this choice are so different from one another.

It's a ballsy choice by the developer, because these people had to be designing these entire areas and questlines knowing that half of their players would likely never experience them (unless you're a nerd like me and replay the game to take the other route). The consequences of this choice further reinforces the fact that you are actually impacting what is occurring in the narrative. Few games take player choice to this extreme, and the fact that CD Projekt Red did makes The Witcher 2 something special for that reason alone. Furthermore, the choice is packaged appropriately—you likely won't even realize that you just made a game-altering choice, even though you still realize the gravity of the choice when you made it. The game won't pause and give you any hint that a massive choice is about to occur, which I love. It's an exceptional, ambitious move that is perfectly executed and it makes this game far more memorable and impactful than it'd be without it. Bravo to the developers for making the difficult decision to include two branching paths like this.

If for nothing else, this game is worth playing due to the quality of its narrative. It's a politically-driven game with strong social commentary and genuinely interesting characters, and it gives you the opportunity to pass judgment and act within this world as you see fit. It's constantly satisfying in this manner and it left me thinking about my own moral code regularly. Although The Witcher 2 does not feature the classic, epic story that is featured in Witcher 3, I appreciated the narrower scale and the stronger focus on the political machinations of this world's elites. It might take some concentration, but once you grasp what's going on in the narrative, it's quite compelling.

The Witcher 2 is not without its warts, but it shows a staggering improvement over its predecessor and it remains more than enjoyable today. If you're in the mood for a good story, check it out. You'll probably be well-satisfied.

20920,69049812,76561198156940095,317,12,2273,0,2273,1589348619,"TL:DR; If you're already a fan of the witcher, the game is worth playing to get some more of that juicy witcher lore. If you're new this is a good starting point IF you don't mind a limited world as well as older gameplay that isn't as refined and is beginning to show its age. 


Ok so I'll preface this by saying this. My initial exposure to The Witcher was ""The Witcher 3"" three years ago on ps4. I loved that game and 100% it. I was left satisfied and didn't play any other witcher games or really dive anymore into the series for the next couple years. Fast forward to a few months ago to the witcher netflix series. It got me to fall back into love with the series. Since then I have read all of Sapkowski's Witcher novels (including all three short stories as well as the series). And now with quarantine, I put it on myself to try to go back and beat all the old witcher games. 

So with all that said I'll try to evaluate this based solely on gameplay and story. If you're a newcomer whose either only played the first game, or this is their first witcher game, this will most likely be extremely confusing. Narrative and plot points are thrown at you quickly, with them expecting you to know every kingdom and remember names. It's extremely confusing and if I had not read the books I would have been absolutely lost. There is some lore in books and dialogue but in my opinion the game does a poor job of conveying it to you. However, the story you do get is intriguing enough. There's lots of dialogue and plenty of quests and side quests to keep you occupied for at least 20 hours. I took more as I went out of my way to do everything besides the dice poker (I still have no idea how that works). The game does show its age in that the majority of choices don't really have an affect on the story or the world. There's about 3 choices that really matter throughout the entire game and they for the most part won't effect the ending minus one. That being said, I can appreciate the linearity of the game and keeping the focus on the main story. Yet, because of that and its age it suffers from a fetch questy nature. Most of the mission revolved around going to point x, retrieve y, fight through obstacle z, and come back. The game does however try hard to make that obstacle intriguing. I found myself laughing, serious, and frustrated many times. In 2011, I'm sure this game was excellent as skyrim had yet to be released at the time of this game. I will argue this game does provide a more gritty, grounded, and focused narrative than skyrim does with tighter gameplay. However, this game cannot match the freedom and the sheer size and scope of skyrim, and due to that skyrim is superior to this game by quite a bit. If you're looking for a game to give you some elder scrolls vibes (which I know many are) this is simply not the game for you. 

Let's talk about the game play. So this game is now pretty old, 9 years old here to be exact. I can't expect it to be as refined as titles today. But to be blunt, it's begun to age pretty poorly. The controls are... passable. It just feels clunky and animations feel very odd. There's clipping issues, hitbox issues, sometimes enemies will look like they're standing still and you hit them and all of a sudden they slam you to the ground and you get murdered by a mob who aren't even near you. There's a lot of times I was frustrated as the game just doesn't have smooth controls, to the point where when I was done fighting I was like thank god. This isn't dark souls level difficulty (Ive played all the souls games as well as bloodborne) but at times it can feel like you're ability to win depends on whether the controls do what you want them to do. Furthermore, the menu's feel clunky and odd. I constantly tried to drop junk and ended up dropping my sword, leading to me having to come out of the menu, pick up ALL the items I dropped to get my sword as I can grab things individually, then repeat the process of slowly using the controller to drop all the items again. Furthermore, there's no quick way to navigate menus. If you want to go to your inventory, then to your journal, you have to open up the pause menu, scroll to your inventory, close it, repause the game, then open up your journal. Or when going to a vendor, you can't buy and craft from the same menu. You have to talk to the vendor, ask to buy, LEAVE the dialogue, talk to the vendor again and open up the craft item menu. A scroll option would have been nice, or just not leaving the dialogue when leaving the buy option would have been preferable. Furthermore the inventory management SUCKS. especially in the beginning of the game. If you play the game, when you get to flotsam GO TO THE BASEMENT OF THE INN AND TALK TO THE BARTENDER. Seriously I don't know why the game fails to mention there's a storage bin for all your crafting junk and gear there. I didn't know until about halfway through the starting area and it was a pain in the butt constantly micromanaging every bit of gear that I got, down to alchemy ingredients and twine for my gear. It will still remain annoying even with the storage but at the very least you know you can just dump it all somewhere later. 

All in all, there's lots of little things that reallllly drive me to almost not recommend this game. However, there are quite a few standout and fun parts, as well as dialogue and choices that make this game fun. If you're in quarantine and want to hop back into this game, this isn't a bad one to jump into. The fact that this regularly goes on sale for like $5 definitely helps as well. Just understand that you're going to be playing a game with dated game play and some very ok graphics. For newcomers.... Maaaayyyybbee just watch some story breakdown and hop into 3. This game may sour your taste and give you the wrong impression of three. However, if you have the time, and want to play through the story and it's on sale, go for it.

I hear a lot of people ask if they NEED to play this game in order to enjoy Wild Hunt, and honestly the answer is no, you don't. But you absolutely SHOULD play this game by merit of it being just as much of a masterclass CRPG as its successor. The engrossing story that can see wildly different outcomes based on your choices, the fleshed out and worthwhile side quests, and addictive and rewarding combat and in-depth gear management that are staples of the Witcher series really start to come into form here, and it's an absolute joy to play. While it's true that some things about Witcher 2 fall a little bit short-- especially in comparison to W3-- i.e. the close camera angles causing eye-strain and motion sickness for some, the nerfed skill point allocation system not always allowing you to go down a character path you truly want to take (both of which are quick fixes with some very simple mods-- mod support being ample and readily available via the game's launcher), and the ""Ubersampling"" feature causing some serious performance issues when enabled, even on modern day machines, all of these shortcomings are more than made up for by just how impossibly fun Witcher 2 is to play. The story will grip you, the choices will really make you sit back and think, and the rewarding combat and questlines will leave you wanting more.

now for romance -yes there are boobs, and can i just say they're done quite well. nothing is cringy, it all feels natural, like thats what would happen if this was a netflix series...oh wait ;)

The combat is an upgrade from the witcher 1 and i for one, dear reader, highly approve. I decided to focus on alchemy for my geralt, but feel free to delve into combat skills, magic, or a combination of all of the above.

is it as good as the whitcher 3...hell fucking no, dont be a dick. but is it worth your time? categorically yes!! slay beasts, get drunk with your friend, play dice (not gwent) and absolutely do not sleep with whores...triss will suffice. and have a great time

Originally, I didn’t get past the first Chapter because of the clunky controls, but completing the Witcher 3, watching the Netflix series, and starting to read the books got me back into the Witcher 2 to see what all the fuss was about.

To play the Witcher 2 is to appreciate how much of a quantum leap forward Witcher 3 was. The amount of streamlining that the developer, CD Projekt Red (CDPR) did for the third game was just astounding. The Witcher 2 caused me no end of frustration with the pointless stealth, horrible doors, clunky merchant interfaces. While the handy Configurator did let me change the controls to match the Witcher 3 more closely, the rest of the interface killed the game for me.

Another disappointment was the quests in Witcher 2. While the main quests were spectacular, the noticeboard quests were simple puzzles or pointless killing quests, such as the Endrega, Drowner, and Harpy contracts. This is another aspect where Witcher 3 was leaps and bounds ahead of its predecessor. 

What the Witcher 2 does deliver is an amazing story. I won’t spoil it, but regardless of which path you take, you will never know the true story completely. The effort the team put into craft the branching narrative is truly astounding.

Another appeal of the Witcher 2, like its successor, its sparkling characters. I played Witcher 3 with a lot of confusion because I didn’t quite understand why Zoltan, Dandelion, Roche, and Triss were so friendly with Geralt. (I also didn’t realise Zoltan was my true brother.) Witcher 2 gave these series stalwarts life, and also introduced some other fantastic characters: Saskia, Henselt, Phillipa Eilhart, and Iorveth. It’s a credit to CDPR that they made a good Witcher game without fan favourites Yennefer and Ciri. Or Roach!

Geralt’s character is also beautifully illustrated in Witcher 2. While he had amnesia through the game, his principles, distrust of politics, and his decency, were apparent in his actions. 

Witcher 2 hews more closely to the books than Witcher 3 does. There’s a greater emphasis on potions, as Geralt can’t take potions or eat during fights, only while meditating. Potions and bombs also don’t magically refill after meditation. It’s more realistic, but it’s not as dynamic as the system in the Witcher 3.

I also enjoyed the soundtrack. While the great Percival (of LE LE LE LE LE LE fame) didn’t feature in Witcher 2, it has a nice folksy vibe to some of the quieter tunes.

So can I recommend Witcher 2 or not? Mass Effect 2 it is not. Its mechanics and side quests are horribly dated and pretty much every aspect of it was improved in Witcher 3. I think this game is for completionists, or those who want to build their connection to Triss, Zoltan, and Dandelion. For all others, use the discussion in Vizima to determine what happened in Witcher 2 without having to play it.

[h2]Combat:[/h2]
Witcher 1 had quite an archaic combat mechanic even by its year of release standards, so the move to dynamic combat was the right choice. It's still rough around the edges as you're often animation-locked and Geralt doesn't always respond to sign casting, which sometimes can be a matter of life and death.

Speaking of death, in [i]""Witcher 2: Prepare to die™ Edition""[/i] Geralt is very squishy in the Prologue and the first chapter. The best way to survive is to cast Quen and roll a lot. It gets a little better in Chapter 2 and 3 once you level up some combat skills.

This is the only Witcher game where drinking potions is blocked by the need to meditate, an odd design choice seeing how applying oils is instant.

The parts where you don't fight as Geralt are garbage as you lose all your abilities, they should've just been cutscenes.

[h2]Skill Tree, HUD & Signs:[/h2]
A much needed improvement over the conundrum that was in the first Witcher, signs like Quen and Yrden are actually useful now.

[h2]Visuals:[/h2]
The leap in graphical fidelity between the two games is huge, a lot of detail was put into making the world and characters look alive. Some effects like bloom, depth of field and sharpening can be a bit much, but luckily you can turn them off.

[h2]Story:[/h2]
This is where things take a dive for me. Compared to the first game the plot and characters in this game are all over the place, especially in Chapter 2. The game is about 15 hours shorter, but manages to do a worse job of conveying the narrative with you needing to read the journal after every quest. Not sure if it's designed to be that way, but it only made sense in the end (which comes rather abruptly).

The big difference however is that there is a certain decision you have to make in Chapter 1 that changes the entire game until the end. You should definitely check out the ""second"" path, but be sure to import the correct saves once you start Witcher 3.",1588846257,1588937493,True,1,0,0.524886906147003174,0,True,False,False

So why in the name of the Gods did the developers decide to curse this gem of a game with a combat system that is beyond horrible? Let's see, 4 out of 5 encounters work like this: I stun a foe, hit him so the killcam plays, another foe hits me from behind for 700 dmg BEFORE I regain control of Geralt, end. Or, I riposte a foe, I take damage anyways from hit during the riposte animation, BAM I lost 75% HP. Or, suddenly the game decides I took a backstab when the foe is 3 meters from me! I think the game engine randomly decides I take hits on the higher difficulties, just to keep things interesting. Too many times the hitboxes simply don't collide, and I'm hit anyway. Dodging doesn't give invincibility frames, rather when you're hit during a dodge it counts as a backstab, and anyways the game likes to pitch you against encounters in crammed spaces which are meant to make you use parry/riposte (but see above). And there's the odd boss battle in which you gain control of Geralt hugging the boss, and he immediately decides to do a 180° sweep attack with more reach than you can roll away (backstab, see above).

Pros:
- Ones learned how to properly use the combat system is an immense improvement to the witcher one and can be put next to the combat system of the witcher 3.
- Very nice story/lore, not as much freedom as I'd like to have in it though.
- More refined RPG elements as the witcher 1.

Cons:
- Less lengthy as the witcher 1, though in my opinion more immersive. It doesn't drag on like the first one at some moments did.
- Really bad prologue imho. Everything in the prologue felt either scripted (because when not played accordingly dying was almost inevitable), meaning what they had in vision for this game was close to making reality, just not fully yet. After the prologue the game opens up and everything gets more immersive, this includes the (more witcherlike) environment. This is imo not a story about kings and castles, but about what happens in between.
- Not so userfriendly tutorial, which may have made a lot of players uninstall the game for it's clunkyness. Do not do this, the game has a lot to offer, it's just a little rough to get into.
- One of the worse inventory systems in games, everything is hard to find and confusion to look at, this was better and simpler executed in the witcher 1 and has been completely remade and refined in the witcher 3.

And now I can understand why people who played one of the newer games first and then tried to play Witcher 1 found Witcher 1 so irritating lol. Witcher 2 is a definite improvement on a lot of things. I was fine with the combat system after I spent about an hour in the game. It's for sure a little overwhelming feeling at first and the changes in how meditation works (compared to Witcher 1) threw me off at first, but after that first hour of playing, I felt pretty comfortable.

The story and choices were SO GOOD. I liked that choices really mattered and that there were a few choices that were timed so you HAD to make a decision quick. I felt pretty invested in/connected to the choices I made. I felt really satisfied after each accomplishment in the game and by the end because the story kept progressing and I kept learning interesting things. Main and side quests were both interesting and fun to play through. The game was also much nicer to look at than the first one, but that's obvious lol.

ALSO I appreciated that this installment (in comparison to Witcher 1) had waaay less ""get that lady in bed"" options. It was still there, just much less and much less annoyingly. And like while there were one or two expected scenes, when it came to quests, it was never a choice you had to make to complete a quest, at least as far as I found during my playthrough (there was one quest in the first game where this was the case). Though I'd mention it in case it matters to someone else, too.

The menu is a little weird the way it works, but whatever, it doesn't ruin the game for me. There's tons of different ways to build your stats and there is no way to max out on all of them by the end of the game, which can seem frustrating at first, but there's really no need to max out all branches to be able to play well, so I don't think it detracts from the game too much.

The journal was done pretty well in this iteration, I think.

Editing to add a note on difficulty: I played on Normal (almost) the whole way through. The first couple bosses are weirdly tough, but once I figured some stuff out and looked up some advice, I was still able to beat them on Normal. I tried one of those fights on Easy bc I got frustrated, but then it felt way too easy so I went back and did it on Normal and did fine lol. I did complete one boss on Easy (the final one) because I just wanted to finally find out what happened next in the story, I was doing all the right moves, and it was just taking forever of getting so close and not making it. But I don't think any of the big fights are impossible on Normal (and I am totally not good at the combat part of games in general!).",1588575871,1588630062,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Textures sometimes need 10 seconds to load (not even in places were you'd expect problems), I've had multiple crashes. But I could see past these issues if the game was great. But narratively it's just strange that you have this extremely long introduction, the game should start after all this king murdering thing. I was already bored when the plot really started because I saw no reason for caring about anything I had to do. This title removed all the good things from Witcher 1 and keeps all the weird things. I loved Witcher 1 for its atmosphere, sadly there is little of that to be found in this title. The music is serviceable at best and the combat theme annoyed me greatly. There really should've been better transitions between music. Movement feels horrible! I get stuck on tiny little objects that I shoule be able to walk over without any problems all of the time. The world design feels extremely restrictive, I've no problem with games that don't grant you certain freedoms in gameplay, but the witcher simultaneously signals that you should walk around and explore while it has all these areas you cannot traverse. I don't care about the characters very much, and I can't even fathom how little I'd have cared if wasn't already aquainted with many of them from the predecessor.
I don't know if I approach this game the wrong way, but why the f... do I pick up anything? 99.9 percent of the stuff you pick up is basically trash and because there is stuff everywhere you won't even remember where you got the one great thing you found, making ressource gathering incredibly unrewarding. I had a horrible time with this game, I cannot stomach playing it anymore.

When I played The Witcher 2 it was just a new gaming experience: it is a beautiful game with a unique atmosphere, the depth of the story is incredible, the possibility of choices are quite high...
The combat system completely changed from the first opus: CDPR made a big improvement and changed the combat gameplay to make it more intuitive.
The graphics are just gorgeous; the design of the world, including the environment, buildings, and armors is really one of the best I saw at the time. After disappointing games just like DA2 and cie, The Witcher 2 came out as a refreshing experience.

In this second volume of the legendary series we follow the White Wolf in a quest he wants to have no part in. I won't give any spoilers, as any slight detail could reveal parts of the story which would make your jaw drop and I want to let you review reader experience it in full.

The game is re-playable at least 2 or 3 times, as I recommend you do each of the skill trees entirely. I highly suggest choosing one tree at the beginning of the game and heavily investing your points only in that one, with maybe 1 or 2 points in another. I personally took the mutations/alchemy and a couple of points in the swords skill tree, and I had a fucking blast, having a full-on Witcher experience.

The game follows the pretty common, but not boring classic of mage, rogue/alchemist and warrior skill trees, having one for casting spells (which is fun as hell, if you invest in the right points early) , one for using potions, oils, bombs, traps and other tools to overcome your opponents, truly testing your craftiness to the limit and one for using your sword (but fear not, you will have PLENTY of combat options making you feel like a true badass of sword combat)

I personally was always the rogue-ish, crafty type, making the most out of my surroundings and knowing my maps and foes weaknesses perfectly, thus the alchemy tree (middle one) suited me like a glove.

The game offers also 2 main paths (which is pretty obvious in the first chapter) when you have to choose your path between 2 main characters. But this is the amazing part, both parts are almost ENTIRELY different. So you will literally feel like playing 2 different games.

Combat could be clunky at times and you do have to not get cornered to be able to do anything at all, but that's also what makes it challenging and fun. 

All of the above said, that's why the game deserves 2 runs for the story and a third to try all the 3 trees, thus all the 3 builds. 

CD Projekt Red did an amazing job with Witcher 2 improving on all aspects of witcher 1, from combat to story and the fact that your save will influence Witcher 3 makes it even more amazing. I truly believe this game is close to a masterpiece, a worthy successor of Witcher 1 and a great red carpet for Witcher 3. Enjoy it!",1588556801,1588556801,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

While it's true that some things about Witcher 2 fall a little bit short-- especially in comparison to W3-- i.e. the close camera angles causing eye-strain and motion sickness for some, the nerfed skill point allocation system not always allowing you to go down a character path you truly want to take (both of which are quick fixes with some very simple mods-- mod support being ample and readily available via the game's launcher), and the ""Ubersampling"" feature causing some serious performance issues when enabled, even on modern day machines, all of these shortcomings are more than made up for by just how impossibly fun Witcher 2 is to play.

Combat is not at all action based despite how the animations may look. Its fun in its own right but it works very differently from a Souls or Arkham game. Alchemy tends to be pointless and finnicky more often than not, a shame considering your role as a Witcher. 

Lastly the bugs range from minor to funny to game breaking.

WARNING: Regarding saves, keep a close eye on how many you accumulate. Each time you save a NEW file is made, the old remain in the folder and pile up over time. If the number of saves gets too high you can find yourself unable to save your game at all or at worse losing all your saves.

Aside from that major point the rest of the bugs tend to involve audio when playing the game fullscreen and using alt+tab to shift programs, and some minor visual hiccup.

Pros :
- Beautiful environment that runs quite well (30 fps) even on 4 gigs of RAM.
- Story is very interesting, and easy to follow.
- Worthy, and fun sidequests, no boring monotone fetch quest.
- Minigames! Well the only minigame I like is the arm wrestling one though because the other one is based completely on luck, and the other one is just QTEs lacking any difficulty whatsoever. But still, a good way to pass the time and get some easy orens.
- Pretty nice skill development tree, though the Alchemy tree is useless.

Cons :
- Very few boss fights, and none of them are pretty challenging. Basically, dodge, strike, repeat.
- Romance is very very confusing in this game. Like, there's no romance option at all, other than probably to Jev, Jek or whatever her name was. If you want to romance Triss, well done, you only get to meet her at the start and at the end of the game. Basically, only 1/4 of the game.
- Combat is, idk hard but repetitive. It's really easy to be overwhelmed at the start, since there's not much of an instruction to combat anyway, but it's really about the weapons. Once you get to Ch. 2, where it'll be easy to get a decent enough kit, you'll find it'll be easy, but still repetitive. Though the animations are quite well.
- It's kinda a, half open world I guess? You can't come back to the map before, so if you missed some side quests, you'll miss it for sure. Also, *SPOILER* in Ch. 2 the map is divided again in 2 parts, before-portal and after-portal. You'll get to explore the after-portal part just one time, so if you forget to explore anything, well too bad.

[h1]Combat[/h1]
Simply put, the combat is deeply satisfying and hectic, but ONLY when you level up enough, and when the combat works as intended, which it doesn't sometimes.
You know, when you start playing Dark Souls for the first time, you have the capacity to make the combat be the incredibly amazing experience it was intended to be, from the very get-go. You have everything you need from the very start: Rolling, and a sword. That's all you need to experience the combat as it was designed, and it doesn't even get much different from there. There's no need to cheese or exploit the AI at all. The only limit was your own capacity to learn, from the very moment you start the game.
This is not the case regarding The Witcher 2. Unless you're playing at an easy difficulty, you'll have to cheese the hell out of your first battles in the game. You'll have to drag them out. You'll have to exploit the AI by baiting one soldier at a time. The combat basically becomes a chore with no fault to the player at all. No, it's simply bad design.
And I've seen this in other RPG's too. You start out as a completely underpowered character, but the AI and the combat system is built for a fairly leveled version of your character, so the combat feels bare bones, very limited, and you have no choice but to cheese the fights by casting Quen, baiting enemies, hitting them one time, retreat, and repeat. That's basically your only choice when you're under-leveled and playing on a high difficulty.
You might be thinking, ""Well, of course it's like that! It's an RPG! You're supposed to be weak at the start and get stronger as you progress through the game"". Absolutely, I agree. That is probably the foundation of an RPG game, but this is not the issue. You see, there is a way to make the full experience of the combat system available from the very beginning of a game, even if you start out weak. There is NO excuse for a game designer to not design the combat this way. You just have to look at Dark Souls for this, as I just described before. You can fight through everything in the early part of the game very easily with just the starting gear, if you know what you're doing. Dark Souls succeeds at handing over the full experience of the combat to the player since the very beginning, while being considered an EXTREMELY HARD game by most people. Do you see where I'm going with this? Me playing The Witcher 2 at Dark difficulty does not excuse the fact that I had to cheese all the fights at the start of the game. And believe me, I had to. I was getting one-shotted by mob monsters. It would be perfectly fine if I had a way to dodge all of their attacks, but you can't. You can still get hit while rolling, and unleveled rolling is pretty bad. When you try to strike one enemy, the others will attack you, and you can't do anything about it sometimes because the game will randomly decide what sword swing animation to use. Some take really long to be executed, which leaves you very vulnerable, and some don't (I'll talk about action consistency later).
This could have been fixed if the game simply provided you with more skills that should have been there by default, like ""Whirl"". 
Despite this, when you leveled up enough, the combat is truly awesome. You'll be: dodging attacks, parrying attacks, trying to get that juicy backstab, combining signs and sword play, planning out your battles by drinking potions before combat, setting traps to get an advantage, chaining sword combos through beautiful animations, thinking of who to attack first, and much more. The combat is dynamic and you get a good degree of freedom to approach it in your own style. Killing a whole group of enemies in 30 seconds after you leveled up or upgraded your gear feels really, really good.
I think what elevated the combat from being ""good"" to ""great"" are the signs. They add variety to the combat in a way that sword-only combat couldn't provide, and an opportunity to come up with different strategies. You get five signs, each serving a specific purpose. I found all of them to be useful, which is a great achievement for a game. I've seen very few games where they provide you with these kind of options, and they turn out to be balanced. No, one or two often completely overpowers the rest. Not in this game. You can find a good use for every one of these signs throughout the whole game. And man, they're fun to use. Throwing enemies off a ledge with the Aard sign might be the most hilarious moments I've experienced in the game.
The Witcher series’ spin on character buffing is somewhat unprecedented, at least in my own gaming history. There are potions and blade oils you can apply to you and your swords, respectively. You get them by crafting them or looting them. The twist is that the game doesn't let you get buffed in the middle of combat. You can only drink potions outside of combat, and on top of that, you are very limited in how much substances you can have on your system at any given time. You can lessen the effect of these limitations by leveling up the Alchemy tree. Either way, what these limitations do is prevent what players often do in games like Skyrim or Fallout when they’re about to die in a tough section: They drink and eat whatever they have to get healed and buffed, seconds before they get their final blow. Can’t do that on The Witcher. This teaches you that there are consequences for being rash and careless, and it forces you to think and prepare before going into fights, and to pay more attention while fighting. I appreciate the game for doing this, because having the ability to immediately stop the flow of time whenever you want and heal in the middle of battle crushes immersion, the flow of gameplay and the sense of realism and challenge. Dark Souls solves this problem in a slightly different way: Healing leaves you extremely vulnerable for a long time, and you literally can’t pause the game.
The game has a lot of flaws both in design and in execution, but when it works as intended, it’s significantly enjoyable.


[h1]Closing thoughts[/h1]
Over all, it's a great game worth your time. Flawed but satisfying combat, deep character progression, beautiful visuals and an engaging story. I cannot wait to play the third one. I didn’t talk about The Witcher 1 here, but just to give you some perspective, I found the combat to be nothing short of ABYSMAL. I couldn’t take it anymore, so I quit the game after 22 or so hours. If the difference of quality is the same as the one between Witcher 1 and 2, then 3 must be the best RPG ever made.

Keep in mind I have been modding Skyrim, which came out on the same year, for 8 years off and on. I have about 600 hours with 500+ mods on that game. I'm, err, an ""experienced nerd"". When I fired up Witcher 2, I was just blown away by how it looked and felt with just about 10 or so mods. Compared to other games from its time, it's the best one I've ever seen. Even when compared to games made now, it's a diamond in the industry.

The world is simply breathtaking. I can't explain how I felt when I entered the first village in the game, seeing the gigantic trees towering over me. Then the monsters came out of the woods, and I kept dying because I was so fascinated by their design. The voice acting is actually GOOD, every item is hand drawn, the environments  are soaked in depth and feels so real. Everything is just awesome. It's no wonder people trust CD Prokect Red so much with the task of creating Cyberpunk 2077. If they can create games like this, they can do anything.

Thank you CD Projekt Red. You are a beacon of light in this crazy world.",1587986403,1587986869,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Finished with Roche's path, will replay the game in the future. 
Since my pc is kinda crappy I played it using the Nvdia Geforce Now service, thank you nvidia!
Very different from the original witcher 1 but still an interesting game. 

PROS:
-fluid combat but hard to get into;
-signs are stronger, yrden is much better and axii too;
-chars models are very good;
-good dialog with lots of choices that change the outcome of the story dramatically ( you can replay the game to alter those decisions);
-you feel very strong late game if you have the gear;
-variety of enemies;
-Lots of weapons and good armor design;
-Only 1 quest had a bug, thank god( looking at you Skyrim).

CONS:
-I ABSOLUTELY HATE the potion system...  because you cannot drink potions mid battle, I get its purpose its to ""prepare"" before the fight but in this case its very very badly made. BECAUSE I had multiple times when I drank some potions to increase healing and stats boosts, then you would go to a BIG dialog scene or some scripted events that take some time and then the potions effects are COMPLETELY GONE, the timer expired WTF. 

EXAMPLE: That draugr boss fight was completely and utter bullcrap. I drank some potions before it but then those battle spirits consumed Geralt and you would play as some soldiers who died in battle, then after you would play as Geralt again but guess what? the potions effect were GONE, the potion timer depleted. I am playing against a BOSS WITH NO POTIONS ACTIVE WTF and you cannot use potions during battle nor heal, absolutely stupid mechanic;
-Some difficulty spikes, like the 1st fight with Letho, hard boss for a very small room;
-Limited storage capacity, very annoying for me.

Final thoughts:
I would give a 9/10 but those CONS are very very annoying to me, but still a very good game o its 8/10 for me.",1587952128,1587952128,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

-The combat is leagues better than the first game's, and in some cases in believe it is better than it's successor. This combat system makes you feel like a skilled fighter, strategically dodging and countering at the right times mixed with sign usage. However potions can only be used outside of combat, which can happen in the spur of the moment with no clear indications.

-The crafting system makes most shopkeepers useless as long you find the right diagrams.

-I felt more attached to the story than I did that of the first game. The characters are well written and so is the story this time around.

What I didn't like so much

-You can't drink potions during combat.

-You aren't told that you will need certain expendable items in chapter three if you want to complete optional quests.

-It is extremely difficult and tedious to make money in chapter three

-Chapter two on Roche's path is very empty and kind of boring.

-Lacking in side content.

-Feels like only a prelude to a larger story, lacks good closure.

-Felt very short.

The mechanics weren't good enough to carry the narrative & vice-versa. It was polished but short. The books have less pages. It felt more empty especially mid-way in the Dwarven city. There were no quests or reasons to enter the homes. The NPCS all have names so it's hard to know which one has a unique dialogue or interaction.

Does it make sense that a lot of charm was lost in 'getting with the times'? My swords carried over from the first game but were only good for the prologue sequence. The 'sex cards' are gone, replaced with a few playful scenes of naked Triss. 

But being this attached to Triss makes me wish I picked 'Shani' in the last game since it clearly doesn't matter anymore. There are no whores or horny women to help for sex except for one tomboy slut. It's all about getting the 'most action' out of a mere fraction of quests, charm, mystery, & character from the first game.

The combat was re-designed & it changed everything. I only got used to it doing a quest where you had to fight off difficult wraiths past a time limit. the combat is unforgiving in that back-stabs are lethal and quick attacks suck you into an enemy past his friends. You have to save-scum & then become increasingly greasy until you win. You have run everywhere and set traps.

You get ambushed all the time in random places. You have to equip grenades, set traps, and drink potions to win. I can't imagine doing this on the 'permadeth' difficulty. There are so many opportunities to die immediately by accident.

I felt confined to a linear track. You can't just zip through bushes. What felt like far travel was just a short distance on your map. It was a maze to learn.

Getting new armour & swords, they always look great. But what is carrying through to the next game? More or less? Is it going to get better? Arm-wrestling was novel but the fist fighting was easy and Dice poker became annoying.

This was a small novella compared to the thick fantasy novel that was the previous one. Maybe it was this game that made me question how well a game could borrow from a book franchise. How many things can you borrow from rival franchises without losing your rich soul? Without becoming generic? 

Certain important characters (main antagonist especially) had too much context to force into dialogue. 

There was not enough to do. The most exciting & developed parts were the beginning & end but my choices didn't seem impactful. I'm always kind to Dwarves & Elves when I can be, but I'll never side with Squirrels. There was no incentive for mercy or cruelty.

My first hour was like 'this is gorgeous' and my last hour was like ""this was it?"" Where is the wholesome little 'know-it-all' girl? Where are the gnomes? Where is the jam-packed intrigue per chapter?

Last on my list of nit-picks is how violent the epilogue was, visually & narrative-wise. Not even Game of Thrones depicted a full scene of graphic impalement and female murder by soldiers.

Great intro-cinematic. Franchise is baller. I'm thankful they made a third one which I've begun playing. I'm not sure if I'm being too hard on this title but it is certainly not as memorable as the first game. Go figure.",1587533223,1587533223,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The man who was once the brave and fearsome warrior of Vizima inexplicably became a fragile mewling kitten seemingly overnight. The silver and steel blades that had decapitated many a foe were suddenly reduced mere feather dusters. Why, you might ask? It's an answer we may never come to know. What we do know, however, is how the great Geralt of Rivia finally met his grisly end at the hands of a common soldier.

On a fair and sunny day, Geralt wandered into a Kaedweni camp in search of the kingslayer. He had many a business to pursue during his stay: One of which involved untangling a web of conspiracies at the behest of the king's right hand man. During this investigation, Geralt quickly realized that the legendary sword bestowed upon him during his days in Vizima was a mere children's toy compared to the regular common sword carried by the soldiers of Kaedwen. Geralt shrugged it off, thinking to himself that perhaps it was a matter of relativity, and strung the common sword to his back.

Eventually, Geralt came face to face with a foe who was unlike any other he had faced: A man who was responsible for gathering the conspirators in the camp who had donned the mythical armor of a soldier that, in his own words, described in his own words as armor that ""made him practically invincible"". Expecting this confrontation, perhaps a vision of alternate timelines where Geralt had fought this foe and lost, Geralt downed many a potion that would bolster his strength, and applied a vigorous amount of oil to his common Kaedweni sword that he knew would be the perfect solution for slaying mere humans.

Geralt swiftly struck the man over and over for what felt like many an eternity. After a long, arduous battle, Geralt gracefully swinging his sword in a manner one could only describe as befitting of a ballerina of death, the man wearing the armor of legend had been felled. Soon thereafter, Geralt discovered this legendary armor just so happened to suit him perfectly, and began wearing it for himself.

Shortly after, Geralt had discovered that he played a part in a plot that would soon turn the entire Kaedwen army against him. Wearing the legendary invincible armor, Geralt unsheathed his Kaedweni blade, ready to fertilize the soil with the blood of those who dared oppose him. Unfortunately, Geralt had just witnessed a cutscene, and could not attack for reasons beyond this plane of knowledge, so he was struck down and killed by a common Kaedweni soldier in a mere four hits. As Geralt lay dying and bleeding out, his only thoughts as his consciousness slipped away were: ""How did it take ages for me to kill a man wearing this armor with my Kaedwen sword, but these common soldiers wielding the same sword killed me in so few hits?""

It mattered not to Geralt. In fact, soon nothing mattered to Geralt. As his tired and weary eyes closed shut, sensing the weight of a million timelines collapsing onto each other, he soon drew his last breath, thus ending the story of Geralt, the Witcher of Rivia.

A sad tale, true, but perhaps if the gods of our world had created a balanced and fair combat system and paid attention to their own lore, maybe it wouldn't have happened. In fact, this is just the tip of the ice burg of all the inconsistent rules of our world, but this one stands out as the most grievous of all. Where Geralt once masterfully slayed monster and foe alike with the expert knowledge of his Witcher combat styles, every encounter ever since saving King Foltest had him barely surviving and on the brink of death.

Perhaps somewhere, out there, another universe exists where Geralt had succeeded in his quest to hunt down the kingslayer. In fact, I firmly believe he did; however, by the end of his quest, instead of excitement for what he had gone through he was instead deeply disgusted and unsatisfied with what he sacrificed along the way to reach his goal. Unfortunately we do not occupy that timeline, and for us, this is how Geralt of Rivia's adventure ended.""",1587415766,1587415766,False,5,1,0.50995403528213501,0,True,False,False

Não só porque sou uma grande fã da franquia, mas porque ele tem realmente uma boa história. Ambos os caminhos são únicos com personagens e missões únicas, mas depois de jogar ambos os lados, você vê como a história se fecha numa coisa só, mesmo tendo resultados diferentes.  Um complementa o outro, já que você só pode saber de várias informações jogando um lado de cada vez.

Mas o que mais gostei foram os personagens, até mesmo os que o jogo quer que você odeie. Acho que o jogo fez um trabalho melhor nesse em relação a deixar todos eles em ""tons de cinza"" ao contrário do primeiro que por mais que tenha nuancias de interpretação, ainda é um pouco bidimencional demais. Nesse aspecto, também gostei como a ""fama"" de alguns dos personagens são até bem erradas em relação ao como eles realmente são. Eles são na maioria carismáticos, ou os clássicos ""amo odiar ele"".

O gameplay é divertido e pode ser desafiador dependendo de como você jogue, e tem missões bem legais, algumas sem graça, e algumas bem interessantes até.

Mas se tenho que criticar algo, são três coisas: A primeira é a forma que o mapa é feito, ele é bem confuso na maioria das vezes salvo alguma excessões. Dois, esse jogo crasha muito, principalmente quando você está salvando ou carregando um save. Três e pior de todos, ele tem um número limite de slots para salvar, mas o problema é que ele não te avisa isso, o jogo ""salva"" mas não salva realmente, apenas o quicksave. Se você salva com frequência, você tem que ficar deletando saves antigos para abrir espaço. Na maioria dos jogos isso não é problema, mas esse como ele não avisa, é bem fácil você perder horas de jogo sem querer.

Pessoalmente, gosto mais do caminho do Iorveth, por lidar com temas que gosto mais e pela campanha dele ser maior, também acho que se encaixa melhor com o que o meu Geralt faria (baseado no meu primeiro jogo), mas não quer dizer que o do Roche seja ruim, ele só é menor e lida muito mais com política/história do universo.

Concluindo, eu recomendo ele, da mesma forma que recomendo o Witcher 1 e 3 :)",1587280627,1587280627,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Good
-Story
-Prologue was a fantastic intro
-Characters
-Voice Acting
-Beautiful graphics
-Awesome time era and setting
-Great Development of both story and characters
-Boobies!!!!
-Arena mode is not bad
-Huge improvement in combat from the first game
- Some customization with upgrades and different swords. 
-Alchemy system still good
-Characters upgrades are not bad.

Bad
-Missions were you follow AI
- AI slamming door in your face
-Prompts to jump two feet of off a tiny ledge
-Prompts could be delayed
-Perhaps there was a mishap going into the epilogue from Chapter 3
-Chapter 3 location is a bit dull and wasn't my favorite
-Chapter 2 location could be a maze at times but it was cool
-Difficulty between easy and normal seems like a huge step but provides a good challenge 
-Meditation ability I wan't a fan of. Having to use that to consume potions was annoying. Plus potions would wear off before I really got into a boss fight or combat in general.

Things to also note
-Story is somewhat short if you don't go and find side-quests or do Witcher contracts. The contracts, however; are in depth, give branching options, and are well thought out for the few that I did.
-Story doesn't mention Ciri that much but does mention Yennefer a lot more throughout which I found interesting.
-No fast travel. Didn't bother me to much.
-I also had issues with the ending cut scenes that bugged out and lost the voice over.

Overall this game's new engine at the time and story make for a wonderful sequel to the first game.

I played dark mode first and hated it, I recommend normal mode cause my two deaths on that mode were my fault.

Which is a big deal when you can only take about two or three hits on that mode. The leveling is locked to the story so you can only grind a few level until you progress the story so if your having trouble with a boss you just have to get good and hope you didn't waste your skill points. Despite all of that i had a blast on normal mode feeling all powerful compared to dark mode feel great.

The game looks nice, however for every nice view, there is 5 minutes of monotonous conversation with boring facial effects, only nice moments its when you can see a boob.

Enemies can be hard, so you need to think before fighting, its not a smashing button game.

They will just pop behind you, sometimes from a place you came, where there was no more enemies....

The story and the lore are great, but the best part about the game is that your actions actually have consequences, so while the game is by no means a sandbox experience, it is certainly not linear.

Witcher, your main character (a monster-hunting castaway mutant) falls somewhere between your typical hero and anti-hero, but that serves to emphasize the main trait of the entire series: the lines between good and bad, right and wrong are often clouded and you're nearly always treading the fine line between what is acceptable and what may be too much of a compromise.

The fighting portion of the game still holds up well in 2020.

you ever feel like you really suck at a game, and then realize it's not you that sucks, but the game? This is how the combat system in this will make you feel. I'm daniel. I just beat deus ex mankind(a pretty hard game) on the hardest difficulty my first time picking it up. So i'm no slouch. But this game is impossible. And it's not because i'm bad, it's because the game is. The lowest tier of nekkar (a common early gmae unit) one shot you from behind. And because of the terrible targeting systeem, your guy is likely to dash in the middle ofa bunch of them quite often. Prepare to need to save before even facing a few mobs. The evasion system is trash too. The best you can do is roll, but you can't roll anywhere the game doesnt want you to go which is A LOT of places, including even down a gently sloping hill because ""thats not the path of the game"" you also can't jump. The combos your guy does seem totally random, sometimes totally wrong for the situation, and putting you in peril. Wild spins that expose your back and take a long time, strange lunges that shoot you in the midst of many mobs all caplable of one shotting you.......

This is a game I really wanted to like. I tried really hard becasue everyone said it was so amazing. But this game has the clunkiest most retarded UI I have ever seen on a game. Graphics are good for it's time, story is cool, but you will be incessantly driven mad by ridiculous things like geralt not doing charms when you tell him to because he couldn't lock on enemies properly, terrible AI that has to rely on cheating instaspawns right behind you, and the like. I am currently in the dungeon mission. The camera continually gets stuck behind objects and you cant see your guy. You try to swing your weapon at guards and instead geralt contniues putting out and restarting torches on the wall becuase it's the same button and you die. You cant even jump!!! and there are so many places where a .5 foot ledge shoulid be possible to jump onto or down from but you cant. You have to find the sandboxy path that the devs came up with for you rather than going where you see as an obvious path. It's just annoying, reminiscent of very old games for n 64 or xbox. This game is pretty bad. I'm going to play it, becasue like I said the story is good, but this is a game with ridiculous combat mechanics where all you can really do is spam roll all over the place to evade enemy swords and it doesnt even really work. It's also kind of annoying that you have to constantly buff armor and make potions, meditate etc before fights. I've played lots of medieval combat sims like mount and blade and stealth FPS like Deus Ex, and this game really could have benefited from going first person.",1586532812,1586584450,False,0,0,0.47413790225982666,0,True,False,False
