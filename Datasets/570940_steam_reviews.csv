Despite its reputation, like many Souls games, it isn't that difficult and can become quite relaxing once you get use the the attack patterns (and learned the location of enemies). 
The bosses are satisfying to beat and the grandiose lore reminds me of Greek Mythology.
Its also one of the first linear games that don't feel linear but is. 
Now onto my review:

Graphics 8/10 - Only complaint is that the player's face always looks weird no matter what.

Game play 9/10 - Can be infuriating at times as the controls get delayed sometimes. (Which also becomes a major issue in DS2). Just beware falling into the trap of farming to progress levels to beat a boss. It doesn't work, you just have to git gud.

Narrative/Lore 8/10 - Like all FromSoft Souls games, you have to dig for the lore. But it is damn compelling. So far my favourite boss lore is that of Artorius.  Overall it is a tragic tale, one I recommend VaatiVidya on YouTube to explain.

Experience 10/10 - Love the feeling when finally defeating difficult bosses. I especially hate Manus - too infuriating. Love the stories of the side cast NPCs and their tragic tales into insanity (RIP best booi and onion knight).

Overall Score 9/10 - A few complaints about the delayed controls and the trend of my character's face looking like a potato. Great game, highly recommend.

I can't say the difficulty was too bad on this one, the hardest part was how clunky all these older controls are and a lot of bugs in this game. I had a blast on my first play-through, currently working on NG+ to get all achievements like I did with Elden Ring. However if this is the first Souls game you're wanting to play I highly recommend playing Elden Ring first as I did. This experience wasn't half as good as Elden Ring's, although it was enjoyable. The bosses in this game were pretty strange, if they weren't stupid easy they were ridiculously hard. I gotta say the mods for this game look like a lot of fun so I am excited to try some of them. The areas in this game that are good are just filled to the brim with enemies while the rest of them straight up suck. Also the balancing in this game is AWFUL. I really wish that I could give an in between of thumbs up and thumbs down for this game.

The remake honestly is very similar. I however have one huge issue with the remake. The way they programmed in the controller joystick makes it very likely overtime to cause your character to constantly go between running and walking when trying to run. From what I understand they made it so it only considers you running if the joystick is fully going in one direction. The issue is all joysticks overtime will struggle to maintain the original maximum directionality and as a result it will bounce between registering your character as running and walking. As this game has very essential platforming it becomes nearly unplayable with controllers that aren't perfect or new. 
Imagine the pain felt as you are walking through an area of the game where you have to avoid giant blades trying to knock you off narrow platforms and you have to pass through four quickly only to suddenly go from running to walking on the last one and your character gets knocked off and dies. 
Now imagine running up extremely narrow rooftops with giant archers who are shooting ballistic arrows at you and if a single one hits you you get knocked off and die. Repeatedly you get close to the end of of this nightmare but time after time you switch from running to walking at crucial times and are launched from the rooftop to your doom below. You've done this many times before but the new difficultly of bad programming of controller joysticks has you bested. You find another one of your less desirable but newer controllers and swiftly get through the area but feel the disappointment in your hands as you realize the reboot of the game you loved is nearly unplayable because of the pure incompetence of the programmers who worked on the joysticks.  May future games avoid this curse and better programmers with more sense work on how to make a functional joystick.",1708865153,1708865153,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

1. There are little to no accessibility options (This is the big one.)

2. Accidentally hitting an NPC can cut off entire avenues of progress in the game as they'll become hostile and not trade 
    with you anymore. Yes, there is an NPC who you can buy forgiveness from, but if you hit him by accident too, you're SOL. 

3. Much of the game is obtuse just for the sake of it, instead of actually contributing to a better game.

4. The player is inundated with dozens of items, like 30+ kinds of weapons, 30+ kinds of armors, and dozens of spells, but realistically, playing through the campaign without grinding, you'll only ever really experience one fully upgraded weapon/armor build.

The prepare to die edition is unplayable on PC, so I feel a bit sad, that this game was not for free as there is not a lot of upgrade in it, only a little bit of graphics and they made it playable on PC, that is it, even the horse armor dude could give the Skyrim remaster for free if you already had the game in your library and in this case the original doesn't really work so it should be normal to solve the issue for everyone who bought the original back in the day. Whatever...

The controls got much better and the camera is also not as shaky, plus the 60 FPS can help, but to be fair the lock on system is still utter garbage, the camera and controls are still bad, but workable. After Elden Ring this game feels like it doesn't have input lag so my god was it a good feeling. That is all that is bad, everything else is perfection.

The gameplay is great, the story is good, I loved the different zones and bosses, I'm already in NG+ and I cannot wait to go through again and face the bosses again and see how much stronger I got. 

On discount it is like 20 Euro and it worth it even if you have the prepare to die edition, especially on PC.

Esse jogo √© simplesmente esplendido e a defini√ß√£o de grande parte da minha inf√¢ncia com meu primo (duvido muito que a gente tenha sequer chegado em Anor Londo), n√£o √© atoa que comprei esse scan de 80 reais (na promo√ß√£o) pra PC. Tirando o pre√ßo, tudo nesse jogo continua perfeito, literalmente uma aula de game design e de como contar uma hist√≥ria boa sem ficar explicitamente explicando ela em di√°logos expositivos.

Caso seja sua primeira experiencia com o jogo, recomendo que voc√™ entre com um bloquinho de notas anotando tudo o que voc√™ tem que fazer, portas trancadas, locais que voc√™ tem que explorar, quests de NPCs e etc, caso contr√°rio voc√™ vai ficar travado no jogo e vai acabar dropando, √© s√©rio, esse jogo √© muito confuso e se voc√™ esquecer de explorar algum lugar, provavelmente vai ter que voltar de local em local pra achar.

Caso voc√™ queira platinar, √© importante que voc√™ saiba que ser√° necess√°rio zerar pelo menos 2x para conseguir os dois finais e ainda chegar na princesa de Anor Londo uma 3a vez, eu recomendo caso voc√™ n√£o tenha experiencia no jogo, zerar a primeira vez de boa, s√≥ guardando as souls dos bosses pra fazer as armas e da√≠ no ng+ abrir uns tutoriais e ir seguindo. Vale ressaltar que eu nunca senti tanta falta de um jogo quanto eu senti depois de ter platinado esse, apesar de ser extremamente cansativo de conseguir as conquistas, o jogo √© extremamente cativante e te d√° vontade de jogar de novo e de novo, ent√£o eu recomendo tentar apreciar o jogo ao m√°ximo por mais estressante que sege.

Now blood flowed freely in Akalabeth, and foul creatures soon came to roam near the surface. Mondain cast such sickness and pestilence upon Akalabeth, that both man and beast lived in constant fear. Thus was the Dark Age of Akalabeth.

There arose from the land a man, pure and just, to battle the Dark Lord. British, Champion of the White Light, did battle with Mondain deep within the labyrinth of dungeons, eventually driving him from Akalabeth forever.

Edit: finished the game and it is absolutely amazing easily the best game in the genre for me and most definitely in my top 5 games ever, only complaint i have is that the game immediately starts NG+ upon finishing the game, which i made the mistake of doing before doing dlc meaning i had to do a second play-through which hindered enjoyment as i felt i had to do a second play-through rather than wanting to. other than that amazing game all round and also i always hear people saying that the second half of the game is significantly worse than the first half, however i found myself enjoying myself as much in both halves, i think this was helped by the fact that the somewhat unintuitive RPG mechanics had sort of started to click finally and i began to enjoy creating my build as much as i had in the other games. also i didnt struggle with bed of chaos and defeated it in 2 attempts which seems to be a huge cause for anger in the later half for most players.",1691154226,1708696843,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

There are very few games I've played more than the first installment of this series, and I'm very happy to have experienced this game on PC + MNK prior to a full achievment run on Xbox a year or so ago, and it's provided me with a great new perspective on this game - especially after playing the rest of FromSoftware's lineup of soulslikes.

Without a doubt, this is the best game in the trilogy -  that may be a hot take, but this title has bee able to create a balance of amazing bosses, phenomenal level design/connectivity, storytelling and writing, build options, and overall feeling of fair difficulty. Of course there are some major flaws with this game, the biggest being Demon Ruins, Lost Izalith and their bosses; along with some AI bugginess in certain bossfights, most prominent with Gwyn.

Now when approaching this game on mouse and keyboard, it was a completely different experience, and in some ways, better than controller - ex: item/estus slot switch w/ mouse wheel, dodge w/ spacebar. However, I believe the downsides of a keyboard and mouse make it to where I'd prefer this game and recommend FromSoft's SoulsBorne games with a controller. The biggest issue with this game not using a controller was definitely parry. Having to use two buttons to parry felt extremely un-intuitive and there wasn't really an ideal button to map it to. I actually had to switch to a controller on the NG+ Gwyn fight after tanking the fight for hours and after thirty minutes or so on controller, the fight was over. Highly recommend using a controller for this one.

As for boss quality, this contains the best and most well designed bosses in the series: Knight Artorias, Gwyn, Ornstein and Smough, Manus, and Sif. This game also contains some of the worst in the series: Bed of Chaos, Capra Demon, and Demon Firesage being the best examples. Nonetheless, I believe the good much outweighs the frustrating in this case, helping that the Bed and the Firesage don't exactly bug me as much as it would for most. Every boss (for the most part) is carefully crafted to test certain abilities you have in the game - Gwyn tests your parry skills, Four Kings tests your ability to do rapid damage with a ring slot gone, Manus tests your patience and endurance, the Asylum and Taurus Demon test your ability to use the arena to your advantage, and so on. Each boss is fully unique, with the only exceptions being Stray and Firesage Demons. All are very well representative of their lore and are fun and engaging to fight, while being challenging yet fair (again, for the most part....)

When it comes to map layout, this game is absolutely perfect - with a sea of open world games out there, having more closed and constructed level design akin to more oldschool games works extremely well for this game. Shortcuts are extremely rewarding to explore and finding items, weapons and more in tucked away spots even more so. This game takes the mentality of knowing its layout like the back of your hand and applies it better than any FromSoftware title, considering that many of their games are more or less straight paths relying on bonfire teleports to backtrack.

I'll always be happy to come back to replay this masterpiece every so often. My soul level one playthrough is just itching to start. If you are looking to pick up an extremely high quality RPG - do your best to three-pointer your copy of Assasin's Creed in the trashcan and pick up this title. It may be hard at first but anyone can finish this game.

update: i watched solaire of astora tell me how to git gud and after remaking my character and spending a hour on gitting gud and then another 20 to catch up i will say my anger is depleting 

thank you miyazaki

update #2: im probably half way and ive became addicted more so than i would to a mobile game

update #3: i love this game and everything is so rewarding, besides the graphics and how the boss fights arent like extremely mystical i think this is just a superior souls game even with elden ring having so much to offer i still think elden ring was far more enjoyable and better but at the same time this game is this game i couldnt tell you which souls is my favorite theyre all perfect in their own ways

It is essentially exactly the same as it used to be with a tiny bit of polish and now you don't need to install DSfix to play with friends. I honestly hardly noticed much of a difference texture wise while playing through. 

I only really put this as a recommend because this is now the only real way to play the game since Prepare to Die Edition is no longer for sale and can only be accessed through keys sold by third party and if you're new to the series this is absolutely worth getting.

When stepping into this, if you come from DS3 or Elden Ring, remember that this game is going to feel dated because all of the old design is here. Bosses won't be as crazy as they are to watch in action as they are in Elden Ring. This is where they learned and improved from Demon Souls, and so coming back to this title from 2 or more games in the future is a huge leap backwards. You will see where they started in the realm of PC here. 

My advice to anyone brave enough to trek through this classic, learn to parry, be aggressive, and Prepare to Die. 

""It may be tough, and it may make you cry, but between the scenery and the difficulty, it is a beautiful and challenging game. The detail on the buildings, Anor Londo specifically, is to die for (since the things in the place might kill you anyway!).

It is a tough game, for sure, and should not be sat down with while in a mental state that says ""I will be good at this, better than anybody else, and I will beat it."" You will more than likely end up frustrated in the end.""

I understand this game was probably great when it initially came out but if you didn't play it back then you will hate it. The combat is a bit rough with attacks going through i frames some attacks not hitting etc. The game feels incredibly sluggish, your roll, your attacks, enemy attacks take 5 hours to complete. But mostly what frustrates is the bosses. They are either incredibly boring and easy because they have 3 different attacks or just unfun bullshit like 2 bosses attacking at different times together so much that you simply can't have enough stamina to dodge all of them without farming first. Oh and the walkbacks are disgusting. Every time you have to walk 1 minute at least and fight roughly 10-12 enemies before you can try the boss again. And usually its made in a a way that you cant run past them either. The game feels also as hard as DS3 and Elden Ring combined but not in a good way that challenges your skill but rather in an unfun ""really what is this, why did they do that"" way. 

I 100% Elden Ring, played DS3 twice, played sikiro and other soulslikes and loved all of them. But this i regret spending money on, i would rather replay one of the good ones",1708541016,1708541016,False,4,3,0.414524048566818237,0,True,False,False

- Old game. Little bit clunky
- Related to the game called Dark Souls 2 


---Positives---

- Incredible game-play that brings the old school of developing game play with intricate level design and simple move sets. 
- Very easy game if you know what you are doing. In your second play through you can decimate your environment. So it is not the problem of everything is being challenging but problem of lacking information.
- Incredible interconnection. I didn't see anything close to DS1.
- Some bosses will remain in your mind forever. 
- Very recognisable and characteristic art direction. You can almost immediately recognise Dark souls among bunch of medieval genre. 
- Variation of skills, spells and weapons. That leads more replay ability.
- Poise
- Too much content if you interested with story. However, it does not force it into you. Players choose to consume it or not by using outside sources. 

---Sum---

An Incredible masterpiece. It is one of the literature worthy games that will have influence over many future games.",1646349903,1708537672,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It sucks if you like fast combat, since if you input 2 hits, it is going to do 2 hits. doesnt matter if you changed your mind while doing one hit which takes 3 seconds. you'll be stuck doing the second hit, you cant dodge then.
The Dogs are Ass, sometimes the skeletons are ass too, the charge for like 5 seconds and then jump at you from 4m away, because the wall collision got into the way, so you have no time to react.
The hitbox is ass, and the combat, well get ready for your friends blaming you to prepare before a bossfight instead of just going in, since ""you didn't die as much as I did"" is always a thing to compare themselfes to.

I feel like most people only like it because they haven't played it in a while. It is painfully slow, ganky and repetitive. On top of all that, the game is actively punishing you for being new (or even average for that matter) - be it enemy placing, where you have to know exactly where to wait or who to kill to not get stuck, or be it navigating the area without getting killed. And it may be easy for someone who already knows their way around the game, but not for any new player.

[b]Enemies[/b] are placed in such a way they block your path and don't let you escape. And it may be fine for a relatively easy areas such as undeadburg, but then goes sens fortress, anor londo, lower londo, the catacombs and so on and you are slowly getting tired of fighting same hordes of generic enemies over and over again. Because...

[b]Combat[/b] is awful. And it's not just game being slow in general - it's also the pacing - many enemies, instead of slowly chipping your health, have one chain attack that does a lot of damage. And here's the question - will you risk having a blow trade, knowing well that if you fail you have to run half of the map again? You'll probably play safe. That makes an already slow game feel even slower. And even if you did choose to engage, prepare for...

[b]Controls[/b]. Artificial difficulty at its finest. As I said, the game requires high precision because each mistake can get you  ganked, oneshot etc. Well, this game has input buffering - but only for certain things aka you can't press heal twice and actually heal twice. But you can roll when you don't want to. Or attack when you don't want to. And with rolls only having 8 directions, you easily roll into your own grave. Again, this is the game where you are supposed to be very precise at your rhythm and movement - placing such restrictions on a player are creating artificial difficulty. Those who already already played it will understand me - [h3] you're not fighting enemies, you're fighting your own controls [/h3]

[b]Locations[/b] are probably the only thing this game does right. I won't be talking about rushed Izalith as I don't have much issues with this area. But sure enough, if there is anything to like about this game, it is its interconnected world with very memorable spots.

[b]Weapons[/b] are okay, upgrade system is not. This stone, that stone, grind this here, grind that there, you need this ember then you need that ember. And I won't even talk about places where you're supposed to ""find"" those embers. Imo weapon scaling should be your only mean to upgrade weapon and you should be able to upgrade via level-ups

[b]The conclusion[/b]
Sometimes I wish people could stop savoring each and every Michael Zaki's footcrumb and just admit this game blows. This whole ""git gud"" thing is nothing but ""take it in the –∞ss like a champ"". This game's problem is not rushed development or somewhat archaic souls formula - it's artificial difficulty created by bad level design and broken pacing.",1708358825,1708451863,False,2,1,0.468871593475341797,0,True,False,False

This game is a masterpiece, a carefully constructed experience that will probably scar you for the rest of your life.
You'll feel things at times, things we all have felt. You'll be left in awe and wonder, or scared and confused, desperate even. And then you'll feel right at home. All this just by playing through a game.

If you haven't yet played this game, I envy you, because you still do so for the first time.
Witnessing Lordran and its tales, is ""like"" living through a legend. You'll see with your own eyes, the myths of this world, through a cathartic storytelling experience.

It's not an easy game, but that is part of the appeal, the game itself gives you all the tools to beat it, and definitely doenst hold your hand, giving you complete freedom to fail time and time again. And it's okay.

The remaster:

Besides the controversy caused by the removal of the original, and charging almost full price for a slightly improved version of  the same, we are still talking about a masterpiece, made by a company who doesn't sell you DLCs at release, nor unfinished games filled with microtransactions, and for me the price is more than worth of the value i got out of the game.

The remaster iself is honestly not bad, the difference in user experience is night and day.

Definitely got a tad crusty with age, but still the most solid world of the series overall I feel.
Of the souls games, I recommend either Dark Souls 1 or Elden Ring as a starting point with a warning that Elden Ring will spoil newcomers with all the quality of life features that have come over the years. But if you really want to see what got this series into the limelight, as well as the popularization of what people call souls-likes, then do yourself a favor and play this game.

It can be tough at times, especially to a new player, but fret not as the game rewards patient players and those willing to adapt to new strategies to overcome obstacles. The game is full of highly memorable set pieces that are bound to leave a lasting impression; as well as great freedom in what you can choose to do with your adventure. This game is over 10 years old and still has an active online playerbase as well, allowing you to still experience the jolly cooperation as well as dastardly invasions of players at your leisure. Not a fan of online? No problem, the game is entirely doable offline as well.

That speaks to two things - that Dark Souls plays extremely well for its age, and that despite the stories being disparate, these are all games set in the same universe. At least when viewed analytically. 

That said, there have been some vast improvements to small gameplay elements between then and now out of convenience, and those improvements are sorely missed here. But this was the game that effectively reshaped an entire generation of development across the industry, so I can't really be that critical. The game is almost unfathomably expansive, and part of me wishes I could play it through the lens of someone who enjoyed it at the time, as it's been copied and supplanted so many times now that it's nearly impossible to understand how impressive it would have been.

Importantly, they've fixed the online functionality and I can change my review now that the game performs as advertised. 

Problem is that the online features aren't a boon. DS1 encourages griefing more than any other; my first invasion came the second I stepped into the Undead Burg - less than 5 mins after starting my newest playthrough. A low-level player had rushed to areas with high-tier gear and returned to prey on other low-level characters, forcing me into a tedious tit-for-tat for 10 minutes. This happened again, and again, and again. Sometimes the invaders would drop in when I was in extremely perilous areas, and then fail to find me. So I would stand and waste my time waiting for them because you can't use bonfires while they're in your game, unable to move in case I was attacked by monsters and the invader at the same time. 

Online play in DS1 involves rudimentary co-op, and one-sided PVP that both encourages and benefits exploitative players. I eventually decided to play the game offline, at which point I lost access to the soapstone warnings from other players about traps and treasures. So there's no ideal way to play this game - online and offline suck in different ways. 

That said, unlike other games in the series, DS1 doesn't block any essential progress off behind illusory walls or hard-to-find items. The level design is reasonably enjoyable to navigate, and of all the games in the series this one minimises the chance that you're going to forget where you're supposed to be going, or fail to see a passageway that takes you to the next area. Memories of initial clunkiness melted away as I played, until it just felt right. It's still intimidating and awe-inspiring and weird and inventive, and it's impossible to misunderstand why it's so well-regarded. I'd argue that, despite all its flaws, it's probably the best in a trilogy of flawed masterpieces. It's not conceptually tired like DS3, it's not quite as unnecessarily obtuse like DS2. For an observant and patient player who can check their preconceptions of what an RPG will demand of them at the door and learn the quirks that allow the game to be conquered, DS1 remains a singular experience.",1653783945,1708394337,True,0,0,0.47826087474822998,0,True,False,False

As a player who ventured into Lordran in the past, the remastered edition not only rekindles the flame of nostalgia but also breathes new life into the classic title for both veterans and newcomers alike.

Visually, the remastered edition brings Lordran into the modern era with upgraded textures, improved lighting, and a stable frame rate. The result is a world that retains its haunting beauty while benefiting from the technical advancements of contemporary gaming platforms. The enhancements, while not groundbreaking, contribute to a more polished and immersive experience.

The core of Dark Souls lies in its intricate level design and interconnected world, and the remastered edition faithfully preserves this hallmark. The atmospheric locales, from the towering spires of Anor Londo to the oppressive depths of Blighttown, are as captivating as ever. The ability to explore seamlessly without load screens enhances the sense of a cohesive and foreboding world.

Dark Souls Remastered introduces quality-of-life improvements that refine the overall experience. The increased multiplayer capacity, allowing up to six players to engage in jolly cooperation or brutal invasions, adds a new layer of unpredictability to the online component. Additionally, the bonfire warping system, initially introduced in Dark Souls II, is available from the start, streamlining travel across the expansive world.

The heart of Dark Souls is its demanding combat, and the remastered edition retains the punishing yet satisfying gameplay that fans cherish. The controls feel responsive, and the weight of each swing and dodge is conveyed with precision. The subtle tweaks to animations and hitboxes, while not altering the core mechanics, contribute to a smoother and more consistent combat experience.

The memorable boss encounters, a cornerstone of the Dark Souls experience, are just as impactful in the remastered edition. Facing off against iconic foes like Ornstein and Smough or grappling with the enigmatic Manus remains a thrilling test of skill and perseverance. The orchestral score, hauntingly beautiful in its melancholy, complements these battles and enhances the overall atmosphere.

While Dark Souls Remastered successfully modernizes the classic, it does little to address some of the original game's minor flaws. The camera can still be a source of frustration in tight spaces, and a few areas suffer from frame rate dips, although these issues are less pronounced than in the original release.

In conclusion, Dark Souls Remastered is a faithful and well-executed return to the challenging realms of Lordran. Whether you're a seasoned undead or a newcomer seeking to experience a gaming classic, the remastered edition offers a refined and enhanced journey through one of the most influential titles in the action RPG genre. It stands as a testament to the enduring legacy of Dark Souls and its continued relevance among gaming enthusiasts.",1578841469,1708301399,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

Very classic and genre-defining game. Dark Souls and Soulslike in general have the perfect combat system: Press RB to attack, press B to dodge or hold LB for shield and pay attention to telegraphed attacks. Nothing more and nothing less. It's simple, nothing too fancy and has a nice push and pull concept.

Boss encounters are challenging but fair! It revolves around learning their behaviour / attack patterns and countering them. 

The world is good designed during the first half of the game, almost bearing resemblance to a Metroidvania with many memorable encounters. No immediate checkpoint before a boss is not good though. It's a time waste having to run past enemies, everytime you fail a boss. This is NOT a challenge, no matter what ""git gud soulsfanboys"" are saying.

Sadly, the game suffers heavily if you reach the 2nd half of the game. The later areas become completely tied off from the interconnected areas and are lacking in the quality department. The distance between checkpoint and boss is also very unnecessarily long and it becomes frustrating when you have to run for 5 minutes (!) just to have a chance to learn a boss.

Lock-on can feel clunky, if you played modern Soulslikes. You can't sprint and you can only dodge in four directions. It's recommended to play without lock-on.

Forced PvP is unnecessary, very beginner unfriendly and should be completely optional, just like in Elden Ring.

This game is amazing at times, and, if we're honest, terrible at others. Areas such as blighttown, Sen's Fortress and Lost Izalith are truly painful to play through, especially the first time. However, some areas are amazing. Most of them are, in fact. In all honesty, this game takes a significant step-down after you defeat Ornstein and Smough, essentially marking the half way point of the game. You must also be ready to deal with the clunky and dated feel of the game, especially if coming from more modern souls/soulslikes. For example, being immobile while healing or only having 4 dodge directions while locked on can really drag the game down, and take some getting used to, as it did for me as I played this after Elden Ring and Lies of P.

Aaah yes 'the best souls-game' - where your hub area suddenly stops working and you have to google how to fix it (and cant till much later in the game), 'the best souls-game' where the item-description says to use an item to boost heal and then you use it and it doesnt and its gone forever, 'the best souls-game' where you get a unexpected special-one-way ticket (ie accidentally falling down a hole) to a lategame area with way too strong enemies for your current level, 'the best souls-game' where you now fight your way through this area wich is so fucking pitch black that you cant see any of the pits and holes the funny and creative game-creators have put there and after hours reach the foggate to the boss only for the message 'unable to enter because this game is garbage' to appear when you try to go in, 'the best souls-game' where youre now stuck in that pitch-black area, until you watch a guide on youtube to know that you have to do a 10 minute runback to a dead end (because you idiot didnt pull that specific hidden lever hours earlier) and stand on this specific spot (that isnt marked or indicated by anything and is literally rock-solid ground) in order for you to break through and fall down the next hole in order to get back to the bonfire you were at hours before (waisting your time with this area), 'the best souls-game' where all of this could have been avoided if it werent for the fun and engaging game-mechanic (being unique to bs1) that prevents fast-traveling between bonfires, 'the best souls game' where if you dont want a roll that takes 5 years and has no iframes (ie you want the normal roll like in the other 'not-best' souls-games) you have to be at under 25 fucking percent equipload meaning you either cant wear armor or have to pump souls into a stat you dont even want to level just to make the roll function properly (wich is something many people give ds2 shit for while praising this game as again the so-called 'best souls-game'), 'the best souls-game' where you all of a sudden cant upgrade your weapon any more, go to consult the internet and find a super useful and not at all convoluted or complicated organigram (im not making this shit up) that you have to study in order for you to know the exact upgrade-path that you have to take for your weapon, like it is a unique character with its own fucking skill-tree and motherfucking quest-line, like jesus christ fuck off game!!!!111!!1!!!!111!!

I could go on and on but my mainpoint is this:
Most of the time I am not actually fighting the enemies or bosses but just the game (or its stupid mechanics) itself. 
To be honest most enemies/bosses dont put up a big fight anyway (and im saying this with the self-awareness of being not the best souls-player). Normally I get the biggest adrenaline-rush fighting bosses in souls-games but in this game it just feels like a slowass fight between old people. Wich is something that drags throughout the whole game. I know its an old game but still, this is supposed to be a 'remastered version' so why does everything feel so painfully slow, janky and well...not remastered at all?
I played through ds2 and ds3 and had a lot of fun doing so but this game is just trash. 
I will propably still finish it but definitely not blind (wich if you read my little adventure up there you know is something i wouldnt recommend anyone doing, wich is a shame tbh because I think thats how youre normally supposed to play these games and also how I had so much fun exploring/discovering things in ds2/3). 
Also this game is just way too expensive. Again, this game is not really 'remastered' so its essentially a more than 10 year old game that they still charge you 20 bucks (at least during the 2 times its on sale each year) for. Please just pay 10 bucks extra and get ds3 wich is actually the best souls-game. Thanks.

Compared to Prepare to Die Edition with Dsfix (mod), this behaves more like a PC game should.
The support for 60fps and the changes to multiplayer especially make this a far better experience.

Anti-cheat was the main point of contention in my original review, but since time has passed and the communities for this game and Dark Souls 3 have matured, it's become clear to me that it wasn't actually that big of a deal and that I no longer feel the same way about this game.
It is unclear if dropping cheated items and getting other players banned is still an issue, but this does not seem to be a common occurrence, and there are mods and utilities to get around the risk.

It is a bit unfortunate that some effects and textures were updated for the worse in the remaster, but that can thankfully be solved using mods.
Purely visual mods seem to be *somewhat* safe online, and it is now possible to approximate Prepare to Die Edition's appearance using them (though keep in mind that many non-visual mods are probably not safe online, and using any mods online is not recommended and done at your own risk).

As for the price, $40 would have been a rather steep asking price if this game didn't frequently go on sale. Don't buy this for full price, it's often 50% off and $20 is a more reasonable price.

In summary, this version is worth it and I'm glad to be wrong about it.


Original negative review:
[ This adds in the terrible anti-cheat from Dark Souls 3 which discourages modding in a game where modding already exists and mainly bans victims of cheaters rather than cheaters themselves.

Cheaters still exist and unsuspecting players can and will be tricked into a softban by picking up cheated items.

The anti-cheat was unacceptable in Dark Souls 3 and it is unacceptable now. ]",1527130668,1707778646,True,0,0,0.738884031772613525,20,True,False,False

I'm here just to be one of the millions of alienated Miyazaki fanboys that tells you to play this game no matter what.

If ""old"" games bother you, don't worry. Play some Elden Ring, Sekiro, Dark Souls 3 or whatever game fits your last gen gaming computer needs. You'll eventually develop a lust for this specific feeling that only Miyazaki knows how to make us feel.

This one right here though is definitely the goat, DS1 incorporates everything that makes a ""souls-like"" a souls-like (even though I hate the terminology).

I cannot recommend any game more highly than this one. In my opinion, it remains the supreme gateway to Dark Souls and the Soulsborne series, possibly with the exception of Elden Ring.

Maybe it will even give you a new mindset for achieving goals irl :)

This game and this remaster is worth your time and your money in 2024 and beyond. The game is good in 2023(when i played it twice) and it was probably great in 2011 when it first came out, there are some negatives tho and you need to be aware of them.

 First of all... 'Dark Souls' games come with a condition and that is 'Do you like a big challenge and a big reward?'. If you don't like a challenge let me tell you that the reward/satisfaction from clearing a level and beating a boss is the kind of experience that you will remember probably forever. These souls games give you those epic, unforgettable moments that is why they are worth it.

 Also please be aware that there is an easy mode for this game, its called summoning. You can summon npc help for bosses and even for level clears but for the real Dark Souls experience you should only summon if its your first run, the second run you should try to solo. Try to solo as much as you can even in the first run, when you see unfair parts or bosses go ahead and summon. Rewrote my review after my second FULLY SOLO run and 200+ hours of gameplay time.

[b]Positives:[/b]

- Great combat, deep combat
- Combos and energy management
- Satisfying kills on regular monsters
- Super satisfying/epic kills on bosses
- 200+ hours of content if you plan two runs(with summons/help for beginners + without summons for a better/deeper experience)
- Memorable levels
- Extremely memorable bosses, best in gaming
- Memorable boss fights especially if you SOLO them, strongly recommend
- Multiple classes available: paladin, barbarian, mage, rogue etc, are all viable
- Good selection of weapons and spells
- Weapons look realistic and are cool to use
- Easy mode option with summoning(better experience SOLO tho)
- Best levels/most memorable levels in gaming: Undead Burg + Cathedral, Anor Londo + Archives
- Good story if you dig for it or check youtube. Very cool lore characters in Dark Souls 1 like Gwyn and Artorias
- Best level inter-connectivity, example: FireLink Shrine connected to Cathedral -> can be seen in first 6 hours of the game
- Cool and memorable songs and themes, especially FireLink Shrine theme
- Great expansion(Artorias of the Abyss) with great bosses that are better than Dark Souls 2 bosses and are close to the bosses in Dark Souls 3.
- Graphics are almost decent in all levels, more in the next section

[b]Negatives:[/b]

- Graphics are decent in almost all the levels that are outside/above ground. The underground levels sadly in 2023 they look outdated, like the insides of a dumpster and these underground levels are very annoying the first time going in
- Some horrible underground levels that are hated by the whole souls community: Depths (a lot of kaka on the walls + rats) + Blight town (permanent poison + toxic enemies make it a nightmare), Lost Izalith (permanent lava) + Tomb of the Giants (no light, monsters that can stun lock and kill you)
- 'Narrow paths' BOSS - a lot of levels have a narrow path where you need to fight dragons, knights or ghosts and a wrong step means you fall to your death. The level beats you, the extremely narrow path beats you. This was removed in Dark Souls 3 but its still alive and well in Dark Souls 1
- 'Invisible paths' BOSS - Crystal caves, you need to reach a boss in a cave of narrow paths that are invisible, the invisible paths will kill you a lot.
- Some levels feel unfinished from an idea and monster placement + boss design perspective -> Lost Izalith, end game


 [b]Despite all it's flaws stated above the positives outweigh the negatives by a lot. This game is a MUST play for any RPG fan(DS3 too) and especially this is a MUST play for a newer 'Souls' player(play with summons the first time when you get stuck, the game can get unfair sometimes)[/b]",1577684737,1707389569,True,1,0,0.5144461989402771,0,True,False,False

of all the dark souls trilogy, this is the most tame and most easy in my opinion. yes, it can be daunting at first, but i find that parrying in this game is the easiest, the magic in this game is the most powerful, and the amount of weapons that can just shatter enemies to bits and pieces is rather high. i think this is the only dark souls game that the player could one shot every boss in the original version because of the ability to stack damage so much and enemies not having that much health. 
speaking of the original game, that game had so many glitches that could be exploited with such glitches enabling one shot runs. one of my favorite series of videos that a youtuber did was a series where they one shot bosses, and they utilized the frame perfect weapon moveset swap glitch to deal crazy damage to bosses. additionally, back in the day, players could gain a bunch of souls easily because of the confirmation box duplication glitch with boss souls. 
returning to the modern day of this version of the game, there are still problematic glitches in the game like stored rolls messing up landings and toggle escapes along with chain backstabs can stil ruin pvp. 
however, some glitches i find to be welcome improvements in making the game even more homely, like the new version of the duplication glitch. the new duplication glitch that works off of using stacks of items and overriding the amount of an item you have with another stack of an item is rather reminiscent of the old old duplication glitch that used an infinite item to use an item over and over again, tick by tick, in that the amount of souls the player gets is rather high and quick. 
rambling about glitches aside, i think that this game is always going to be great. the only issue i have is the lack of mods for this particular game as well as the second, which i hope each will have more in the future.

[h3] Introduction: [/h3]
Dark Souls Remastered ‚Äì because who doesn't want to die repeatedly in high definition? Get ready to laugh, cry, and hurl your controller across the room as this remastered edition brings back all the joyous frustration of the original, now with better graphics for you to admire while your character gets obliterated.

[h3] Gameplay [/h3]
The gameplay is as challenging as ever ‚Äì  Remember that time you thought you were getting the hang of it? Yeah, forget about that. They've rearranged enemies just to mess with you. You'll find yourself in uncharted territory, questioning your life choices.  Dark Souls Remastered retains the challenging and rewarding gameplay that has become a hallmark of the series. Combat remains as precise and methodical as ever, demanding mastery of each encounter. The interconnected world design seamlessly invites exploration, and the subtle changes in enemy placement keep even veterans on their toes.

[h3] Sounds and Atmoshpere [/h3]
The haunting melodies and atmospheric sounds remain untouched, providing the perfect background music for your existential crisis. It's like a horror movie, but you're the star, and the monsters are your self-esteem crumbling.  There is only a few places in the game that have background track, each one makes the atmosphere of the game interesting.  The remastered edition maintains the immersive audio experience, further enhancing the game's ability to draw players into its dark and foreboding universe.

[h3] Story [/h3]
The story of the game is vague.  It is made that way with intention making players fill in the gaps and create their own story in a way.  
In the twisted tapestry of Dark Souls Remastered's narrative, players are thrust into the enigmatic land of Lordran, a world steeped in mystery and despair. The story unfolds like an ancient tome, with fragments of lore scattered throughout the decaying landscapes and cryptic characters. As an Undead, cursed to roam this desolate realm, players navigate the interconnected realms, encountering grotesque creatures and formidable bosses. The narrative is a cryptic dance between light and dark, and each discovery adds a layer to the overarching mystery of the fading flame. Unraveling the lore is akin to deciphering an intricate riddle, with moments of profound revelation punctuating the relentless struggle for survival. Dark Souls Remastered invites players to delve deep into a narrative abyss, where the line between hero and villain blurs, and the weight of destiny rests heavily on the player's shoulders.

[h3] Conclusion [/h3]
Dark Souls Remastered ‚Äì the game that turns you into a comedian as you laugh in the face of your impending doom. With improved everything, it's the definitive way to rediscover the masochist in you. Just remember, in Lordran, you either die a hero or live long enough to see yourself die a thousand times.

Dark Souls has undeniably changed the video game landscape around it. If you enjoy games, its cultural importance alone makes it worthy of recommendation. Now having played it myself, I see two games. At its best, it offers satisfying combat and exploration which dances the line of tension and relief; at its worst, it is esoteric and tedious. 
	
Stamina-focused and methodical combat is FromSoftware‚Äôs most lasting legacy for good reason. It provides clear, immediate feedback on when the player has over-extended. The combat is not mechanically very deep but gains great depth in its situations which all need slightly different approaches. The flaws of a first game do emerge especially in areas where the game loves to put enemies in tight corridors or on cliffs. Weapons clanking off the walls might be realistic but that makes it all the more frustrating when I cannot simply swing my weapon differently in those areas. 
	
The game also does a poor job explaining core features like how magic works or the importance of equip loads. There are large segments of the game where navigating becomes a chore. While it has a lot of potential that later games undoubtedly build on, the first Dark Souls remains flawed.

Old age should burn and rave at close of day;
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

Though wise men at their end know dark is right,
Because their words had forked no lightning they
Do not go gentle into that good night.

Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright
Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay,
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight,
And learn, too late, they grieved it on its way,
Do not go gentle into that good night.

Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sight
Blind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay,
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

And you, my father, there on the sad height,
Curse, bless, me now with your fierce tears, I pray.
Do not go gentle into that good night.
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

What can I say about THE game, Dark Souls? This game isn't just a journey; it's an addiction, a unique experience that has repeatedly drawn me back into its hauntingly beautiful and treacherous world.

Sure, it's not without its quirks - there are some glitches here and there. But honestly, that's fine by me. These minor imperfections hardly detract from the overall brilliance of the game. In fact, in a way, they add to its charm, reminding players that perfection isn't the goal - perseverance is.

Dark Souls is more than just a game; it's a test of will, a trial by fire (and occasionally by some pretty terrifying dragons). It will humble you, make you stumble, and push you to your limits. But therein lies its beauty. It teaches resilience, strategy, and patience. Every defeat is a lesson, every victory a triumph worth celebrating.

I've journeyed through Lordran on multiple platforms - from the PS3 to the PS4, and now on Steam. Each playthrough brings new challenges, discoveries, and a deeper appreciation for its intricate design and storytelling. Chasing achievements on Steam has given me a fresh perspective and new goals to strive for.

In conclusion, what can I say? I am addicted to this masterpiece. Dark Souls isn't just a game to me; it's a testament to the art of gaming, a reminder of how engaging and immersive a video game can be. If you're ready to embrace its challenge, Dark Souls will offer you an unforgettable adventure that stays with you long after you've put down the controller.",1706783161,1706783161,True,3,0,0.548926591873168945,0,True,False,False

The entire dark souls trilogy is incredibly well written and the worldbuilding is incredible.  From Software is a company that I would poor my entire life savings into. This is a company that LOVES the games they create and it is very obvious.

The world in Dark Souls 1 is entirely interconnected (up until Anor Londo) and, even though this is a third person game, makes you feel so immersed into the game.  There were times during boss fights where I actually jumped and made grunts of pain from being hit or jumping/dodging away from an enemies attack.

This game has taught me valuable lessons that another person simply couldn't ever teach me and allows me to escape reality for a few hours.

If you're looking to get into this game, do it.  Just go in knowing you're going to fail and lose, just like in real life, this game does not hold your hand and forces you to think for yourself and navigate a world without a tutorial (or atleast, without a given tutorial level) and the way the game starts in the Northern Undead Asylum is done perfectly: albeit, a little frustrating for new players of souls-like games.

after what is arguably one of the most iconic boss fights in gaming this game seemingly goes from a 9/10 to 3/10 in the blink of an eye, it's almost shocking how people will say that you shouldn't bother with DS2 because it has cheap gotcha kills and bad level design only to suggest you should play DS1, in my experience DS1 is endlessly more clunky and frustrating and I spent near enough 50 hours in 2 and only ran into to like two or three instances in which the way the game was designed actually frustrated, whereas with this game, every single level leading up to one of the big 4 at the end of the game was either actively trying to piss you off while padding out run time, or, had a boss that made you want to pitch your controller at a wall.

I cannot recommend this game to anyone, the clunky controls combined with the below average late game overshadowed & ultimately ruined all the fun I did have prior to finishing up Anor Londo and I cannot for the life of me understand how it is people are willing to overlook how bad the last third of this game is, but, will endlessly rag on DS2 for stuff like ""bad hitboxes and annoying enemies"" as if DS1 doesn't have the exact same issue's.

generally I can push through quite a bit of bs and beat a game before coming to any concrete conclusions about it but not this one, I understand that in 2011 this would have been THE rpg to play and that there wasn't anything else like it but, guess what, it isn't 2011 anymore and I genuinely believe this game needs serious critical reevaluation or at least hold it to the same standards and criticisms as other games not just in the series but in the genre.
between a remaster that really hasn't remastered anything of note, frame drops on modern hardware when there is no good reason for there to be any and an end game that'll leave you wanting to pull your hair out, I'd say this game needs a remake more than upgrading some textures and ignoring all the bugs/exploits that as I understand it have been in the game since its launch...

if you do play it, god forbid you criticise the end game on the subreddit, and don't you dare compare it to either of the 2 other games in the series, I had the displeasure of saying the other games' worlds kept me engaged through the rougher parts of them and the amount of backhanded ""advice"" and talking down to I'd received was both hilarious & frustrating.

I so desperately wanted to understand why it is people talk so highly about Dark Souls 1 and just as I was beginning to I found myself being repelled by the game, rather than coming away from the game loving it I've just been disappointed time and time again honestly.
out of all the videos and written reviews I've seen they all gloss over lost izalith, tomb of giants and the dukes archive as if they don't exist and most of these reviewers have absolutely ragged on other games for design choices that pale in comparison to what goes on in these areas but proudly hold DS1 up as a masterpiece even though there is enough here that is wrong, at least in my mind, that it doesn't deserve that level of praise, it is good, some parts of it is great but this game is so deeply flawed from my experience.

I may actually finish the game some time in the future and if I do and my opinion changes I'll update the review but as of right now, it gets a negative rating, I really wish had a third rating option (like so many other people have said before) because somewhere between a positive and negative review is where this game lands for me.",1706427713,1706427713,False,3,0,0.471077978610992432,8,True,False,False

The second half of the game has, some problems. If you've done any of your research, most people would probably agree. Since I'm writing this without spoilers, I can't give specific examples, but here are some of the problems:

-Worsened Level Design
People believe this could be due to pressure from Bandai, but all of the levels feel so much worse than the first half. Along with less shortcuts and or longer boss runs (the latter not necessarily being a bad thing), the designs are much more basic. For example, the second area most players experience has so many buildings, nooks and crannies to explore, whereas the later areas have very straight walkways, which either lead to the way forward or a chest. One of the areas had quite interesting level design, but it's gimmick/s made it easy to hate.

-Underwhelming/Aggravating bosses
The bosses in the first half aren't nearly as grand as some of the later entries in the series. However, they felt about right considering their place in the world. The second half of the game requires you to fight some, lore-wise, much stronger bosses, but there are a lot of problems. There are certain bosses I actually like in the second half of the game, but one of them could be considered the worst boss of the series, heavily relying on RNG. The rest feel underwhelming, but can also be extremely punishing, to a point I would also consider to be unfair.

There are some things I like about the second half. The build variety really opens up around this part of the game, including the boss weapons. Also, I really like the concepts for the areas, They're all very different from each other and the rest of the game.

The DLC, which can only be accessed during the second half and is often played at the end of a player's journey, is very good. The level design was an improvement from the second half, but I still preferred the original sections. The bosses however, are great! Each of them were enjoyable, fair and provided a good challenge. The clunky-ness of Dark Souls 1 definitely affected how cool these bosses are compared to the newer games, but nonetheless they were very fun. Also, since it's included in this version of the game, you might as well play it!

I'd 100% recommend playing this game, though. Even with a mid tier second half, Dark Souls 1 is definitely up there in my favourite games of all time! The remaster is slightly expensive, so I'd probably wait for a discount, but if you have the money, go for it!

The way the game world is interconnected is incredibly refreshing and often surprising. Many locations are stunning and offer great visuals. On top of that the combat is, beside a bit of jank, really fun and great. Most bosses are decent but a few are simply amazing and there are only a few bad ones, most of which are in a single area of the game.

Overall an incredible experience with a super satisfying gameplay loop and world. All of this is tied together by some of the most interesting lore in all of gaming.

    Dark Souls 1 e o Comando Vermelho, duas entidades que √† primeira vista parecem distintas, mas ao observarmos de perto, percebemos surpreendentes semelhan√ßas.

Ambos t√™m reputa√ß√µes tem√≠veis, sendo venerados por alguns e temidos por muitos. Dark Souls 1 √© conhecido por sua dificuldade implac√°vel, enquanto o Comando Vermelho √© famoso por sua presen√ßa marcante no mundo do crime. Ambos deixam uma impress√£o duradoura, embora por raz√µes bastante diferentes.

A narrativa de Dark Souls 1 √© como um quebra-cabe√ßa complexo, exigindo dedica√ß√£o e paci√™ncia para ser totalmente compreendida. De maneira semelhante, a hist√≥ria do Comando Vermelho muitas vezes √© obscurecida por camadas de mitos urbanos e uma cultura de sigilo. Em ambos os casos, voc√™ precisa cavar fundo para desvendar os mist√©rios.

A jogabilidade implac√°vel de Dark Souls 1, onde a morte √© inevit√°vel e parte integrante do aprendizado, encontra paralelos no estilo de vida do Comando Vermelho, onde a sobreviv√™ncia muitas vezes envolve enfrentar desafios quase insuper√°veis.

A conectividade online em Dark Souls 1 e a rede complexa de alian√ßas e rivalidades no Comando Vermelho compartilham uma caracter√≠stica fundamental: a imprevisibilidade. Em ambos os casos, voc√™ pode ser surpreendido a qualquer momento, seja por um invasor habilidoso ou por um s√∫bito desenvolvimento no submundo.

Por fim, o design de n√≠veis labir√≠ntico de Dark Souls 1 ecoa a complexa estrutura do Comando Vermelho, onde ruas estreitas e becos sinuosos se tornam terrenos f√©rteis para estrat√©gias e emboscadas.

Em resumo, Dark Souls 1 e o Comando Vermelho podem pertencer a mundos diferentes, mas compartilham uma aura de desafio, mist√©rio e uma reputa√ß√£o que transcende o comum. Ambos exigem coragem para explorar e, ao faz√™-lo, revelam-se experi√™ncias que deixam marcas duradouras.",1706119312,1706119312,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

If you want good environmental storytelling, check out Metroid, that's a series that's really good with it. Dark Souls however is nowhere near that. So I suppose like I said, this game objectively may be good, but it's nowhere near conversation for the best game ever and anyone who says it is has to be either high on copium or has spent so much time wasting their life on this game that they want to justify their playtime by claiming it's a masterpiece.

While there is one infamous boss that appears 3 times with a different color palette, there arent any other bosses like that. theres also 3 bosses that appear as regular enemies later in the game(but that area has already been criticized enough). Every boss except for those i mentioned are very unique, while for a certain boss, that isnt a good thing, usually it is. But enough about the bosses. The enemy variety is so good, theres always something new to see in areas, you dont just fight the same enemies with different clothing or weapon.

The ""Artorias of the Abyss"" DLC comes with the remaster and its really good with some of the games best and hardest bosses.

Your money is likely better spent on a newer FromSoft game, such as Elden Ring (phenomenal - easily my goty for 2022) or Sekiro (playing through right now and is pretty baller so far).

It's slower, it's clunky, and it's darker, but the same mechanics apply in Elden Ring as in this game.

I think Dark Souls 3 is a better game but in Dark Souls 1 the bosses feel more unique and the world just has a magical feeling to it which Dark Souls 3 lacks (Ik that's on purpose).

I played Dark Souls so much back in the day on ps3 and was happy to pick up the remastered version here on PC. It runs smoothly and plays pretty well. If you're a souls fan then the remastered version delivers exactly what you'd expect. Dark Souls but again, this time remastered with a fresh coat of polish. 

For those who haven't played Dark Souls, I employ anyone who is a fan of any kind of action adventure rpgs, or any of the other Souls games, to pick up Dark Souls Remastered. Buts it's super difficult, right??? Nah, the souls games difficulty has honestly been meme'd far into outer space. Yes the game is more difficult then most action adventure rpgs but it's not nearly as impossible as some like to play it off as. So don't let that scare you away. The game can just demand a bit of actual learning and ingenuity. There are so many different ways to tackle problems, enemies and bosses in this game. Various weapons that deal different types of damage, sorceries, pyromancies, miracles, etc. If one thing doesn't work then try another. All in all I highly recommend Dark Souls Remastered. Whether you're a Souls veteran and you've somehow skipped this one or a newcomer to the series, the game offers a challenging and rewarding experience. It really does feel amazing to finally get that last hit in on a boss that may have been giving you trouble. Remember to never give up and just keep trying. You got infinite lives anyways.

P.S. My only gripe with the first Dark Souls in general is still the Bed of Chaos. That boss just isn't fun to fight at all. It's not a difficult fight, it's just very very annoying. A single blemish on what otherwise has become one of my favorite games.

I'm being totally serious with the latter, I reported an asshole using View-Bots, which have very similar patterns across a wide range of users, for years to boost his viewership and harassing those that don't even interact with him, yet Bandai, making some of the most hyped games with huge teams behind them, could never see what I, all on my own, had seen?

These NINE Bots all stole from [u][url=https://www.youtube.com/@bIuecrimson]bluecrimson[/url][/u], whom made these Videos 9 years ago, and look at the Channel Creation Dates of the last 4 on that list, they were made in February 2020 and only 6 days apart at most from one and another.  I had witnessed yet more stupid garbage like this, so much I'm still making a Series out of it.  This is the type of crap Bandai is unable to see, really?  I can't make it more obvious something's off, they're condoning it like YouTube is what this is.

Also, they keep putting out utterly bad products like Jump Force.  It's not FromSoftware I may have issues with, but I no longer have faith Bandai Namco has the best intentions anymore, they are like the others, taking advantage of the system of awful Influencers on SheeTube to promote garbage and/or using the bad clout as it's still good clout and publicity.

Elden Ring was my introduction to Souls-like games, and I liked that so much that I decided to come back and try Dark Souls. Despite being a much older game, it was still a great, polished game. The world design is iconic. The way it is so big but so beautifully compact and interconnected is a work of art. It starts off being so overwhelming, and then as you get familiar with the layout you can traverse the map so quickly. The exploration is extremely satisfying. The combat feels good. It was a bit tough going from the jumping of Elden Ring back to the more 2-dimensional combat, but it still feels good - challenging but fair.

Having only played through it once, build variety is hard to assess. I know that tanky melee builds work well, and that sorcery builds can be very strong as well. It doesn't seem like dexterity, status effects, archery, and some of those other builds are quite as viable as they are in elden ring, but maybe i just need to get more familiar with them.

One other down side is the inflexibility. There isn't any way to respec your character, so you're a bit locked in by your early game build choices. That's even true when you go into New Game +. It would be cool to be able to respec and play the game differently on subsequent plays without starting from scratch, but this is a minor complaint.

All told, this game is an iconic classic, and I would highly recommend to anyone. It's not as hard as people make it out to be.

This is my first ever review, but since everyone seems to criticize the remastered version for being an overpriced patch and I just wanted to know if the game is a good choice for newcomers, I wanted to share my toughts on the game as someone who has no nostalgia connected to it. 

I have never played a Dark Souls game before (Elden Ring was my introduction) and never thought I ever will (too hard, too frustrating), but since Elden Ring is my favourite gaming experience since The Witcher 3 and Red Dead Redemption 2, I thought I finally had to give it a try (discount...). And although Elden Ring pulled my in right from the start, Dark Souls 1 never really reached me. The mechanics, erratic questlines, weird npcs and the interconnected world - it is all there, but (for me) Elden Ring is just the way superior experience. In every aspect.

Even though I - of course - did not expect it to be as good as ER, I still was disappointed. I don't really know why I never really enjoyed the game, but one reason is that there is almost never any music, which in ER greatly enhanced the atmosphere for me. In Dark Souls 1 the only things you hear are your own too loud footsteps and the monsters/fight sounds. That can be immersive in tight dark corridors - but it never was for me. The parts I liked the most were the very first area (dark clouds, a fallen castle, thunder rumbling in the background: excellent), and the very last area (mostly because of the visuals). Here the game really shines.

Speaking of visuals: usually, I do not care much about graphics, especially if it is a game from 2011, but I have to say, except from the lighting in some areas: this game does not look good, especially the late game areas reminded me of Gothic 1, a (great) game from 2001, that was already graphically outdated when it was released. In DS1 many areas are pretty big, but also feel pretty empty. I don't want to spoil anything, but often they are just bland: too huge (but of course smaller than in ER) to really fill them, so you have some items and some enemies here and there and that's it. I never was fully intrigued by this world and was never motivated to think about the story of this decaying land as I was in Elden Ring, where every part of the world seems to breathe story and atmosphere. The same thing is said about Dark Souls 1, but at least I did not have this impression.

My biggest concern before playing was the difficulty. After playing Elden Ring (and Sekiro) the game is pretty manageable. The bosses almost move in slow-mo compared to the two and should not give you too much trouble, if you have played ER or Sekiro. But even here, the game could not convince me. While ER felt like a fair and rewarding challenge, the gameplay in DS1 often just annoyed me due to just annoying design choices. In one notorious area for example 1 hit (arrow) of a certain enemy type is enough to change your status into toxic - at the beginning of the area. Have fun to explore and fight! The said enemies don't respawn and you can use an item against it (if you know about it), but it is still a cheap way to artificially increase a difficulty that is not challenging but often simply annoying. Another example: you can get a curse that halves your HP, even after you died - good luck finding a cure. Not to speak of one of the most annoying boss fights in video game history. Many will say that this is the typical Dark Souls experience and it certainly is. But ER never annoyed me this way, while still being an actual challenge (learn movesets) and providing a breathing and mysterious world.
 
Just a noob perspective. I only finished it once and I do not know if I will ever play it again. So why still the thumbs up? Because I absolutely love Elden Ring and can acknowledge its promising beginning in DS1.",1694423859,1705406136,True,7,0,0.537027478218078613,0,True,False,False

If you're a fan of the series, you know that there's plenty of games in this vein that might scratch the itch better. They play faster or more agressively. They executed different design ideas, or have an interesting setting. This game popularized the subgenre started by it's predecessor, Demon's Souls, which remains a Sony exclusive to this day. Dark Souls fleshes out more of the ideas set forth in the previous game and gives you a well-crafted, seamless world where you can traverse beautiful castle landscapes, to dark, dreary catacombs, to oceans of lava and fire, and everything in between.

People say it's hard, and it's not. The game gives you more than enough tools to complete it. The fun is in sticking to it and seeing how far you progress.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and we adopted our son together. Both are now 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I felt lost and unhappy. I was self-destructive. One day, I was so angry with everything spiraling out of control that I punched a concrete wall in a moment of overwhelming emotion. This resulted in breaking my fifth metacarpal in my right hand‚Äîthe hand I worked with, played games with, and used to carry my children to bed‚Äîthe hand I desperately needed to ensure I could continue providing.

Upon learning the severity of the self-inflicted damage, I became almost suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man, with no history of depression or anxiety. I had never experienced anger outbursts, nor was I the type to break down and cry, but I was in a tough situation that truly prevented me from seeing the light on the other side.

With nothing better to do, I looked for a game I could play WITH ONE HAND while recovering. Somehow, I stumbled upon this game and read some of the comments. I decided it was worth a try... I must admit I didn't beat the game, nor did I play as much as some of you. In fact, I may have played this game for only a day or two. That being said, after doing so, I had a new joy and hope for life. I managed to leave behind the pain and suffering that had been thrust upon me. I could experience the joy and happiness of other people. I relaxed for 5 ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• minutes listening to this music, long enough to realize that I would be okay.

After realizing this, I turned off the game and went back to work. My hand hurt a lot, but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so sorry for myself and became the father I needed to be at that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving like.

Today, I am close friends with the mother of my children. We don't fight, argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents and friends.

Now I have 3 children. My third child is, wait, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my separation, and we just unexpectedly stumbled into each other's lives. We have been dating for a year and are very happy together.

Moral of the story: you never know what life has in store for you, and if I had given up when all odds were against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

I come from the land of easy-to-play baby games that don't challenge you very much if at all. I had zero interest in playing anything even remotely difficult, so when this one was suggested to me, as a streamer, I could not have been less excited about it. But after a little convincing, I decided to take up the mantle.

After advancing past the ""first"" boss and second boss with some 50+ deaths, I had had maybe no less than two or three emotional breakdowns. Dark Souls has touched me in a way no other game has - in that it not only challenged me, but it completely obliterated my fragile, inflated ego. It magnified my skill issues and forced me to swallow the cold, bitter truth - I needed to get good. Not just at the game, but being able to accept that I sucked SO HARD at something. I contemplated throwing my controller down and giving up a handful of times, but something just kept on pulling me back. I didn't want to admit defeat.

After keeping at it and figuring out some of the basic game mechanics, such as dodge rolling and blocking, etc, I slowly started to not only not mind the endless amounts of deaths I would be punished with, but I was actually *enjoying* it. I wanted to explore every nook and cranny, find every secret, learn about the enemies, the lore, the NPC's. The world is beautiful, the characters are memorable, and the combat, while difficult, is so satisfying when you do get the hang of it.

While Dark Souls has given me many rage-inducing screams of frustration and agony, it has also given me many shouts of victory and laughing fits over the stupid ways I've died or watched enemies fall off cliffs. But above all else, it has given me the gift of humility, something no other game has. It taught me to be patient, observant, and persevere.

A game I once wanted to stay as far away from me as possible now sits in my library as one of my most favorite titles of all time. And I look forward to playing the other games in the series as well! Thank you for helping me grow, FromSoftware. Not just as a gamer, but as a person, too.

The jump button is by default the same button as sprinting, and I found out literally while typing this review that I can rebind it. So that's a me problem, so here's just a PSA for anyone else thinking it's annoying to accidentally jump face first into an axe when you're trying to dodge it.

While locked onto enemies you only have 4 dimensional rolling; meaning no diagonal dodges. This will cause you to accidentally roll directly into the enemies if your joystick was slightly angled more up than left/right. This also makes fighting enemies on a bridge specifically awkward, as you can't slightly roll left or right by going diagonally forward or backwards.
You're also unable to sprint while locked on. I don't think I need to tell you why this is frustrating for somebody that is used to more fast paced souls-likes, so you better get comfortable switching between locking on and unlocking from enemies depending on the situation. I'd honestly recommend not locking on bosses at all until the exact moment you're about to attack.

Enemies have pretty weak tracking, so by simply side strafing or running behind them, will cause them to miss the majority of attacks. Unfortunately, you have the same issue. Gonna charge up a strong attack with an ultra greatsword? Better hope they don't move one frame to the side.

A couple of bosses has sadly wasted potential and a few copy-pastes here and there. One late game area in particular feels very rushed. Controls are a bit janky with frustratingly slow animations, (but this game was made before even vine, so not the same ADHD tiktok attention span brain rot back then, so gets a slight pass on this one.)
Bosses are too easy imo, leaving me pretty underwhelmed after first trying most of them. I had way more difficulties with the titanite demon in the catacombs hallway than any of the bosses in the entire game combined.

So why am I recommending it? Because I love DS3. To be fair, most of my complaints are from having played the later games that are objectively more hardcore and fast paced, so I'm trying to see this game for what it was when it first came out.

There's a lot of visually stunning areas in this game, interesting NPC's and a fascinatingly interconnected world. For a game without fast travel for the most part, I really thought I'd be missing it way more. But it just works really well. Every time you find a shortcut you'll be amazed by how it connects and loops around the game world.
Sure, it can be annoying sometimes having to backtrack a lot if you want to go back and check something, and sometimes it would discourage me from going back up to pick up an item I missed, but it's not a major issue overall. I personally love running around and getting familiar with the areas. (except that one town)

DS3 is one of my favorite games ever, and I love discovering interesting connections with this game. So if anything, playing this game has enhanced my love and appreciation of DS3 even more. And that fact alone makes this game worth playing, even in 2024.",1704951035,1704951035,True,2,0,0.509803950786590576,0,True,False,False

Enemies are bad, and bosses are even worse. Yes I've not played the whole game as you can see by my hour count, but I just cannot continue, I'm getting so annoyed playing this, because enemies are all a pain in the ass and just not enough interesting to make me willing to defeat them, and bosses are just so easy that there is no reward in defeating them. Overall, the game is boring and clunky in it's gameplay. YES it is gorgeous artistically, but if gameplay sucks, I think I'll just watch a youtube walkthrough of it skipping the boring parts, saving hours of my life that can be dedicated to other games.
And to those who say ""yeah it's an old game of course the commands and mechanics are worse than all the games that came after this"" I'm sorry but games like the original Ratchet and Clank trilogy are 10 years older than this, and still far better in every aspect gameplay-wise. I cannot just forgive this game because it's old.

Edit: just watched the entire game on youtube, I have to say there are some great moments, and this game is artistically a masterpiece. Too bad I was unlucky and my experience was just terrible.

I only swung greatswords and polearms around but the weight of their attacks are nice. Enemies do a lot of damage including random non-boss monsters so getting your head around this is pretty much the only hurdle to overcome. Once you're over it and like the gameplay enough, you're in for a treat.

I only really liked about 5 out of the 20 or so bosses. I think the DLC bit is absolutely incredible and only really has one boss that's less than great, but the rest of the game just feels weird. I wouldn't say it feels unfinished towards the end, but bosses like Bed of Chaos and Gravelord Nito just don't feel right to me. There's always one small mistake with most bosses, like weird hitboxes, enemies in the boss room, and overall if this is your first souls game, I'd suggest starting with Dark Souls III or Elden Ring. This game just feels clunky and janky a lot, and a lot of basic things could be fixed with things like mods, but overall I think it's worthwhile to play.

I'm at level 40, tackling Sen's Fortress, and I can't believe how awesome this game is. The difficulty is real, but it's not just about dying over and over. It's about the thrill of making progress, the surprises around every corner, and the sweet taste of victory when you finally beat a tough part.

The level design is like nothing I've ever seen. Everything connects seamlessly, and there are secrets everywhere. No map? At first, I was like, ""What the heck?"" But now, it's one of the coolest things. Getting lost is part of the fun, and finding a bonfire feels like discovering a hidden treasure.

I get why people rave about Dark Souls now. The world is crazy interconnected, and it all just clicks. Different enemies keep you on your toes, forcing you to mix up your strategies.

Anyway, stop what you're doing and play this game. Seriously. It's a wild ride, and I'm kicking myself for not playing it sooner. It's easily one of the best games ever.",1704540353,1704540353,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Dark souls I is unique, it offers an experience I have rarely seen elsewhere. I absolutely recommend to NOT watch playthrough as a big part of the experience comes from discovery. It doesn't have incredible graphics but certainly doesn't need to. If you're searching a game with good interconnected level-design with a very addictive fighting system and unique mechanics you are looking for the good game. I would recommend playing through this game at least twice be cause you WILL miss a lot on your first playthrough.

If it is the difficulty stopping you then don't fear. This game is hard, you will lose sanity sometimes (this game is one of the few to make me lose my mental, even if I'm usually very calm) but the key is perseverance. The game sometimes feels unfare and just here to annoy you, but actually looking back I liked the difficulty. It would not be the same game if it was not so hard. Sure you find new armors to wear, weapons to wield and level up, but in reality you only really forge your experience, knowledge and skills. Everything seems hard until you memorize, react, dodge, attack at the right moment against this one boss that was once an incredible wall. Learn from yourself (not guide as they kind of ruin the experience).

If this comment happens to convice you to buy the game then have a good time with it, and, most importantly, pray you don't go Hollow !

However, as this was one of the first, its experimentation and introduction of relatively innovative mechanics came with so many issues to compliment the extraordinary, ultimately resulting in an experience that is diluted by tedium in a range i would arguably describe as 20% exceptional, 80% monotonous  

Inherently when experimenting with the first of anything (car, bike, software, hardware) there are very obvious flaws that are highlighted and buffered out in later iterations, understandably though this is the first iteration and is riddled with said problems, the primary issues all result in horrific compromises in pacing, progression and mapflow, making the game feel odd.

The main problems are ultimately due to the ambitious pursuit to make the game heavily based on exploration and self discovery: you aren't taught fundamental mechanics or aims, where to go, what to do, why you're doing it: this is both from a narrative and game-play point of view and this makes first playthrough unpleasant without any external information... the main kicker to this problem is the game is very specifically paced: it expects you to know where to go, what to do, why you're doing it and this is one of the most substantial factors to why this game is horrifically paced... you'll find yourself asking ""how was i supposed to know to kill this guy"" or ""why did i have to do this in that order"" ""am i the right level for this"" as you accidentally stumble into one of the most lategame regions at the start: you'd think this is the ""joy"" to exploring a harsh world but from a progression standpoint the game STOPS you from playing it if you dont do it exactly how they expect. ""you didnt speak to this background character inbetween this fight and this fight, youve ruined the arch"" without any indication, ""you cant progress until you do this incredibly odd, complicated thing or travel to an incredibly odd location in the background:"" later iterations of this formula such as elden ring polish this idea, allowing these exploration things to be entirely optional without compromising your game or pacing, and it also explains what you need to do and why: this game doesn't hold your hand and expects you to follow their exact instructions without any instructions: its vague and poorly executed. If you dont play with an external, third party guide your experience will suck: but in an exploration, adventure game: the very LAST thing you want is a guide... you want to work stuff out for yourself but it feels too essential to not have one due to the unclear pacing of this game

The next issue is repetition: the game-play really can get monotonous and not in a conventional souls-like perspective... fans often quote something in the sense of ""the game wants you to learn and study a route/fight to perfection in order to obtain victory"" and this can be a fun feature if you are actively being taught from trial and error. But this game has alot of dull segments of backtracking, not learning anything new each experience just suffering the same walk or sequence over and over, this is partially due to relatively poor bonfire placement / map design issues, resulting in large backtracks, but also just some segments really overstaying their welcome 

The engine also feels reminiscent of something like bethesda: where all their games feel kinda clunky, floaty and unresponsive but supposedly people like this feel... idk this is a subjective thing for me but it just feels so rough i cant be the only one.

I'm absolutely sure this game could be some fun to people that have devoted their gaming experiences exclusively to theses titles: with the knowledge of these mechanics it could be great. but not the first playthrough... I barely want to touch a second: the game floods me with an overwhelming feeling of boredom for the most part but the pull to play again and again is due to that other 20%

The world-building, the cinematic experience, music, atmosphere is all exceptional... actually some of the best in any game ive played and these few highlights can make we want to slog through the other 80% : highlights being the sif fight and in dark souls 3 the dancer of boreal valley. it carries the experience and ALMOST makes me want to thumbs up this game... but i honestly cant bring myself to it: the game brings me pain from a ""its so unfun to play."" i dabble with sometimes excruciatingly difficult games (much harder ones than many souls like) so i dont think its a ""skill issue."" but more just a complete sense of  disinterest with the generic base mechanics that the added frustration in pacing, progression and exploration make it overall: a game i dont enjoy

my brain likes to remember the positive highlights of a game so i will potentially be drawn back to these games for that 20%... On a huge positive note: games such as remnant, hollow knight, darksiders and many others have been birthed thanks to the existence to these early games: ones that in my subjective opinion have refined these issues with monotony and incoherent progression almost entirely out of them",1704139805,1704528163,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Although sometimes quite jank in feel and gameplay, the first installment of the Dark Souls series holds up in other regards, such as atmosphere, its use of music, voice acting, exploration and overall worldbuilding. 

Most of the story is either shown visually, implied or simply written in the description of an item you pick up. Like the world, the game asks you to seek things out off of your own curiosity, should you have any.

The pacing of player combat is quite slow, but hardly will you ever feel outpaced by enemies, even when using a colossal weapon. 

It's difficult, but fair and encouraging, as well as rewarding, to learn.

Dark Souls to me is not a masterpiece however - some bosses are either buggy or downright tedious, but thankfully I can only really think of two great offenders of this throughout the whole game (Bed of Chaos, Ceaseless Discharge).

I can't speak for PvP, as I have no interest in it in this game nor do I intend on trying it.

If you're willing to get over the somewhat-dated graphics and elementary combat, but interested in the world this game offers, give this a go.",1704398062,1704398962,True,1,1,0.511149227619171143,0,True,False,False

UPDATE 2024-01-04: changed to dislike. Mainly due to the above reason ""where to go"". I am fed up with constantly Alt-Tabbing to find out where I need to go. The game simply doesn't have a plot.

Hell, even people who aren't into it should try this game. Beating it kind of changes your perspective on gaming as a whole.

[strike] The reason for the ""not recommended"" is simply to raise awareness for the PC servers still being down 2 months after a gamebreaking bug was discovered. However, apparently there was a community fix within a few days, yet FromSoft still hasn't implemented a fix into the games and turned the servers back on. It was understandable that they were prioritising Elden Ring at first, but it's gone on long enough. Give multiplayer back.

Will change this review when servers are back up. [/strike]",1650392192,1704343874,True,0,0,0.555732667446136475,0,True,False,False

I expressed that I was tired with how easy most video games had become. She nodded, understanding my plight and asked what games were my favorite. I was eclectic and had a wide range so she assumed I was a hardcore gamer, but what I did not divulge was that I was a dabbler, a poser, a hack who only played other games when World of Warcraft would briefly lose its luster. She walked over to the wall and picked up a game I hadn't heard of before - ""Demons Souls"". She talked about how difficult it was how the story was a puzzle, every enemy was a boss fight, and the sense of accomplishment I would have after beating a boss. Excitedly, I paid and hurried home to try out this amazing sounding game. I progressed doggedly through the tutorial, got to the nexus, and progressed onto Boletaria where I immediately hated everything about the game. Disappointed, I turned off the PS3 and never returned to Demons Souls, my passion for WoW reignited.

Several years later, some of my coworkers were talking one afternoon, about a new game sweeping the gamer landscape.
""What game are you guys talking about?"", I asked.
""Dude, it's called 'Dark Souls'. It's fucking awesome, hard as shit though"", they replied.
""Nice, is it on Steam?""
""Yup, it sucks though. It's way better on PS3.""
Damn, I thought, I just got rid of mine. I wasn't deterred though, thinking I was a real gamer. I knew with persistence I could overcome jank and bugs. Hell, one of my all time favorite games at this point was Morrowind. As soon as I could, I purchased it, ""Dark Souls: Prepare to Die Edition"". That sounded metal, it had to be good. After a brief wait for the download, I was good to go and quickly booted it up. If I could somehow find a way to express the confusion and frustration at trying to figure out the keyboard and mouse controls, what the menus meant, what anything was, I would be a far better storyteller. But all I can say was after ten-ish mintues, I was done. Uninstalled and never to return.

Fast forward 10 years. Life had changed drastically for me. I was several years divorced, I had a few promotions at work, got to do some awesome projects that really tested my professional capabilities, made some mistakes, got fired and was trying to pick up pieces. I had met someone new and special, we moved in together and I was getting my life back on track. One of my newest hobbies was investing random moments into video game lore. Legend of Zelda, Warcraft, Diablo, Metal Gear Solid, Final Fantasy, etc., all the universes of all of my favorite games I had begun taking headlong dives into to divine the game series with the best and most rich stories. This, of course, was primarily accomplished through essay-format videos on YouTube. One day, a video suggestion for the ""Dark Souls Remasterd"" popped up.
'Ugh', I thought, 'that game sucked'.
But curiosity got the better of me and the sweet soothing voice of Vaatividya began to ooze out of my headphones. The story of Lord Gwyn punctuated with snippets of Dylan Thomas' ""Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night"" immediately had me enraptured. I was sucked in at the depth and complexity of the lore. Every one of Vaati's videos had me enthralled and the crushing feelings of loneliness, death, and desperation were drawn out elegantly. I watched all of them, every single one, multiple times. After several weeks of gushing over the videos, I finally bought the Remaster. And unlike all the other attempts at FromSoftware games, I couldn't stop playing this time.

I love this game. Praise the Sun.

I actually felt like i knew a lot about the game but about 3-4 hours into the game i was shocked at how much was here and how wonderful the experience was. 


as for how it holds up against the other souls games.... not fantastic, it left me feeling like demon souls, just not really intrested in playing again right away, compared to bloodborne where i wanted to play more immediately and still play that game very frequently. I do plan on doing a second play through in a couple years but as it is right now there wasnt a lot in the game that left me wanting to do it again, there were maybe 4 bosses, 2 of them being in the dlc portion of the game, that i feel a desire to fight again and the rest id rather not fight them ever again. which is unfortunate however still a good game and would highly reccomend!

p.s. I dont think Bed of Chaos is really that bad, sure hes annoying and confusing but once you know whats going on you kinda just get through it, i thought it would be a big stumbling block in progression purely out of jank, but it was fine hes not even one that im worried about having to face off with again",1704251719,1704251719,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Although in my opinion it doesn't come close to Elden Ring, its still a really good game. I liked its simplicity with the only exception being the weapon upgrade system which I found to be unnecessarily complex. The atmosphere of the game is unmatched, just in the character creation screen the music makes you feel like you are about to embark on a mysterious adventure. Even though theres very little music at all, every area in the game feels completely distinct and unique. And like Souls games are, the gameplay is perfect, its been said before and I dont need to explain how they nailed it.

My only issue with the game is that although most of the game is great, the only reason this doesn't get a 100 is because of how annoying and padded out the last third of the game is. *SPOILERS UNTIL NEXT PARAGRAPH* Right after Anor Londo, every boss afterward up until seathe and gwen are all gimmicky and annoying as shit, Nito, Firesage Demon, Bed of Chaos, the entire Duke's Archives level. I used so many walkthrough videos at this part its ridiculous. If they had just cut everything between meeting Gwynevere and fighting Gwyn, it would've been a perfect game.

DS Remastered has several missions, some are optional and others depend on your decisions. It has two endings of the player's choice and a dlc called Artorias of the Abyss which is highly recommended and worth it.
If I had to tell you what I liked and what I didn't, I would start by telling you what I didn't like. At first, you can't teleport between bonfires (which is essential to not waste time going back and forth, especially when the distances are long) but later as you progress in the story you can teleport yourself from one place to another. The good thing is its story, its dark narrative where the world is on the brink of extinction and the characters suffer different tragedies.
Graphically it looks amazing, especially when you get to Anor Londo. Personally, I had a pretty bad time in the Fortress of Sen and Crystal Cave, where you don't know what to do and it's full of traps.
The game has a message of perseverance and improvement, since it invites us to learn from our mistakes and not give up in the face of adversity, thus being a life lesson, I would say, in my opinion, the most valuable.",1704226545,1704226545,True,17,0,0.667785227298736572,0,True,False,False

Interactive level design offers a level of complexity rarely seen in modern gaming. Every shortcut, hidden path, and interconnected area contributes to a cohesive and immersive experience. Exploring Lordran is a puzzle in itself and is quite rewarding.

Now, for what I don't like: The PS3-era jank; the game is quite dated in many areas, feeling clunky and slow, especially since I am coming from playing BB, DS3, and Elden Ring, it feels jarring. Secondly, the bonfire placements; there were many instances where I had to go through long and arduous paths to get to where I want to be. Lastly, the bosses can be a mixed bag; some made my jaw drop, while others almost made me quit the game‚ÄîI am looking at you, Bed of Chaos.

All in all, I don't recommend this entry in the series, even though it's the one that gave the series much-deserved attention; it certainly didn't age well.",1704123780,1704123780,False,3,2,0.492169737815856934,1,True,False,False

Having to do bossruns all the way from firelink shrine is not a good world building, but an annoying piece of shit.

Developed by FromSoftware, it's a game renowned for its challenging gameplay, atmospheric world-building, intricate level design, and profound storytelling. Here's a comprehensive review detailing why ""Dark Souls"" remains a must-play for gamers seeking a uniquely immersive experience.

[h1] Unforgiving Challenge:  [/h1]
""Dark Souls"" is notorious for its punishing difficulty. It doesn't hold your hand; instead, it teaches through trial and error. Players face relentless enemies and formidable bosses that demand patience, strategy, and precision in combat. Every encounter is a lesson, forcing players to learn enemy patterns and master combat mechanics to progress. The sense of accomplishment upon overcoming seemingly insurmountable odds is unparalleled.

[h1] Intricate World Design: [/h1]

The level design encourages exploration, hiding secrets, shortcuts, and hidden paths that reward observant and daring players.

[h1] Atmospheric & Immersive: [/h1]
""Dark Souls"" excels in creating a hauntingly atmospheric world.

[h1]  Deep Lore & Storytelling: [/h1]
The game's narrative isn‚Äôt spoon-fed to players. Instead, it's cryptic, requiring keen attention to item descriptions, NPC interactions, and environmental cues to piece together the lore.

[h1]  Multiplayer Innovation: [/h1]
The multiplayer aspect of ""Dark Souls"" is innovative and unique. Players can leave messages for others, warning of dangers or offering guidance. Co-op and PvP elements add unpredictability, allowing for both cooperative play and intense, challenging encounters with other players invading your world. The online component adds an extra layer of depth to an already rich gaming experience.

i tried dark souls when it first came out. hated it. thought it was stupid that anyone would take pride in beating a game that's designed to be overly frustrating and unfairly difficult.

then i went and lived my life, forgot about it, then picked up this dipshit remaster on sale because the original version i bought has had the online removed and ran like shit. i was a different person by then. i'd been through some shit. i loved it. i saw it in a new light and became obsessed with it and living in its world and i found a lot of value in its message, which i viewed to be a love letter to life itself: by showing such desolation, melancholy and sadness, it was highlighting the beauty that we take for granted by contrast.

by this point i've finished every game in the series, and the other similar games: bloodborne, sekiro, elden ring, etc.

the marketing around ""oooo it's so hard"" and ""oooo you're gonna die so much"" is honestly not in the spirit of the game. the game wants you to win. it wants you to never give up. this is an experience that people without confidence in themselves need to fight against so they can learn something about what they truly are and the potential within. don't you dare go hollow!",1703996071,1703996297,True,184,4,0.939746439456939697,0,True,False,False

Launched in 2011, this action role-playing game has left an indelible mark on the gaming industry, redefining player expectations and setting new standards for challenging gameplay. At the heart of Dark Souls' success lies its unique and groundbreaking gameplay, a distinctive blend of difficulty, interconnected world design, intricate combat mechanics, and environmental storytelling.

Unforgiving Difficulty

One of the defining features of Dark Souls is its unrelenting difficulty. Unlike many contemporary games that prioritize accessibility, Dark Souls thrusts players into a world where death is not only inevitable but a crucial aspect of the learning process. This punishing difficulty curve serves as a stark departure from conventional gaming norms, demanding players to adapt, strategize, and persevere.

The lack of hand-holding is intentional, forcing players to explore and learn from their mistakes. Each death becomes a lesson, encouraging a methodical and patient approach. The game's tagline, ""Prepare to Die,"" serves as both a warning and a promise, setting the tone for an experience that rewards resilience and mastery.

Interconnected World Design

Dark Souls' world design is a masterclass in environmental storytelling and interconnected level design. Unlike linear game structures, Dark Souls features a sprawling open world with interconnected regions that seamlessly flow into each other. The interconnectedness of the world allows for a sense of discovery and exploration rarely seen in other games.

Players often find themselves opening shortcuts or unlocking hidden pathways that lead back to previously explored areas. This design choice not only enhances the sense of a cohesive and living world but also reinforces the feeling of accomplishment as players unveil the intricate connections between different regions.

Combat Mechanics and Player Agency

At the core of Dark Souls' unique gameplay is its deep and intricate combat system. Combat in Dark Souls is deliberate and methodical, requiring players to learn the timing and patterns of enemies. The absence of a traditional difficulty setting forces players to confront challenges head-on, emphasizing skill development over character progression.

Weapon variety, character customization, and the importance of player skill contribute to a dynamic combat experience. The stamina system adds an additional layer of complexity, requiring players to manage their actions carefully. The lack of a pause button during gameplay further intensifies the sense of vulnerability, enhancing the overall immersion and tension.

Environmental Storytelling

Dark Souls eschews traditional narrative methods, opting for a subtle and cryptic approach to storytelling. The game's lore is deeply embedded in its environment, with item descriptions, environmental details, and cryptic NPC dialogues providing fragments of a larger narrative. Players are encouraged to piece together the story through observation and exploration, fostering a sense of engagement and intellectual investment.",1703992343,1703992408,True,1,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

(It gets a few points for being the genre-defining game and also being the first souls game that I played, hard to be objective talking about something so endearing)
Didn't think I would love this game when I first looked at its visuals, but here I am. DSR is the game that finally could appease my craving for a challenge and did it in a really stylish and cool way. While the first few bosses are made to be a stumbling rock in your way, it becomes much easier to fight them with each consecutive try, since the learning curve is insanely well made in this game. And if you want an additional challenge - you can also look into its DLC. And the lore is also quiet good, despite many people saying otherwise.

Nevertheless, you cannot ignore how unfinished later parts of the game look. The big four combined are easier than Ornstein and Smough encounter, level design is going downhill after you're done with O&S too, which breaks my heart. Hopefully, one day we'll get a Dark Souls Remastered 2 so that we could finally enjoy our adventure to the fullest.

There are glitches, bugs and dumb designs.

It's a piece of work that drives once sanity to the breaking-point, and then stomp you on the neck while you are down. Heck almost all From Software games are like this! And DS1 is far from the best of them.

And I've lost count over how many times I've wished for the developers to step on LEGO's or stump their toes into table-legs. And for the love of it, I don't understand why I even keep play it as it keeps hurting me!
And if you don't believe me, try playing with an whip-only run!... Oh... oh shit... that's why it hurts so much!


Anyway, with all that said... 10/10 times I would suffer through this game again, for some reason, cause at the end of the day... I'm having fun with the pain here... WHAT DOES IT EVEN SAY ABOUT ME!!!?

So if you like to suffer too... I'd give it my recommendation.
If you don't... I'd still give it my recommendation, but with the advice that you have to out-level every zone.",1703818873,1703818873,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

PTDE is unique, it's, in my opinion, the only true original Dark Souls experience, and only it can truly communicate the ""origin of Dark Souls"", what makes Dark Souls what it is today.
- ""Why?"" - Because DSR graphics are not even close to the original ones, the atmosphere is not the same and even playing with mods that change them didn't make it close to what PTDE's graphics were. Install a patch like DSFix to PTDE and there you have a game that makes Remastered almost pointless to exist. PTDE can run at 60 fps in high resolution with custom HUD, the only downside to playing it over Remastered is not having online features... Which may not be of much value to many people anyway.

Dark Souls Remastered: A Timeless Masterpiece

Dark Souls Remastered is a faithful remaster of the critically acclaimed action RPG that redefined the genre. It features the same challenging gameplay, intricate world design, and memorable characters that made the original so beloved. The remaster also includes a number of enhancements, such as improved graphics, framerate, and online connectivity.

Graphics and Presentation

Dark Souls Remastered boasts a visual overhaul that brings the game's grim and atmospheric world to life in stunning detail. The textures have been re-worked, the lighting has been enhanced, and the environments have been meticulously recreated. The result is a game that looks more beautiful than ever before.

The remaster also features a higher framerate, which makes the gameplay feel more fluid and responsive. This is particularly noticeable in boss battles and other intense encounters.

Gameplay

Dark Souls Remastered retains the same punishing combat mechanics that made the original so unforgiving. Players will need to learn to dodge, parry, and block effectively in order to survive the game's many challenging encounters.

The world design is still as intricate and rewarding to explore as ever. Secrets are hidden around every corner, and the interconnected levels encourage exploration and experimentation.

Enemies and Bosses

The game's enemies and bosses are as memorable and challenging as ever. From the humble hollows to the fearsome knights and dragons, there is always a new challenge waiting around the corner. The bosses in particular are some of the most memorable in gaming history, and they will test your skills to the limit.

Online

Dark Souls Remastered also features a robust online component that allows players to summon allies to help them through the game, or invade other worlds to cause mischief. The online play is as chaotic and unpredictable as ever, and it adds a whole new layer of depth to the game.

Overall

Dark Souls Remastered is a must-play for any fan of the genre. It is an excellent reimagining of a classic game that remains as challenging and rewarding as ever.

Pros:

Stunning visuals
Improved framerate
Faithful remaster of the original game
Intricate world design
Memorable enemies and bosses
Robust online component
Cons:

Nothing new for returning players

Don't get me wrong: I enjoyed myself. This is a fun game that will certainly offer an experience you won't soon regret or forget. There's many interesting locations to explore, with a connected world that remains one of the best ever designed, and truly feels alive as you explore further and further, and which brings all kinds of dark fantasy to life for you to enjoy.

That said, this game hasn't aged too well. The combat is clunky and at times unresponsive, and the difficulty of the game usually comes from being swarmed by a large group of enemies rather than any interesting combat mechanic.

Boss fights are surprisingly easy and just not very interesting. They're all too slow and pose very little threat compared to the swarm of enemies you've been fighting in the open world. The only three difficult boss fights include a coin toss in a tiny arena against some demon dude and two dogs, a not-so-fair 2v1, and a fight where the most used strategy is literally to save and quit. There's [i]ONE[/i] really good boss fight, and it's a DLC fight.

Most of your time in the game will be spent running back to wherever you got killed, running pass everything and avoiding interacting with the game. You'll spend way more time just running back to your corpse or a boss arena than exploring or actually fighting anything, and it gets grating.

I couldn't tell you what the plot is about. Almost all important plot points are way too cryptic to understand at a glance, which is a shame because the stories this land has to tell are actually really interesting... too bad the game doesn't really want to tell you about them. A game shouldn't have to rely on fan content for you to make basic sense of its story.

[b]Don't make this your first Souls game[/b] and only play it once you've got some experience with future (better) games and only if you're curious to see where Dark Souls started. If your friend wants you to play this game blind, chances are they wanna see you suffer and have fun at your expense.

In all, if you've never played a Souls game, I'll always recommend starting with Elden Ring. This game is terribly clunky, but charming in a strange unique way. There's nothing quite like OG Dark Souls, and the more I play it, the more I enjoy it. But it's [i]definitely[/i] an acquired taste.",1696865750,1703331613,True,0,0,0.558334231376647949,0,True,False,False

Unfortunately, my excitement quickly turned to disappointment as I delved into the game. The lack of diversity and inclusion is glaring and detracts from the overall enjoyment.

The game seems stuck in the past, featuring a predominantly homogeneous cast that feels out of touch with the diverse gaming community of today. The character customization options are limited, and the representation of different races and genders is sorely lacking. It's disheartening to see such a renowned title fail to embrace the rich tapestry of backgrounds and identities that make up the gaming world.

In an era where inclusivity is rightfully prioritized in the gaming industry, Dark Souls Remastered feels like a missed opportunity. The narrative could have been enriched by diverse perspectives, and the overall gaming experience could have been more relatable for a broader audience.

The ""remaster"" addition to the title probably doesn't do much. There's room for so many QoL adjustments/additions.
I haven't gotten far at all, I'm at the third boss and I wouldn't have known where to go without finding a walkthrough. 
As a remaster the game is unnecessarily difficult, if you accidentally roll into a corner and an enemy is beside you, GG, you are not getting out unless you kill them, no amount of rolling can get you out at all.
[spoiler] And when the run back to the boss is filled with ""assassins""/thieves and bleed-hounds that don't lose aggro[/spoiler] it feels like a chore to play the game.
While it has a ""Classic"" status among games, it really doesn't hold up. In the numerous videos I've seen on the Dark Souls franchise as a whole, Dark Souls (the first one) has in almost every video, been reviewed somewhat poorly with the main point I stated above (game design).

The Grand Archives was fine I enjoyed Seeth the Scaleless but the area where you're spawning in the prison cell was kinda boring. Tomb of the Giants i just had no clue what was going on at the point I got to Gravelord Nito it felt like a chore to just complete the game and be done with it.

After going around in circles 5 or 6 times, the frustration level is just too high. Unlike with the later Dark Souls games, one cannot travel to a different bonfire, requiring long walks relying on memory. The second problem is it is not clear what to do next. I hate games that rely on the internet community and their walkthroughs to learn what to do next. 

Third, one cannot save. but rather on their few bonfires to save. The difficulty level rises fairly quickly so that by the middle to late game, it is really difficult. Not so much the combat, but rather stupid things like suddenly sinking to one's death waking across a pond (with no recovery of saved souls) or trying to time swinging blades just right while crossing a narrow ridge high up. Dying means losing all saved souls and respawning at a point far before the point when one died. Furthermore, all enemies respawn, too. That means another hard slog just to get back to regain your lost souls when you were killed before.

This is not an open world game, it is quite lateral. Nonetheless, they still are able to make the frustration level too high for me to continue. The ambiance is great as is the environement. The story is weak. I quit sometime past when the frustration level outweighed the enjoyment. 4/10",1703177458,1703177458,False,0,5,0.332109391689300537,0,True,False,False

What I found most interesting is the level design, and how they nailed that this early in their Souls entries, so much so in fact that I think it almost rivals Bloodborne's, and is certainly better than all their other Souls games in that aspect, for me.

Will update the review after I play the DLC that I missed because, in classic FromSoftware fashion, you needed to be told beforehand about its existence and how to access it, as otherwise you'll just finish the game and get locked out of the DLC until replaying 70% of the game again, but harder this time.

It was tense and different than any genre I've played before. 
You as a player will notice your huge progression alongside the game. 
The little minions that were slapping you on your face at the beginning of the game will be nothing more than insects to you afterall (I recommend going with the Zweihander str/dex build). 

Moreover, the most mind-blowing thing in this game is how the whole world and areas are connected into each other. The design is genius!

It's not difficult for its own sake or to give people bragging rights or whatnot; instead, the whole point is Not Giving Up. 

The old Japanese saying, ""Nana korobi ya oki""--fall down seven times, get up eight--is at the very heart of every design decision. NPCs go ""hollow"" when they give up trying in the face of adversity and setbacks (and so do players, in a way: they quit the game feeling empty rather than fulfilled). The ""prophecy"" of the Chosen Undead? It's not about you unless you make it about you. We are told that several undead have come from the asylum already; but the Chosen One is simply the one who doesn't give up. Is it you? That's not up to destiny. It's up to your perseverance.

Things that are good:

- The first half is genuinely good designed, including environmental storytelling, intuative 
  leads towards the intended path and interlooping map design.
- Any of the many builds available can work if you know what you are doing.
- Primary gameplay loop is actual fun while still being challenging, a very new and innovative 
  concept for AAA games these days...
- Story is one of the best in gaming history. Prepare thyself for many hours of hunting down 
  every bit of lore.

Things that p*ss me off and will trigger you too:

- Why the f*ck is the dodge direction bound to the camera lock? When unlocked you can
  dodge in any direction you input but when you lock on you can only dodge in 4 directions.
- Why THE F*CK is the lock-on distance different in every area? Not much of a problem if you 
  have a melee build 'cause you can play unlocked but if you play a mage of some kind you 
  basically HAVE to play locked-on and in specific areas like the Duke's Archives you can't 
  lock shit even if its only a metre or two in front of you.
- Yeah, a game from 2011 has kinda shitty hitboxes sometimes. Not as bad it sounds 
  though...
- The second half just falls flat and dips its sh*tty little nose in some sh*tty little Izalith lava 
  before dropping in a sh*tty little hole in the sh*tty little Tomb of Giants.
- After you gain the ability to warp from bonfire to bonfire you will be asking yourself why tf 
  you can warp ONLY to specific bonfires for wich there is no good reason. Backtracking will 
  become a chore since the level design aint as good as it was in the first half 
- Speaking of wich, in the later half most boss arenas are outright hostile to you, be it through 
  too little space, the arena being filled with enemies IN ADDITION to the boss, unavoidable 
  drop damage or the game suddenly becoming a platformer with no dedicated jump button. 
  F*ck Nito and the Centipede Demon and f*ck the Bed Of Chaos in particular.
- The game mechanics outside of basic controls are not explained to you. Like, not at all. I 
  strongly suggest watching/reading a guide after you arrive in Firelink Shrine 'cause the game 
  is about as eager to explain it all to you as the government is to stop printing f*cking money.

While Dark Souls graphics are getting a little aged, the oppressive ambiance and creative setting demand exploration.

I've played this game SO many times to exhaustion: PS3, Steam (Prepare to Die Edition ""PTD"") and now the Remastered.

What I would say is that the Remastered version is hardly 'remastered'. A modest discount was provided for fellow PTD owners on steam (for a few years before they rescinded that, while removing PTD entirely).
If anything, I question whether there is a slight issue with input latency (PS4 controller) on this version, or whether things might've just felt slightly more responsive 10+ years ago?
In addition, it was a prolonged length of time before network connectivity was restored to this game (which is honestly essential for jolly cooperation and invading: core mechanics to the game) so obviously not exactly on the radar.

Dark Souls 1: Yes, recommended. But don't think you're getting the experience as it was back in the day, it's a hollow shell of itself, sad to say. It's probably more of a solo experience if you play this game nowadays (which is also certainly fun and a good challenge, but nothing like how it was).
There is a much lower amount of players nowadays and with that comes fewer helpful/funny/disparaging messages around the world; fewer player ghosts to make you jump or laugh at when you see them; fewer invasions at inopportune moments who will try to cost you your souls/humanity; any hope of organised pvp battles is pretty slim; fewer people to help you, and fewer people for you to help!

EDIT:
For me, a) a good (i.e. entertaining and rewarding) gameplay and b) respecting players' time are the most important things for a (functional and stable) software, made for entertainment (a.k.a. a video game). For me, the aesthetics are secondary (maybe even tertiary), the stories are also secondary (maybe even tertiary). That is why I'd say that Onimusha, albeit an older game, is a similar game (gameplay-wise), but a better one. If you play it in 2023, you will feel entertained and you will feel that your time is being respected. When it comes to Dark Souls, the two most important checkmarks for me are missing. Before you decide that you know better and that you want to insult me or make a snarky/meaningless comment, please, keep in mind that I've put myself through Escape From Tarkov for a little more than 3000 hours. Did you play Dark Souls for more than 1000 hours? I very much doubt that.

EDIT 2:
Here is some more embarrassing evidence on why this is not ""the masterpiece"" that its fanboys believe it is. Keep reciting your juvenile ""git gut"" mantra, if it somehow makes you cope with reality.

The game on PC is absolutely broken: You'll be plenty of distance away from the environment such as walls or landscape but when you go to strike, you'll get your attack blocked by the terrain in some moments. Hallway combat is a nightmare, your best bet is just to lure the enemy back to an area thats clear, but even then you'll still get caught on invisible obstructions. Once and a while you'll be walking on a path or stairs and just fall through it, and it won't leave your ""souls"" where you died. This game is unplayable, many bugs and glitches, Steam won't help you, they'll just tell you to go contact the game developer, so with that said, Steam will just take your money and run.

This game felt very familiar, yet also somewhat different as well. Enjoyed it very much.
Although I have to mention, it's quite clunky and you can definitely feel that it's quite old at this point, especially when it comes to the camera and targeting at times (and don't even get me started on the camera issues for that big fiery demon boss, ugh).

But regardless, it's a fantastic experience, although do beware, definitely not for the faint of heart or those with a lack of patience.

Sometimes it ticks me off and sometimes I feel an intense sense of euphoria playing it (quite literally, if you've played you know what I mean). It is simply put a flawed masterpiece. I'm writing this review after playing this game after Elden Ring (my first souls game) and I find the amount of polish and content in this game considering its age staggering. It is very easy to see why this game is so revered and considered to be one of the greatest of all time. The sandbox is perfect, the world-building is great (I would even argue better than Elden Ring), the mood is pervasive and the gameplay addictive. While not very easy for new players, those that stick with it will be pleasantly rewarded with some of the best experiences video gaming has to offer. Dark Souls is truly an experience that ages like fine wine, the more the player learns about its lore and complex game systems the more fun they will have. I really like the games message about not giving up or going ""hollow"" in the face of overwhelming odds and I find it to be very applicable to life, which like dark souls isn't always easy but is always worth playing. Man I am so thankful to Elden Ring for making this genre accessible to me because these are some of the best games of all time. The game still looks great, runs great, has excellent music and the included DLC is awesome (it had my favorite boss fights in the game to be honest) thanks to the remaster. While I have a few minor criticisms (like how sometimes it is impossible for a new player to progress without occasionally looking things up) they can somewhat easily be overlooked because the rest of the game is stellar. When finished I was left asking myself, not will I play it again but rather, when will I play it again. I am really excited for ds2 and 3 and will be moving on to those right after this one. A single playthrough of this one took me 45 hours and if the other two have this much content to offer I will be very impressed. I would easily recommend this game to anyone looking to get into the souls-borne games (as it has still aged remarkably well). If you can get it on sale go for it bc honestly its worth full price, a true 9/10 for me. If this is your first souls game, I like everyone else urge you to stick with it because once you climb that mountain there is no going back.",1702264712,1702265242,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

If you're looking for Souls-like, play the game that defined the genre. So far, it looks like the remaster has been just that and nothing more. This is a good thing. I've seen remasters of old games severely overstep, such as the Silent Hill HD collection introducing bugs that didn't exist, and the graphical atrocity that was GTA San Andreas Remastered. The devs fixed a few issues that the first Dark Souls had. For instance, the game would sometimes register a fall to your death when you only fell like 10 feet, but since you hit the bottom of the map, ""You Died."" The remaster fixed that problem. More astute observers probably noticed some issues and I'll leave them to nitpick over it. I personally enjoy this remaster a lot.",1702258134,1702258134,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

all of that aside dark souls is a game that is known first and foremost for its gameplay. i dont play action games really, FF16 being my first one only a few months ago, so i was going in as a big baby. i know i wanted to be big and strong. i sort of regret starting as a knight bc it meant i had this great armour to begin with, although i was fat rolling up until bell gargoyles. i think if i had started as wretch i couldve more organically built up my character and there wouldve been something in the player expression of that, bc my character didnt feel like mine until i got to the depths, and i put on the sack. but that, then, was when it all started coming together. i dont remember why i put the sack on as my headgear, but i found it very charming. and aside from a brief stint of using the helm of the wise to fight the gaping dragon, i wore the sack for the rest of the game. upgraded it to +10 quality where it was only MARGINALLY worse than random headgear found elsewhere. suddenly play expression meant that DARK SACK BONUM PULLUM was a real character and i became invested. that, and finding the two weapons id play the whole game with, made me realise i was in my playthrough. i used the halberd and zweihander for the whole thing, finding their different styles useful in different contexts. for sif, i used the halberd, but for nito, i used the zweihander. that and the 3d metroidvania thing the game has going on was super cool. every time i unlocked a shortcut that took me from one place to another i did the biggest sexiest moan that i could. there is something so unbelievably satisfying about linking up all these areas. it helps u feel like uve conquered them in a very real way. and that in ofitself helps u tackle the game in kind of whatever order u want! it felt good knowing that i did sif earlier than all of my friends bc once i found him i decided to stick with him! the only boss i ran from to come back to was the stray demon in the undead asylum, and thats bc he sucks! BUT enough nattering... the gameplay of darksouls is more than exploring or player expression. its combat baby! fighting in this game is good. its simple on one hand, light attack and heavy attack, but theres so much variety. every weapon has flavour and personality, looking cool and distinct and also feeling powerful and weighty. finding the right weapon feels incredible. landing hits with the zweihander is addictive. flattening fools, even big fuckers like silver knights, or staggering artorias, is so rewarding. u commit to a heavy attack at the cost of precious stamina instead of rolling is a tiny calculation of risk, reward, and probability u are running in ur head every few seconds in those hard as nails boss fights. and bosses are hard, theyre relentless and feel unfair and like there's no way u can learn them... and yet u do! kalameet was probably the hardest boss in the game for me. he took me just under an hour to beat but at the start i seriously felt there was no way i was ever going to beat him. and yet the way u learn to read him, learn which way to dodge, when to sprint instead, where ur punish windows are. beating these games rewards u with a feeling of satisfaction so pure that the in-game reward for it can be totally lacking (and often sometimes is) and its FINE bc the reward u wanted was knowing that u won. very few other games can give u that feeling. O&S gave me that the most. i got them on my third try, but genuinely don't feel like i've ever been that engaged with a bossfight other than extreme trials in FF14. genuinely bonkers how wired in u feel when ur going toe-to-toe with a tough motherfucker. cant recommend that shit enough.

im feeling extremely high on DS1 having just finished it but it would be remiss of me not to mention that it does have a lot of stinker stuff in it too. the latter half of the game isnt bad but does pale in comparison to the first. basically once u've finished anor londo the game is just slightly not as good and its noticable. the areas are slightly less interesting, some enemy placements are silly and the bosses are just not as fun either. there are some real bad fucking moments though. tomb of the giants is bad. cool idea for an area, ancient crypt filled with skeletons of long dead giants... and yet it ends up being impossibly dark with annoying enemies and jank platforming. crystal cave isnt as bad but is definitely not good. invisible paths are gimmicky. uninteresting nor innovative way to keep environment design fresh. as for bosses, seathe and moonlight butterfly are not good but man, nothing is as bad as bed of chaos. its nuts just how bad that thing is. it's not even a puzzle boss; it has two huge glowing weakspots that need to be destroyed. the problem is not working out how to destroy them, but rather that he kills u instantly 100 times in a row and there was never anything u could do about it at any point. it doesnt engage u with the way u've played the game at all. ur build or stats or understanding of combat or movement dont come into that fight. so why is it in an action game?

things i wanna gush about before i go: O&S, wow, genuinely so cool. doing mario 64 in the painted world was awesome and one optional boss was genuinely super cool. the DLC bosses were all engaging and fun in their own way. lautrec's side quest is really great (although the idea that freeing him is a choice is kind of dumb. if ur choices are ""engage with a mechanic or dont"" then the most interesting one is always the former). i love that he kills the firekeeper, despite the fact he can help u beforehand as a summon! then u have a fun bossfight with him if u want to get vengeance and bring firelink shrine back to life! thats genuinely so cool. id also never heard gwyn's music before, so even though he was pretty easy, especially after coming off the DLC bosses, he felt like a fun and fitting final boss. good stuff.",1702170423,1702170423,True,1,0,0.532019674777984619,0,True,False,False

What separates this game from the others in the series is the deep interconnected world, which is why there is no way to warp to other bonfires, and find new routes that lead back to the Firelink Shrine. The story of this game is really cool because it basically starts you off after the events of an apocalypse and you just need to rekindle the flame to continue the cycle, or alternatively you can end it. I really like the lore of this game too as there are multiple characters that you can learn about, some can lie, some will attack you, and they all fit in great in context with the story. One of my favorites being my man Solaire. Now the issues with this game are that the controls are pretty wonky, and the bosses definitely do not hold up in comparison to future games if we are being honest here. There is charm in slowly beating a slow moving boss, and yes they are certainly more balanced except for that one stupid guy at the end of the DLC. But I honestly cannot say that I like these bosses as much as future entry bosses. also screw you gargolyles lol. Also, I forgot to say but the music in this game is iconic, most notably being Firelink Shrine and Gwyn's theme. Another issue is that sometimes it's like almost impossible to figure out where to go next, like it is extremely hard. And sometimes the bonfires are not close at all, which leads to a lot of frustration when lost, but if you can look past all this, this is a game that I definitely cherish, and wish there were more interconnected games like Dark Souls 1.",1702149232,1702149232,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

After falling in love and putting almost 600 hours into that game (Elden Ring), I thought that id like to go back to the beginning. It was a clash of familiarity and a new (re)learning curve to say the least. It was also a very interesting and rewarding experience, and I want to share my opinion to all the other Elden Ringers that are curious.

The game is for sure more challenging, there is less room for errors, less things in the game are clearly explained to the player, and there are less checkpoints in areas which means a lot of walking, don't forget all of the stuff that was definitely put there to troll the player. All of this stuff just means that exploring, taking your time to figure things out and making these mistakes are all part of the experience of the game.

The biggest thing for me was how different the movement was between the two games. No jump on demand, longer recovery animations and only dodging in cardinal directions, but yet again this is just part of the learning curve of the game and a lot of the game is designed around these things.

Overall, I don't really have strong emotions one way or the other for this entry personally, though this might change as I Journey through the other Souls games. I still do recommend this one to my Elden Ring peeps if you're interested.",1701840180,1701840241,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The Music
The World design
The Bosses

The way this world is connected and flows together is beautiful and unlike anything in any other game.
Even the newer souls games don't have such a masterful world design.

This game has very iconic moments and characters and I loved it.
This game could be a masterpiece if it was remade.
The only thing holding this game back is some of the run backs, and some areas (near the end of the game) that feel unfinished, which I believe is due to the game's short development time.

I highly recommend this game to anyone that is a fan of games like DS3 and Elden Ring.

If you pay attention to your surroundings and take things slow, there are only really a few areas that should give you a lot of trouble the first time. People always praise the level design and connectedness of DS1 so you don't need me to tell you that, but it is a neat feature. The first half of the game is great in this regard, but the later levels feel incomplete or there seem to be missing enemies, items, things to discover etc. I don't mind the fast travel you get at a certain point since getting around would be an unnecessary pain without it. The world is also not as dark and drowned out as 3 which is something I quite liked, especially in regards to the armor sets. Most of the bosses are similar in the sense that they have telegraphed attacks which you either have to roll through or run away and whiff punish, or simply go behind them and stab them. They are fun and simple, but 2 of the DLC bosses as well as the final boss of the game are more in line with the fast-paced bosses of DS3. I enjoyed the fights, but I thought they felt a bit disjointed compared to the other bosses.

Pros:
+ The interconnected maps design is definitely best experienced blind, I feel there's no other experience quite like it. Making it a little bit further every time you die, finding new bonfires, new shortcuts...
+ Motoi Sakuraba went insane on that soundtrack.
+ The story doesn't get all up in your face, it's up to you if you want to delve into the lore or just kill stuff straight away, no expositions.
+ You seldom see other NPCs but they all manage to be memorable anyway. A lot of them are strangely motivational, too.
+ Just the amount of things you could do in every playthrough is insane, really.

Cons:
- The controls might feel clunky at first, God help you if you're going to do some platforming (you know which boss it is, without cheesing).
- The last half of the main campaign might feel like a slog with how the last few areas feel so low-effort, you don't get that adventuring feel. Some of them also resort to cheap gimmicks, like the entire map being dark as hell. Just areas you'd rather never go back to, really.
- Over time it might feel like it doesn't matter what armor you're wearing, especially if you're melee, because no matter how much defense you got, if you start fat rolling, it's just not worth it. I just went naked for a good chunk of the game because your character is faster and you get the good iframes.

Just recently played this for my second time after some years and it got even better this time around. The pure gameplay experience like the combat is a joy to get better at, and the lore is very enthralling. The world design in its inter-connectivity is ingenious and every enemy placement, level design and enemy design is just very carefully crafted. Even the most random appearing aspects of the game have a lore explanation as to why it is like it is. 

 Are there some negative aspects? Sure, the awful boss run-backs can sometimes feel like a waste of time, especially after getting used to stake of marikas in Elden Ring. It could be argued therefor that the bosses in this game aren't as hard as other Souls-borne games, but there are some real tough cookies in this game, so don't be fooled. 

I'm a fan of hard but fair games, and this game perfectly balances this. 
It is fun, captivating and even  infuriating at times, which makes it exactly the perfect game to start with, in the souls-genre.

+ More consistent FPStown and Seath boss fight
+ New features regarding summoning (ex. can lock summon sign to friends only)
++ Can still skip sens and the rest
++ Quantity using
+++ Memeroll was a nice addition to the game (did exist in PTDE but was much harder to perform)
+++++ being able to handle items in stacks, no need to spam same buttons 80 times to donate 80 Souvenir of Reprisals. Same goes for consuming souls.

- Vamos Bonfire (NoobTarp.exe)
-- Easier to manage covenants
--- Cannot poopwalk(?)
--- Invader can use estus flask, which doesn't encourage >proper< invader/combat etiquette (no estus allowed for either combatant)
--- Significant increase in # of cheaters in PvP
- Most >boring< bugs are still in place
---- Graphics are in some places improved, some places made garbage. Armour doesn't shine anymore. Ornstein looks better.

Game-wise i still give this game a solid 10/10, probably best game i've ever played.
Remastered-wise i rank this 2/10, didn't really >improve< anything about the game

[EDIT 4/7-22] As of updating this review, the online servers for Dark Souls (R, II, III) have been offline in excess of 160 days, proving either the developer's incompetence in resolving the issue, their neglect for the Dark Souls community (their customers) or both.

That said; it has an incredibly obscure story, clunky mechanical operation, difficulty is only as bad as it's perceived and has more glitches and skips than I could explain in five minutes. Conclusion: This game is not and has never been difficult and in many ways is objectively just bad. In fact, the right way to say this is that it's bad in all of the right ways. I generally think that most game enthusiasts will eventually want to play this game because of it's impact on the current gaming landscape. The funny thing about the genre that popped up surrounding Dark souls is that the souls likes all tried to do verbatim copies of the original Dark Souls while not realizing that the original objectively sucked. They would input the mechanics, which were horrible, into the combat systems of their games and then wouldn't understand when their game didn't fare as well as the original.

DARK SOULS 1 is an addicting surreal experience which will stay with you long after you finish your first playthrough. After you play this game you will find yourself questioning the point in playing any other genre of game or franchise because they will seem beneath you and this amazing gem.

You are Undead. A forgotten remnant stuck in eternal purgatory. Your destiny is to slay the four Lords and usurp the throne from Gwyn, Lord of Cinder. Then you may choose whether to try and save the world from it's doomed fate or curse it and continue the endless cycle (This is my short interpretation  of the plot but a hall mark of this series is to be as intentionally confusing and ambiguous as possible so take it with a grain of salt).

DARK SOULS 1 is obviously one of the greatest games ever made. It has a seriously hardcore player base which continue to play it non stop to this day. This is one of those games that will make all other games look terrible in comparison because of how uniquely fun and addicting it is. There is a high amount of quality for a game releasing in the year it did so I would definitely say it's more than ahead of it's time and more than holds up today.

The combat is flawless and the only example of a game which exceeds it is it's own later sequels. The bosses in this game are some of the most legendary encounters in gaming history and you will feel extremely satisfied when you overcome them. While this game is regarded as very difficult, I would argue it's not frustrating or unfair and it's very nice to see a game designed in a way that only has one single difficulty setting so everyone gets to play the intended best balanced version of the game. The RPG elements are also very strong here with simple but useful leveling and upgrade systems and a huge amount of equipment to customize your fashion with.

DARK SOULS 1 truly is the greatest of all time, but it did eventually lose it's title to FromSoftware's future games like DARK SOULS III & Elden Ring. Despite that it holds up today and is one of the most memorable and fantastic gaming experiences one can ever have.

I beat every boss in one try except for Artorias which took two tries and Kalameet which took four, using +15 Longsword, +5 Crest shield, +10 Elite Knight armor set.

The character animation when fighting is so clunky that it's just awful if compared to current gaming era. You can't really hit the target correctly even though your character is already facing in the right direction. The graphic quality is also very outdated. The developers might have made it in HD quality, but the 3D quality was still from a decade ago. If you're a player with RTX 3xxx or above, you would be disappointed in the ""remastered"" graphic quality.

Combat is the weakest out of any installment (haven't completed demons souls yet) and it takes a bit of getting used to if you've played any of the other installments in the series. A lot of people praise the world and levels as well in this game. They are very interconnected, which alleviates some of my complaints, but without fast travel of bonfires, some of the levels get tedious pretty fast if you happen to die. It's been interesting to see how this series has evolved since this game, but I would still say you are better of with Dark Souls 3 or Elden Ring at this point than dipping your toes into this one, unless you want to complete all of the Souls games, or really enjoy the lore.

===================================================================

My first ever Soulsborne Game! At first, I was thinking that ""Dark Souls is hard"" is such an overused phrase, but I realize now that this Game can really be punishing whenever it gets a chance to. The ""hard"" part is that you actually have to think before you do anything but at the same time you almost don't have a chance to think at all, especially when you're faced with Boss Battles. There are things that will make your life more difficult in this game, like accidentally hitting NPCs will make them hostile towards you (NPCs are really helpful in this game) and facing enemies in narrow spaces feels like hell because your character's attacks bounce off of walls.. BUT, I enjoyed the game so much! The feeling of finally defeating that one annoying enemy after several attempts can be really rewarding and actually makes me want to explore more of what's ahead after.

As for the LORE, it is just MAGNIFICENT! I can't get enough of the Lore this game has to offer and the Game doesn't just give it to you only by text but also by the world-building (Game Level and NPC Position) within the Game. The reason why something happened is always intriguing from the beginning 'till the end. I can't wait until I finally get the chance to play Dark Souls II. Oh yeah, a little bit about the Game Mechanic and Character Build, the Battle is ""easy to learn, hard to master"" kinda mechanic but there's no one OP weapon or Armor Set, so try to use whatever you fancy. My suggestion is always try to balance between melee and range attacks. In my case, I used Pyromancy/Uchigatana/Arrow Combination and this is really helpful to defeat many kinds of enemies.

Nothing about this game is unimpressive, there had to have been some sort of genius to be able to put such a special game together.  My favorite game of all time is Dark Souls.

It's not perfect. Lost Izalith is there more in concept than anything else because it's so unfinished relative to the rest of the game.  Some boss fights have aged. It may also be true that the game is unnecessarily hard to figure out. These and other complaints are true.

Dark Souls is also, in my opinion, the most coherent game ever. All aspects of this game are made to flow into each other: themes, gameplay, lore, multiplayer, world design, character design,  the very notion of death in video games is explored in a fascinating way.

Prepare To Die Edition with DSFix is much better looking than this, but they delisted that so this is your only way to play this game on PC. Also, because of the delisting, the online player base has migrated to this version so it's sorta forcing you to double-dip.

Basically, all they did was up the resolution, framerate, and change some lighting and effects (with questionable results). With PTDE, you can get the same resolution and framerate, while preserving the original art direction. There are fewer players online, though, so that's why I double-dipped. It's really sad this happened to one of the most critically well-received action RPG's of the decade, and the studio who farted this out really let down the fans and From Software.

All that said, you CAN mod this and make it look like it should have out of the gates. Go over to Nexus Mods and download the DSR 2020 texture pack and you won't be disappointed. There are other mods that can further modify the looks but that texture pack was all I found necessary to give it a remastered appearance. It's just sad that's necessary on a $40 remaster (you can pick it up on sale for half that once a year, or something absurdly rare like that).

Dark Souls Remastered sure is just Dark Souls Prepare to Die Edition with DSfix like people say but the thing is DSfix cannot optimize your game the way Dark Souls Remaster optimized it, never in my life have I seen Blightown with 60 fps until Remaster. So that is a plus towards the remaster. Another pros towards Remaster have to be the switch from P2P to Dedicated Servers, the online works so much better than before, I remember back in  DSPTDE I'd have to download a mod just so i can play with my mate. There are so many changes in this game that I absolutely love and for me it's just better functioning Dark Souls, the price is unfair even though we DSPTDE owners got it half price but hey it brings me back to what I said earlier, it's different Developing Team who was working on this game so no wonder why we didn't get it for free, they need to make money somehow since they've put some effort into it I guess.

Anyway great game, I love it.

For experienced players, a complete run will last 4 to 10 hours, depending on how challenging you want it to be (DLC included) so you won't be grinding for 16-24 hours like the other games in the series. 

It also is the best approach to the series because of those reasons, so new players will find an unforgiving but fair game, that is quite easy to learn but hard to master. An average run for a beginner would last 40-60 hours, depending on how much they want to explore/how fast they learn.

The pvp is still the same mess it was back then so eh ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

Bloodborne, Elden ring and Sekiro have better action and bosses and Demons souls have a better atmosphere and mood.

Along with this, all enemies and bosses are governed by learnable (and after a while, predictable) attack patterns. Once mastered, the consistency of the enemies' movements allows the player to overcome them with mastery. The game is really not a test of mechanical skill, but of patience and willingness to take the time to learn the different enemies. 

Due to the consistency of the enemies, dying is mainly the result of the player's lack of knowledge of certain enemy types. The mechanism of learning in this game is failure. After each death, a new valuable lesson is learned - and this for me is the core of Dark Souls. 

The visuals of Dark Souls 1 are a bit dated at this point but they hold up decently well. The atmosphere of the game is great and this is thanks to the visuals being accompanied by excellent overall sound design that matches the dark fantasy environment of the game. ""Less is more"" seems to be the approach with the music that is often absent or very subtle until you approach a specific area, or discover a boss. Then it ramps up, giving a sense of urgency (or dreaminess), only to subside again upon death, or upon defeating the boss.

The variety of weapons and upgrade options help keep the game fresh. These also enable a variety of approaches to combat, and thus allow for diverse player expression. I opted for a quality Claymore build which is the weapon I used for the majority of my playtime, but someone else may use 5-6 different weapons with different enchantments tailored for different areas, and both approaches work. 

Sadly, the design of the latter portions of the game falls short. Namely Lost Izalith and New Londo Ruins. The drop in quality in these areas in stark compared to the first half of the game. This portion of the game was rushed and I would argue that the game would've been better without these areas. I found myself going through them mainly because I've 'gotten this far and there's no point in stopping now'. Some of the worst boss runbacks are present in these areas.

Speaking of runbacks, this is in my opinion a needless gameplay mechanics. Good example of these are the Bed of Chaos, The Four Kings and Gwyn runbacks. Instead of being able to retry a boss immediately after dying, the player is subjected to running back to the boss for minutes at a time, passing by groups of enemies in the process. If the rest of the game wasn't as good as it is, this would have eventually made me quit the game. I don't understand the point of there checkpoints being so far away from the bosses. Sometimes I wondered how much of my gameplay was spent in running back to the boss rooms over and over again. This mechanic only serves to waste the player's time and increase frustration.

Worth mentioning is that the online community is still active and I found myself being summoned for boss fights around a dozen times during my two playthroughs. I found the multiplayer aspect of the game enjoyable, and the community friendly. I even encountered a player-made PvP hub in the DLC area where members of different covenants would duke it out while others players patiently observed and waited to duel the winner.

All in all, highly recommend the game if you haven't tried it. Its a different breed of game and I wish I had given it a try when it first released, rather than a decade later. With that said, 40‚Ç¨ is a bit steep, so best to get it on sale.",1700638616,1700680282,True,2,0,0.524886906147003174,0,True,False,False

I've played Elden Ring previously, wanting to try out the original souls games after some mates recommended them.
I found this to be an entirely different experience than I had imagined. 

MOVEMENT / MECHANICS

The movement is a lot slower than Elden Ring, and I'm not just talking about the player in this regard. Most of the enemies and bosses are slower too. This can make it easier to dodge some attacks because you can see them coming. But sometimes it can be more difficult to predict since most of the attack animations start out slow but then swipe/swing more quickly which makes it really interesting to learn the timing and frustrating at the start. Also some of the bosses have outright ridiculous attacks. I'm looking at you Bed of Chaos. You have a... well, half jump that you can perform by either running and quickly letting go of sprint and pressing it again, or you can press I think the left analog stick. 

LEVEL / WORLD DESIGN

The Level/World design of this game is actually insane. I loved the progression through all the unique and fascinating areas and the fact that no area is the same. You start out in an asylum for the undead, progressing through the beautifully connected world with various swamps (of course), lava caves (Lost Izalith), tunnels that drop deep into the earth (Tomb of the Giants), trap-filled dungeons such as Sen's Fortress, A massive castle (Anor Londo) and Dark green forests (Darkroot Garden). These are just a few of the locations featured in this game. The level design is harder in Dark Souls compared to Elden Ring because it's more difficult to run past enemies (since you don't have a horse) and the environment is generally more dangerous. I personally found this quite interesting and made me think differently about certain situations. 

BOSSES

I will say that the boss design in this game isn't amazing in terms of programming, a decent proportion of the bosses don't live up to the name in my opinion but they're still awesome to fight nonetheless. There are definitely really cool bosses in this game, allowing the player to still enjoy learning the moveset even though they're getting blasted most of the time. A few examples of this would be, Artorias Of The Abyss. (Easily the best boss of the game), Great Grey Wolf Siff and Gwyn Lord of Cinder. I even enjoyed fighting OnS, finding it a way more enjoyable 2v1 than bloody Godskin Duo. 

Disclaimer: I have not fought Kalameet, Gwyndolin and Pricsilla as of this review so I can't comment on those fights. 

BUILD VARIETY

One of the aspects that makes these games so well regarded is the huge amount of build variety, and Ds1 is no exception to this fact. I did a strength build for my first playthrough but I've seen so many different builds utilising other interesting attacks and play-styles. I will say on the other hand, It does fall a bit short compared to other souls games but I will say it was one of the first games to add decent build variety, along w/ Demon Souls.  

CONCLUSION

Dark Souls perfectly captures that gritty dark atmosphere of the nihilistic fantasy world you drag yourself through to achieve something great, and this is exactly how I felt while playing this game. I highly recommend this game to anyone that wants a great challenging experience, it's 100% worth the money.

[b]Dark Souls: Remastered[/b], is based on the original Dark Souls/Dark Souls: Prepare to Die Edition, which are no longer available on the Steam store. Something of note for this personal review: I have played the original, as well as gotten 100% completion on all Souls games released on Steam so far, and some other random ‚Äúsouls-like‚Äù games. Just want to get that out of the way so you are aware I am experienced on my overall views with this particular series, as I may make some comparisons with Remastered vs. PTDE/1 original, so I will be adding a layer of comparison for those looking for a [b][u]gorgeous view[/u][/b], or [b][u]amazing chest ahead[/u][/b]. 


[u][b]Another note:[/b][/u] Since my review is just too long for Valve‚Äôs fairly weak character limits (in far more desperate need of a minimum cap, rather than a max, IMO), I'll be moving it to another link provided, should you wish to read the full review. Now, for pros and cons, I will be both adding overall pros, or specifically mentioning it differing from the original if it fits that particular case as to why it‚Äôs a pro or con. Everything I've added to comments will be moved in a few minutes, so you can get the full, organized list [url=https://steamcommunity.com/groups/AbyssalAscent/discussions/1/2573194016121244332/]here[/url]

[h1]Pros[/h1]

Updated framerate, and no longer glitches for me on ladders. I didn‚Äôt fall through a single one at 60fps. Also native 4k, I believe.

You can now switch covenants at bonfires, so that makes things much easier than than DS1 was. Also no sin penalty for betraying a formerly joined covenant, as far as breaking a rule for leaving via the bonfire selection option. Only when it‚Äôs part of the normal game design mechanics did betrayal cause negative ramifications. I don‚Äôt think any cared otherwise when I tried to rejoin either, but I cannot recall for certain if this is true in all cases.

It was quite active last time I tried it. Dark Souls stays pretty active, since it‚Äôs a real cult classic masterpiece series. It‚Äôs big, confusing, time-consuming, quite addictive, and fun!

Items updated from original in how you can buy, arrange, and select stuff. Made inventory management easier for me.

The game itself is very challenging. One of the few game series where enemies and bosses will teach you as you play. You realize how you messed up, what to do better in most cases, and it‚Äôs like a learning experience as you go along. Most games seem unbalanced, but this really does a nice job in teaching you how to evade, take advantage of weak points, timing spots for pot-shotting, and possibly parrying if possible, if you‚Äôre really into that. It was a tiny bit easier for me to parry in this version too, I believe. I didn‚Äôt focus on my parries, since for me it‚Äôs mostly useful in PvP only, which I am not a fan of really. Most enemies are easy enough to eliminate without the need to parry, and waiting for parry opportunities would just make the game longer and more drawn out, so it‚Äôs not very useful in most cases in PvE aside from a couple of bosses in the whole series.

Much better in PvP, even though it bores the heck out of me, due to its slowness and story/focus-breaking potential from an immersion standpoint. I got PvP backstabbed a lot in the original one when the enemies appeared to be in front of me, many times on the other side of the room, at least five or ten meters away from me, then would ‚Äúteleport‚Äù into an automatic backstab animation, because of the horrendous lag, and a lot of users took advantage of that. On this one the ‚Äúghost backstabs‚Äù were much rarer, so fights felt more balanced than on the first, which was literally a trainwreck of awful.

Nothing I considered great from the original game was removed, so I enjoyed it just as much as the first one! Happy they didn‚Äôt overdo it, but it‚Äôs not really that ‚Äúremastered‚Äù either, looking at it from that perspective.

Most of the bosses that are ‚Äúcheese-able‚Äù from the original are still as easy to kill in the same manner. I could still allow poo to kill a few of them, poison arrow others without being noticed, use fire through doors, and things like that. I won‚Äôt go into spoilers, but there is plenty of info online about how to cheese a bunch of these if you really want to know. I recommend facing them in NG/NG+ and then maybe resorting to it if they‚Äôre too hard after a whole lot of tries, some leveling up, and maybe tweaking of gear setups, or if you already beat them a few times normally, and you would rather breeze through the remainder to get all the achievements.

I enjoyed some ‚Äúsequence-breaking‚Äù in this game, since I‚Äôd done things fairly traditionally the first go on Souls 1. On this one, for instance, I rang the Blighttown bell well before the Cathedral one. I beat most bosses in differing orders, and did other random fun things I never thought to do in the first game, since I kind of remembered the gist of how things went.

The combat is very intuitive, the environments, music, and the main ingredients to make a great game are all here, and they are beautifully done. This game is just amazing to play. The bosses and enemies have lots of variations on how to approach combat, ways to beat them, and strengths and weaknesses (such as using bows, magic, close combat melee, stealth, parries, elemental weaknesses or immunities, and so on).


[h1]Cons[/h1]

One of the least remastered games that labeled itself ‚ÄúRemastered‚Äù that I have ever played. Almost nothing changed. Aside from mentioned points above. Looks like the same game to me, and felt about the same. Just a bit easier.

It‚Äôs only around $5 USD if you owned Dark Souls 1 original/PTDE on Steam. It should honestly be free(!!), since there isn‚Äôt really a lot of new stuff going on. Kinda rude to make you pay for something you basically already have. There is hardly anything notable beyond what I already expressed. It‚Äôs nice if you finished the first one and want to replay it, and get 100% of the achievements again, however. Some of us are just masochistic.

Can still use some tactics to cheese and also to level up easily if you want to waste a bit of time on doing so at certain parts of the game. I‚Äôm surprised they didn‚Äôt remove a few of these, or make it tougher to do.

You can get stuck at Vamos‚Äôs bonfire, and it‚Äôs hard as heck to get out of there if you are a bit under-geared. Skeleton wheels are just evil! Titanite demons and skelly wheels are the worst things in the game, probably.

Not enough room for the rest of the cons I have to list.

Background: Why DS is a 10/10 game? It simply created new genre in video-game industry. Nowadays, it's very rare to accomplish that.
Gameplay: It's often said that DS is a VERY HARD game for players that are either psychopaths or Einsteins. It's not true. YES, this game will punish you for wrong actions and mistakes, but it gives you true satisfaction and dopamine shot every time you roll over an attack or finally defeat that one boss that gave you trembles and tantrums. Most important thing is that you can in very simple way make that game easy, pick a bandit with master key and access locations from other side, two hand axe and one-shot early enemies. 

World: Great thing about this masterpiece is fact of non-linear world with lot's of metroidvania elements. Later in game you realise, that you can travel to other locations using shortcuts and that most of them are connected to other areas. Another great aspect of created world is that you can see endgame locations from the starting one and vice versa, whole world is connected and it's beautiful.

Lore: You can simply skip all dialogues and know nothing about nothing to enjoy this game. It has in my opinion one of the best method of story telling: Short descriptions of items and dialogues which you need to interpret. Stories of some bosses and final decision is very deep on philosophical level, if you played the game and it was fun, you can simply watch YT videos and other stuff about lore for enlightening, you will be like: ""ooh so he is that guy"" and ""so that's why that happened"" or ""damn that's sad"".

Conclusion: Game is great, i think it's one of those titles every man should play. Finally, little bit of my word to you, if you think this review is good, and want to give me some feedback, it would be very nice of you to give this review some badges, it's purely your decision and I don't want to be too pushy. 

Have a great day and keep playin' :3",1700600578,1700600578,True,54,0,0.770564854145050049,0,True,False,False

Now I cannot play the DLC anymore before clearing the game - AGAIN. (Almost no QoL improvements, downgrade in graphics compared to PTDE. Though Blighttown FPS issue seems to be fixed so... yay?)
3. Price abuse. It is 2023, the price for this game, in today's date is just abuse of monopoly power. If you do not care about the price though, its definitely a masterpiece (for its time).

Dark Souls, the unsung hero of the Battle Royale genre, stands head and shoulders above the rest, making Fortnite look like child's play in comparison. From the treacherous landscapes to the heart-pounding combat, Dark Souls is the true heavyweight in the competitive gaming arena.

Firstly, let's talk graphics. Dark Souls boasts a dark and gritty aesthetic that puts Fortnite's vibrant colors to shame. The hauntingly beautiful environments, the meticulously designed characters, and the grotesque monsters lurking around every corner make Fortnite's cartoonish graphics seem like a mere child's doodle.

Gameplay in Dark Souls is an exercise in precision, strategy, and relentless determination ‚Äì qualities sorely lacking in the more forgiving realms of Fortnite. Each encounter in Dark Souls is a high-stakes battle, and victory is a hard-earned reward that Fortnite's respawn mechanic can only dream of replicating.

The soundtrack of Dark Souls is a masterpiece that transcends the boundaries of typical gaming music. The haunting melodies and ominous tones perfectly complement the oppressive atmosphere, creating an experience that goes beyond the lighthearted tunes of Fortnite. Dark Souls' soundtrack doesn't just set the mood; it becomes an integral part of the soul-crushing journey.

In-game purchases? Dark Souls doesn't need flashy skins or emotes to keep players engaged. The reward is in the struggle, the triumph over seemingly insurmountable odds. In Fortnite, you may spend V-Bucks on superficial items, but in Dark Souls, your victories are the only currency that truly matters.

In conclusion, Dark Souls is the Battle Royale experience for those who seek a true test of skill, bravery, and perseverance. Fortnite may have the mass appeal, but Dark Souls is the unsung hero that delivers an unparalleled, unforgiving challenge. Prepare to die, Fortnite ‚Äì Dark Souls has arrived, and it's here to show you what real gaming is all about.",1700270326,1700270326,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

This game forces you to explore to find interesting gear and punishes you for not preparing to conquer areas ahead. However, while doing that exploring never feels like a chore. You never feel like ""god just let me go through already"" the enemy placements will at first, force you to stop and look ahead and make you think about how to challenge them. The game also doesn't hand you any wins, there are no participation trophies here, everything you collect in this game you earned. whether it be 10 souls from killing a rat or it is a boss weapon that you forged from beating the boss that took you 50 tries to beat.

The enemy design is very simple at times with wyverns, rats, skeletons etc. but at other times it is also very intriguing and some of the most abstract designs in video games with bosses and other major enemies. This is a plus as when you see a very unique design in the game it serves as a warning, and it also drives your curiosity to find out how it fights but more importantly, how you can beat it.

This game also makes you feel like an adult, it tells you the controls and nothing else. Everything you need to figure out on your own. You need to explore and find things that tell you where to go, whether they be NPCs or the description on items. The only thing limiting you in this game is your drive to explore and learn more about the world.

Let me paint a picture for you:
You've attempted this fight 30 times each time falling short. You make your way back to the boss arena, you've mastered the area before it maximizing your health entering the boss fight. The music kicks in, a beautiful orchestra accompanied by a choir of operatic chants. The stage is set, you know all of the bosses moves, you know exactly how the fight is going to go, you planned your strategy ahead of time, you use your buffing item that you learned the boss is weak to by reading the texts in the game and inferring with the knowledge you've accumulated over countless battles. The only thing to do now, is execute your plan to perfection. You start out strong dodging his moves and weaving in some counter attacks but you get a little greedy and get punished for it. your down, but not out. you fall back to recover but the boss doesn't let up. he keeps pushing you and you find yourself crumbling under the pressure, your plan is faltering. You pull off some miracle dodges and the boss finally calms down enough for you to stabilize. you get your bearings back, the buffs wore off but you still have plenty of life You start taking it slower, only going for 2 hits when you feel you can go for 3. slowly the boss is whittled down. The health bar is so low now. only a couple more hits and its over. you push your advantage you dodge aggresively. you swing, swing, swi- the boss counter attacks, waiting for the moment you got greedy and he hits you hard. your down to your last legs. both of you 1 combo away from death. the blood is pumping, the fear of having to do this again, the adrenaline of being so close to victory everything is telling you different things you cant get a thought into your head without contradicting it. ""play safe, run in, dodge and counter, bait an attack"" all of your options are in your head, the bosses hasnt done anything as if hes waiting for you to crumble under your own fear so he can finish you off. Then as the music swells, he charges in. the move you've seen countless times before, the move you've sworn to never die to again comes. you know exactly how to dodge it, where to optimally position your self after it to guarantee a counter hit. You feel it in your soul. you dodge, counter. its not enough your one hit away, the boss charges up his next attack, its coming, you have no time to decide what to do ""dodge or hit ? dodge or hit ? dodge or hit ? dodge or hit ?"" in under a second this one question bounces in your mind countless times you give in to your instincts and right as the bosses weapon is going to hit you, you swing your weapon and strike him down. You've conquered not only the boss but your doubts as well, you overcame it. the relief kicks in its finally over, the battle is won, but more still awaits.

[b]Review by Unam[/b]

Ah, good old Dark Souls. 

I'm a huge fan of the genre, playing and beating all of Fromsoftware's classics and I've enjoyed all of them (Yes, even Dark Souls II). Hell, I've even done an SL1 for Dark Souls III, and it was the most bittersweet experience of my life. I keep coming back to these games because I appreciate them as pieces of art and for being plain fun. Dark Souls is the second of the Soulslike genre, only being predated by Demon's Souls for the PS3. While not my favorite of the trilogy, Dark Souls is still a masterpiece and will likely hold up for ages to come. I adore this game, and I could end the review here and give it a 10.

[b]BUT[/b]

I'm reviewing this as a remaster of the original game, and that is where the package as a whole lacks. I'll review the game and then the remaster separately, and give it a single score. 

[h2]Part 1: Dark Souls [/h2]

In this portion, I'll discuss the original game. The game is a masterpiece. I find it incredibly amusing that this was only the second time Fromsoftware was dabbling with the genre. [b]They have managed to craft such an important landmark in gaming history, and their efforts and passion should never be unjustifiably doubted [/b]. I'll start with discussing the world, as that is my personal favorite part. Like other Soulslikes, the game offers extensive creation settings, allowing you to play whatever you want. The game also has a lot of different gameplay styles, including magic, pyromancy, miracles, and basic swords, axes, knives, and shields. You can literally play whatever you want to play, and it really helps with providing a lot of replayability. Out of the entire trilogy, Dark Soul's world remains the most interesting and innovative. All of the areas are so unique, from the soothing melodies of Firelink Shrine to the bloody atmosphere of Blightown and the haunted feels of New Londo Ruins, everything here feels so special and they all fit together perfectly. One of my favorite parts about the world is that it is all interconnected, and you never follow a straight path. As an example, in one playthrough I went straight to Undead Burg, which is most commonly the area where new people go, and in another playthrough, I went to the Catacombs. Sure, some areas are harder than others, but you can tackle the world in whatever direction you want, only being stopped by having to hit certain checkpoints along the story. What helps bring the world to life are the enemies, that are never recycled and are proprietary to a certain area, and they all fit with the tone of the environment. Along your journey, you will meet a few characters, and they all help guide you and give a brief description of your surroundings [Insert ""Praise the Sun"" joke here]. These characters tend to give you a glimmer of hope in this dark depressing world, which helps alleviate the player and gives tidbits of lore.  

Now, you can't go talking about Dark Souls without mentioning the bosses. While it doesn't have my personal favorite selection, some of the bosses are super iconic. There are roughly 26 bosses, with a few repeated ones. This is honestly a lot, but out of those 26, there are only 10 which are really good, with the rest ranging from decent to annoying. While this is fine, most tend to be super difficult, this is why most people use the phrase ""This is the Dark Souls of [genre]', speaking of which... 
Let me rant about the [u]DIFFICULY[/u]. The difficulty in Dark Souls is balanced, mostly dependent on the player's skill and willingness to repeat the action to make the difficulty. I'll set an example; You can literally grind the same enemy for 100 hours to get to level 300 and literally destroy anything in your path with a single hit, or, you could send yourself at level 1 and most certainly get destroyed in a single hit, it's up to you what you want to do. Personally, I would recommend against grinding unless you're feeling like you are under leaves for an area or boss. That's why I don't like the phrase ""Dark Souls is the hardest game ever made"" because it isn't and everyone that says that has probably never played the game. Hey, if you think it's the hardest game, all power to you, but you cannot deny its difficulty revolves entirely around the player. n

I especially adore the theme of [b]Perseverance[/b] in Dark Souls. [u]You are going to die, that is a fact and there is no way around that,[/u] but that is ok. The game is all about patience and not giving up. You are literally placed into one of the most demoralizing worlds ever and are placed against unsackable odds, yet you surpass them little by little, and adventure to find balance. This is what I love about Dark Souls. This is why I will never get tired of Dark Souls. [b]This makes it a masterpiece. [/b]

Dark Souls also received 1 piece of DLC, [u]Artorias of the Abyss[/u] and while you might groan, let me tell you that this is one of, if not the best, pieces of DLC I've ever played. It lets you explore new areas, battle new enemies, gather new weapons and spells, and fight new bosses. Bit of a spoiler, but Artorias and Manus are up there in my top 5 bosses of the entire series (My number one is Slave Knight Gael from DSIII if you're curious). It is an amazing appetizer for people that wanted more, and at the time of release, it was retailing for around $15 dollars at the time of release, which was a steal and puts into perspective how gamers are being mistreated nowadays, with DLCs of the same price only adding minimal content, a real shame. This is more Dark Souls, and if you loved the original experience you're going to love this. 

This is my review of Dark Souls and like I said before, it is excellent, I genuinely don't have a single complaint. I would give it a 10/10, but...

[h2] Part 2: Remastered Edition[/h2]'
[u]I don't like Dark Souls: Remastered.[/u] Let me put it into perspective. The original game came out in 2010 everywhere, where it was released for 60 dollars, like most other AAA games, and like other games, it became heavily discontinued after a few years, usually retailing between $15-$30 dollars. That's all and fine, but then in 2019 Bandai Namco alongside Fromsoftware announced a ""Remaster"" of the game. I put this in quotation marks because considering this a Remaster is a disservice to all Remaster. They literally slapped the game on Steam again, updated some textures, gave you the DLC, and called it a day. Now I'm going to list all the new features, ready?

1. ...

What's that? Do you think I made a spelling mistake? [u]No, the Remaster literally adds nothing new.[/u]. I wouldn't be complaining so much if they didn't delist the original version from Steam, furthermore, they didn't even give this as a free upgrade to the original owners, which is a complete spit in their faces. 

Here is what they should have done:

1. Rebuild the movement system so that it feels more fluid, much like Dark Souls III
2. Add a few more enemies and rework some of the bosses to give them a few more moves and make the fights more dynamic and make them feel less clunky.
3. Fix some of the glitches that the original game had.
4. Fix (or remove) Capra Demon. 

Not hard guys.

[h2]Conclusion[/h2]
 
I adore Dark Souls, it is one of my favorite games ever. It will forever remain in my heart. It has created a community of hardcore fans that respect and love it. Its world and bosses are some of the most interesting in the area, and at the time it was released it put Fromsoftware on the map. It created the best trilogy in gaming and its monumental achievements cannot be understated. However, this Remaster is terrible.

Far many before me can tell you about this game better than I, and I'm sure there's plenty after me who could also do the same, but I think that's almost fitting to the themeing of this game. or even, the entire series.
Quite simply put; it's a good game. One of THE best, of all time. I'm not joking it's very literally been voted as such.
 
It's still a 2011 game at it's core, so there is some old school clunk and jank, but it's not intrusive with it usually. movement speed is a little low, sure. but you can look past that most of the time. If you have some buddies to play alongside with, or even want to go completely solo, it's still really fun and enjoyable for both crowds.

The lore of course is super well thought out, even for simple things as to why your healing item works or why you respawn after you die. It however will not be giving you the answers to everything; but it does provide just enough for you to be able to draw your own conclusions, thus, YOU are actually included into how things went how things are. how things will be. 

Dark Souls is a game to test you in how strong your will is. 

There is no difficulty slider. there never will be one. and there never should be one.
which is poetically beautiful in its own right.
EVERYONE is on the same difficulty, thus, no one is treated unfairly. No matter what disadvantages you have in how you play, how you react, how you conduct yourself. You are challenged on the same equal level as everyone else. THAT, is the truest inclusivity imaginable. You are treated as an equal to every other player before or after you.  

Will you give up because you lost to a particular challenge 13 times in a row, or are you going to get back up, dust yourself off and go at it again until you win? the choice is purely yours. only you can make that choice, and thus, it's up to you on whether you can get through the game or not. 

Also, a super neat detail, it could be considered small to some; is the Two Bells of Awakening. If you're around two specific areas and you're hearing bells going off. that's quite literally other players in the game right this very second, who are beating those bosses and claiming victory by ringing the bells for it. It's just one of those synchronous moments that tell you that other people are making their way through their journeys as well along side you, and how they are doing in a way.  

Dark souls is a rich game, one steeped in lore, in how hard the Developers thought about every smallest detail, and it's always up to the player how much they want to take it in. If they want to ponder, just why a particular enemy is even in this particular area, or simply who's the next thing you gotta bonk to get out of your way. It is a game that deserves it's reputation, a game that earned the right to bear forth a new genre of gaming entirely, and change the landscape of gaming in its own unique way.

I do recommend you play it, whether as something you want to just smash and bonk your way through it, something to cherish as you play with friends, something you cleared on your own under a rather tough challenge/Speedrun, even under something super silly as ""Can you Beat Dark Souls while blindfolded on a banana"" or as something you keep with you, and ponder on for the rest of your life. 

just, do me a favor will you? 
Make sure that you never go Hollow friend, and safe journeys ahead.",1699566474,1699566474,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Literally, it's Dark Souls, the spiritual successor to Demon's Souls and the OG of the souls-like genre. You are the Chosen Undead, a Hollow shell of a person now destined to either take over as the herald of fire and rule over this chaotic realm or to plunge everything into an age of darkness forever. Master Dark Souls' unforgiving combat and challenging bosses as you traverse an expansive RPG full of some of the most impressive world-building I've seen in a videogame.

Going into this I had a decent amount of souls-like experience already. I had played Mortal Shell once, Jedi Fallen Order on the hardest difficulty, and Sekiro to 100% completion over about a dozen playthroughs. I expected to feel at least a little bit prepared but not a tremendous amount, considering Dark Souls plays a bit differently from these other titles and is also around a decade older than them. For the most part, I was right. Some outdated mechanics and awkward controls took me a very long while to get used to (don't even get me started on sprint, dodge, and jump all being bound and linked to the same button). Playstyle was significantly different as well; I was so used to the blocking/parrying-centric combat of Fallen Order and Sekiro that I was confused for a while on why blocking things with my medium shield in Dark Souls wasn't as effective. I hit a point of severe frustration early on in my playthrough navigating through the Undead Parish, and more specifically at the Bell Gargoyles boss fight. I felt that I was less often fighting my opponents in Dark Souls and more often fighting the game itself, trying to get it to work the way I wanted it to, the way I had set expectations for.

So I learned. I used the crafting system to keep my equipment upgraded to a point that felt more usable, I optimized my equip load so that I had a more medium-paced dodge roll as opposed to the heavier one, I focused my combat playstyle less on blocking and more on dodging and rotations. And I got better. I went from taking basically an entire evening to beat Bell Gargoyles to beating most boss fights in under ten tries, and quite a handful of those bosses on the first try. And as I learned how the game wanted me to play, how the game wanted me to explore, how the game wanted me to breathe, I could focus more on how incredible of an experience Dark Souls was. Despite being a decade old and one of the first games in its genre, I could feel the passion that went into its story, its environments, its combat, its character design. Once I got past that hurdle, I could name on one hand the number of times I was genuinely frustrated with Dark Souls, something that caught me by surprise considering the game's and series' reputation. 

I am still stunned with how much I genuinely enjoyed Dark Souls. Not that I was going in expecting to hate it but again, Dark Souls' reputation masquerades it as something that very few people come out of without losing a few patches of hair. And don't get me wrong, I still think run-backs and dual-boss fights are some of the dumbest things to grace the light of day, but my overall experience with Dark Souls was so incredibly positive. I am very excited to try the rest of the Souls series and Elden Ring next (I am aware of Dark Souls 2's problems please just let me dream).",1699160807,1699160807,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I went into this expecting an outdated jankfest but instead got a well-crafted and sadistically challenging experience that tested me and my sanity in ways most modern Soulslikes haven‚Äôt‚Äîeven those made by FromSoft.

My first few sessions all ended in rage quits, and I don't recall having said this many gamer words ever since I quit League of Legends almost a decade ago.

[hr][/hr]
[h1]Difficulty[/h1]
Dark Souls 1 has been referred to by many as ‚Äúeasy‚Äù‚Äîespecially compared to something like Sekiro‚Äîwith the implication that with difficulty comes quality. After having experienced this masterpiece, I can confidently say that this notion of Dark Souls 1 being easy comes from a fundamental misunderstanding of difficulty.

What is difficulty? What decides whether something is a challenge or a cakewalk? I‚Äôd suggest it to be the amount of effort and thinking a player has to put in to overcome the challenges set forth by the developers. Part of the draw of games with high difficulty is that, the greater the challenge faced, the greater the satisfaction received when we finally overcome it.

And when we talk about ‚Äúdifficulty‚Äù in Soulslikes, the conversation seems to be focused solely on how hard the bosses are. It‚Äôs always Malenia this, Malenia that, Waterfowl this, Waterfowl that.

However, a large part of the difficulty in Dark Souls 1 is focused on the maps themselves: the valleys, forests, caves, catacombs, and dungeons you‚Äôd have to work through to finally arrive at the boss at the end.

You are presented with numerous challenges that you can‚Äôt solve with a simple well-timed dodge roll‚Äîchallenges that are less about trying to figure out how to dodge Waterfowl Dance and more about keeping your wits about you as you explore this vast and beautiful world.

[h1]Exploration[/h1]
The map design in Dark Souls 1 is a work of art. Unlike in more modern Soulslikes, the way forward isn‚Äôt always clear‚Äîyou are forced to trawl through the unknown until you finally happen upon your destination.

You have classic ganks, ambushes behind corners, and archers shooting at you from seemingly unreachable places. However, accompanying them is a deluge of sadistic map design choices seemingly intended to engender a rage-filled, ‚ÄúARE YOU FUCKING SERIOUS?!‚Äù every time you encounter one.

Later game areas also often feature certain cancerous mechanics that would probably have driven me insane had I not acclimated to and embraced the BS with a simple, ‚ÄúOh, so we‚Äôre doing this now? Ahaha, okay, let‚Äôs go.‚Äù

What‚Äôs more, hidden paths flanked by perilous drops that would lead to secret areas in other games are, in fact, often the intended path in Dark Souls 1. As someone who always takes the time to clear the entire area of enemies before exploring every inch of the map, I [u]adore[/u] this map design.

It is often unclear whether the path I‚Äôm taking would lead to yet another secret area or the boss, and this sense of uncertainty is so much more mysterious and fun than when the Site of Grace is literally pointing to the next one. It‚Äôs also really nice how the fog gates here don‚Äôt always lead to bosses, which makes the surprise when you finally find a boss even greater.

[b][u]NPCs[/u][/b]
Some NPCs give you major hints about how to proceed or how your actions would influence the world, which is really cool. I had to retrain myself to actually pay attention to NPCs again due to how often modern games‚Äô NPCs just spew pointless nonsense.

However, certain NPCs should really, REALLY repeat their vitally important hints, because they are the ONLY indicators for how to proceed. If any hint was needed for this game, it would be to [b][u]listen very carefully to what the first NPC you meet at the hub tells you[/u][/b]. Write it down or screenshot it if you have to.

[b][u]Rewards[/u][/b]
What about your reward for finally overcoming these challenges? In other games, your reward for clearing some dumb puzzle is usually a useless ring the devs placed there for the sole sake of being a ‚Äúreward‚Äù.

In Dark Souls 1, you get anything from the emotional release of finally clearing the area, to secret paths leading to Bonfires and NPCs, to even one where you‚Äôre able to (moderate early-game spoilers) [spoiler]kill some bastard who would otherwise shoot at you with magic for 80% of the entire boss arena[/spoiler]. This is the most fun I‚Äôve had with exploration in a very long time.

Now, this is not always perfect‚ÄîI personally hate illusory walls because the ways to discover them are either a) unreasonably long periods of rolling into and hitting walls or b) using guides, both of which are extremely anti-fun. While this game hints at some of them, many are insanely hidden and often lead to extremely important NPCs and areas.

[b][u]Do Not Use Guides[/u][/b]
The last thing I will say about this topic is to never look up anything unless you‚Äôre absolutely, definitely, 100% stuck. And unless you want this game to become a boring cakewalk, do not look up an area or progression guide. A lot of the difficulty in this game is about exploring the unknown and figuring out how best to proceed. You can face that challenge head on‚Äîor you can Fextralife the fun out of the game.

You are ultimately free to do whatever you want, but I will tell you that using a guide for this masterpiece of a game is like flipping on a switch for Elden Ring that will summon a Mimic Tear +10 at the start of every major fight‚Äîa switch you can never turn off.

Embrace the unknown. Get lost, get mad, and git gud.

[h1]Boss Fights[/h1]
Compared to more modern Soulslikes, the difficulty in many boss fights comes less from the bosses‚Äô movesets themselves and more from the arenas in which said fights take place.

I won‚Äôt spoil anything, but I will stress that instead of solely testing your reaction speed and the dexterity of your fingers to dodge through attacks, the test of skill here is often about forcing the player to figure out ways to mitigate the sadistic and annoying cancer present in many of the boss fights.

The collection of bosses in Dark Souls 1 is such a perfect blend of testing your brain along with your skill. While I definitely enjoy my Waterfowl Dancing amputees and old men armed with katana, spear, and Glock, this style of difficulty is so much more varied and enjoyable, even if the fights themselves are indeed easier from a skill-based perspective.

[b][u]Runbacks[/u][/b]
While the runbacks here are definitely longer than those in modern Soulslikes, I didn‚Äôt feel as annoyed for some reason.

Since the difficulty in modern Soulslikes is concentrated almost solely in the bosses, runbacks in those games feel like a nuisance. In contrast, since the difficulty in Dark Souls 1 seems more puzzle-focused, doing the runbacks quickly, safely, and efficiently felt like simply yet another puzzle to be solved.

Or maybe I‚Äôm just glazing because I still can‚Äôt believe how good this game is.

According to many players Dark Souls is one of the hardest game series out there. It‚Äôs rare that solely beating a video game is considered an achievement itself. To do just that you need to go through a purgatory of constant failures, pain and frustration. It‚Äôs a production that many people take on mainly just to challenge themselves. Still, there is more to this game than just being ‚Äúa bit more difficult than an average video game‚Äù.

Your character wakes up in a prison cell and you find out about the curse of the undead. The curse causes you to lose all power and come back to life after each death, until you start to lose your mind and become one of the empty husks, ghouls mindlessly roaming the many castles and dungeons you explore. 
Once you leave the walls of the asylum you were locked in and learn about the prophecy of the Chosen Undead, you travel to Lordran to rekindle the fire, lift the curse and save the world. 
Well, did you grasp the main concept? Was it too general of a story, not specific enough? That is Dark Souls. If you pay attention to the prologue and the actual things you do in the game, you might get [i]some[/i] idea of what is even happening. But this game is a big jigsaw puzzle. Many things you do in it are for you to just progress further. You don‚Äôt get the context of the fight with this big spider monster and what defeating it means for this location. You just want to get past it. This context you find in environmental storytelling, item descriptions and enigmatic dialogues with NPCs.
You can only understand Dark Souls when you actively seek out its secrets. Its actual story is not only not handed to you on a silver platter, but is also full of lies, falsehoods and manipulations. The characters have their own goals, things they say are not always the truth and it doesn‚Äôt matter if they are purposefully spreading lies or are just as oblivious as we are.
I‚Äôm not saying that to correctly appreciate this game you must become the absolute lore master, it‚Äôs not the point. I‚Äôm saying that by just playing the game to beat it, you will miss a lot of its artistic value. It‚Äôs full of interesting side plots (my absolute favorite is Artorias and Sif) and metaphors. Damn, people are writing research papers about this game, I considered it too.

The gameplay itself is like this: you go from a bonfire (which is your checkpoint) as far as you can, ideally to the next one, defeating or evading enemies as you go and acquiring their souls. Souls are the currency that lets you level up, upgrade your gear or buy items from merchants. You explore many different locations, fighting various enemies, finding items and uncovering secret illusory walls. You face formidable bosses each testing your skills.
So what is so difficult then? My take is that Dark Souls difficulty consists of several main points. One of them is losing all your power after death. When you die you lose all your current carried souls and humanities (humanity is a whole different mechanic I won‚Äôt be explaining here) and leave a blood stain close to the place you perished. If in your next attempt, you manage to reach the stain you‚Äôll recover all your lost power. If you die before that though, the stain gets replaced with a new one, making you lose all previous progress. It can be equally addicting as demotivating.
Another unpleasant thing is running back after each death.
Thirdly, this dark fantasy adventure is oddly realistic. Your character has a stamina bar that depletes with almost every action. Sprinting, dodging & rolling, attacking, blocking hits all use stamina and once you run out of it, not only you cannot attack further, but also you can‚Äôt dodge away. It‚Äôs important to keep track of your stamina bar, because besides knowing a few spells, you are just an ant with a toothpick to that Gaping Dragon ‚Äì one wrong move can mean the end for you. Combat itself is also pretty tactical, if you can call it that. You must position yourself in a way so that if the enemy swings at you, you don‚Äôt roll off a cliff or into the lava. Even just healing yourself is a tricky decision ‚Äì you must make sure that you have time to do that mid-combat. The animation takes time and foes won‚Äôt let you take a break. 
In conclusion one of the most frustrating situations can be that you die to a boss, try to run back fast for your souls while being mad, start making mistakes along the way, get beat up by some funny skeletons because you swinged at a wall instead of them, miraculously survive only to roll off a cliff and die again. Then rage quit.
Sounds bad right? Do I think this game is hard?
It‚Äôs certainly above average. But I think the key here is to keep the right mindset. You will die a lot, it‚Äôs not only part of the experience, but also the best way to learn. The game teaches you to live with failures and that it‚Äôs never truly over unless you don‚Äôt get back up. Also, there is no shame in screwing up ‚Äì the beauty of this game is you can have 300h in it and still die in a stupid way. 
You are given many tools to aid you. You can always farm some souls and level up yourself or your gear before moving on. You can experiment with your playstyle and build. There is pretty much no best armor or best weapon here (except for some cheesy magic builds I heard of), just play around and find what‚Äôs best for you.
And your biggest help might be the multiplayer feature. You can summon other players (or AI characters) to help you fight a boss you have trouble with. The MP also works in more subtle ways: players can leave messages to each other on the floor, helping you find treasure or warning you of some danger. This can also troll you and make you roll into the wall repeatedly, but hey, it‚Äôs part of the charm. 
DS has some mechanics that aren‚Äôt really explained to the player, you have to google them on your own. Many people will probably say ‚Äúit‚Äôs part of the difficulty and mystery of the game, it‚Äôs good!‚Äù. But man, I think things such as Equip Load could‚Äôve been explained a little better.

The remaster is my first encounter with the game, so I won‚Äôt be comparing anything here. The game looks good and has a great aesthetic. Environments are amazing, so are the enemy and boss designs. Really, solely how the bosses look like can tell you a little about their story (Artorias having a broken arm). The world is dying in this game, it‚Äôs basically medieval fantasy apocalypse. Many foes once great and powerful, now are sick, wounded or lost their former power. They still will give you a hard time though. Anor Londo might be the greatest visual achievement here ‚Äì not many game locations will leave that kind of impression. It only grows on you when you uncover its secrets.

The music is an interesting thing in Dark Souls. Overall, many times it‚Äôs not there. You just hear your tired footsteps, undead yelling, sounds of combat struggle. That makes the moments when music appears all the more powerful. There are only a few locations with background music. The boss themes not only are intimidating and adequately convey the fact that you‚Äôre going to get your ass handed to you in a moment, but often they give off more specific feelings. ‚ÄúKnight Artorias‚Äù is menacing, but then it tries to tell you the tragedy of the character. Gwyn‚Äôs theme should be the biggest and most bombastic track of all ‚Äì it‚Äôs the final boss battle. Instead, it‚Äôs just this melodic, melancholic piano.

It‚Äôs not easy. You have to fail; you must learn the game and it requires a lot of patience and resolve. In the end though, it‚Äôs not only worth braving the darkness for the sense of satisfaction, but also for the incredible world building.

Most bosses just use 3 or 4 different attacks and the strategy is to just hug them and swing because the rolling just sucks, they're really anti-climactic.

It is riddled with bad design decisions and while it can be fun, most of the time it's just frustrating and tedious. Examples include:

- Sparse respawn points; dying makes you go over the same spot again and again. This makes the game ""grindy"" without the actual benefit of the grind.
- No explanation of game mechanics and poor UI, which artificially raises the difficulty and prompts players to lose time or make bad decisions. I think this is one of the biggest problems of this game; once you learn the mechanics and few other gimmicks, the game becomes much easier (which further proves this point).
- Slow movement which feels unresponsive and frustrating at times.
- Artificial difficulty introduced through poor mechanics, such as ""darkness"" (which also makes the level feel longer then it really is), invisible pathways, sparse spawn points again or enemies waiting all day in that small nook behind a corner for an off chance that player comes by.
- Jumping mechanics are just atrocious, but sometimes required to reach certain places.
- ""quests"" which depend on player doing random stuff with no indications of what to do (people with stockholm syndrome might call it storytelling).
- Blighttown, 'nuff said.
- Price (worth 10$ tops).

If you are a big fan of FromSoftware's games, I still would not recommend to buy it. Watch youtube playthroughs, it's going to be way cheaper and more fun. If you still want to play it after going through a playthrough you might enjoy it more now that you know the gimmicks that artificially inflate the difficulty.

I finished the game only to be able to say I finished it. It wasn't very enjoyable experience and a lot of my struggles came from the game not explaining itself (which can be mitigated a bit by reading wiki/guides). I only enjoyed about a quarter of my time there; most of the game is dying in stupid ways due to some of the flaws listed above. And after all that time final boss fight was anticlimactic, easy and the ending disappointing. I recommend their later games; the more the improved on their formula, the better it gets.  

I definitely do not recommend this game and regret wasting my time on it.",1698849840,1698849840,False,1,1,0.449291795492172241,1,True,False,False

But, fine. If you need to see the words: Dark Souls is a good game. Still! It's still good, even though there are other games that are like it that are also good. You should play it. Even if you looked at it and was like ""nah, not my deal"" or ""I hear that's hard, I don't like stressful games""... no. Unfortunately, your opinion on Dark Souls matters as little as mine does. It's still a good game. You should still play it. Because for all the things you and I might believe ABOUT Dark Souls, the only way to find out if you like the game is to play the game. There are reasons everyone says it is a good game. If you need to, wait for a sale. But try it.

If only the back half was as metroided as Firelink. I also got a bit over leveled for some areas before even going to them, mostly all of the bone zone, this is my least favorite part of RPGs. Oh, and do not get me started on the Tomb of the Giants, Hollow Knight fixed this ez oversight. Unpolished aspects like these burnt me out on this one of a kind unfinished masterpiece.

But here I am starting over because Firelink is just the best, and I wanna try pyromancy.
Annnnd I am right back to where the game falls apart, aka depending on fast travel.

And then again is The Bed of Chaos.

I'm all for hard difficulty in games, no challenge means no fun, but this Boss was designed by some kind of psychopath I tell you.

It being my first soulsborne, it was truly an experience filled with wonder and rage. One example of wonder would be me taking the lift under the first bell tower. One example of rage would be the walk back to the Taurus Demon. That is probably the most mad I had been at a video game in a very long time, but being more well versed in these types of games now, I look back on it and laugh.

Coming back over a year later, and after beating Elden Ring, I must say this game has so much to offer. The only stipulation being that you are willing to put in the time to learn the game, and to get better. Coming into the game I had so much drive. I wanted to beat every Dark Souls before Elden Ring came out, just to have that experience. just to not even get halfway through the first game before calling it quits. After giving it a second go and completing it, I will say that you shouldn't throw in the towel, or you're going to miss out on one of the greatest gaming journeys I've been on. 

This game, for newcomers, will beat you down over and over again. The game, for players who have played before, will beat you down over and over again (but more fun this time).

Feeling inspired, I decided to take on the classic trilogy, starting with Dark Souls I.  Being a much earlier game, you can tell the graphics and gameplay were still in their ""working out the kinks"" process, but that doesn't stop this game from being a masterpiece.  It may not have the open-world aspect that Elden Ring or match it's beauty in world design, but it is truly a work of art.  The way the world is all linked together and the main storyline are what drive this game and I'm all for it.  I definitely need a guide for a few parts to see where to go next, but other than that, the game is fairly linear without forcing the player to make one decision or another.  I, personally, found this game  lot easier than I was expecting (thank you, Sekiro), but that allowed me to focus less on grinding to prepare for a boss fight and more on the story that I'm experiencing.  Overall, this is a 10/10 game.

Dark Souls Remastered was some of the least fun I have ever had in gaming. A mixture of terrible combat, horrendous level design, awful bosses, and ugly graphics come together to create an overall garbage experience.

Let's begin with the combat. Wow, it's bad. Like really bad. When I played I tried almost every build. While the weapons were different, they all had one thing in common. They felt like shit to use. I tried straight swords, greatswords, curved greatswords, katanas, rapiers, axes, spears. I even fucking tried bows if you can believe it. EVERYTHING FELT LIKE SHIT TO USE! I ended up settling on a pure magic build. While magic still felt overall bad to use, it was the best option because it got rid of a lot of the bad mechanics that plagued melee weapons. One of the main issues that I had with the melee combat was the fact that if a pixel of your weapon made slight contact with a wall, it would stagger you. Enemies did not suffer from this which lead to bullshit situations where you were not able to hit enemies if they happened to be in a tight hallway or something similar to that. This is just one of the many things that really stood out to me. Combat was generally unsatisfying and clunky.

Next, let‚Äôs go over the level design. I don‚Äôt even know where to begin with this. With the exception of maybe Undead Burg and Undead Parish (the first couple of areas of the game), the levels of this game are laughably bad. It‚Äôs honestly kind of impressive that they managed to make a world this terrible to traverse. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if they held some sort of contest when making this game to see who could make the worst level. I know I keep going on and on about the level design, but it‚Äôs actually that bad. Blighttown, Sen‚Äôs Fortress, Anor Londo, New Londo Ruins, The Duke‚Äôs Archives, The Catacombs, GODDAMN NEARLY EVERY FUCKING AREA IS DOGSHIT! I kept telling myself that there was no way that the next area could be worse than the last and I was wrong every time. The only redeeming quality about the world/level design is how they link a few areas back to Firelink Shrine. They only do this about three or so times that I can remember though.

Finally, let‚Äôs end this negative review by talking about maybe the most important part of a Dark Souls game, the bosses. If you were hoping for me to say something positive about this, sorry they are bad too. I guess you can say they fit the vibe of the level they are in. Sadly the vibe of each level in this game is ass. The best bosses in this game are mediocre and the worst ones are downright offensive. Capra Demon and The Bed of Chaos are genuinely some of the worst bosses I‚Äôve seen in gaming. Bosses that generally get praised in the Dark Souls community such as Ornstein + Smough and Great Wolf Sif are barely any better.  

Dark Souls Remastered consists of bad combat, garbage level design, and unfun bosses. I am absolutely flabbergasted, fucking astounded, that some people consider this the best game in the trilogy. I feel like Fromsoft should come to my house and apologize that they made this mess that I played through. I would not recommend this game unless you dislike fun, or if you just want bragging rights saying that you beat the game.

What I would consider the last seminal release of the AAA video game industry, a one-of-a-kind title even the original developer can't seem to fully re-capture the magic of. The cornerstone and main highlight of the game is the world and level design, everything is interconnected with multiple paths to reach different places with numerous shortcuts to help progression and ease backtracking. With no fast travel in the game until the last 20% or so this gives the game an incredible sense of immersion. 

Further helping with the game's immersion is its sparse use of music, reserving its sparse tracks for the games boss fights and only 4 in game areas; the only thing you will hear throughout most of this game is your own footsteps and the sounds of your environment. While there isn't much music each track is memorable, Gywn's theme, Firelink Shrine's theme and Sif's theme being highlights. 

Combat in this game is weighty where every action you make needs to be deliberate to succeed. Dark Souls difficulty is a bit of a meme, especially in the case of DS1 where the original PC release had the ""Prepare to Die"" subtitle. The game isn't really difficult, it just punishes bad behaviors and not thinking through what you're doing both in exploration and combat. Being too aggressive in combat and not watching your stamina will get you killed in enemy encounters. At the same time spamming dodges without paying attention to enemy patterns will also get you killed. While dodging has generous invincibility enemies will mix up their attack timing, delaying swings and changing patterns. You need to pay attention to both your opponent(s) and your surroundings and adjust each of your actions accordingly. 

For PVE the game is very balanced and offers numerous ways to build and outfit your character. Certain builds will struggle more with certain boss fights and situations but excel at others offering a lot of ways to play and replayability. Between the original release and the remaster I've played 4 very different builds and had a fun and interesting time with each. And despite not being able to re-spec a character on an individual playthrough the game has a ton of replay value with its varied quests, ambitious NG+ features and actually challenging (and farming heavy) achievements. 

While the story is pretty simple, the world's lore and overall tone of the game is incredibly engrossing. At the start of the game, you are given a good baseline of why your character is doing what they're doing and a broad foundation of the world you find yourself. However, by observing your environment for context clues and reading item descriptions you'll find a rich, in-depth lore that lets you have fun filling in the blanks yourself. This is complimented by countless memorable NPC, enemy, environment and weapon designs that still hold up all these years later. 

The remaster is generally an improvement, which with how poor the original PC port was isn't really a great accomplishment. The only major negative is that by changing the lighting system to a more ""realistic"" one the high contrast art style of the original is partially lost making some select areas and enemies look pretty bland compared to the original version of the game. The game still does look good overall however and you wouldn't really notice it unless you were very familiar with the original release. 

As for flaws with the game itself, I feel there are only 2 major ones. The first is that the games netcode is abysmal, PVP in all forms it takes is more funny than something that's really engaging because of how bad the rubberbanding and stuttering can be. Considering this a remastered re-release it‚Äôs disappointing nothing was done to address this issue that plagued the original (and all its sequels). Co-op is more forgiving in this regard, however if you are not the host there is still a good chance you can get a bad connection and just end up in a laggy, rubberbanding hell where none of your inputs will be read and acknowledge by the game until 10 seconds after you've pressed them. That being said there is no real reason you need to engage with the online functions of the game outside of trying to get certain covenant rewards. While the idea of invading or protecting other players' games sounds neat in concept the netcode makes it more of a headache in practice. That being said, all of this is entirely optional, you opt-in to the games online function by using an in-game consumable that basically gives you a status effect that enables the online functionality for you. So, by simply not using this item you never have to interact with these parts of the game. The less online intrusive elements like soap-stone messages and player ghosts are still as novel and enjoyable as they were at the time of release, however. 

The second flaw is the covenant system itself. Covenants are in game allegiances that offer certain rewards by ranking them up, normally through collecting certain items and engaging with some form of PVP or co-op. While the concept itself is fine none of these covenants explain how they work or what they reward when you find them in game. While a lot of stuff in Dark Souls is intentionally vague for lore or immersion reasons there is no reason for a player character to blindly join a covenant without being told what their about or what they offer to the player and is immersion breaking in itself. Outside of that this lack of explanation just leaves the player confused and forced to look up information online. This is something that could easily be fixed with in game dialogue from covenant heads or even info in the game menu when interacting with a covenant head. 

Now while I see these as flaws, they are both essentially optional systems (game is fully playable offline and you are never forced to interact with covenants), so they don't hamper the overall experience of the game. If you've not played it before I strongly recommend experiencing it, this is a classic title I grow to appreciate even more as time passes.",1698185634,1698185634,True,4,0,0.536446928977966309,0,True,False,False

My only frame of reference so far for Soulslikes is Elden Ring so if you don't like me comparing the two then stop reading.

I find it rather interesting that a lot of the DNA in Elden Ring can be found here in the original (sans Demon's Souls) in that there are a lot of diverging paths and exploration is on some level free-form. I was expecting a mostly linear experience but found it was actually pretty open-ended which was really neat, and stumbling randomly across new areas when I was just expecting a dead-end with some item was fantastic. The whole ""if you're stuck somewhere go some place else"" idea is present here as well, although the lack of fast travel until O&S ended up being really annoying for backtracking.

I was expecting to be more annoyed by the massive walks of shame but I got pretty used to them quickly. There are some that are more egregious than others, but the game teaches you to be patient and slow when exploring, so taking time to go back to the boss room wasn't as frustrating (unless I had to go through annoying enemies to get there.) The walks in this game make the run back to Placidusax look like child's play, since while it's pretty long with that fight, you can at least run past a lot of the enemies whereas in this game you often are pretty much forced to fight them unless you want to get stabbed in the back.

PvP is just as bad as Elden Ring, tried it out for a bit, and got teleport backstabbed by a gravekeeper UGS that one-shot me three times in a row before I gave up on trying to guess where he was on his screen due to latency. Speaking of, it's really neat and interesting to me that there are so many different PvP factions that often have unique mechanics. Makes me wonder what it was like in the hayday at peak activity. Kinda rare to get invaded in my playthroughs.

Damage scaling was a nice surprise but it took me one bricked build to realize that vigor is a stat you basically don't have to invest in for half the game. I got stuck on Moonlight on my first playthrough because my ZDPS dex build was failing to 6-round him and it was getting annoying. Read a thread that said you should be 3-rounding him and that re-speccing isn't in the game and got the hint. On my second I basically didn't even level Vigor at all for like half the game.

This game does Dual Bosses right which is a shame since Elden Ring seems to have deeply forgotten this methodology of design. O&S might be one of my favorite bosses now and it's comical to compare it to the foreskin duo in ER. That being said, while boss design in some respects is better, some are just kind of... bad? Capra Demon stands out to me since he's really aggressive and in a tiny room with two dogs that also rush you down, so there's basically nowhere to run and heal. Sure, you can just adapt by playing aggressive and using shield instead of trying to heal off all damage, but I can't help but feel like this fight would be more fun if you had A LITTLE more space between the enemies before they were on you and the arena were maybe... twice as large. with another arena that size placed horizontally? I don't know.

idk how to finish this off, I'll just say Claymore is my baby (love the rolling two-handed R1) and it's insane how they only have one ring slot in the game since one of them is permanently taken up by Ring of Favor and Protection. Moving on to Dark Souls 2 next, surely it can't be that bad right?",1698164863,1698166462,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I quit my first time as I was not enjoying the whole feel of the game at all (I started out with DS2 back in the day and played that and DS3 before 1 which was a big reason for this) as it feels a bit slow and stiff nowadays. But I forced myself through eventually with DS1 R. I did not have alot of fun that time either, and especially in the second half as I did not even enjoy the gameplay, which is basically what carries that part of the game.

But this most recent time I actually had alot of fun which kind of surprised me. I do think it is due to me finally finding a weapon and playstyle that I actually enjoyed with the slower more deliberate gameplay. Earlier I went with dex/quality builds but this time I went full Zweihander and had so much more fun. Also inspired me to do a full playthrough of the series with Zweihander which I am currently very much enjoying.

The game itself is basically split into two parts. Everything up until Anor Londo is basically why this game is regarded as a masterpiece. More so in gameplay and the progression, as I do think the bosses are a bit of a mixed bag, even throughout the whole game in fact with not alot of truly great ones. But dang if the level design is not just incredible, and also the atmosphere. But the second half is actually kind of terrible. Bosses go from pretty good to the absolute worst I have met in a game and the levels are super uninspired in their design. The saving grace in the late game is the DLC which I think have the best bosses in the game by far (Artorias is really fantastic). I do not blame people for not getting through the second half (like myself lol), but I do think it is worth it in the end to get through it all.

Luckily I enjoyed the gameplay way more this time which made that second half much more enjoyable for me. Has very much opened up my eyes more why people still insist the first one is the best, even though it is such a flawed game. I still do not agree as DS3 is still my favorite due to it being great throughout, but at least I now like both DS1 and 2 the same (OG, not SotFS) as they both even out to a similar enjoyment level to me in the end (I liked DS2 way more than 1 back in the day, but I know that can be due to alot of nostalgia) I also think I would rather replay this than DS2 due this game being quite short in comparison. Pretty sweet game and series ofc.

So much so that it took me three rage-uninstalls and four brand-new characters to finally commit to a full playthrough. But boy, when it clicked, it CLICKED. This is, in my opinion, one of the greatest games ever made. 

Pros:
-The level design is probably the greatest ever in gaming history. Every single area is a memorable experience. The game also rewards exploring these unique areas by giving you items, NPCs to talk to, and shortcuts that make your way to the boss easier and faster. 
-The enemy design, of both the common enemies and the bosses, is masterfully done. All of the bosses are unique. They look badass and creepy. 
-The soundtrack is amazing. I sometimes visit Firelink Shrine just to chill and listen to music.
-This is a FromSoft game. So, naturally, the combat is the strongest point of the game. It's rewarding and extremely fun. Getting better after every try against a boss and finally defeating them after hours of trial and error is the most satisfying thing I have ever experienced in any game I have ever played.

Cons:
-Some areas have just a little bit too much bullsh*t. Sometimes it can be helpful to just put the game down, clear your mind, and come back the next day when you feel frustrated about some of that bullsh*t. 
-The game can be too vague at times. [spoiler] Accessing the DLC is an entire quest for no reason at all. I also remember needing to check a guide to find the door that went to the Lower Undead Burg after running around like a mad man trying to find a big door. [/spoiler] But 95% of the time, the game will reward your exploration, and you will eventually find a way to progress.

Amazing game with a great lore. Made me fall in love with the franchise. 
9/10.

Also be warned new coming players.
Players with larger hours on the game will invade you with 99 humanity, fully upgraded armor and weapons, at a low level. 

They are called twinks, Run back to the closest bonfire and jump off the cliff, you can block them through the steam player recent play list, to never be invaded by them again, They completely ruin anything PVP wise, you will get one shotted no matter what. You can also deny them by entering boss rooms.

The worst great videogame I have ever played.

Do you want to to fight your way through poison swamps, treacherous cliffs, and lava lakes, all whilst only being able to dodge in 4 directions. Do you want to get lost, wonder what the hell you are supposed to do to progress, only to figure out you need to spend 20,000 souls, kill a giant wolf, and loot some dead guys grave just to get a ring that lets you fall through a very dark pit? Do you want to fight two bosses at once, or one incredibly frustrating flaming tree? Do you want to fall off of cliff after cliff after cliff, or get stuck in a corner and beat to death. Do you hate dogs? Do you like big booby women? Do you hate yourself? Do you love torture.

If you answered all of these questions with ""Yes, I DO!"", rethink your life. If that doesn't fix you, play dark souls.

I mean, I played this after beating Elden Ring several times over, beating bloodborne, beating Dark Souls 3, and I gotta say....damn this was hard. pretty challenging just because the pacing is so different from those other titles mentioned and it's retraining my brain and when I need to dodge roll or attack. 

A masterpiece title and one that I'm glad I experienced in an already amazing year for games.

My solitary existence was my constant companion, leaving me feeling like an outsider in a world that I perceived as unrelentingly harsh. My solace came from Limp Bizkit's music, whose angsty tunes resonated deeply with my troubled soul. Fred Durst's raw and emotional lyrics were the soundtrack to my life, speaking to the darkness that consumed me.

But then, I discovered Dark Souls Remastered on Steam, a game that would alter the course of my journey. Just like Limp Bizkit's intense music, the game plunged me into a world of shadows, challenging me at every turn. It felt like I was confronting the abyss within me, just as Limp Bizkit's lyrics had done for years.

The brutal difficulty and relentless enemies in Dark Souls Remastered taught me lessons that Limp Bizkit's music couldn't. It was a reflection of my own life ‚Äì failures, setbacks, and relentless struggles. And much like Limp Bizkit's music, the game showed me that even in the darkest moments, there are glimpses of light.

The game's intricate level design and hauntingly beautiful landscapes hinted at the hope that I'd never allowed myself to see before. It was as if Fred Durst's lyrics had come to life in the game, reminding me that even the darkest souls have pockets of brightness.

Just like Limp Bizkit's music served as my therapy, Dark Souls Remastered became my escape and a source of inspiration. It helped me confront the abyss within my soul and provided the strength to overcome it. I realized that, much like Limp Bizkit's music, there's redemption even in the darkest corners of life.

As I write this review, I can't help but draw parallels between my life, Limp Bizkit's music, and Dark Souls Remastered. They've all been essential in guiding me from darkness to light, proving that even the darkest souls can be remastered and can have spaces where it's bright and light sometimes.

TLDR: Limp Bizkit's music, like Dark Souls Remastered, shines a light on the darkest corners of the soul. Both have shown me that even the darkest souls can find redemption, just like Limp Bizkit's lyrics resonate in the darkest moments of life.",1697456391,1697456391,True,0,2,0,0,True,False,False

I have to say the game still holds up very well to my surprise and it is still great for first time enjoyers. The bosses are amazing and to my surprise I still remember the name of almost all of the bosses which I typically can't which just shows how memorable each boss is. The gameplay is still amazing which I honestly wasn't expecting considering it was the first in the series (I know demon souls came out before dark souls but I'm referring to the dark souls series) I can't wait to get all the achievements for DS1 and playthrough DSII and DSIII.

I actually have around 900 hours in this game, but regardless I'm not here to brag about playtime. I'm here to review one of my favorite games of all time, while also shitting on how this is a horrible remaster. This game, as a lot of people know, is absolutely amazing. From its interconnected world, to its methodical and intricate combat, this game is a joy. I don't want to go way too in depth over the game itself, as this is the REMASTERED version, not the original. All you really need to know is if you're considering Dark Souls, then buy it and give it a shot. Worst case scenario you can refund it if it's not for you! If this is up your alley, however, then prepare yourself for a magical experience until you kill O&S and it goes down to being just a pretty good experience (then it becomes a masterpiece then with Artorias of the Abyss). One other thing, though, this is a wiki game. Just like games like Terraria and Barotrauma, this game wants you to look at the wiki and learn about it, as it's super convoluted. Don't feel ashamed for checking out the wiki!
Anyways, onto the remastered part: it sucks. I wasn't lucky enough to get PtDE before it got delisted, but looking at comparisons they are next to the same thing given you install a performance mod for PtDE that is widely available and easy to use. If you own PtDE, this game is just as dead so don't bother getting it for the multiplayer. This was how I got started as a sunbro, but it's dead now just like the original. As with the Vampire Survivors review, I won't be putting a number score here because number scores are BS in my opinion, but my overall verdict is that it's still Dark Souls I, but if you already own another version of DS1 then don't bother.",1697310005,1697310005,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I‚Äôm trying, but I feel as if the game punishes me for exploration. Combat is so rigid and tanklike, but not impossible. Still, every enemy does enormous damage and takes so many hit points to defeat. Took me a few tries to beat the first boss, but I did it. Everything after that has been so awkward. I meet skeletons, but fighting them is not worth it. What I‚Äôm reading about the game says it‚Äôs damn near impossible to conquer it without taking tips from the community, which tells me to avoid combat as much as possible and collect items instead. But what are these items? Why am I collecting them?

Why are minor enemies such a MAJOR EVENT to fight? Challenge stems from the clunky combat controls instead of anything deliberate. When I die, often it‚Äôs because the game didn‚Äôt respond when I wanted to roll, or didn‚Äôt block when I pushed the button. So far I‚Äôm not enjoying this, all of these stats and items. Why can‚Äôt I assign a throwing item to a quick slot for easy use? I can‚Äôt explore without facing enemies I can‚Äôt defeat. I can‚Äôt fight. I can‚Äôt outrun most of the enemies. What am I doing?

The whole game seems to be built around the idea of respawning: the game will kill you over and over, but that‚Äôs ok because you can just go back and figure out how to proceed from there.

It's very fun and worthy of spending many days on to fully complete its storyline and maybe even go above and beyond with the achievements. I will admit, however, I feel like there's a lot of functions in this game that's left unexplained and likely will leave the player to have to research things. There are a few places you need to go that can't be unlocked until you get certain things (which aren't specified), in order to cast pyromancies/miracles/sorceries you need to have the appropriate conduit wielded (which wasn't explained), the stats at the start aren't elaborated on nor is there really an option to see what they affect, and I had no idea until about halfway into my first playthrough that there are different paths you can ascend your weapons to (i.e. lightning, magic, fire, etc.). So unless you know a lot about Dark Souls in advance before playing, you may have some trouble figuring some things out throughout the game. However, these downsides are not enough to get me to dislike the game. It was incredibly fun even with these quirks.

Well, that's changed this time around, I've finally beaten the game! It only took, what, 55 hours? I'm sure if I ever play it again, that it'll take maybe half the time. 

My thoughts on the game are vastly different than they were when I was playing this on my old 360; I had thought the game was wayyyy too difficult. Now I think that it's an experience of a game that most of everyone should play, or at least try to. The first half at least, the second half is certainly... Something. The whole game takes a noticeable drop of quality after Anor Londo, a criticism I'm sure that everyone under the sun remotely interested in DS1 has heard. If the entire game was built like the second half was, I'm sure that this game wouldn't have made as big of a ripple across the entire gaming scene as it did, in fact I'm positive it would have killed this entire series, and with it the souls-like genre.

It's not necessarily a bad game but a large part of the difficulty meme for this specific game is based off of how janky everything is. Hitboxes and collision are insanely inconsistent, my character would randomly fall off of rounded surfaces during platforming segments and then there's wild things like enemies backstabbing you from the side while you're in mid-air. A lot of the maps in this game are horribly designed (fuck whoever designed Tomb of Giants) and some enemies are extremely unbalanced. I've played through DS1 multiple times and every playthrough feels the same, the game is hard and frustrating because of it's legitimate difficulty but a larger part of it is the poor design. It would  be nice to see this get a proper remake like Demon Souls received.

While I don't particularly like playing this specific entry in the Dark Souls series I have to admit that it's my favorite in terms of its plot and its significance in the overall DS continuity. I don't hate this game I just think it needs a lot of polishing before I would call it an amazing game. I'm glad future titles were more refined than the previous iterations.

Overall, play it for the memes but DS2 is better.",1696878063,1696878406,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This game would break your soul, your controller and maybe even your monitor, and its worth each one of those things. its a once in a lifetime experience. To think that a game released 13 years ago, would not only stand up to modern gaming standards, but far surpass it, tells you all there is to know about this one.

the good - 

The NPCs of this game are some of the best ones i have encountered in any game. You almost start to connect with them and root for them to achieve their targets.

the combat is by far the best combat mechanics i have ever experienced. I was playing lies of P and dark souls side by side, and it is mind blowing how this 13 year old games combat matched, if not surpassed, the latest edition of soulslike on the market.

the bosses - some of the best. you need to strategise and analyse each one of them and plan your attacks accordingly. gives one a weird feeling of achievement for defeating a virtual enemy.



the bad -
that being said, the game is EXTREMELY frustrating. there are very few checkpoints and for some bosses you need to fight a dozen soldiers before you get a shot at them again. but its all about getting it.. once you get it - believe me this game would still beat your ass and humble you : D.

Ever played Zelda? Do you remember that feeling of adventure and discovery you experienced in those games? Well, dial that feeling up a notch and add in a lot of brutality. In short, that's Dark Souls.

Even to this day the PVP scene is alive and well and I regularly get into tons of thrilling, often nail-biting matches with other players.

Overall I would give DSR a 4/10 - worst game fromsoft has made to date for sure.

.Certain bosses are very gimmicky and unfun to fight. (Ceasless discharge and Bed of Chaos)

.The lighting is considerably worse than on the PS3. (How did you manage that?!?)

.Some armour sets just don't look right and the colours are all messed up.

.Has very serious balancing issues where it can jump from being impossibly hard to way too easy.

.There are areas of the game that actually made me uninstall because of how unfinished they are. (Just put some enemies in a circle in the level editor and call it a day? Really?)

.Absolutely awful jumping mechanics that WILL get you killed.

570940,147560213,76561198148160209,205,4,409,0,409,1696329795,"Man i really tried to like this game holy hell, but honestly everything about the game feels clunky, frustrating and tedious. Your attacks never hit how you want them too, controls are god awful with many things bound to the same few buttons (though i hear its much nicer on controller). constant backtracking for seemingly no reason, awful collision with enemies constantly blocking your path in tight spaces and your weapons bounce off walls so you can barely do anything about it.

Now i dont usually do reviews but im writing this mainly because i genuinely want someone to tell me why people like this game, none of the steam reviews say anything more specific than very general statements or just praising the difficulty, none of my friends who like the game can explain anything specific either. I think this game originally came out at a time when games were getting easier and all the reactionaries loved this game because it felt like a 90s game (probably the only game series for which saying it feels like its from the 90s is praise somehow), so it feels like people are more praising the game for some philosophical reasons rather than the actual gameplay itself. 

The only thing i hear people say is fun is ""getting better"" at the game but honestly when the gameplay is so clunky and tedious i feel like its more a case of needing to get better in order to even be able to progress in a game that is at it's core just a mediocre action game. And ok this may be the most problematic part of this review but honestly the game isn't even really difficult despite that being what everyone praises, as almost every death feels much more like you dying for some stupid reason and every time i'd die i wouldn't think something like ""i need to read the enemies attack better"" or ""i need to be more precise in my movements"", but instead something like ""damn i was stuck in a corner and couldnt do anything against 3 enemies when i couldnt even swing my weapon without hitting a wall and got stunlocked to death"".

I might be missing or not getting something in which case i'd happily let someone change my mind because it seems like all the aspects people praise is much more them coping than anything, with common praises being things like ""it doesnt hold your hand"", ""it feels like a game from the 90s"", ""the game is challenging"", but when you look at those statements none of the is praise its just a statement like the game has open exploration, feels dated and is tedious. Most people who praise the game just say something like ""oh yeah youre just bad if you dont like it"" or something of the sort but honestly ive played way harder games that were way more fun but the reason why those games were fun is because the core gameplay was always interesting, and it always felt fair and deserved, while dark souls 1 combat isn't particularly interesting and deaths feel more undeserved than anything, and the controls as well as not getting bored and impatient pose a bigger threat to you than the actual enemies in this game.

Honestly maybe its a sunk-cost thing, where you spend countless hours battling the controls and running through the same areas, and by the time you learn how to actually play the game, you make yourself believe youre having fun so as to not admit you wasted all that time on a mediocre game, and nobody wants to admit it so instead everyone just collectively decided to pretend to enjoy it or something and that all the bad game design is somehow actually incredible game design if you have 3 shots, squint your eyes really hard, and repeat the phrase ""its hardcore"" 99 times in front of a mirror.

I must admit however the one thing i can't comment on is the story and soundtrack since i definetly havent played enough to really get to see a lot of it so even though i don't find them anything special, ive definetly not progressed far enough to either hear the ""good tracks"" or witness the story or something. This is a pretty important point as i have many times played through games with awful controls and many tedious elements because the story and music were really good so i could see that changing my mind.

Once again, I ask someone to change my mind because i've genuinely tried really hard to get into these games and see anything positive but I just cannot, no matter how hard I try.",1696335333,1696335333,False,7,0,0.550909280776977539,4,True,False,False

Not Recommending due to the poor job the REMASTERED version received, it was just a re-release, they could had worked more on it for the price asked. 

Aside from that, Dark Souls is a unique experience, and each game should be on your library, as each one of them is a masterpiece from the gaming universe no doubt. 

Me being an OG, from Shadow TOWER on PS1, to Eternal Ring on PS2 and the Kings Field Series across, this one is a must on the expansive FROM SOFTWARE works. 

I recommend buying it on a sale if you don't got the PTD edition.

fixed issues: 
- jump is on L3 instead of Circle, which is also the key to run
- multiplayer: you can actually get summoned and summon this time; gravelording seems to be easier/working as well

not fixed issues: 
- fps issues: what would be small stutters in any 2018 game, like droping ~5fps brings the remaster down to 30fps, that feel like 10fps
**- jumping: the game originally was in 30 fps and if u play the PC version u get 60 fps, but the jump distance is halfed **(seems fixed, had no problem with the longer jumps on 2nd playthrough)
- lagging multiplayer (lagstab)
- multiple ledges/clipping environment still exist (ie great hollow, lost izalith, ...)
- alt tabbing still doesnt work: game will either refuse to switch tabs or go in windowed mode to do so, which you need to change in the options every time it happens",1548671445,1696240518,True,0,0,0.52581632137298584,1,True,False,False

Pardon me but i'll need some time for playthrough 2&3...
Review coming once i have finished it.

Here we are, game finished.

This version is pretty bad compared to the OG.
There's a ton of imput delay and for some reasons the chosen undead randomly starts walking a bit whenever.

Those two things nuked builds that aren't long range or turtle.

Dex and parrying all the time is out of the window, weapons with long attack animations too.

The graphical and framerate upgrade is just not worth it.

You're better off sticking to the original PC version and use DSfix or get it on PS3.

It's still an incredible game but it's the worst From Software port i've seen yet.

I will say, I don't understand the hype around this game. In all the other souls games I've played, I've rarely felt cheated or cheesed. I lost count of how many times I got hit my attacks I felt I dodged, got combo-ed by a boss or stun locked by normal enemies. With that being said, I did find myself laughing at some of these deaths and I did enjoy my time in Lordran.

Gonna try and do some pros and cons I had with the game I guess:

[h2]PROS[/h2]

- The bosses felt fair for the most part and all were fun to fight
- Enemies are relatively easy to dodge and backstab looping is always a blast
- Upgrade materials are readily available until late game, costing an appropriate amount of souls to buy and are dropped somewhat regularly from normal enemies
- The setting is great

[h2]CONS[/h2]

- The lack of early game fast travel leads to some fun instances where you spend 30 minutes running between areas of the map just to unlock the ability to upgrade your weapons more or to allow you to upgrade your flasks (since you can only carry one fire keeper soul at a time...)
- Boss run-backs are atrocious. I hope you enjoy running for 5-10 mins to get back to the boss and then spend 3 seconds fighting it before getting true combo-ed.
- Many areas felt barren or pointless, they were only there to add needless complexity or to add difficulty getting back to the bosses
- You need a consumable to kill certain enemies that costs 4000 souls (stupid ghosts in new londo)

I really didn't like it at the start and didn't get the appeal. By now, I finally understand why people like the souls games. I still really dislike the PvP though. Having someone with 1k hours in the game just destroy you randomly sucks. At least you can entirely avoid this by just being hollow most of the time and only being human when you need it and don't care about dying.

Surprisingly, I haven't gotten super frustrated with this game. With the exception of PvP, when you die, it's at least 95% of the time your fault and it feels fair. Failure doesn't feel as bad when it was the result of your own actions. I get much angrier at multiplayer FPS games.

As for this being a ""remaster,"" it's pretty much the same as the original game. Just a different lighting system that changes the game's feel in an overall negative way, but the game runs at a stable 60fps even at 4K resolution for me so it doesn't really matter as much. If it ran poorly AND looked dated, then I would have an issue with it.



For anyone who is reluctant to play the game or isn't enjoying it yet, all while likely being told to ""git gud"" by the gatekeepers of the community, just keep going. It'll take a while for it to click, but you'll steadily improve and your experience will get better alongside your skills. The game never lets up in terms of difficulty, but you'll get better at handling all of the doodoo feces it likes to throw at players until you can just clown on all the enemies.

After the tutorial stage, you are just left on your own to discover everything that the world has to offer. Everything in the world will try to get you, and you need to push back hard so that you won't get swept up and go hollow. The storytelling is cryptic, and you won't really get it unless you really start piecing together the story that comes from the item descriptions and the environment. But unlike some modern games, the story is worth the effort, and it is like a puzzle mini-game inside the game itself, so I enjoy it.

Combat feels much more basic, heavier, and strategic compared to its succeeding genre offshoots like Nioh and other games in the Dark Souls trilogy. I was literally thrown off at some point by how heavy the combat felt, and when I went back and played a session of Nioh, which revolves around fast-paced combat, I couldn't play the same fast-paced combat again. But this does not detract from the godly first experience that you will have in this game. The feeling of exploring some area where you feel that you can't escape and then finally finding a shortcut or a bonfire is exhilarating and fun. The environment will kill you most of the time, and that's fine with me because it adds to the experience [spoiler](except for Anor Londo Archers and Sen's Funhouse; those two will always be a nightmare for the first playthrough)[/spoiler].

This game encompasses all of my favorite things about video games. Good combat, an amazing story, the feel of discovery in an open world (technically, it is a semi-linear open world), and finally, an experience to remember. Overall, I really can't recommend this game enough; it is worth its full price, and you can get an even better deal if you buy it whenever it is on sale.",1695919855,1695919855,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The interconnected world is genuinely amazing, and the fact that you can't warp to bonfires from the very beginning of the game like in Dark Souls III is very fun to me as the exploration aspect is awesome. Obviously there were some things I didn't like in the slightest (like Bed of Chaos but that's a given), however the majority of the game was really fun to go through. Especially the DLC's, since Artorias and Manus are great bosses. Overall I really recommend this game, it's pretty good.",1695897202,1695897202,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Dark Souls is the best RPG I have ever played. Spent thousands of hours on PS3 and other platforms, making me a forever FROMSOFTWARE fan. Everything about the game is borderline perfect besides the dreaded ''walk of shame'' with certain bonfires. Some areas like Tomb of the Giants and Anor Londo for example, will have you restart the entire area and fight or run past hard hitting enemies if you die to the boss. Either wasting precious healing items or possibly dying and losing your blood stain in the boss arena. Making some areas incredibly frustrating and tedious. Besides that, this game is just amazing and I'll be playing it along with the other Souls-born games for years to come.

""DARK SOULS‚Ñ¢: REMASTERED"" by FromSoftware, Inc. is a masterpiece that needs no introduction for fans of the souls-like genre. As a seasoned undead adventurer, I've delved into the abyss of Lordran once again, and this remastered edition is a testament to the timeless brilliance of the original game.

Graphically, ""DARK SOULS‚Ñ¢: REMASTERED"" breathes new life into the dark and atmospheric world of Lordran. While it doesn't overhaul the visuals entirely, the improvements are significant. The enhanced lighting and textures make every corner of this grim, interconnected world more captivating than ever before. The character models and environments are more detailed, creating a more immersive experience while still preserving the iconic aesthetics that define the series.

Gameplay-wise, ""DARK SOULS‚Ñ¢: REMASTERED"" remains the benchmark for challenging and rewarding gameplay. The combat mechanics are as tight and precise as ever, demanding mastery of weapon types, timing, and strategy. The sense of accomplishment when conquering formidable foes or navigating treacherous terrain is unmatched. The game's notorious difficulty is not arbitrary; it's a beautifully crafted challenge that forces you to learn and adapt, making each victory all the more satisfying.

The level design is, once again, a standout feature. Lordran is a sprawling, interconnected world filled with secrets, shortcuts, and hidden lore. The non-linear progression allows for diverse playstyles and encourages exploration, making it impossible to resist the urge to revisit areas and uncover every hidden gem. The world feels alive, brimming with mysteries waiting to be uncovered.

The online multiplayer aspect remains a unique and integral part of the experience. Jolly cooperation, tense invasions, and cryptic messages from other players continue to add an extra layer of depth and unpredictability to the game world. Whether you're seeking aid or plotting the downfall of other adventurers, the multiplayer interactions are a testament to the game's enduring appeal.

""DARK SOULS‚Ñ¢: REMASTERED"" is more than just a nostalgia trip; it's an essential upgrade for both newcomers and veterans alike. The technical enhancements, while not groundbreaking, improve the overall experience without compromising the game's original vision.

The gameplay is what keeps me coming back. That is an amazing feeling about using the rings to get amazingly overpowered. It is also my comfort game if ever I feel like I just have an extra hour in evening I will just beat up this game and completed again. It is kind of second nature through me now. So it's just relaxing and beautiful I enjoyed so much.

This is still my favorite Dark Souls game even if it is the most Yankee of them, but maybe that is why I love it so much. It has that feeling of being an adventure and all the times you almost fall to your deaths. It's amazing and it has some really good secret boss fights that makes it feels like the game is not all what you see.

The DLC is my favorite part of the game it all just comes together with four amazing boss fights that keeps me on the edge of my seat.

Did you ever played the original Silent Hill 2 for the PS2 and then years later bought the HD Collection and were like: ""Wow!, this looks worse"" well, I've got bad news for you, this ""Remaster"" makes SH2:HD look decent.

The special effects are better overall and the game runs at 60 fps so, there was a try, BUT, it feels like they improved that and at the middle of the way said: ""that's it, we're done, the Remaster is complete"". They implemented a new and better lighting system to the game so, the game must look better, right? Well, it  kills the original atmosphere in a lot of areas and also it makes almost everything look worse. For whatever reason a lot of armor sets and armor that the enemies are wearing look worse as if they directly tried to downgrade them. Some NPC's faces look better and less polygonal but most of them look worse. Then we've got the textures of the environment, a lot of them got improved but others look as if they tried to make them worse.

Only about 20% of the new stuff looks better than the original and for that I don't recommend it. If you have the original version just mod it so it runs at those magnificent 60 fps; if you don't, well, time for some heavy modding so this doesn't look like the downgraded version of the original.

Gwynevere.
It's Dark Souls.
Musics are aight.
No performance issues.
Pretty good for the first game in the series
Open levels design which lead to surprise shortcuts.
Graphic is alright for a remaster of a really old game.
Really hard, probably the hardest one in the series, but* -> Cons.

[h1]Cons:[/h1]
Inventory management is a nightmare, the UI is cursed, could have got a rework to be more like DS3.
No fast travel until half of the game, even then you can't fast travel to all bonfire, collecting items and running to vendors are very tedious.
Some of the worst boss designs in the entire series, some of them aren't even worth being called a boss.
Dated, slow combat, you can only dodge one time, chaining dodges isn't possible, you have to take a break after every dodge.
*Quite boring, bosses have like 5 attacks at best, combat play out like a turn-based game, boss attack -> you dodged -> you attack, rinse & repeat.
Your experiences may vary depends on which area you choose to go first, pick the wrong area and you'll want to uninstall the game, playing this game blind is the worst thing you could do which is the opposite of other games in the series and Elden Ring.

To sum up, it's a souls game with minimal enjoyment, much more boring and annoying to play unlike other games in the series but it's not a bad game that deserve a negative review, give us a Neutral option STEAM.

Gameplay ages like fine wine, and while the graphics aren't obviously cutting edge now, the art direction carries it and still manages to be beautiful.

But it is an inconsistent experience with a couple of questionable gameplay elements that is more inconvenient than challenging. If Dark Souls 3 is everything FromSoftware had learned fit into one condensed finely tuned package, then Dark Souls is the raw experience that crawled to let Dark Souls 3 run.

So, let's start with the bad stuff:

[list]
   [*] Controls are clanky at times. I know the game is supposed to be slow and thoughtful while also reactive, but sometimes it just feels weird.

   [*] Bonfires. They're awesome in general, but 2 things I hate about them: 1. They're never (except one single time) right in front of a boss. Every god damn time, you after you die to a boss, which will happen, before fighting him again, you need to walk for 5 minutes. The way isn't a challenge anymore after you've done it 3 times. 2. Their warping ability. It's a great mechanic and I like that you get midgame and not from the beginning. But god damn you can only warp to a couple of them, so more walking... 

   [*] Stamina Bar. It's always annoying. Sure it is intended to make you think etc and be careful with your resources but there are better ways to solve this.

   [*] The skill system. Overall it's okay, but some details about it are strange. Resistance for example seems completely useless. Also, the higher your numbers get, the less they will increase. I already started NG+ and I had to do a lot of farming to actually feel a difference in my damage numbers. You also can't upgrade weapons further in NG+, so I guess you just have to hit more.

   [*] After a certain point, the game becomes less enjoyable IMO. To be precise: [spoiler] The new areas after you get the Lordvessel are not as exciting as the game is up to that point, Especially Lost Izalith/Demon Ruins and the Duke's Archive [/spoiler]

   [*] It is quite a task to compare items/equipment, expecially when you don't know what some of the stats are actually meaning. I mean these unusual stats are very nice and should be added to more RPGs, but overall it's not too easy to decide what to use or to even realize what's your best option. And not even to start with how you want to upgrade your stuff, especially weapons.
[/list]

But, that aside, there's also a lot of good stuff that kept me going:

[list]
   [*] Obviously the difficulty. It teaches you to be considerable about your actions. Not only in battle but also with the quests the game offers. It makes you learn what your enemies are doing so you can react accordingly. Every hit you take or deliver can be crucial.

   [*] Combat, even besides the difficulty, is awesome. You have a lot more weapon types than in typical RPGs, you can chose between wielding all of them one or two handed. You can choose to block, parry or dodge attacks. Although bows aren't really meant as a main weapon you can still use them occasionally. Magic is also a little weird, as your spells have limited uses and you don't have something like Mana. If you're out of spells, you have to have an alternative.

   [*] The world is great. You can visit basically like 90% of what you're seeing (except very far background), it's interconnected, not repetitive, atmospheric and interesting. I would like to see some more NPCs just to fill some places, but it's fine as it is. But the NPCs that are there already are very nice already.

   [*] Basically right from the beginning, you get awesome looking gear. At least for some classes/build, most weapons and armor look fantastic! You can actually start the game with fully fleshed out knight armor.

   [*] And one of the aspects which FromSoftware is know for: Bosses. They are incredible. Menacing, awesome looking and with great variety!

Why?

Elden Ring (ER), that's why.

Granted, I believe they made Elden Ring more of my style because this s**t was hard.  Not that ER was easy, but I did not have to run down a chasm to repeat a boss fight in Elden Ring.  I'm happily satisfied that the devs made that change for ER, but DS is the OG so... yes you have to run down a chasm, hoping not to take too many hits, to repeat a boss fight.  

Anyways, I hold the record for most refunds for Dark Souls Remastered.  TBH, it's going to take 10-20 hours to really feel the ""feels"" if you know what i'm saying. . . And once you do, you'll agree that Dark Souls is easily one of the best games ever. 

Trust the guy who has refunded this like, 17 times.  I also killed all the NPCs in the starting shrine out of frustration which I would NOT recommend doing because, come to find out, they sell you useful items later in the game (Doh!) and you can't respec. . . So, me losing my 49,000 souls (repeatedly) from non-boss fights, sent me into a black-out rage.  Once I came to, they were gone; do not do what I did.

Don't roll knight, roll pyro.

If i want to keep it brief, I would just say The Dark souls Remastered is a masterpieces, thru and thru. From the beginning on the undead asylum to end of the kiln of the first flame, this game was captivating and mesmerising. I could only wonder how much a vast and detailed world of Lordran was created for us, the chosen undead, to be a part of; to be the one saving or dooming it as we see fit. The game, the lore, the combat, the equipment and stat system, the inter-connectivity of different areas was really a joy to explore and experience. 
Its evident why this was amongst the titles that gave birth to the sub-genre called 'souls-like'.

I don't know why i have not played the dark souls trilogy before, but now when i am, i just couldn't get enough of it. Playing and finishing this game made me realise why these series by Fromsoftwares are so popular and I myself am in love with it.

-Terrible claustrophobic and narrow areas where the developers find it necessary to have either a hard as hell enemy waiting, or hordes of easier enemies who spam all at once, getting multiple hits in on you. This doesn't help when you are halfway through an attack animation but is canceled if they hit you (they will hit you).

-Random trap floors that can screw you over and cause you to lose souls and humanity, landing you in the nest of enemies but not only that, but for some reason you get fall damage for falling through these unsuspecting collapsing floors. One example is when returning to Undead Asylum and you fall through the floor to fight a boss, but the game unfairly causes you to lose health upon hitting the floor, leaving you vulnerable to be hit a single time from the boss that will send you back to the bonfire.

-Backstabbing (by far the most broken mechanic) is complete sh**, so many occasions where a random will invade and somehow get back-stab after back-stab. This wouldn't be as much of a problem if it was fair, but I encountered countless enemies and invaders who somehow managed to activate these back-stabs even when looking directly at me or when I have rolled out of the way of their attack but the game registers it as a back-stab.

This game has its moments where I find enjoyment from playing and exploring, but this is heavily watered down by the ridiculous design choices and bugs that commonly occur throughout your playthrough. This being said, it is not the worse game but also not the best of the series, it has spirit and love put into it, and I do recommend others to try it and judge it for themselves, this is only my opinion based on my experience with the product

I've enjoyed Elden Ring, Sekiro and Nioh massively but never played the DS series, so had high hopes for the widely acclaimed first game. Have to say it is a huge disappointment.

- I was prepared for clunky controls, but not something *this clunky*. Walking/running around is annoying slow. Input lags are even more severe than in Elden Ring. Rolling with the lightest armor felt like fat roll in ER. The combat was mediocre to start with and the controls just made it straight up painful.

- The game difficulty feels way too artificial and ultimately unfair. Git gud is only fun when you feel like you're moving toward achieving something. When you need to git gud just to avoid Crepe Demon's jump attack first thing you enter the door, you're just dealing with the game dev's malice and decide it's not worth it.

- Exploring the map was probably the only fun part but it is undermined by the lack of fast travel/means to avoid combat when moving between bonfires. I was trapped in the bonfire in upper blighttown for hours which basically ruined any excitement I had when I lit that bonfire. (ER/Sekiro have fast travel, for good reasons.

Simply put, this game is incredibly frustrating. You have to walk around vast areas without any saving spots just to be one-hit killed by some random low level enemy and walk all that way again.. Its just such a huge waste of your time, it's ridiculous. Not to mention boss fights, they're just boring.
Yes, it's supposed to be difficult and extremely challenging, and it delivers in that regard.
That being said, it's not what I personally consider a pleasurable gaming experience.

If Elden Ring was a recommendation with an asterisk, then this has to be a recommendation with three asterisks at least. Really, it barely eeks out a positive review on the strength of its level design (the structures are a joy to explore in principle) and the fun I had performing the rather consistent parries.

Apart from that, I finally get that age-old ""artificial difficulty"" argument. Of course, that's always going to be an extremely silly term to call it and thus easy to dismiss, but it does address a mixture of jank and tedium which frequently mars enjoyment of Dark Souls. A lot of the bosses aren't hard per se - being slow, predictable and having a limited moveset, though the DLC is much better in that regard - but they do often take a stupid amount of hits, all the while you have to ensure you don't perish to jank: Questionable hit boxes on certain attacks, stage hazards, getting stuck on random bits on the ground, the camera...

Combine that with boss runs (again, never hard, just tedious) and you're looking at a lot of wasted time, plain and simple. It doesn't help that you're controlling a character that moves like a wet sponge and seems incapable of scaling anything higher than a stair. Your character arguably performs better when keeping what you might foolishly assume are the key tools of locking on (the one useful thing about the O&S fight is that it teaches you to stop doing that) and rolling (since you take additional damage during it) to a minimum. Hence why I say that exploring is fun [i]in principle[/i]. Which is stupid, because you have to, since you're also dealing with general FromSoft obscurity. The bottom line is that Dark Souls isn't hard because it's such a challenging test of skill, it's hard because it's a psychological test of how much repeated BS you're willing to tolerate.

So, feel free to make ample use of guides, because this is a very cool game to experience in many instances. Not that I think you have to experience it yourself; I'd say it's perfectly fine to just watch someone else play it and spare yourself the firsthand frustration. I think between the parries, some fun fights in non-boss sections, most bosses thankfully being easy enough to only take a few tries and the fantastic level structure, I had barely enough fun to make this thumb point upwards, but a glowing recommendation this is not.",1694968871,1694968871,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

They have been hyped up quite a lot, so I decided to delve into the worlds created by Miyazaki. Many have named the first game of the series as a masterpiece, and one of the greatest games ever made. Personally, I do not think that it actually is. But, it is a great game nonetheless, that reminded me of my early gaming days in the 90s.
The atmosphere is amazing, and the bleakness of the dying world slowly seeps into your soul. It is a difficult game but fair, despite some clunkiness. The majority of times that I died was either due to poor reaction times, or getting to greedy with my attacks and mismanaging my stamina. The only exception would be the Anor Londo Archers (yes, they deserve the capital letters). Lost almost 93000 souls to them and 12 humanity. 
Overall, I did not have much difficulty with the bosses. I beat Quelaag, Nito, Sif on my first try. Artorias, Manus, Kalameet and Ornstein and Smough on my third. And then we have the Capra Demon for 8 and the Bed of Chaos for 11... These two were a case of poor design. Especially in the case of the latter. In general, that part of the game seemed unfinished and it was a real slog. 
I certainly liked the challenge that the game presented me with. It was a long time since I had palpitations during a boss battle, and the exhilaration after I triumphed. This is the essence of Dark Souls. You get good. As simple as that. However, the quality of the game fluctuates especially in the second half. But, I would highly recommend this game simply because the feeling of overcoming the challenges it throws at you is simply the best.

I feel that, despite this game's good qualities, it still has a bunch of indisputably bad design decisions that I never hear anybody talk about, so I want to complain about them here.

I wrote an even longer review than this, but it ended up being too long for Steam. So instead of my usual list of pros and cons, I'll just list the bad design decisions that I feel people tend to overlook when extolling this game.

--- Bad design decisions featured in this game:

- As someone who mostly plays single-player games, this first point is one I am emphatically passionate about: if a game is presented as single-player, it should be playable without needing help or advice from other players (specifically, without needing to refer to a wiki). If the game doesn't give me the necessary tools to figure out everything for myself, if I need to read a wiki or find hints left by other players to learn basic information about a game, then that game is badly designed. Arbitrarily hiding information from players isn't making a game ""full of secrets"" or ""mysterious"", it's just making it obtuse and inaccessible. Without checking the wiki, there is no way for you to know:
        - How many souls a soul in your inventory is worth before using it (or until Frampt is available). This is especially true for boss souls (since the amount Frampt gives is not always the same as how much it's actually worth).
        - Which upgrade path for a weapon is best (you can only see how the weapon's stats change when upgrading to the next level, not the maximum number of levels nor the stats for each level). Additionally, once a weapon is upgraded, it's impossible to know whether a newly acquired weapon can be upgraded higher than the already-upgraded one or not. There is NO REASON this information couldn't have been made available in the game, and the game is not better or more fun for having this information withheld.
        - The necessary ingredients for boss weapons. The game won't even show which boss weapons can be crafted if you don't have the correct kinds of ingredient weapons in your inventory.
        - That equipment load affects run speed and roll speed. Also, there is no in-game way to know equipment load levels, which determine whether you do a fast/medium/slow roll. Considering how central combat and rolling are to this game, this is a major, inexcusable oversight.
        - What staggering is, and when/why some enemies stagger.
        - What being ""hollowed"" is, why this is relevant to the story, why the player character being hollowed is different from enemies being hollowed, or why enemies only attack you but not each other.
        - That being un-hollowed allows summoning help in boss fights. There is no other benefit to being un-hollowed (as it allows invasions), so it's easy to go through the entire game without realizing this.
        - That there are illusory walls (if you haven't discovered any by accident).
        - What invasions are, or when they are NPCs (which can be reasonably defeated by a sufficiently skilled player) or other human players (who have no visual indication of power level and may easily one-shot an unprepared player out of nowhere).
        - Which items are dropped by which enemies and how often. This is particularly important if certain weapon upgrades require rare materials, but there are not enough of them in chests around the world to fully upgrade a weapon (without going through the hassle of new game plus), so you need to grind certain enemies to get enough of them. There's no reason the game couldn't have had a codex that gets filled out with enemy information as you defeat them.
	
Besides hiding useful information from players for no reason, this game has plenty of other bad, stupid, and unjustifiable design choices:

- The game's entire move set is dumped on you in the very first level. If you don't master jumping and parrying, you may never be able to get back to this area to see the instructions.

- This game has no story, just unrelated events that happen in sequence. The ""story"" - if it can be called that - merely consists of the player character traveling to a series of different regions and killing boss monsters, usually without any information on who these monsters are, why they were important, nor whether the player character has any idea why they're doing this in the first place (aside from, ""Well, I'm playing a video game and I guess this is the way forward.""). This is where defenders of the game will give the weak counterargument that the story is in the flavor text of in-game items. To this I reply: reading item descriptions is a mediocre excuse for storytelling. Compare this to the storytelling in Subnautica or Skyrim: all information necessary to those stories is presented through dialogue and cut scenes, and most text is just for additional flavor and worldbuilding. And - most crucially - this information is presented in places where you'd actually think to look, like in-world books or highlighted entries in a codex, not fricken' item descriptions which are so often unhelpful, boring, or obtuse that you just learn to ignore them. Integrating storytelling with gameplay is the superior approach, and if Dark Souls had been well-made enough to do things this way, its fans wouldn't need to defend it. Extra points are deducted for weapons that have special effects which are only documented in flavor text.

- The fantasy elements in this game don't feel like they're from the same world. Sure, each different monster looks unique, but the bosses in particular feel like a grab-bag of fantasy elements, not parts of a consistent style or system.

- The world doesn't feel alive. All characters and enemies are just standing in place waiting for the player to come along and interact with them. Compare this to Skyrim, where NPCs have set routes and will walk from their house to work and back, or will even join you on quests to other locations. Additionally, the various towns you walk through in Dark Souls do not look like they were designed for actual people to live in (no beds, no bathrooms, no markets, unnatural layouts). This makes them feel very artificial and video-gamey.

- If you don't understand how ""builds"" work (that is, upgrading your stats to focus on damage vs. speed vs. magic), you can get yourself into a situation where you have to grind a lot to be reasonably leveled. Magic is particularly clunky to use in this game: you have to stand still in place for a second or two to cast any spell. Considering this leaves you wide open to backstabs and that enemy attacks can interrupt the spell, it doesn't seem balanced compared to combat. So in the early game if you spend several upgrade points on magic in the hopes it will get more powerful later, all that time and grinding will prove to be a waste, and will increase the cost of future upgrades for the stats that actually matter.

- There are places where you have to sit and wait for 30 seconds to be transported somewhere. In all other situations in this game, if something doesn't immediately happen when you take an action, this means you're missing a necessary item or have to complete some task elsewhere first. Having places in the game where you actually need to wait 30 boring seconds doing nothing is inconsistent and infuriating.

- The process for accessing the DLC (Oolacile and the Abyss) is unjustifiably obscure. It requires revisiting the least fun area in the whole game and killing a specific but otherwise nondescript enemy for no discernible reason. This isn't fun or challenging, it's just obtuse and inaccessible. (Plus, the process for downing Kalameet is similarly obscure and arbitrary.)",1694733884,1694734244,False,4,1,0.53167414665222168,0,True,False,False

I like the lore, even though is can be very vague and the universe itself is shrouded in mystery, decay and hopelessness, but in the same vain there is still ""hope"" in the kindling of the first flame, there is beauty in the broken landscapes and dilapidated structures, Anor Londo was a big focal point of the game, at least when establishing the ""ruling hand"" of Lordran. When understanding the dynamic between the ruling class, what happened during the ancient Dragon wars involving the everlasting Dragons and the 4 Lords, as well as Gwyn, it makes you really feel just how bad things had become when you come in.

Gameplay in my opinion is SLOW, compared to even Dark Souls II SoTFs, and a snails pace compared to the likes of DSIII and Elden Ring. I won't say it's a bad thing, as it was much more challenging than Elden ring, the 4 Lords were easy enough even without help. The bed of chaos was, something? I feel that could've been done better. Gravelord Nito was difficult at first, but slow, and like much of the rest of the bosses, once you learn his attacks, and when to dodge, he becomes trivial. The four kings were more difficult, as at the time I'd say I was under-prepared in terms of DMG output, and as you continue to fight them off more ""clones"" appear. This was annoying to say the least, but he went down after a couple attempts. Lastly, Seath the scaleless was an okay fight, the curse infliction was a difficult obstacle, but once again, a couple attempts and a few thousand souls to level, he too went down.

The only negative things I can say about the game, is the collision of weapons in small corridors, on posts, objects etc. This has killed me many a times, but it is avoidable with proper kiting. 
I've mentioned it before, in my previous review. Invasions suck. It wouldn't need to be that way, If the latency wasn't such an issue. This seems to be an issue in DS 1-3 and I can't really see it any other way. Getting struck through blocks, getting struck when obviously out of range of an attack, it's not fun. Thankfully, you don't NEED to be human for any apparent buffs or bonuses, unlike in later titles. 

I think if you enjoy the fantasy genre, and want to challenge yourself as a gamer, give Dark souls a try. If you get mad take a break and come back later, I can certainly see why this game is held with such high regard.",1682642135,1694651249,True,0,0,0.459520429372787476,2,True,False,False

> Level design is excellent many areas in the game are built like a maze - essentially... a single area, say, shrine for example can lead to a dozen different places all interconnected in their own intricate ways.
> Graphics and lighting are excellent for a seventh gen console title, and still looks great. thanks to the games moody and interesting art direction,
> There is a looot of content in this game to dabble into....
> Sound and music is great though not amazing, it works and compliments the world.
> It is a story light game, there is a ton of lore here for the curious ones...
> Bosses are the real highlight of this game
>There is a slight bit of jank to movement...it is certainly not a platformer, but you can get used to it as you play...

I do appreciate the consistency with which FromSoft tackles game mechanics and you clearly see the evolutionary path up to the point of Elden Ring.

That being said, a lot of the quality of life improvements are still missing here, which is a good thing. The world feels much more condensed, raw and deadly. The atmosphere is phenomenal and clearly sets this game apart from ER.

I got it on a deal for roughly 20 bucks, but if I wasn't on a tighter budget right now would have bought it at it's regular 40 bucks as well at some point.

I think there's no need to argue the quality of this game anymore. Graphically it works just fine setting a very distinctive tone. Sound design and music is top notch.

All in all I highly recommend Dark Souls to anyone seeking a good challenge and to players familiar with newer FromSoft titles who can live without some of the quality of life things like fast travel and an in-game map system.",1694395870,1694395870,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Another thing that fucks everyting up is introduction of the dogshit DS3 style matchmaking, which no longer allows you to invade infinitely up and also locks you in a specific weapon upgrade bracket, so the pool of available players to play with is by default much smaller than in the original no matter the online activity.

The PvE is pretty much the same, hitboxes of certain attacks from certain bosses are a little more forgiving (Smough's ass slam, Ceaseless Discharge tenticle slams and swipes, Stray Demon AOE blast, etc.) due to the game now running natively at 60fps, so that is nice. The lighting is worse than in the original, a lot of the metallic armors look like they're made out of plastic now.

I don't care what anyone says. This is not a good game.

After 35 hrs
A terrible game. Ugly graphics, clunky controls. But the worst thing about the game is it doesn't respect the player's time. 
Why is the distance between bonfire and the boss fight more than 1 full minute?
Why is there no fast travel between bonfires?
Why are there so few bonfires?
Why is there no guide or help of any kind?
Why should I go to youtube to find out whatever the hell is going on?

I like hard games, but this is f-ing ridiculous. It's all about wasting players time. If I was immortal and had all the time in the world, sure, I'd keep playing without complaining, but who has the f-ing time to go back and forth with no point.

I recommend the brilliantly implemented Remnant: From the Ashes to anyone instead of this garbage.

So far 50/100

After 79 hrs
I call it a day. I have this bad habit of playing even a bad game to its end, but I've just had it with this one.
The problem is not that it is hard or the boss fights. The problem is the time it takes to get to the f-cking boss. I spent nearly a 10th of the game going from bonfire to the boss fight location, and it frustrating as f-ck.
Why the f-uk should I play half the game to get the ability to jump between bonfires?
And then I had to go thru the sh-t maps like blighttown, lava town and crystal town, when I watched the walk through for the great hollow map, I said I am done. Enough is enough.

The gamers and critics who review should be more responsible. Instead of calling what it it - frustrating - they called it hard and it achieved a cult status, which is ridiculous.
It is impossible for me to recommend this to anyone. They will hate me for it...

In the end, I want to thank all the YouTube folks. You saved me at least 40 hours of my life

Elden Ring's my first Soulsborne game and  I am still really enjoying it. If you're looking for something easier than grab yourself a copy of Dark Souls Remastered. The combat is the same except bosses are much slower. Backstabs are relatively easy to do to enemies. There are some dungeons that can be found annoying and frustrating but there are always ways to come back to them later in the game. The game is not currently being updated so there are tons of cheese methods that aren't patched yet. [b] Dark Souls Remastered also comes with the DLC (Artorias of the Abyss) so there is no need worrying about buying DLCS for the game. [/b]

An iconic name, rhyming with difficulty and despair. 
It is true to an extent. 
I wanted to try it for myself, even if I'm not a hardcore gamer. And what a journey ! 

I finished it in Normal Game and in New Game +. 


The art is one of the points that surprised me the most. The remastered version is beautiful and smooth, the dark fantasy, bleak but nonetheless medieval fantastic atmosphere is something that I missed in games. Just look at landscapes from Sen's Fortress and Anor Londo, and you will feel a real medieval Lord of the Ring's Weathertop, Osgiliath and Minas Tirith or Berserk castles vibes. I also really loved the forest/ruins environment from Undead parish. 

The music is non existent while exploring, it gives a real feeling of vulnerability since you are startled by the smallest environmental noise. It is also epic and terrifying while fighting bosses. My favourites ones are those from Ornstein & Smough and Kalameet. 

The scenario and lore are quite difficult to find, you have to look up the item's descriptions to gather informations. Even if it is rewarding to understand the puzzle bit by bit, I was often lost with the lore and I don't think I could understand it without videos and wikis. Also the NPCs dying or going hollow if you didn't talked to them at a specific point or didn't do something to keep them alive (even if you didn't know) is a tad frustrating. 

As Sartre said ""Hell is other people"". Well, in Dark Souls you'll start to think it's true. Especially when you try to return to the bonfire with enough souls to level up and a bloke invade you while you have no more estus, let you get rammed by monsters and emote on your face after backstabbing you... Unforgettable experience.

The difficulty is one of the most iconic part. The fact that you can't choose the difficulty is THE BEST. It is something that you never experienced before. At first I took three weeks to reach O&S because I was scared to die. But after beating NG, I got like ""f*ck it we ball"" and played normally. Dark Souls is one of the best gaming experience I had with Nier: Automata. The feeling when you triumph from an area that gave you nightmares is unique (I'm looking at you Tomb of Giants, you were the first area to make me ragequit in 20 years of gaming). Or after beating monstrous boss (Ornstein and Smough of course, but also Artorias, Manus, or Four Kings in NG+... They nearly crushed my spirit). You'll have to keep your mental resilience in check and never yield. My advice is to take small breaks (5 minutes to a few hours) when you begin to get tilted, and come back with a renewed spirit. 
 

Dark Souls is an experience, a proof that you can do it.

The one thing id say is don't expect this to play like Elden Ring, the combat is slower and significantly clunky'er then what you might even expect. Attacks are way slower, and you have to commit to every attack you through out. The game really sensitizes on waiting for your turn to attack ( outside of the 4 kings, where you throw all that out the window and smash face ). However even though its slower, the fun of combat is far from boring. Instead spamming lions claw, and dodging Melania's waterfall dance youre pacing around the enemy trying to get that sweet backstab. Outside of combat i wont lie, i had my fair share of WTF moments. I thought walking into Blighttown was horrific, then i discovered Sen's Fortress, and the Tomb of the giants. Definitely felt like however designed the areas just wanted to make a area where we would just actually suffer true emotional damage. Overall though id say its a MUST if you're a fan of the genre.

Die Herausforderung: Dark Souls ist ber√ºchtigt f√ºr seine Schwierigkeit, und ja, es ist wirklich knallhart. Doch es ist keine frustrierende Schwierigkeit, sondern eine Herausforderung, die dich wachsen l√§sst. Du wirst sterben, oft und viel. Aber jeder Tod ist eine Lektion, die dich besser macht. Es gibt keinen Sieg ohne Kampf, und das ist es, was Dark Souls so befriedigend macht.

Die Welt: Lordran ist eine d√ºstere, faszinierende Welt voller Geheimnisse, Verbindungen und Geschichten, die darauf warten, entdeckt zu werden. Die Atmosph√§re ist einzigartig und unvergesslich, von den verfallenen Ruinen bis zu den majest√§tischen Bossk√§mpfen.

Das Gameplay: Die K√§mpfe sind pr√§zise, anspruchsvoll und unglaublich befriedigend. Jede Waffe und jeder Zauber hat ihren eigenen Charakter, und die M√∂glichkeiten f√ºr Charakterentwicklung sind endlos. Es gibt nichts Vergleichbares zu dem Gef√ºhl, wenn du einen scheinbar unbesiegbaren Boss besiegst.

Die Community: Die Dark Souls-Community ist eine der freundlichsten und hilfsbereitesten, die ich je erlebt habe. Ob du nach Tipps suchst, Hilfe f√ºr einen Bosskampf ben√∂tigst oder dich einfach √ºber die Lore unterhalten m√∂chtest, es gibt immer jemanden, der bereit ist, zu helfen.

Fazit: Dark Souls ist ein Meisterwerk, das nicht f√ºr jeden ist. Es ist anspruchsvoll, es ist d√ºster, es ist tiefgr√ºndig. Aber f√ºr diejenigen, die sich auf dieses Abenteuer einlassen, wird es zu einer unvergesslichen Reise. Es ist ein Spiel, das dich fordert, dich belohnt und dich ver√§ndert.

The changes made from ""Dark Souls:Prepare To Die Edition"" to this one (while well recieved) are way minor compared to the flaws it (still) has. After 7 years of the first Dark Souls launch, it's unacceptable that they can't fix their fucking game. If you already own DS:PTDE not worth at all to pay for this, even considering the 50% discount. From the beginning I knew the ""remaster"" was going to suck, but bought it anyway cause of the active pvp (for 1-2 months until everyone drops the game)... If you haven't played DS1, its better to buy it on console, at least those versions are worth your money since they decided to remove DS:PTDE from Steam.


2023 edit:
Looking back on this review clearly didn't age well and while I maintain some of my opinions from back then people might misunderstand it as pure hate for the game. Dark Souls Remastered is the best version of DS1 at least from a smooth gameplay and frame stability perspective. The few quality of life changes made from the original are very welcome (multiple item turn-ins with covenants, the new bonfire at the catacombs blacksmith, control/key bind config, etc). One of the most known issues with this remaster is the change on the lighting effects that completely change the atmosphere of the areas and as a result can take out of your immersion. It's still pretty annoying to this date that FromSoft removed both DS and DS:PTDE so you HAVE to buy this version and the 50% discount it had on release (which isn't available anymore unless there's a steam sale going or something).",1528006075,1693488521,True,0,0,0.505216419696807861,0,True,False,False

The only bad thing I can say about this game, is difficulty to understand what to do next or where to go (e.g., how to get to the Abyss), so you are basically forced to lookup a walkthrough or a guide.

I perfected (got all the achievements) the game in one sitting (New Game +++), as the game is just that good. You can do a no-hit kill of a difficult boss at ease, but then get killed by a single early stage enemy. That is the beauty of the combat, you always have to be on your toes.

Oh, sure, you can quibble about minor changes (the lighting is different!) and complain that nothing has changed since the [i]Prepare to Die Edition[/i], but at the end of the day this game makes the original obsolete in every way. Yes, I would‚Äôve loved to see [i]Dark Souls 2[/i]‚Äôs superior menus implemented and yes, I do think there are certain levels that seem downright lazy when compared to the stellar bulk of the game, but at the end of the day this is not a remake, and to change things drastically from the way they were when it came out would do a disservice to the game itself. Worse would be to arbitrarily shift characters and items around and fill the game with goons by the bucketload, as the already disappointing [i]Dark Souls 2[/i] was subject to with its 2015 ‚Äòremaster‚Äô [i]Scholar of the First Sin[/i]. [i]That[/i] was a bad remaster, because not only was the technical improvement negligible, but the actual design of the world and its lore was compromised by some fabricated need to change things around to make people purchase the same game twice.

This game, on the other hand, is the same game it was when it came out in 2011. There is a new bonfire in the Catacombs to make it easier to access an NPC in that area, but that‚Äôs it. As far as I can tell that is literally the only change to level design from beginning to end, and yet it is a vastly superior experience than [i]Prepare to Die[/i] because the multiplayer is alive and well. I‚Äôve played [i]Dark Souls[/i] a lot, but it wasn‚Äôt until the first time I played this edition that I encountered members of covenants outside of a handful of the most popular ones. In the very first area where multiplayer is possible I fought a Gravelord Servant, then an acolyte of the Path of the Dragon, all within ten minutes. I got my shit ruined because I was wielding a weapon I barely had the stats to even [i]hold[/i], but it was a [i]fantastic[/i] experience regardless because I felt like I was experiencing the game for the first time in the way it was intended - as a fusion of single- and multiplayer experiences into one.

It‚Äôs awesome, is what I‚Äôm getting at. If you have money that you are going to spend on a computer game I literally do not think there is a better way to spend it than on a copy of [i]Dark Souls Remastered[/i]. It‚Äôs the best game I‚Äôve ever played, and failing a return from the heavens by Jesus Christ himself and the subsequent release of a game he‚Äôs been developing for the last two millennia, I don‚Äôt see how that will change. I really do think everybody owes it to themselves to give this game a try, and I think that this version is the best way to do it.

Dark Souls is the first souls-like game I've got around to play, finally in 2023. :D Though there's many similarities in the gameplay to Witcher 2/3, Prince of Persia and some other action/RPG games I'm familiar with.

[b]Gameplay:[/b]
After everything that I've been hearing about Dark Souls for over a decade, it truly did deliver on the promised experience! The start was quite harsh, and it took a while to adjust to the combat mechanics and learn all the finesses. I didn't entirely like the fact that the controls were made for controllers and were sometimes VERY unintuitive ‚Äì I even had look up an external resource to learn how to jump, because it was explained so poorly in-game! I took me around 60 hours before I realized you can kick, do jump attacks and whatnot. 

After getting hang of the mechanics the experience became much more fun. One of the big (positive) surprises for me was just how much RPG elements there were, as I had thought of Dark Souls as more of a hack'n'slash type of game. As I often tend to be somewhat of a completionist, the game was at times surprisingly grindy as well, since some items have really low drop-rates and later on leveling takes a lot of souls (the main currency of the game) ‚Äì although to be fair, you don't [i]have[/i] to grind if you're not so inclined. The gameplay and combat was overall very satisfactory and I enjoyed it a lot. The difficulty was very steep at the start, but towards the end it became sometimes even too easy, with all the fully upgraded gear and higher level. One of my only gripes is with all the invisible walls and not being able to walk over a 5 centimeters high branch, which had me feeling like I was playing the first Witcher game all over again.

[b]Story/Lore/Environment:[/b]
I really loved the aesthetics of the world and the environment. All of the areas were ingeniously connected to each other and made exploring fun. There were also a HUGE amount of secrets to be found ‚Äì even some entire large areas! There was a fair amount of detective work to even get access to the DLC area!

To be completely honest, I often have a hard time understanding how Japanese games can be so bizarre, but maybe that's just a Western perspective. xD The world and the story is kept a bit of a secret from start to finish, and you're only fed tidbits of lore as you go through it. The state of the world is also not really put into perspective and you don't really understand what humanity, undeath, hollows, gods etc etc REALLY are, and how they relate to each other.

The weirdness and quirkiness is especially accentuated by all the characters you meet throughout your adventuring. It feels like more than half of them speak in Shakespearean monologues and have a weird laugh they do every time you talk with them. Also, after a lengthy monologue that's going all over the place, you're only answer is either 'Yes' or 'No' ‚Äì the answer sometimes completely defining in unexpected ways the future of your well-being, their life (or death) and whether you'll ever get access to their goods/services. Next time you'll also have to find them in some remote area of the world that you (maybe) got a hint about. You do also always get the option of just stabbing them in the face whenever you feel like it, which I guess is some nice freedom of choice.

[b]But wait ‚Äì there's more![/b]
In addition to the grinding, the Co-op and PvP features made Dark Souls feel surprisingly much like an MMORPG. The online features and the New Game+ feature really give the game a lot of replayability. There's also a huge amount of weapons and combat styles that you're not going to experience in a single playthrough. Anyway, now I'm going back to my next one-and-a-half playthroughs to get the final five missing achievements! :P

2. DS2 took a bit of an odd turn (new mechanics, new lands), but it's still near and dear to my heart. Not a must play, but a nice addition to the main course.
3. DS3 got the series back on track, perfecting the original formula in almost every way and wrapping up the story cycle beautifully in the Ringed City DLC. A must play.

Dark Souls I is a breathtakingly beautiful game for
its time where each area in the game feels alive. Dark Souls I takes the blueprints that Demon Souls left and builds upon it greatly. Dark Souls I is a perfectly merged dark fantasy game known to build an entire genre of games, souls like, 
with the games sheer difficulty and fear factor. Dark Souls I in 2018 would get a remaster with a fresh coat of paint, bringing the game closer to life with a great graphics overhaul making the game even prettier. Dark Souls I is well known
among hard core gamers due to the games incredible difficulty compared to anything on the market at the time. The game always for you to choose how to play it and this is one of the great strong points of the soul-borne franchise. If you
choose one route and struggle, for example you choose a dex weapon and can't seem to overcome a boss, the game will throw optional bosses at you for a chance to level up and come back when you are stronger or with the games great
build variety you can swap how you fight the enemy you have discovered in a new way for a chance at success. This is the main and real driving point of the Dark Souls games, the reward curiosity and exploration and give you a real sense
of completion and worth when you finally manage to overcome a challenge, these games are all about overcoming a challenge. I first played Dark Souls III and then returned to Dark souls I once I had gathered all the achievements for Dark Souls III.
This made my journey with Dark Souls I much easier than the average player as I came to get the game with previous experience with the souls way of doing things. However, this does not mean my journey was without rocky roads or challenges as
Dark Souls I is a very different game from Dark Souls III with unique boss fights and a less fluid movement system, learning to play with these was a challenge in itself that I would have to overcome. Once I did I fell in love with Dark Souls I. It is
unapologetic and fierce, the game will kick you down and keep you there if you let it. Many of the boss fights within Dark Souls I are some of the greatest and most enjoyable boss fights I have ever experienced with a video game. For example, the legendary
duo fight with Oystein and Smough, I can safely say this up there for one of the scariest, mightiest and and most breath taking boss fights I have ever fought. However, this is the peak of Dark Souls I, as much as I love many of the boss fights in this game, 
the games second half (any point after this fight) is where the game has a serious dip in quality. This part of the game is not bad in any way it just lacks in comparison to how great the start and middle of the game is. As areas such as tomb of giants or the catacombs
are very difficult but not in the usual sense, the are challenging not to teach the player but almost seem to be a pain on purpose. The bosses of these areas are also fairly tame in comparison feeling as if they didn't get the same love or care that other bosses did. However,
this doesn't mean every boss in this half is bad as the four kings is one of my favourite fights in the game. Although, fights like nino or pinwheel are very underwhelming and often a pain to get to and fight. Overall, with a few bugs and fairly tedious areas such as the tomb
of giants, Dark Souls I is still an absolutely legendary game and possibly one of my favourite games of all time, it is a must play. Dark Souls I set out the foundation that so many games attempt to be. Imitated yet never duplicated.

I loved and cherished this game so much after beating it the first time round I dedicated hours of my time to achieve 100% completion of the game as an excuse to replay it a few more times and show off my love for the game and the series.",1693061055,1693078935,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

FromSoftware's masterpiece has given birth to a genre of its own, shaping the very landscape of gaming with its unique blend of difficulty, atmosphere, and profound storytelling. Dark Souls isn't just a game you play; it's an epic journey you live.

The world of Dark Souls is a dark and mysterious tapestry, woven with layers of interconnected areas that invite exploration and discovery. Each location exudes a unique ambiance, from the eerie grandeur of Anor Londo to the gloomy catacombs and beyond. The sense of place and atmosphere is palpable, making each corner of the world feel like a living, breathing entity.

Combat in Dark Souls is a symphony of strategy and precision. Every swing of your weapon, every dodge, every parry is a calculated move that demands the utmost attention. The deliberate pacing of battles forces players to learn, adapt, and truly understand their foes. The feeling of triumph that accompanies overcoming a seemingly insurmountable enemy is unlike anything else in gaming, a testament to the game's unforgiving yet fair design.

Where Dark Souls truly shines is its masterful storytelling. The lore is enigmatic, delivered in fragments through item descriptions, cryptic dialogue, and the intricate design of the world itself. Unraveling the mysteries and piecing together the history of Lordran is an intellectual pursuit that rewards those who seek understanding. It's a testament to the game's respect for its players, treating them as intelligent participants in a living narrative.

The difficulty of Dark Souls is legendary, and rightfully so. Yet, it's not just about being hard for the sake of it; every challenge is a lesson, an opportunity to hone your skills and refine your approach. The game teaches patience, observation, and critical thinking, attributes that extend beyond gaming and into the real world. The feeling of accomplishment that accompanies overcoming seemingly insurmountable odds is a high that lingers long after the final boss falls.

Visually, Dark Souls is a masterpiece of gloomy beauty. The art design, combined with the intricately crafted environments, creates a world that feels both grim and captivating. The interplay of light and shadow, the intricate details of armor and architecture, all contribute to an experience that is visually mesmerizing.

In conclusion, Dark Souls is a triumph that has forever changed the landscape of gaming. It's a journey that tests your limits and rewards your determination. FromSoftware's opus is an artistic endeavor that melds storytelling, challenge, and atmosphere into a gaming experience that transcends the screen. If you're seeking an adventure that will reshape your perception of games, Dark Souls is an essential pilgrimage that will leave an indelible mark on your gaming soul.",1692996334,1692996334,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I [b]LOVE[/b] Dark Souls! I [b]ADORE[/b] it!
It's so much fun reading about this game's lore, enjoying its soundtrack, and simply experiencing this game's absolutely gorgeous art-style & world...
...yet I [i]hate[/i] actually playing it.



[h1] Sack of Gore [/h1]

I heftily dislike how this game controls.
Controls are both stiff & slippery. It feels like everything you do has a second-long delay or something, and yet you also just fly all-over the place.
[b]JUST SWING YOUR DAMN SWORD![/b]
It feels like it wants to ground itself in clunky realism by giving weight to everything due to your armory, and yet your character just flies everywhere like you're skating on butter.
It's partially due to this inconsistent flow of movement that really gives me this ""[i]yucky[/i]"" feeling while playing.
Half of the time my character never does what I want them to. I try to do something as simple as climb a latter or swing my sword, but instead they just wobble around.

Also, no matter your loadout, even if you remove everything & look like Mary's Mother, you're still so slow in so many aspects!
Many action takes like a whole seconds to perform. But when it's set in action it cannot be stopped.
I'm simply not a fan of that. I want to be able to cancel my attacks by switching weapons or blocking. That's how I enjoy my games, not by punishing me with enemies that attack faster than I do -- thus already having hit me after I swung my sword before them, giving me no opportunity to react, leaving me in this dishonest state of unfairness.
No joke, this game gives my controller bite-marks.

The controls are honestly so awkward & stiff & slippery that I thought my controller was broken! (It's not)
It is totally inexcusable to make a game wherein the challenge isn't the difficulty of the game itself, but from handicapping the player in the most bullshit ways possible. Where doing anything will have you stand on your toes in anticipation to see what any of your slightest movements will end up doing.

And dying to a boss & having to run through like 17 rooms of enemies to get back where you were, now at half the health since you had to run through like 80 enemies; just ain't fun.
Luckily, this is something Elden Ring would [i]finally[/i] fix by having bonfires near the bosses, and not on the opposite of the whole area. i.e. like a 7 minute run to the boss-fight again.



[h1] UI/UX [/h1]

Navigating these menus are harder than the actual game itself.
The thing about bad UIs are that they're near-impossible to describe.
But trying to navigate these menus. I just can't. It's impossible. You think it'd be simple? But [i]nooo![/i]
And when you open up your menu, the game is still running! So you can still get attacked while switching gear.

And pausing this game at all is an ass! Oh wait- you can't pause it... [b]AT ALL![/b]
I mean, if you gotta go answer the phone or take a shit... it's like tough shit if you gotta take a shit !!!
You gotta take a quick shit; you gotta turbo turds!
I'm trying to play the game! I got shit-stains in my pants & an answering message on my phone that says ""Sorry! I'm playing DARK SOULS‚Ñ¢: REMASTERED!""
[I]What a selfish game.[/I]
[b]BOTTOM LINE: HAVE A FUCKING PAUSE BUTTON![/b]



[h1] Non-gameplay [/h1]

Everything that isn't connected to the gameplay I like.
I like the lore, I like the story, I like the music, I like the visuals, I like the sound-effects. I like practically anything not related to the gameplay itself... so what good is that when I don't already enjoy the game?



[h1] Conclusion [/h1]

I kinda hate this game.
Which is really sad. As I [b]LOVE[/b] everything about this game, except the game itself.
I listen to the soundtrack constantly, I follow many Dark Souls fan-artists & content creators online, I've bought merch, I watch people play it on YouTube, I have a screenshot of this game as my Windows background even...
The game is [u]fantastic[/u] in those regards.

My advice is look up Wiki things VERY frequently so you dont make an irreversible mistake (Like on my first play through, where I had to start over on a new save). Strength builds are incredibly viable in this game, and is the only Souls game that I use strength builds religiously for, where I use Dex builds in all other games (Zweihander and Greatsword FTW). Also, I highly recommend beating every boss in your play through. You get 100% of the experience and the souls you get rewarded with will make you big and strong to beat the game harder.

When i was younger when i thought of really difficult games i thought of games just set on the highest possible difficulty and i wondered why anyone would play those games like that because it wasn't even challenging most of the time it was just blatantly unfair. Then i heard of the ""Souls like games"" it was in 2018 and i decided to give Dark Souls 3 a try for the very first time, it was my first souls game and to be honest i just didn't understand why people actually enjoyed playing these games. You have no map, no quest marker and there was practically no safe area. I was fairly early into the game so i understandably didn't like it, but i continued on a little bit further until i encountered the Abyss Watchers. It was so difficult to me that i took a months break before playing again, but when i finally returned i managed to defeat them and my lord. The amount of hype i had and excitement i had gained after defeating this boss made me finally realize why people enjoy these games, to overcome the challenge and the reward of doing so makes it all the more sweeter when you spend time and effort into learning a bosses move set and prevailing. That was on Xbox One, When i first decided to get a PC i made sure to pick up Dark Souls Remastered so i could experience every souls game and i have come to the conclusion that the money this game cost is well worth the price. From the beautiful areas that have been carefully woven and crafted to connect to each one another around the map to the amazing boss designs and music, this game has grown to be one of my favorite games in recent years. Again i just want to talk about the map design and how everything connects together and i just absolutely love what they did with this game when it comes to level design, it is by far my favorite part of this game. Another extremely strong point in this game is the bosses, an example of an amazing boss fight in this game HAS to be the final boss Gwyn. As your walking into his domain after offering all the other boss souls to that alter thingy you get yourself prepared for an amazing boss fight that is super intense and at the same time extremely challenging, Is what i imagine people who are first experiencing the game would feel but after my 3 playthroughs throughout this game i always love to walk over to Gwyn and just reminisce on the adventure that i have had to go through to get to this point. And the music of that fight only solidifies that feeling. As apposed to all the other extremely intense music that is loud and gets you in the mood for a great fight Gwyn's music is just graceful for a lack of words. It makes you feel more like ""This game is about to end.."" instead of ""This game is about to end!"".

Well this was certainly an interesting game.
The game which started the infamous trilogy of ball crushingly hard games. (And no demon souls doesn‚Äôt count ffs that game isn‚Äôt even on pc)

And for the most part, I really enjoyed my experience with it.
The early to mid game was especially good with its bosses and overall level design. (I‚Äôd say from start to O and S)

For someone whose first souls experience was with elden ring, this game really forced me to adjust my play style.
Whilst in elden ring I would tend to run past most enemy camps, only picking up collectibles or killing the strongest foes to get their drops, in DS that same strategy usually would lead to me getting pushed up against a corner and getting Stun-locked back to my last bonfire.

The game doesn‚Äôt ask you to take things slow, it kicks your ass If you don‚Äôt, requiring you to take out enemies one by one to avoid enraging too many folks. 
And that‚Äôs really where a lot of the difficulty In this game comes from, its levels and regular enemies, not its bosses.

Not to say the bosses are bad though, far from it‚Ä¶for the most part. As I already said, i really do not have any issues with any bosses up until O and S besides one in the lower undead burg who is made artificially more difficult by putting regular, VERY ANNOYING ENEMIES, in his tiny arena.
But after O and S‚Ä¶the game turns into a bit of a mixed bag.
While the environments still look amazing, the level, enemy and boss designs take severe hits in quality, usually just falling back into gimmicks or lazy reskins of old ones if we‚Äôre talking about bosses specifically.
But I still was happy with the overall package of the base game.

The DLC was where the game picked up in pace for me again. (Figuratively and literally)
The 4 bosses in the dlc basically feel like they have watered down movesets from bosses you‚Äôd see in later installments, to not be overwhelming in your clunky and overall slower movement, but I personally really enjoyed this.
This was the first time in the entire game where the bosses posed a real challenge in my eyes.

As a conclusion, I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this game to someone If they‚Äôve never played souls, but if you have played any of the other games and are willing to look past some of the jank of this one I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll find some joy in it.",1692622472,1692622472,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game is undoubtedly very difficult, but fair. Usually when you die it feels like it was your fault, not the game forcing a cheap death. The game focuses on slow and meaningful combat. When you make a combat decision, such as attacking, dodging, or healing, you are committed to that action. There is no canceling an action once you start it. In a way, this game's combat is the antithesis of button mashing. Battles between enemies are like duels where you and your opponent are trading blows with each other and your opponents will punish you for making a bad decision.

It's the kind of game that rewards players for playing through it multiple times. The first time I played through this game it was a huge challenge. I was very excited every time I made progress and was constantly scared that I would die at any second and ruin said progress. It feels like everything in this game can kill you instantly and you never know what is lurking around the corner. If you stick with it, killing bosses and finishing the game is one of the most rewarding things you can do in all of gaming. 

Upon repeat playthroughs, the game definitely gets easier as you know where everything is and exactly what to expect, but it never stops being fun. There's enough weapon and armor variability that you can play through multiple times and have a completely different experience for each of them. 

The lore is extremely in-depth, but it's not directly told to the player. In order to figure out this game's story you either have to read every item description and take notes or you have to look up lore videos online. There's really no way you could figure out all of the lore from a single standard play through. On the other hand, the lore is not required. Since the main focus of this game is the combat, you can play through the entire game without knowing any of the lore and it would be just as fun. Taking the time to figure out the lore simply adds another layers of intrigue to those that wish to seek it out.

I really don't have anything bad to say about this game. Many consider it to be the best in the Dark Souls series and I've never encountered any game-breaking bugs/glitches. Everything is difficult but in a fair way that makes you feel rewarded for progressing. If you like the slower punishing combat that rewards good decision making, then you need to give Dark Souls a try.",1692475483,1692475483,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Dark Souls is an Action RPG game, where you free to choose what to do next. There are a lot of activities: from exploring new locations to farming souls or gear. The charm of the Dark Souls is the enemies and bosses, that won't spare you. But you'll get used to it... You will.

The beauty of the world in DS1 is indescribable. I was astonished when I first saw the Ash Lake. The primordial beauty of the world right before your eyes. Also, there are a dozen of shortcuts from one location to another, and when you open them you'll be like: ""Wait, what? How did I get here?"".

Most of the games I play are 4-12 hours long and I think Dark Souls is a good example of why that might be the ideal length, because people don't do a great job describing exactly how rough that second half is. I mean aside from the spectacle of it from a distance, and one of the best bosses in the series, even Anor Londo didn't impress me. 

Now believe me, I get why this game is held so high over the others for veteran fans. Back in 1974 there was nothing else like this game. When it came out it was indisputably the best at what it did and that probably had a major influence on the people who played it back then and discovered what they want from games. It definitely helps that the game makes a powerful first impression with Firelink and all of the zones directly connected to it. Those are all of the best areas in the game minus a couple.

There are a couple systems I wanna talk about, like humanity. Humanity is a consumable item that raises hp and item discovery, as well as damage with certain weapons. You can also spend it at any bonfire to increase the amount of healing items that checkpoint gives you by 5. This whole thing feels unnecessary. The game is rarely ever hard enough to warrant spending them and humanity isn't rare enough to warrant saving them so I gotta say I like the estus upgrades in future games more, and I don't want kindling to return nearly as much as I'd want to see bonfire ascetics from DS2 make a return.

The combat in this game is quick and responsive unlike the sequel, which has it's own charm. Your moveset is determined by the tools you choose to use. Not just attack moves but how effective your dodge roll is. This leads to really stupid situations where you choose a class that starts with cool armor and end up stripping all of it off for the entire first half of the game so you can get a faster roll. Honestly if you're not opposed to using a shield, I say start off with all your armor on and trying to rely mainly on blocking with the occasional roll, just so what's happening on the screen isn't so stupid and immersion breaking. Obviously if the roll is more fun to you, that's what matters most.  

The bosses in this game are mostly just alright. The great ones you've already seen online and they're pretty much the standard for DS3 and Elden Ring. 

I definitely recommend Dark Souls if not for the fantastic first half, for the rest of the amazing series that comes after the credits roll (just don't expect DS2 to immediately wow you)",1692297764,1692364146,True,1,0,0.481557369232177734,0,True,False,False

Royal Nectar Force on approach.  Wait a second. Oheck it out.  - Hey, those are Pollen Jocks!  - Wow.  I've never seen them this close.  They know what it's like  outside the hive.  Yeah, but some don't come back.  - Hey, Jocks!  - Hi, Jocks!  You guys did great!  You're monsters!  You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it!  - I wonder where they were.  - I don't know.  Their day's not planned.  Outside the hive, flying who knows  where, doing who knows what.  You can'tjust decide to be a Pollen  Jock. You have to be bred for that.  Right.  Look. That's more pollen  than you and I will see in a lifetime.  It's just a status symbol.  Bees make too much of it.  Perhaps. Unless you're wearing it  and the ladies see you wearing it.  Those ladies?  Aren't they our cousins too?  Distant. Distant.  Look at these two.  - Oouple of Hive Harrys.  - Let's have fun with them.  It must be dangerous  being a Pollen Jock.  Yeah. Once a bear pinned me  against a mushroom!  He had a paw on my throat,  and with the other, he was slapping me!  - Oh, my!  - I never thought I'd knock him out.  What were you doing during this?  Trying to alert the authorities.  I can autograph that.  A little gusty out there today,  wasn't it, comrades?  Yeah. Gusty.  We're hitting a sunflower patch  six miles from here tomorrow.  - Six miles, huh?  - Barry!  A puddle jump for us,  but maybe you're not up for it.  - Maybe I am.  - You are not!  We're going 0900 at J-Gate.  What do you think, buzzy-boy?  Are you bee enough?  I might be. It all depends  on what 0900 means.  Hey, Honex!  Dad, you surprised me.  You decide what you're interested in?  - Well, there's a lot of choices.  - But you only get one.  Do you ever get bored  doing the same job every day?  Son, let me tell you about stirring.  You grab that stick, and you just  move it around, and you stir it around.  You get yourself into a rhythm.  It's a beautiful thing.  You know, Dad,  the more I think about it,  maybe the honey field  just isn't right for me.  You were thinking of what,  making balloon animals?  That's a bad job  for a guy with a stinger.  Janet, your son's not sure  he wants to go into honey!  - Barry, you are so funny sometimes.  - I'm not trying to be funny.  You're not funny! You're going  into honey. Our son, the stirrer!  - You're gonna be a stirrer?  - No one's listening to me!  Wait till you see the sticks I have.  I could say anything right now.  I'm gonna get an ant tattoo!  Let's open some honey and celebrate!  Maybe I'll pierce my thorax.  Shave my antennae.  Shack up with a grasshopper. Get  a gold tooth and call everybody ""dawg""!  I'm so proud.  - We're starting work today!  - Today's the day.  Oome on! All the good jobs  will be gone.  Yeah, right.  Pollen counting, stunt bee, pouring,  stirrer, front desk, hair removal...  - Is it still available?  - Hang on. Two left!  One of them's yours! Oongratulations!  Step to the side.  - What'd you get?  - Picking crud out. Stellar!  Wow!  Oouple of newbies?  Yes, sir! Our first day! We are ready!  Make your choice.  - You want to go first?  - No, you go.  Oh, my. What's available?  Restroom attendant's open,  not for the reason you think.  - Any chance of getting the Krelman?  - Sure, you're on.  I'm sorry, the Krelman just closed out.  Wax monkey's always open.  The Krelman opened up again.  What happened?  A bee died. Makes an opening. See?  He's dead. Another dead one.  Deady. Deadified. Two more dead.  Dead from the neck up.  Dead from the neck down. That's life!  Oh, this is so hard!  Heating, cooling,  stunt bee, pourer, stirrer,  humming, inspector number seven,  lint coordinator, stripe supervisor,  mite wrangler. Barry, what  do you think I should... Barry?  Barry!  All right, we've got the sunflower patch  in quadrant nine...  What happened to you?  Where are you?  - I'm going out.  - Out? Out where?  - Out there.  - Oh, no!  I have to, before I go  to work for the rest of my life.  You're gonna die! You're crazy",1692332947,1692332947,True,2,0,0.525862038135528564,1,True,False,False

See, that's another example of Ed's brilliance. Whenever one of his drugs is about to lose its patent he has his boys and girls alter it just a tiny bit and patent it all over again. Making not just a pointless new pill, but millions and millions of dollars. Which is good for everybody, right? Except for the patients. Psht. Who cares?

One of the best games what I have played on any of the platforms. I own version for PC, xbox, ps3 (and remastered for Nintendo switch) and have played on all platforms. Witth combined 4000 hours I can say for certain that this game hooked me on all similar games what came next. 
The way you understand the story of this world by slowly going deeper and deeper in unknown territory where you're not welcome at all was really special on my 1st play, and remnants of this feeling still are there after few thousand hours of making challenge runs, co-oping with friends or with random, invading for PvP or taking part in organized by content creators or myself PvP tournaments. Second part of the game feels rushed, but it is still very solid.

In my original review for DSptde I wrote that ""I'm waiting remastered only because of new players who will give new life to this game, make PvP in creative locations possible again. No other fixes are needed. Why? Because DS1 does't have any problems to fix, but awful net-code."" Did it give me everything I ever wanted? A Lott of people and many-many memories, recorded PvP duels? Yes, it did. It also did some disappointing changes, as healing with Estes during pvp or weapon matchmaking what killed some mechanics of original game, as chaos weapon. Was low lvl pvp toxic without this changes? Yes it was. Did it become less toxic? No it didn't. You still can use end game magic without any stats to 1 shot people.
Every time I see someone new playing this game, I wish it was me, experiencing this world without knowing anything and getting frustrated and feeling like some of the mechanics are unfair and not so user-friendly. This game offers the greatest interconnected world.

As someone who never quite understood the appeal of Dark Souls and always considered them unfair designed, I finally understand the appeal of it. ""It's not about the destination but the journey"" is a quote that could not be more true when it comes to this game. Every bit of annoyance the game throws at you is needed for you to experience the best pay off you will probably ever have in any game.

That means if you consider yourself to have the mental strength to go through a journey of pain/suffering/hardships/joy, then this game will give you something very special and change the way you look at game-design as a whole.

Multiple aspects of the game are quite poorly made. Sadly this makes it very unfun to play.
A few examples of what I mean:
[list]
 [*] The controls only allow you to move in 4 directions. Front, left, right or back. This is quite annoying when you want to roll as your character can't roll at a 45¬∞ angle. When fighting in narrow spaces or on small elevated walkways this can get you killed very quickly.
 [*] The hitboxes are incredibly unprecise. I rolled away from a monsters swing attack, saw his claw going 2 to 3 meters past me and I still got hit. The other way around I had situations where I attacked with a Greatsword and saw half the texture of the blade going INTO the body of the enemy, but he didn't take damage. It just didn't count the hit. When shooting a bow or crossbow past a wall or object this is also very obvious. The arrows and bolts are often stopped despite clearly flying past and then get stuck in mid air.
 [*] Sometimes you will just die to random bugs. I rolled into a pot to destroy it and was insta killed by it. This is not supposed to happen. It's bugged. I also died when traversing a fog gate because the game placed my character too far to the side and I immediately fell down a cliff. In a hardcore game which punishes you for every death this is [i] VERY [/i] frustrating and must not be a thing.
 [*] Multiple places in the game have death traps which you will die to unless you already know about them. Something like an enemy jumping at you from behind a corner and stabbing you in the back. This isn't fun. Neither is it challening or difficult. It's just annoying.
 [*] You sprint by holding down B on a controller. This can not be set to toggle. You move your camera with the right stick. As a result you can not move your camera while sprinting. This is annoying when you want to run around large bosses because you can not see them as you will always look to the front while sprinting.
 [*] There is no pause button. You can open any menu but the game keeps going. Fanboys will go on about how this is immersive but it's just annoying. Someone rang the door or something else in real life needs your attention? Well screw you because you can't pause. Some might argue that this is due to the Online functionality of invasions, but it's not available in Offline mode either. It's just a bad design decision.
 [*] The UI is a horrific mess. There are multiple menus for equipment and the things you'd want to do with your equipment are scattered across them. Some stats are displayed in multiple menus, some only in one, but not the other.
[/list]

Overall easily half, if not more, of the games 'difficulty' comes from how janky and clunky it is. And that just means it's not fun to play.


The game has some positive aspects too.
[list]
 [*] The atmosphere within the world is great
 [*] The lore and story (while very cryptic) are interesting
 [*] The way the level design loops back in on itself is amazing
 [*] The visual design of the enemies looks really good
[/list]

But the negative side sadly outweighs the positive side by a lot. It's just not fun to play this game.

The fact that this is the Remastered version of the game seriously makes me wonder how bad the Original was. Because honestly, this does not feel like a Remastered Game to the standards of 2018. It feels like a copy paste of a game from the late 2000s.",1692062223,1692062369,False,4,1,0.483460396528244019,0,True,False,False

I know lots of people think its a lazy remaster, but when I first played the og souls, it was in its remastered form. Since I played Dark Souls 3 before this game, it'll be a bit hard for me to say what I like about this game, since everything I like ""from"" this game is most likely also in Dark Souls 3, and I also reviewed that game, But I'll give it my best.

The world of this game definitely feels big, having everything connected makes the game a much more enjoyable expirence, Ds3 did the same, but Ds1R just feels as if they did it better, but Ds3's world still looks more pretty cause everything in the distance definitely looks blurry in this game. The Covenants are better than Ds3 in my opinion, they feel like actual factions. They're pretty much the same as Ds3 but they were just done better, although people will probably like the switching factions from inventory option better. Having the player have access to the harder parts of the game, (Kinda like how you have access to Caelid from the start of Elden Ring) to than getting their ass kicked, to then coming back later when stronger makes for a good way to feel as if you're actually getting powerful. The bosses aren't as crazy as Ds3 or Elden Ring, but it gets a pass for being old (the best bosses are really just the DLC ones, they just feel more hyper active than the base game bosses). The Boss music isn't as intense as the other games, but its somber parts are something of a beauty. It also has one of the best upgrading paths when it comes to weapons. There are so many different ways to upgrade your weapon its actually insane. Its the same for Ds3, but this game made me learn to appreciate it.

Most people when they play this game will be annoyed that you can't fast travel to the other bonfires at the start, I kinda like how you have to earn this ability, makes me feel like i'm on a adventure more, having to walk back to the places I've passed. What annoys me though is the constant having to run a fucking marathon to get to a boss fight from a bonfire. The closet bonfires that are next to boss fights are 3 football fields long. This makes areas that look cool and beautiful start to annoy me, and I lose that feeling of what I thought of it, cause having to walk through the area 10 times cause I died 10 seconds into the boss fight makes me now annoyed at the environment, seeing how I have to run through the whole thing again just to get back the the boss, even though I love the areas and environments in this game, I think they're better than DS3 (not including Ringed City because that shit slaps) and on par with Elden ring if it wasn't for the blurriness. 

This game is definitely way harder than Dark Souls 3 in my opinion, but i think its more bullshit hard if anything. The Main thing is the stun locking, getting stun locked in this game can happen very easily cause most of the armors have 0 poise, so have fun doing any fashion with armor that offers that (thank god for the poise ring). Bosses can literally 2 shot you, because their first hit will stun you, then their second one will be the killing blow. This was the case for me for the final boss, and I had 40 vigor (it ""was"" NG+ though) Bosses in this game don't swing as much as in the later installments, so learning their patterns aren't as hard. Oh, and you might as well just throw those Estus Flasks away, every time you're in the middle of healing, the boss is programmed to run or jump to you at the speed of Usain Bolt and knock you out of it or take more of your health than what the flask gave you.

The ""PvP"", it might be one of the gayest things I have ever seen. Back stab back stab back stab FUCKING BACK STAB, PVP IS JUST BACK STABBING. And the proc for doing a back stab is insane, someone could be behind you, but as long as they are 8 steps close to you, they will get a backstab on you. Using heavy weapons will punish you, cause players will poise through or roll through your swing and walk behind you and backstab you, and you can't roll away cause the swinging animations are so long with large weapons. I don't hear anyone talk about this, but the lock on system is ass. Being locked on to something only allows you to roll in four directions, Up, down, left, right. There is no Up left or Up right, just full on WASD movement with one finger. Fighting bosses was so annoying with Lock on, that I beat the game without it, and it just made things more easier in my opinion, but don't you dare think about NOT locking on during PvP, you'll just be leaving your back open for a backstab.

Now it may just sound like i'm now shitting on the game, but i'm not, I really do love this game, this blows most other games out of the water, Dark souls 1 is in my top ten games of all time to me for gods sake, although this game to me is an acquired taste. Throw your average COD or Battle royale player at this game and they'll probably fucking hate it. But once you actually put the time and effort into this, you'll just love it. For being the first Dark souls, it definitely sends the series in a nice running start, and those who have played Elden ring should definitely play this so they may know just how the Souls games have improved and gotten better since this timeless classic.

I highly recommend this game to:

* Anyone who wants or needs a potent reminder of what we can become, if and when, we manage to set our minds to something (absolutely NOT to downplay how incredibly challenging that step in itself is).
* Someone looking for personal, emotional resonance in a game, in a world of games that seem to be about min-maxing spreadsheets.
* Anyone who finds themselves inspired by the bleak, the macabre, who can pull positivity out of the depths of despair, or anyone who is searching for what that means.
* Anyone who believes this game isn't for them - I promise you that most of the discourse you see online is either surface level, right for the wrong reasons, or just flat out incorrect. Ignore anyone who seems to boast or wish to speak of comparison of work or achievements. All of our steps and achievements are valid and our own, for ourselves.

This game has fundamentally changed my life in a way that I feel games have not since I was much younger, merely in the process of getting hooked, perhaps even breaking me free from borderline addiction to mere escapist fantasy.

I implore you to give it a shot and give it an earnest try, and to do your best to free ourselves from others' statements of ""should"" in this game. What you choose to undertake, and in whichever manner you choose is your cross to bear. I beg of you not to let others take that away from you. We don't have to wait for others to allow us to feel accomplishment; we can reach it from within ourselves, when provoked.

Go forth and conquer. Climb digital mountains to peaks you've never even dreamed of, that you would never have believed possible for you to overcome.

After playing through [b]Dark Souls 3[/b], I was amazed by just how much the game offered in terms of content. After many years of not playing the game due to many distractions, I finally decided to try out the first [b]Dark Souls Remastered (DSR) [/b]game. I have to say, I was not disappointed with my experience of this game, it nails what a game should have in terms of being a good game.

[h1]Story[/h1]
The story for [b]Dark Souls[/b] is not exactly told to the player but there are some bits and pieces to it that you can make out. You will understand what your objective is at some point but the game won‚Äôt tell you where to go or what to do next. This is completely fine on its own, as you can explore areas of the game to maybe find a hidden item. However, if you must look up a guide that‚Äôs not a bad thing as the game can get difficult on occasion on what to do.
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3018867181
I do love the world-building that DS has as it feels like everything is alive but dead at the same time, it really fits a dark fantasy-like setting.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
The gameplay for [b]DSR[/b] is really fun and challenging. Since I played [b]DS3[/b], I was able to get a grasp on the controls and fit into the game just fine. In terms of mechanics, everything is pretty much the same as it was in the original version. At the start of the game, you can choose your character class and what starting item to get. There are a few interesting items for you to have, like the [b]Master Key[/b]. I should mention though that if you pick the [b]Thief[/b] class, getting the [b]Master Key[/b] is pointless as the class comes with one. So, if you get the [b]Master Key[/b] and picked the class, you will get two of those keys.

Every time you defeat an enemy, you will get souls. These souls can be used at bonfires to increase your stats and level up. Although to increase damage, that actually requires you to level up your sword at the blacksmith in the game. There are four blacksmiths that you can find throughout your adventure and they can do various things for you in the game. You do have to visit them on occasion as your weapons can actually break. You will get an icon stating that your weapon is at risk of breaking, it will also do 70% less damage and you must go to a blacksmith to get the weapon repaired. Failure to do so will result in the weapon breaking completely and it does 85% less damage. Shields and armor can also lose their durability and may need repairs as well but I never came across this issue during my playthrough.

I should mention that leveling up your stats in the game will also increase your damage as well, it‚Äôs just the blacksmith is the key way of doing it.

There is also a lot of side content for you to do, like doing side quests, fighting hidden bosses, or even doing the DLCs that come with the game. A lot is given to the player when they play the game and with a big world you explore, there is a lot for you to go out and do. The game also rewards you for going out of your way by giving you hidden items, weapons, armor, or even spells.
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3018866871
Although I do have a small warning for those that have come from [b]DS3[/b] or are just starting out. When you try to heal, your character comes to a complete stop, they won‚Äôt walk while they are healing. Unlike in [b]DS3[/b], where that is a thing, this is not a con for the game, just a small warning I wanted to give out.

However, I do have a few minor issues that don‚Äôt ruin the experience in [b]DSR[/b] but are at least worth mentioning. The first two issues I have with the game do go together and I should at least talk about the steep learning curve that the game has. As well as the mechanics that the game gives you starting out that are a little rough too. I am going to talk about this status element in the game called [b]Curse[/b], which is a completely unique status element to this game only. The only way for you to get [b]Cursed[/b] is by getting inflicted with it by the [b]Basilisk‚Äôs[/b] mist attack (one other enemy and a Boss can do it to). If the curse meter is full, you are killed instantly, when you respawn at your bonfire, your health is cut in half and you can‚Äôt summon player phantoms or the NPC phantoms in the game. This effect is with you permanently until you get it removed.

The only way to cure the [b]Curse[/b] is by a [b]Purging Stone[/b], although there is an NPC who will do it for a fee of one [b]humanity[/b] but getting to him is a problem. The only way to get these purging stones is by going to the [b]Bell Gargoyle Belltower[/b], you will meet someone named [b]Oswald of Carim[/b], who will sell you these stones for 3000 souls. Although to get to him, you have to travel a little bit, which should take you at least 20 minutes or more because the enemies you have to deal with along the way can be a problem. You also can‚Äôt really run past them due to the dogs in that area being very fast and doing bleed damage, plus the other enemies too. Remember, your health is cut in half, meaning a few hits will take you out. The only other way to get a [b]Purging Stone[/b] is by finding the [b]Undead Merchant[/b], who is much closer. However, she will sell them to you for 6000 souls. By that point in the game, you may have to grind for a good 20 or so minutes to get those souls, assuming you did not pick any item that gives you them. Also, you can't fast-travel at that point in the game, so you have to either travel or grind.

Now, let that sink in and try telling all of this to a new player who just got [b]Cursed[/b]. It‚Äôs not a good feeling and this mechanic never returned in any other Souls game for a good reason. [b]Snuggly[/b], who is another NPC can also help with [b]Curse[/b] as well, so I should mention them too.

The last issue I have is that after a certain point in the game, the bosses actually start to become a little easy. There are a few exceptions to this but a large majority of them are pretty much cake walks, getting to them is more of a challenge than anything.

[h1]Graphics, Performance, and Soundtrack[/h1]
The graphics for [b]DSR[/b] are stunning, I loved how the dark fantasy setting was played out in all of the areas. I tested the game on an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 3GB, AMD Ryzen 5 1500X Quad-Core Processor 3.50, and 16 GB of RAM. I experienced no issues while I was playing and the game ran smoothly at 60 FPS.
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3018866635
The soundtrack is another thing I should give a small mention to, all the songs in the game were phenomenal and I loved listening to them, especially the final boss theme.

[h1]Final Verdict[/h1]
[b]DSR[/b] is a fantastic game that I highly recommended to those starting out with the [b]Soul[/b] series to go out and play, despite the issues I mentioned above. If you are a returning player and have the [b]Prepare To Die Edition[/b], then I recommend you get the [b]Dark Souls Fix[/b] patch instead. Nothing really changes in terms of gameplay, unless you want to play the game in HD which could be a strong enough reason by itself.

Role-play:
Dark Souls features robust role-play via game play; it has ten starting classes and you can play as a sorcerer, thief, knight, and cleric, etc. which gives the game a lot of replayability. The game features a lot of side characters which add depth to your role-playing ability as they are literally tied to your class progression. Those who may find melee combat tiresome can do the entire game with ranged combat so the accessibility curve is not too high for people who dread close combat. The game is optimally balanced for each class. Your class choice may change your perspective towards the game. I played nearly the whole series without using any magic, miracle, or pyromancy technique and when I switched to ranged combat I found the game a little less tiring and I sense the camera movement in close combat has a lot to add to that tiredness.
Level Design:
Art Design and Direction:
The art direction of Dark Souls is jaw-dropping. It features gigantic forests, castles, catacombs, and lava pits to name a few, and takes inspiration from world heritage monuments like Angkor Wat. I y features a medieval setting which gives vibes c. .. to a synthesis of eastern and western medieval culture.

Enemy Design:
Enemy Design of Dark Souls is incredibly diverse.
The game never stops surprising you. It has Dragons, Dark wraiths, Ghosts, Gargoyles, Knights, Snake people to name a few and the list is very very long. At times you are fighting mushrooms, at others you are engaged with giant rats. The game keeps it afresh till the very end.
Exploration:
Dark Souls does no hand-holding in telling you where exactly to go, what exactly you need, where to get what you need, and how to use the item that you need to use. In that sense, the whole game is a giant labyrinth with enemies lurking at unknown corners. This is where the game becomes truly difficult. It becomes too difficult at times that you have to read stuff on the internet in order to know what you are supposed to do in the game. For those who like this kind of exploration, Dark Souls is a must-play game as the exploration is frustrating, wondrous, and rewarding at the same time.
Navigation:

Dark Souls does not feature a map or a checklist of objectives and there is no mini-map to keep track of where you are coming from. This is intentional but that does not bode very favourably for the game design. The navigation in dark souls is bad. It features many checkpoints in form of bonfires but they can become very hard to find.
The bigger problem is however indistinguishable pathways and pitfalls. You may be staring at a staircase and never know that it's there. This is simply bad design, something which the later games in the series improve upon but here it is very bad and indubitably frustrating. Some may like this frustrating aspect as to them this naturally adds to the exploration aspect, this is where the masochist aspect of the player base comes from, but even they can't deny that the frustration is there, they just simply enjoy it. It is not slavery if you are into it.
Combat:
Combat is Slow, Tactile, and Fair. What do I mean by that?
Slow:
Dark Slow features natural-paced melee combat which is close to that of the real world. For far combat, the game also involves slow realistic V casting animations like an old priest blessing you in real life. It's not a hack and slash game.

Tactile:
Every armour you wear and every weapon you wield changes how your character moves i.e. it affects the expense of your stamina bar. The clashing of weapon have a realistic sense of weight behind it.
Fair:
In Dark Souls, the core game play loop involves one vs one standoff i.e. you and the enemy are on equal footing. You can heal and so do the enemies. You do get to face multiple enemies at times but more or less it has to do with where you move while being engaged in combat. You may trigger a second enemy in that fashion. You can take advantage of your enemy position by stabbing them in the back and enemies can do the same to you. You can make different builds each with its own advantages with certain types of enemies and disadvantages with certain other types of enemies.
The only negative aspects of combat are parrying mechanics which are non-tactile and texture or object clipping of enemy weapons which give them the ability to hit you through walls.

Graphical Fidelity and technical performance:
The original launch of the game was mediocre on Console and absolutely disastrous on PC where it became playable only due to community efforts.
But after the release of remaster all the woes related to technical performance are gone now.
The graphical fidelity of the game is good but it doesn't do art design and direction justice and falls a little short on it. However I have to note that I played it on 4K, as such the experience was a notch higher for me on a personal level and I am not disappointed, however, compared to Dark Souls IlI, the game shows its age speaking purely in terms of graphical fidelity. The game does not feature pause which is a gimmick move to add flair to the hype of this game being one of the hardest to date. Games can be just as hard with a pause button, Sekiro a later game by the same developers proves that. The camera is janky at times and can ruin some moments of playtime.
Sound:
The Soundtrack features melancholic tunes as ambient music and heavy choirs as boss music which gives this game series a distinct sound template. It's beautiful and loud at times but for most of the game, it's minimal and adds to the silence and mysteriousness of your in-game V surroundings.

Story:
The story in Dark Souls is good but storytelling is very inconsistent and mediocre at best. The game has rich lore but you are better off watching it on YouTube. A YouTube named Vaatividya has made a career out of it. Many players are definitely obsessed with the game's lore which may come off as pretentious at times. However, it's certainly not a game you will keep playing due to its story, no definitely not. It's most likely that you may get no sense of a cohesive story (which is there by the way) in your first play through. In short, it's good but nothing special for any seasoned reader or film watcher. I will say for the western audience it brings more freshness to the table in terms of lore to obsess over than to the eastern audience since the developers are Japanese. On a personal level, I do find the lore quite in-depth and intriguing.

So yeah, it's good!! 

And yeah, it's hard. Elden Ring was my first souls game and this was a different type and degree of challenge. But it felt like a more rewarding experience.

The world design as a whole is unlike any other I've experienced. The world feels cohesive, like the product of natural development and evolution. Moving through it, you feel like a part of the world, and you feel how insignificant you are in it. Though you don't have warping for half the game, it doesn't feel tedious to traverse the world because there is always a new discovery or surprise or shortcut to find. The exploration and critical path that players can follow has great pacing and sense of momentum. 

The first half's progression is so good that when you do finally get warping, it takes away some of the sense of magic. But, I think that contributes to a sense of fatalism about the world that you feel as you come to master it. Just as you were once the victim of an indifferent world in the hard early game, as you gain strength and skill in the later game, the bosses and enemies become victims of an indifferent player character.

I think that the game is about power, the helplessness you feel when you lack it, and the terror when you have it and know that it can't last. 

What makes the game fun is how good it feels to gain power and exact it on a world trying to exact it upon you. Despite the game's fatalistic and helpless themes, you feel very much like you are in control. Whether that feeling is illusory, the fact that the game makes you feel it (and question it, when you think about it) is a remarkable use of interactive storytelling.

In short, it's great, in spite and because of its difficulty. Once you get through the difficulty wall, nothing can stop you.",1691906340,1691906340,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Difficult bosses, a large world to traverse and navigate through, and plenty a rich, dark storyline... should you choose to discover it.

[i] Me at 4:99 [/i]: [b] Baby don't hurt me [/b] 

Dark Souls: Remastered starts amazing and shows 10 ways to frustrate you, at first you can't even move 200 meters. But with each death you get better and start to have fun. You really understand what's this game all about, the enemies you cant pass easily, the map that connects beautfiully, items you find, upgrading your weapon and defeating bosses, you get the whole idea and its really fun. 

I started to have fun when I played it as a parkour game where you kick people from cliffs and L + R2 jump on them. 

It was really amazing to get into this world and play in it. But... I thought Anor Londo was last part and after Ornstein Smough I thought I was going to play 1 large area and reach the final boss, turns out there were 5 more areas I have to go, to reach the final boss. And I can say those areas was not fun. FOA running to bosses takes too much time if it's a part of game why not make it twice longer? They fixed this in future games I think. New Londo ghosts, Road to lost izalith, saving sun bro, dukes archieves, scaleless, all of them are tedious stuff where you have to look up a guide, they didnt add merit to game and elongated it. So I really didnt like the second part, but overall its a great game made by a great company, anything game aims to do is amazing, the thing they aimed to do... not so amazing.

But I played this in 2023 where time is an absolutely valuable currency for me, so I was a little hesitant to finish it, if I had played 5-10 years before I would be more patient... Or not! I wouldnt like the second part thats for sure.

I dont recommend this game if you dont wanna play every souls + bloodborne game, if you are starting for the first time dont play this game, if you finished other games i think you should just repeat those games.

If you are just starting to this series just play Bloodborne DS3 Elden Ring or Sekiro.

This leads to these particular problems.

1. Save points:

- The save points act as respawn spots. Pretty standard. What isn't standard is [b] not having any before a boss. [/b]

- This forces you to walk back each and everytime you want to retry a boss. These [b]walks-backs range between 1-5 minutes.[/b]

- Some of these [b]save points are hidden[/b] which is what creates the dynamism between minutes. If you do not find these hidden points you'll be on the higher end of the walk-back range.

- There are also [b]no auto-saves[/b] which means even if you die just exploring an area before you find a save point you'll respawn all the way back to your previous one. Depending on which one you last used ranges between another [b] 5-10min walk to return. [/b]

2. Controls

Rolling is this game's dodge mechanic. It gives you invulnerability frames and allows you to reposition.

But the roll happens when you release the button and not when you press it.

This manifests itself in a noticeable and frustrating delay. You will think there is something wrong with your controller.

Years of playing games where reacting and dodging at the very last second is the correct playstyle will have you crashing into a wall in Dark Souls.

You'll roll early, not get damaged and think ""how did that not hit me?"". You'll roll on time, get hit and scream ""I ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• pressed the button"".

This is not a game where you react but where you predict. Trial and error is the core gameplay, you will not avoid damage any first time you fight an enemy.

To run you need to hold down the roll button. The time the game needs to register your button press as long enough enough to distinguish between a roll attempt or starting a run will again result in a frustrating delay before you start running that will certainly lead you to more controls based deaths.

This also creates an unconscious dynamic where while you're holding down the button running you'll think once you release it you will roll. Needless to say this doesn't happen.

There was no point in the game where I felt I needed to walk instead of run.

The run is also a face button. This leaves you unable to move the camera unless you do a gamer 420 MLG claw grip which I'm sure causes severe medical problems.

3. Exploration :

- Game expects you to explore. But in most RPGs exploration is rewarding, This isn't the case here.

- In this game everytime you die you lose your XP. This means [b]you've gained nothing by killing enemies if you then die [/b] in the process before leveling up on a save point.

- Areas are huge and reaching a boss will have you forced to decide between walking all the way back to your save point to level up and returning (with all the normal enemies respawned) or fighting him and pray you're able to beat him in this attempt, lest you want to suffer from the [b]5min walk back. [/b]

- You'll be too busy just not wanting to die to really effectively focusing on fighting the boss.

- Both choices (walking back for a level up or fightning the boss and dying) will lead you to the walk of shame. The standard universal game choice (leveling up before a boss) will have you sit through double the walk.


4. Guidance:

- Game does not tell you where to go.  [b]Game does not hint where to go. [/b]

-  [b]There is also no map[/b]. Areas, besides being huge, are pitch black and have no discernible features/landmarks to navigate around. Darkroot Garden and Tomb of Giants come to mind.

- Many paths/ladders you need to go to are [b]blended entirely to the background[/b] which you'll surely miss. The path going down to the Depths right next to the Capra Demon fog gate is one example.

- This leads to you [b]walking around aimlessly[/b] unable to even progress to a new area because you've missed what should be an obvious path. In theory would be fine because exploration is necessary ( and rewarding? ) but because of the problems I listed above this isn't the case.

5. Conclusion:

- World is too big and you run too slow.

- There are not enough save points and the ones that do exist are placed at locations that force you to walk back for several minutes at a time.

- There isn't a designated story path.

- Game forces you to explore but punishes you for doing so.",1688554963,1691749085,False,7,3,0.496728688478469849,3,True,False,False

if you are considering playing dark souls for the first time let this old vet of the game give you some advice (played on console more than pc)

1. get a controller that you can hook up or bluetooth to your pc, keyboard at least for me was HELLISH. controller feels a lot better.

2. dont be afraid to summon, we all need help sometimes, no theres no shame in looking for a golden or white sign to summon a friend or stranger to help us!

I remember trying to play this many years ago and like several others went the wrong direction from firelink to he catacombs. Of course I had chaulked this up to this being the hard aspect of the game everyone was talking about. After about 3 hours of dying continuously to skeletons i decided the game could promptly fuck off. How naive, how close minded I was, how much I missed out on during the early days of dark souls and its sequels. To be blunt, you can look up any critical dark souls review video and I would agree with it. The game is indeed hard but after your first playthrough you likely won't have much trouble at all navigating this world, especially given how much they force you to travel by foot and use shortcuts rather than warps fo the first half of the game. I think this game is an absolute masterpiece. The bed of chaos being the exception. I've only beaten DS2 once as of last week but I have to admit it doesn't even compare to the masterpiece that the original dark souls is in my opinion. They do have good ideas which i'm excited to see more fleshed out in my DS3 playthough. Although, these ideas just didn't hit the mark for me. DS2 was experimental whereas DS1 plays it safe in most aspects. Given this franchises unique nature of gameplay to story balance, it just works not being so experimental. I think this game is perfect to start on for a new fromsoft enthusiast and you may just end up having your entire life projectory changed by looking into the storylines of some of the npcs and bosses. I give DS1 an 11/10 waaay exceeded expectations.",1691647936,1691647936,True,2,0,0.525862038135528564,0,True,False,False

For context, I played ds3 first, loved it, tried this one, hated it, played elden ring, loved it, then came back to this one and figured out poise. I just finished it the first time today.

If you try to play this game with low poise (light armor) you will get stunned by every single attack and take 10 years to recover. High poise allows you to get hit without being completely stopped in your tracks. If you like wearing heavy armor you'll have a great time but I feel like poise is so necessary in this game that it limits build diversity. The most fun I ever had in Dark souls 3 was playing a themed character called ""THE BEAST"" who wore no armor and used the dragon stones, claws, and the FUGS, and I was able to replicate parts of this character theme in elden ring but it's essentially unplayable in this game because of how un-fun it is to play without heavy armor.

It's predecessor ""Dark Souls - Prepare to die Edition"" was, when first released on Steam, a nightmare to play due to an unaccurate and washed out keyboard and mouse controll with a fixed frame rate of 30 fps. However, over the years the community released a variety of mods, which fixed these issues and expanded the gameplay beyond these concerns. Thus, there has never been a need for a remaster which only focussed on these difficulties. Of course it's a quality of live improvement but it isn't worth the money if you already own the ""Prepare to die Edition"". Nevertheless, I do have to admit that the remaster did draw a lot of players in who had never experienced the original Dark Souls. Therefore, it might be worth the buy for the single players experience.
Besides the single player Dark Souls also offers a mulitplayer experience which, if you take Dark Souls 3 for instance, is the driving factor which keeps the game alive. But they didn't change any multiplayer features. And let's be honest the Dark Souls PvP multiplayer experience never has been any fun if you were not willing to invest 100 of hours into learning how to perform and counter backstabs. Additionally, spells and armor have never been adjusted for the multiplayer since the realease of the ""Prepare to die Edition"".
Furthermore, the access to the ""Prepare to die Edition"" has been terminated, which made the modding community for the original game die out on the long term.
Last but not least, the ""Prepare to die Edition"" is an outstanding game but it is far from a perfect product. Countless bugs, Izalith being a rushed and unfinished area, a whole lot of cut content ... ""Dark Souls Remastered"" never cared to adress these things during its production besides the fact that the game could have been expanded beyond its original scope. Surely, this opinion is influenced by me being a Dark Souls fan from the top to the bottom who wants to reexperience Dark Souls the same way I did when I first layed hands on the game. The past years have shown that it isn't a far fetched dream to wish for a good remaster of a game. With the ""Deamon Souls Remastered"" an example even comes from the Dark Souls universe.",1528591516,1691355636,False,1,0,0.474683523178100586,0,True,False,False

However, despite places where the gameplay feels clunky (I'm looking at you Bed of Chaos) the story, visuals, characters, music, and combat are hugely enjoyable. It is easy to see why DS1 is so beloved.

Getting a couple things out of the way, play with a controller if you can. Using keyboard and mouse wasn't something I found to be good. If you are like me, and don't have a ton of patience for figuring out everything yourself, don't let slamming your head into a wall stop you from progressing. Asking a friend, or even playing through the game with a friend made my first playthrough enjoyable and helped me feel prepared for replaying on my own. 

Overall the only thing that I actually dislike about the game (NOT mentioning bed of chaos) is the camera lock system. It often prevents you from being able to see what larger bosses are doing, while also having weird ranges for locking on to enemies with ranged attacks. There are ways to mitigate this problem by not relying on the camera lock for combat but that wasn't something that I felt like investing time in learning.

I have trouble being really compelled by the story, lore, and characters, despite reading item descriptions and exhausting each NPCs dialogue.
Many areas are oversized and/or under-developed, and most don't feel terribly original, so it's overall hard to grow attached to anywhere.
...but... Are all of those things really so bland compared to other games...?
I don't know. For some reason, the game just isn't clicking with me.
I've played other games that were particularly challenging or even similarly unforgiving of failure but still engaged me.
Maybe it's lack of variety in the combat?
I've played other games with relatively simple combat where that didn't bother me.
Maybe it's just all of the above combined that makes it feel so bland.
Uncompelling world, vapid environments, and uninteresting gameplay...
Overall, there just isn't much to keep me interested.

I hesitate to give it a negative review because I don't actively dislike it overall.
If you feel like a long and meaty challenge to sink your teeth into can carry an otherwise largely bland game, give it a shot. Maybe you'll find more appreciation in it than me.

In my case, though, as someone who tends to be mostly ambivalent toward challenge, little in this game really grabbed me... besides a couple of enemies which literally did grab me. Oh, and the massive-****-off crow; that one grabbed me a few times... and those lesser batwing demons after the... --Come to think of it, there was actually a decent 'handful' of things that grabbed me.",1690731333,1691232276,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Considering when it came out it's genuinely magic that it's as good as it is. If you're looking for a starting place in the series I recommend Dark Souls 3 first, but Dark Souls 1 is fine too.

Honestly worth it at full price I think and the game runs pretty amazing. Normally I would go through every element of the game to evaluate it but I don't think it's fully necessary for this so let's go rapid fire.

Music: Pretty good, Only weird thing is that your character inevitably moans erotically after getting hit.
Visuals: Overall I think the art style is pretty good, but you can tell it hasn't fully evolved yet. Enemy designs feel good but not great and weapons can sometimes look awesome, and sometimes look boring.
Story: There is definitely a cool story here and while piecing it together yourself can be a great experience, it's also next to impossible to do alone and I recommend watching Vaati.
Gameplay: Here we go. The game is hard but outside of the basics of learning when to roll, hit, and use healing, just make sure your are leveling up your weapon as much as possible and focusing on min maxing your character and you should be able to eventually beat the game. The world is super rewarding to explore and you really can feel an extreme difference in your level of mastery after beating the game. I missed a boss so I ran through the game in new game plus at supersonic speed to reach them, and it really felt great after I struggled so hard the first time.

Granted, this is a game from 2011, but even back then, I would think some of its aspects weren't what you would call ""modern"". There is no map of any kind, and there is no indicator of missions or where to go. And this can be very annoying: you'll feel kind of lost in that world.

However, when you compare that to the old ""Zelda"" games, you can see that this game represented some sort of rescue; that Hidetaka Miyazaki wanted to bring back that idea of a world that was supposed to be freely explored, and you would just find new things in your path: eventually, you would bump into a main story element. There are no dead ends: every path leads to somewhere. And some places hide immense secret areas that can go an entire play unexplored.

The world design, however, is not really an open-world like ""Ocarina of Time""; it actually reminds me more of ""Banjo-Tooie"", in that it's not composed of separated levels. Everything is interlinked with shortcuts and passages you wouldn't believe. Still, it is sprawling in its own way, like a series of areas that lead to each other. But again, it's easy to get lost in it, as you'll have to memorise it, which you'll do with enough gameplay.

Then, there's the combat - perhaps the most infamous aspect of the game. I actually concluded ""Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice"" and ""The Surge"" before I properly started this game, and let me tell you, I don't find it that hard. If anything, it's like a slower-paced version of ""Sekiro"". It's all about timing: this game is not about swinging swords against your foes, but striking and blocking at the right time.

My biggest issue with the game however is the pause menu, which doesn't actually pause the game. This may be because this is also an online game, and online games can't usually pause. What I find weird is that even when I'm offline, the game still doesn't pause - and sometimes, I have to pick a phone call, or I have to go to the bathroom, or I have to pick my nose! So you just stand in a corner, hoping no enemy will creep on you while you're out.

I find the soundtrack to be beautifully composed but poorly executed, as if FromSoftware didn't have the budget for a proper full orchestra. As for the performance, the game runs beautifully: people talked a lot of crap about this remaster, but it goes without a hitch, and while the graphical adjustments are not in par with, say, the remaster for ""Modern Warfare"", the game is stunning with what was added to it.",1559422318,1691099836,True,48,7,0.654368579387664795,0,True,False,False

Man am I glad I made that choice. This game doesn't have the best combat of the series, nor the best bosses, nor the best weapon variety, nor the best visuals. However, the inter-connectivity of the world building and the atmosphere alone are enough to convince me this is the best Dark Souls game, and there isn't a doubt about it. Turning every corner gives you butterflies in your stomach. You'll be wandering around for an hour and begin to feel like you are 100 miles away from where you started, wondering how in the world you are supposed to navigate your way out of the current area, then all of the sudden come across a path back through the Valley of the Drakes back to Firelink. Setting scale aside, this game has better world-building than Elden Ring(Which I deemed the best game ever upon completion) and I do not say that lightly. Finally getting to the end and beating Gwyn was magical, I jumped up out of my seat and screamed ""**** YEAH"". Then I poured a cup of coffee and sat in my silent living room for 30 minutes just thinking about my journey in retrospect. If you're looking for modern, over-the-top high octane combat, sure Dark Souls III or Elden Ring will probably suit you better.

Dark Souls acts as the beginning of not only FromSoftware's flagship franchise, but also birthing the Soulslike genre, which is characterized by an emphasis on environmental storytelling, mastering combat mechanics through each boss, and expected player death that ties into the story. The biggest strength of Dark Souls is the level design, which is easily one of the best ever put in a game. Each area has a unique identity of its own but somehow smoothly connects with one another. There are multiple routes that lead to different areas, most specifically Firelink Shrine, which is basically the main hub of the game. The linearity of the level design also greatly benefits the player as there is a loose, but clear enough path on how the player should progress throughout the game, which removes the need for quest markers and waypoints. Without the quest markers and the clear objectives, it allows you (the player) to fully adventure through the world of Lordran. As for the story and narrative, there's very little exposition and dialogue that is spoonfed to the player. Cutscenes are very sparse and are usually reserved for boss fights and key points of progress. It's up to the player to pick up the pieces throughout their playthrough to further uncover the lore and overarching narrative, much like the real world where you learn by picking up bits and pieces of information from different sources like people or books. If you are up for a challenge, then I 100% recommend picking up this game.",1690830595,1690830595,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

At the beginning, I found myself constantly struggling, but gradually, I honed my skills and adapted to the game's demands. However, I must emphasize that the game never became easy; it was my improvement as a player that made the difference.

Completing the game was an unforgettable journey, and I consider it one of the most rewarding experiences I've had as a gamer. The game continually forces you to step out of your comfort zone, discouraging reckless rushing and instead requiring thoughtful and methodical gameplay.

Even the most basic enemies can be formidable opponents if approached carelessly. Overall, Dark Souls Remastered is a masterpiece, challenging players while offering a deeply gratifying sense of achievement.

Throughout my time with Dark Souls, I couldn't help but draw parallels between the game and real life. It struck me that the challenges presented in the game mirror the hurdles we face in our daily lives. Just as in the game, we encounter obstacles everywhere, but it's our ability to assess and strategize that ultimately leads to success.

In many ways, the game taught me valuable life lessons. It reinforced the importance of perseverance and resilience in the face of adversity. Each defeat in the game became a stepping stone, a lesson learned, and a chance to improve. This process mirrored the way we grow and develop as individuals by learning from our mistakes and pushing ourselves beyond our comfort zones.

Believing that overcoming Dark Souls can translate into success in real life may sound like a bold statement, but it's one I strongly stand by. The game's challenges demand patience, determination, and the will to keep going despite repeated setbacks. These are the very qualities that can help us conquer the trials and tribulations we encounter in the real world.

Dark Souls is not just a game; it's a metaphor for life. It shows us that with dedication and the willingness to learn from failure, we can tackle even the most daunting challenges. This powerful message makes Dark Souls Remastered an exceptional and unforgettable experience that extends far beyond the virtual realm.

I tried Dark Souls 3 a couple of times and didn't make it terribly far because I would get so mad I'd quit. It took me watching Noah Caldwell-Gervais' video talking about the Dark Souls trilogy to finally get myself this remastered version of the first official entry, not only because it is the first, but because the blocking and parrying are more forgiving. 

Like Noah, I found myself looking for every opportunity to make the game easier for myself, summoning NPC and human help alike, using ranged attacks, upgrading my weapons and stats; along with ""getting gud"" by learning how to deal with every boss and standard enemy, knowing full well that a single mistake could spell doom. I got so mad multiple times that I'd delete my saves and start over out of rage, whether because of a boss I got stuck on, or a part of the regular level that did my head in, or the wheel skeletons that are, in my opinion, some of the worst enemies put in a video game. This love-hate relationship culminated in me beating my first playthrough the day before my birthday this past January and my first New Game+ playthrough 8 days before writing this.

Now, I have the whole trilogy, Sekiro, and Elden Ring in my library, and I want to play Bloodborne and Lies of P, too. Halberds and greatswords are my weapons of choice because the game allowed me to see which ones I liked. I have a new save where I'm running a pyromancer and I want my next one after that to be a cleric that I level into a paladin. My favorite bosses of the ones I faced across the trilogy are Artorias, Sif, and the Abyss Watchers because they are the most straightforward (i.e. least-gimmicky) and are adjoined in the feeling of doing a dance when fighting them.

Playing Dark Souls and reading Berserk served to remind me that things like these are worth persevering and seeing to the end, no matter how fuck-off difficult they are. I've seen for myself why people think Dark Souls is one of the best games ever made, and I'm fond of it, warts and all. The interconnected world design, melancholic music themes, funny ragdoll physics, and the simple act of grinding for souls on simpler enemies made me stay for the ride.

However, this remaster is a solid PC port. Some parts of this game have not aged well -- mainly Lost Izalith still feels unfinished, Bed of Chaos is still the most obnoxious boss in any game ever made, and the New Londo ghost enemies are still extremely obnoxious -- but otherwise I think this game holds up pretty well. 

I think the level design is still the best in any of the Souls games. The way that the levels interconnect feels metroidvania-esque. Compared to recent Souls games like Bloodborne/Dark Souls 3/Sekiro/Elden Ring, most of the bosses in this game feel pretty basic but they are still an exciting spectacle. The combat in this game is slower paced compared the newer Souls games but it feels weighty and satisfying.

After 100% Elden Ring some months previously I knew I wanted to play through Dark Souls. I however, waited for a sale before buying it. If you are familiar with Elden Ring there are a lot of similar features such as how leveling works or how a bonfire resets enemies in an area and fills up your healing uses. However, unlike Elden Ring which is open world Dark Souls seems to focus more on the dungeon aspects of the world. When going through an area they are pretty good about setting up shortcuts you can unlock which allow more convenient access to other locations. Like Elden Ring you can access previous locations and in fact there are reasons to go back to previous areas. However, the fast travel system is more limited meaning you will have to remember how to get around and where the convenient shortcuts are.

I was dead wrong.

Sure, I see the core of what would eventually evolve into a radically different, near-perfect game, but that core itself is STILL an absolutely unmissable experience to this day.

I don't know what I can say about Dark Souls that hasn't already been said by other, more seasoned FromSoftware-sexuals out there about its difficulty and the satisfaction of beating its challenging bosses. It's a great game that absolutely deserves all the praise it's gotten over the years. But I'll try.

Is it perfect? No. Are ALL of its bosses, at least the required ones for story progression, all flawlessly designed? No. I'm looking at you, Bed of Chaos. But what it does get right in terms of boss design, its varied and interconnected environments, and the ways you can tune your playstyle? It absolutely knocks all of that out of the park. Experiencing this classic now, I completely understand why it's compelled so many people and even spawned so many imitators that can't hold a candle to its quality.

The mechanical consistency that I admired in Sekiro has its roots in Dark Souls. For all its (slightly) clunky movement, slower pace, and recovery animations that last an eternity and WILL be punished when you mistime anything you do, none of it is the kind of ""jank"" that you gotta work around. It's the kind of system that can be learned because it's always consistent. You get a feel for its controls the more you play. Your rolls, depending on how much weight you've got on, always go at a consistent distance. You can hold your shield up to block, but timing it after a roll or an attack is reliable when you get a feel for how long it takes your character to pull up their shield. Attack animations, both yours and your enemies', are readable, so even if you're the type to want to lug around a slow, heavy weapon, knowing that its attack animations are always at a consistent timing will give you a feel for when it's safe to swing it. Parries are more dangerous to screw up than in Sekiro, but given the great readability of most enemies, you'll know which attacks you can parry almost at a first glance. It'll take a few tries. And a few deaths. Maybe a lot of deaths. But it's not something you can't overcome. And when you do, god, you're rewarded with some big damage, and for some smaller weapons, a kick to your opponent's face, just to add insult to injury. It's fantastic.

Everything you can do in Dark Souls is measurable, but in a way that's intuitive. What may seem clunky in your first hour can turn into some particularly elegant gameplay by the end. And this mechanical consistency is what a lot of games, not even just Souls-likes, often get wrong. But it's a quality that's just as evident in this classic as it is in a game as recent and as polished as Sekiro.

And the best part, especially for folks who might be hesitant because of this game's notorious difficulty, is if you're starting to feel like you're stuck, Dark Souls is so insanely open-ended that instead of beating your head against a wall you can't break through, you can always try going elsewhere and come back at another time. Try a different route. Maybe you'll find a secret. Maybe you'll find a whole new area. Maybe you'll encounter an entirely different boss. Maybe you'll find someone willing to trade with you or give you some kind of cryptic hint about the world after a bit of creepy laughter. Maybe you'll find a good place to farm for souls and get stronger. Maybe you'll find an item that, as it turns out, makes the previous boss you were stuck on an absolute joke. This game rewards exploration in the best ways possible.

Which brings me to the world this game is set in. Good lord almighty. The kingdom of Lordran, for all its death and destruction, is absolutely beautiful. God, the SCALE of these places, man. To be honest, I assumed that Dark Souls, despite all I've heard about it taking inspiration from the Berserk manga, was going to be generic western fantasy. It's not. It's very Japanese in how it handles western fantasy. It takes its inspirations and does two things with it that I've seen in other Japanese games: it either mangles it to be something exceptionally horrifying, which is most evident with the boss designs, or in terms of its world design, it upscales everything, and I mean EVERYTHING to be as large and grandiose as possible, while applying the same type of corruption and undeath appropriate to its themes. The transition from Sen's Fortress to Anor Londo is one of the greatest things I've experienced in a game, and it's serviced by how challenging it was to get through the former. THAT is how you introduce a new area with an entirely different feel and scale after making your players think they've seen everything.

Dark Souls is the furthest thing from generic in terms of its presentation, and I am absolutely disappointed with myself that it took me this long to grab this game and play it. It makes me appreciate everything that I found beautiful about Sekiro while the first entry in this iconic franchise still holds up on its own merits. So much that I'm willing to suffer through another run just to see what I missed.

Don't let the game's reputation of being difficult make you miss out on what it does best. I say the same thing about Sekiro, and I'll say it again for Dark Souls. FromSoftware knows how to make the difficulty inherent in their games pay off. And said difficulty rarely ever feels distinctly cheap. Victories are earned in Dark Souls, whether it's entirely through you ""git'n gud"" with your dodging and rolling, suffering alone with just a sword and a shield, as I did, or doing the 200 IQ move of using ranged attacks, magic, and summons, or if you're the type to be thorough in your exploration and you find other ways to beat its challenges. These are all ways that the game accepts, even if some ""hardcore"" fans don't. Don't mind them. This game's far more flexible than folks like them would make you think. Either way, there's no replacing the satisfaction of beating this game for the first time. I can't wait to get started on FromSoftware's other games, but at the same time, there's a few optional bosses and some secret areas I missed on my first run, and some more item descriptions for me to read to get a sense of the lore without watching a Vaati video. So once again, just like Sekiro, I'mma be doin' some NG+, baby.

Praise the Sun!

A lot of people say that it's a masochist's game, but there's a level of patience and stoicism that the game forces you to appreciate. I can't say that any other game I've played really engages the player in that kind of discourse. 

There are definitely some grindy bits, especially if you're going for the collect-all-the-rare-weapons achievement. But in many cases the grind is simply overcoming a new area, getting a little farther each time, until you finally kill the boss at the end and get to the next area. This means that you're not grinding for arbitrary levels or drops (although you still can do that if that's your thing), but instead each attempt pushes the game forward.

The story the game tells is very much told by reading in between the lines. There are occasional lore dumps, like the intro cutscene, but much of the info is learned by speaking to the various NPCs around the map. These NPCs have different dialogues depending on when you speak to them, and sometimes offer vague objectives the player should complete to progress. Essentially, you could play this game as a beat-em-up and miss all the lore and reasoning behind it.

The level design might be my favorite of any game. Everything is tied together in a rat's nest of levels, some open plan, some linear with a few doors scattered around. Each area is connected to every other area, but those paths may only be accessible after beating a particular boss. Everything is situated such that there's no discontinuity; every region has a footprint in the world, and many times if you look around in a level, you'll see areas below or next to you that are part of a completely different part of the game. It gives a really lived-in sense to the world when there aren't areas built just for show, but are instead all accessible. Also cool that there aren't any loading screens between regions, you can just walk between them like walking through a densely packed city.",1690342934,1690342934,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Otherwise, I just don't get this game's appeal. I recently played Elden Ring and Sekrio and thoroughly enjoyed them, so I decided to see where it all began. A sizeable majority of this game is just not very good. Level design is interesting, but different rooms even within the same zone seem to have been made with a different theme in mind. Enemies don't really have any meaningful reward for killing them, so I ended up just running past most things. Pretty much every boss except for the last on is really big and really slow, more of a spectacle fight. Only at the final boss was any complexity added, and even then it was pretty bland (he just moves faster). The physics, collisions, and many other aspects are just inconsistent (swords/melee hitting invisible geometry and staggering the player, but enemies not having that same collision). The menuing was pretty tedious to navigate (but thats probably because it was designed for controller on consoles). The games seems to confuse tedium with difficulty, with 2-4 minute back tracks to bosses upon death, which really only pads time. Finally, there just wasn't really enough weapon variety and I ended up using the same catalyst+spell for pretty much the whole game. The ability to redistribute skill points at bonfires might improve this since you can adapt to new weapons you find to try them out.

I will say, one innovation that will forever change gaming is the introduction of double sided elevator which ensures the player can always ride up or down without pulling a lever and waiting. Despite this, From only used it once and all the other elevators require a lever pull for some reason.",1689214019,1690336113,False,1,1,0.41682848334312439,0,True,False,False

Modern English translations of the Old Testament section of the Christian Bible are based on the Masoretic Text.[35] The Pauline epistles and the gospels were soon added, along with other writings, as the New Testament.[138]

Old Testament
Main article: Old Testament
Further information: Development of the Old Testament canon
The Old Testament has been important to the life of the Christian church from its earliest days. Bible scholar N.T. Wright says ""Jesus himself was profoundly shaped by the scriptures.""[139] Wright adds that the earliest Christians searched those same Hebrew scriptures in their effort to understand the earthly life of Jesus. They regarded the ""holy writings"" of the Israelites as necessary and instructive for the Christian, as seen from Paul's words to Timothy (2 Timothy 3:15), as pointing to the Messiah, and as having reached a climactic fulfillment in Jesus generating the ""new covenant"" prophesied by Jeremiah.[140]

The Protestant Old Testament of the 21st century has a 39-book canon. The number of books (although not the content) varies from the Jewish Tanakh only because of a different method of division. The term ""Hebrew scriptures"" is often used as being synonymous with the Protestant Old Testament, since the surviving scriptures in Hebrew include only those books.

However, the Roman Catholic Church recognizes 46 books as its Old Testament (45 if Jeremiah and Lamentations are counted as one),[141] and the Eastern Orthodox Churches recognize 6 additional books. These additions are also included in the Syriac versions of the Bible called the Peshitta and the Ethiopian Bible.[l][m][n]

Because the canon of Scripture is distinct for Jews, Eastern Orthodox, Roman Catholics, and Western Protestants, the contents of each community's Apocrypha are unique, as is its usage of the term. For Jews, none of the apocryphal books are considered canonical. Catholics refer to this collection as ""Deuterocanonical books"" (second canon) and the Orthodox Church refers to them as ""Anagignoskomena"" (that which is read).[142] [o]

Books included in the Roman Catholic, Greek, and Slavonic Bibles are: Tobit, Judith, Greek Additions to Esther, the Wisdom of Solomon, Sirach (or Ecclesiasticus), Baruch, the Letter of Jeremiah (also called the Baruch Chapter 6), the Greek Additions to Daniel, along with 1 Maccabees and 2 Maccabees.[143]

The Greek Orthodox Church, and the Slavonic churches (Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, North Macedonia, Montenegro, Poland, Ukraine, Russia, Serbia, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia and Croatia) also add:[144]

3 Maccabees
1 Esdras (called 2 Esdras in the Slavonic canon)
Prayer of Manasseh
Psalm 151
2 Esdras (4 Ezra) and the Prayer of Manasseh are not in the Septuagint, and 2 Esdras does not exist in Greek, though it does exist in Latin. There is also 4 Maccabees which is only accepted as canonical in the Georgian Church. It is in an appendix to the Greek Orthodox Bible, and it is therefore sometimes included in collections of the Apocrypha.[145]

The Syriac Orthodox Church also includes:

Psalms 151‚Äì155
The Apocalypse of Baruch
The Letter of Baruch[146]
The Ethiopian Old Testament Canon uses Enoch and Jubilees (that only survived in Ge'ez), 1‚Äì3 Meqabyan, Greek Ezra and the Apocalypse of Ezra, and Psalm 151.[n][l]

The Revised Common Lectionary of the Lutheran Church, Moravian Church, Reformed Churches, Anglican Church and Methodist Church uses the apocryphal books liturgically, with alternative Old Testament readings available.[p] Therefore, editions of the Bible intended for use in the Lutheran Church and Anglican Church include the fourteen books of the Apocrypha, many of which are the deuterocanonical books accepted by the Catholic Church, plus 1 Esdras, 2 Esdras and the Prayer of Manasseh, which were in the Vulgate appendix.[148]

The Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Churches use most of the books of the Septuagint, while Protestant churches usually do not. After the Protestant Reformation, many Protestant Bibles began to follow the Jewish canon and exclude the additional texts, which came to be called apocryphal. The Apocrypha are included under a separate heading in the King James Version of the Bible, the basis for the Revised Standard Version.",1690233727,1690233727,True,1,0,0.515994429588317871,0,True,False,False

The lore is much deeper than it first meets the eye and almost everything feels connected. The game-play is brilliant for most part and the level design especially in the early-game beautiful (exceptions: Capra Demon boss arena, Great Hollow). Also I like the feeling dark souls' world gave me, the feeling of an age coming to its end, having left its days of glory far behind it, and yet still exhausting every possible means of preserving itself, becoming more and more intolerable to its inhabitants until its eventual inevitable demise in order to give birth to something new and better; and I like it because I really think this applies to our world as well.
   Having said all that, the second half of the game feels a bit sloppy and is not so masterfully developed as the first, with the exception of the DLCs that might be even better than the base game. Furthermore there are several areas, enemies, and bosses in the game that are difficult for all the wrong reasons (examples: Blighttown, Great Hollow, Lost Izalith, Capra Demon, Bed of Chaos, Four Kings). There are also some broken builds that make the game extremely easy and are frustrating to come across in PVP and there are some tedious activities (such as cutting dragon tails) that have to be performed in order to get access to some great weapons.",1690179954,1690181783,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Prepare to be drawn into a world where death is a constant companion and triumph is hard-earned. Dark Souls, the critically acclaimed action role-playing game, is a masterpiece that both punishes and rewards players in equal measure. Developed by FromSoftware, this gaming gem has captivated the hearts of countless gamers, immersing them in a hauntingly beautiful and challenging universe.

From the moment you step foot into the desolate and atmospheric kingdom of Lordran, Dark Souls sets an unmatched tone of dread and melancholy. The game's dark fantasy setting is brought to life through stunning visuals, intricate level design, and an ambient soundtrack that heightens the sense of isolation and foreboding. Every location in the game feels like a piece of a bigger puzzle, waiting to be unraveled by those willing to delve deeper into its mysteries.

The gameplay mechanics of Dark Souls are its true signature. Combat is a dance of precise timing, thoughtful strategy, and immense patience. Each enemy encounter is a test of your skills and knowledge, requiring you to learn from your mistakes and adapt your approach. The satisfaction of overcoming seemingly insurmountable challenges, whether it's a massive boss or a group of relentless foes, is unparalleled. Dark Souls respects its players by not holding their hand, making each victory taste all the sweeter.

The character progression system is both deep and customizable, offering a wide range of character classes and weapon types to suit any playstyle. This versatility allows for multiple playthroughs, each offering a unique experience and sense of accomplishment.

One of the game's standout features is its interconnected world design. As you progress, you'll find shortcuts and hidden paths that link previously explored areas, creating a cohesive and interconnected world that feels alive. Exploration is key, and every corner of Lordran is filled with secrets, treasures, and lore waiting to be discovered.

Furthermore, the multiplayer aspect of Dark Souls adds an additional layer of depth and unpredictability. Interaction with other players can be both helpful and treacherous, as you might receive assistance in the form of messages or find yourself invaded by hostile foes seeking your demise.

While Dark Souls offers an unforgettable and rewarding experience, it may not be for everyone. Its high level of difficulty can be daunting, and some players may find themselves frustrated. However, for those willing to embrace the challenge and learn from failure, the sense of accomplishment is unmatched.

In conclusion, Dark Souls stands as a timeless masterpiece in the gaming world. Its rich lore, atmospheric world, challenging gameplay, and sense of achievement combine to create an unparalleled experience. If you seek a game that demands both skill and perseverance while rewarding your determination with moments of triumph, Dark Souls is an absolute must-play. Enter Lordran, brave Undead, and may the bonfires light your path.",1690140562,1690140562,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Not that it's suddenly now not worth recommending, no. Simply compared to the newest entries this one will feel very clunky, slow and pointlessly complicated. You truly will not realize how spoiled we are with the granted warping until you see first none and then limited options available here. Overly complicated upgrade system scattered across the game world, much harsher NG+, huge runs to bosses, tight time limits for questlines when looking for spells (most notably Miracles), awful menu deigns and usage, and widely known fact that the game kind of becomes ""meh"" after finishing Anor Londo as further areas feel unfinished or poorly balanced (or both), Bed of Chaos anyone? Additionally as this is a Remaster this is a rather lazy one not really fixing many bugs that existed in the original (InfernoPlus covered the matter extensively on YT).

But then of course the game doesn't require mods to work properly anymore, can use items in bulk and we got a possible warp to Catacombs. I guess it's something...even if some new things are broken like early PvP balance.
I'm not sure is it the best starting point for new souls players as its age may proof pushing off but it's most certainly the best to get started and hooked on Dark Souls deep lore and mystery of its world. Magic here is extremely powerful compared to any future entry so this can be a nice incentive. The interconnected world is still an impressive feat even if after any future entry having to traverse it multiple times may get on ones patience. Original cast of favorite characters that future games only attempt to clone. By far the BEST dragon-form in the series...

It's an old classic now that for sure still has things to offer but to someone not feeling nostalgic towards I can tell it may prove off-putting for the clunk or lackluster late-game. These simple facts that can't be jumped over so one has to be prepared for them...and to die...a lot ;3",1690042799,1690042799,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Dark Souls 1..... is not good. It suffers a major flaw that FromSoft have since fixed- and that is teleporting between bonfires. While this IS technically possible in DS1, it's not until very late game. I have had 5 consecutive runs completely ended due to this one lacking mechanic. 
Call me crazy, but I don't want to follow a guide for THE WHOLE GAME. I honestly have no idea how I ever beat this game on PS3 pre-internet guides to begin with but JFC this is just dumb at this point. I just can't recommend it anymore after 5 straight up game ending runs all because ""you chose the wrong bonfire"" and get stuck in a perpetual loop of death and not being able to go anywhere or do anything, messing up NPC quests and the like along the way because you can't do anything. 
This seems to be an issue right after Gargoyles. I can clear first bell in under 2hrs, while leveling, and still somehow end up in a never ending death loop no matter what way I go. Leveling has nothing to do with it, it's merely the lack of being able to escape these death loops via going to a different bonfire and approaching from a new angle. 
It was obviously an issue, or they wouldn't have immediately fixed it in their following games.",1682358964,1689843657,False,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False
