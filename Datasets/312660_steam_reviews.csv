I bought the very first SE1 a number of years back & the game has still managed to maintain most of it's original ideas while evolving nicely with the times. 
Although it's sequel SE5, is unfortunately let down by a number of factors e.g. high memory leakage,bugs,etc.Though Rebellion are still patching the issues gradually, you will find most SE hardcore players still on SE4 servers.  
Multiplayer is very challenging and you will really need patience to play & to become good at, as there are some very committed players you will go up against (mainly camping & making nuisance of themselves by shooting you in the spine 5 seconds after you respawn!)
Tight team planning & a mic will make all the difference.
Co-op is likely the best mode & I have made a number of solid gaming pals over the last few years that are my age group(over 50's!) In fact I believe most of the players are middle aged.

312660,158201628,76561198125598450,150,3,595,0,595,1707742334,"I just rated as not recommended so the review would show up. It's likely 90+% of people don't have an issue with my complaints regarding controls.

1. Most games allow for both a primary and secondary key binding. Not this game.
2. Only a select few controls can share the same key binding. 
3. Multiple keybindings for things that should at least optionally be the same.
4. No option for keys to be sticky

By default ""e"" is interact, but hold down ""e"" to search a body.  Except to pick up a document from a table is ""r"", which by default ""r"" is reload. Why not let the interact key also pick up a document? I can't say how often I've clicked ""e"" to pick up a document.
Zooming in using ""b"" binoculars uses left and right arrows, but with a scope it's up and down arrows (or vice versa I forget). Why not have up and down arrows be zoom in both? Then left and right to change range in scope?

Speaking of scope, when using a sniper rifle, right mouse must be held to keep the gun against shoulder, why? Why not hit right button once to engage scope and again to disengage? Then hit space to stop breathing, target and fire. With a laptop (and my preferred keyboard) this is stupidly difficult 

In fact playing on a laptop sucks because of keybinding limitations. Even using a full keyboard and mouse likely causes carpal tunnel.

I use a micro keyboard. It's about 6 inches wide.  The top 3rd is a touchpad that works exactly like a laptop touchpad. You can double tap with 1 finger for left mouse, 2 fingers acts like a scroll wheel, 3 fingers double tap is right mouse. Left of the touchpad is a left mouse button and on the right side a right mouse button. The top right corner has up/down/right/left and ok (enter).
Below the touchpad is a mostly standard qwerty keyboard. F1-F10 along the top, Tab, caps, left shift, left control. left alt, right alt windows are available; along with standard symbol keys. On the left of keyboard are larger left and right mouse buttons. On the right side is large page up and page down.

Now imagine this. Enemies are near, you want to use smg. Hold down left mouse to keep the gun shouldered, use w, s, a, d to move and the touchpad to aim. Now try to do all of that and figure out how to accurately fire. If not for right mouse having to be held, it would be possible, but not pleasant.

In sniper mode it's just frustrating. Hold down right mouse, hit space, try to aim then hit left mouse to fire. In my case, I have to hold the keyboard with at least three fingers and a thumb to stabilize the keyboard.  Left thumb hold right mouse button, right thumb hit space, then move to right thumb to touchpad to aim and try to figure out how to fire without dropping the keyboard. forget about trying to change the range (if zoom was up/down for both binocs and scope then changing range would work with left/right.

I then thought, I know, I'll use my awesome joystick as a game controller. It has an analog control with 4 buttons on top of the joystick, a fire button and secondary fire button all on a 3 axis joystick. The base has 6 additional keys and a throttle. Except if you select controller in game you can't adjust the keybindings. 

Fine, I'll use a joystick keybinder program.  10 keys, an analog joystick, fire and 2nd fire, a 3 axis joystick and throttle are not enough to satisfy all the major keybindings because the user can't determine how they wish the game to act and the developer thinks you need separate keybindings that do the same basic things.

In case the developer reads this, the following changes are needed.
1. Allow your user to select any keybinding they wish and alternate keybindings. if you want warn about conflicts, but don't make it a hard rule.
2. Allow the customer to chose if a keybinding is a switch (push once for on, push it again for off; in fact this should be the default it's not like you have to hold down the ""r"" key to reload)
3. Allow controller customization.

Remember that some of your customers may have disabilities.",1707793013,1707793013,False,5,2,0.547465920448303223,0,True,False,False

It is exceptionally two-dimensional in its characters and plot, being neither here nor there, where it could choose to embrace the Nazi shooter genre like Wolfenstein, or try be a serious historical game, but kinda sits randomly in the middle making it just feel like a boring fictional story.  

Voice acting and general sound:  This maybe a personal thing due to my equipment, but the sound effects in this game are horrible, and the voice acting honestly quite average.  Possibly too its the artistic styling, but I almost hate hearing my character speak as its painfully bad, it sounds like a Steven Seagal film.   

Gameplay:  Sniper Elite has always been a bit ironically named, this one feels even more so like the Sniper element is gone, where in previous ones I felt like I was constantly trying to mask my shots and find vantage points, this one feels like I could just walk it with the SMG even on the harder settings.  There are more items etc than in previous games, but I feel like they have added little to the game.  

Price:  Come on guys, its 7 years old.  

Its an enjoyable game when it runs right, and the environment is beautiful like most Sniper Elite games, but its firmly a ""buy when its on sale"" game.",1707545741,1707545741,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

My only interest in the series was from my hunger to play something in the WW2 shooter genre; a sub-genre that used to dominate the 2000s that is pretty much all but dead in current year. I picked it up on sale, along with all of the DLC content, for a total less than $15. After finally finishing the base game and all the expansion missions, I have to say that I'm very impressed.

Aesthetic: The graphics look great, I especially love the attention to detail when it comes to the villages and buildings in general. A lot of care went into making these set pieces feel lived in (despite the lack of actual civilians). Each level plays out in an open world setting, giving you the freedom to do side quests, get collectibles, and strategically take out the enemy at your own pace. Some of these levels are pretty huge for being mini-open worlds. Seriously, if you took one and tripled the size, you could easily fit an entire game in it. The sheer amount of mini-open worlds keeps the game feeling fresh at pretty much all times.

Sound: Very classical, run of the mill, World War 2 sounding soundtrack. Not that this is a bad thing, but often times I kept the music muted and listened to podcasts or other music while playing. The voice acting is great for what it is. The protagonist sounds like your typical Nazi killing superhero that you'd expect in these sorts of games. There's also a pretty cool feature where different environmental events would completely drown out the ambiance. For example, you can use a plane taking off from a nearby runway to mask the sound long enough for you to get a stealth kill or two without being heard.

Gameplay: This is where the game shines the brightest, although the gameplay loop does get repetitive after a while. You can tell they tried their best to make the AI believable, but like every other stealth game I've played, they're kind of dumb and predictable. Some times they will stack up and get aggressive, and other times they just kind of wander around like the AI in Metal Gear Solid 2/3. 

You have your classic XP system, with a lot of weapons, traits, and inventory items to unlock. However, there are quite a few items hidden behind a paywall (not an issue if you get the season pass). 

The controls are flawless and feel completely natural. Character movement and response is exactly what I wanted it to be. There is a climbing element to it, but it's a little more realistic. You won't be climbing walls and jumping from roof to roof like in Assassin's Creed. The stealth kills are extremely satisfying, as there are a variety of ways to take out each enemy. The violence reminds me of those bone breaking moves you can do in Mortal Kombat. Time slows down, the enemy goes X-Ray vision, and you watch the bullet slowly pierce their eyeball and blow off the top of their skull. Or you can blow our their lung, neck, heart, intestines, kidneys, and even their nuts. Yes, time slowly down while you watch a guy's testicle slowly explode from a sniper round.

You also can use decoys, mines, bouncing betties, TNT, stick grenades, silencers, and can even call in indirect fire. The rifle/secondary weapon/pistol variety is also extremely satisfying and features all of the time era's greatest hits.

DLC: I was honestly annoyed at the paywall existing for some of the weapons. Even if it didn't effect me because of my season pass, it was still annoying to know it was there. That being said, the four extra missions easily make it worth it alone. 

Like the base game, all four missions exist in varied mini-open worlds. Each one having plenty of side objectives and side content, similar to the base game. I want to say I got about 8-10 hours out of all four missions, with the least impressive one being the Hitler one. I beat that in about 30 minutes or so. I killed a couple of troops, killed Hitler, killed a couple more troops, then sprinted for the exit site with machine gun fire spraying at me like an Indiana Jones scene. Kinda mindless. However, the other three missions were all very fun though, worth the price, and kept me busy for a while. 

Replayability: This is easily one of the most fun games I've ever played. Having just finished the campaign and expansions, I am definitely excited to revisit this game in the future and try again on harder difficulties. I would guess that it's probably good for two or three playthroughs tops, when all is said and done.

Solid 9/10 game. If you get this on sale, you'll be getting a ton of content for a very reasonable price. I also highly recommend getting the season pass to get the full experience.",1707515408,1707515408,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Everyone can implement their own strategies and order of doing things which adds some player expression and replayability. With that being said, I completed all of the achievements in this game and playing on the hardest difficulty feels like a totally different and less enjoyable game in my opinion. There's nothing drastically wrong with it but stealth in this game is very basic and playing yet another ""don't stand in their cone of vision!"" game is not that special. Maybe the higher difficulties are super fun for enthusiasts or purists of certain styles of gameplay but for me a bit more of a casual approach is the best. Overall it's a fun game and I'd recommend it if you enjoy third person stealth and sniping type games and even more so if you have a friend to play with but the harder difficulties are boring to me.

Personal recommendation: Play Authentic or authentic plus the first time through the campaign.

Authentic difficulty really makes you use more of the map and mechanics of the game that you otherwise don't need on easier modes.

The brutal kill shots are still a thing. In this game you play as a sniper who needs to infiltrate bases and your means of doing so mainly requires you to snipe your way through groups of enemies. Sometimes you can destroy vehicles by shooting out their gas tanks, but the main thing that makes this game cool is it's x-ray bullet time effect that shows your sniper bullet pass through the enemy's vital organs and it shows them being ruptured in slow motion. This is gratifying when you pull of a nice clean heart shot. It's even more satisfying when you shoot someone in the nuts and you see the testicle get ruptured. lol.

If you like brute force shooting, you'll probably enjoy the game. If you prefer realism over fun gameplay, you'll enjoy the game.

To be fair, it's not much different to the previous games, just don't expect improvements.

Various small things I disliked that made the overall experience bad:
- Talking to various NPCs to get a briefing on each mission
- Killing enemies with other means is easier than killing them with a sniper, so much easier that they had to add aim assist to the snipers. Especially for stealth, you almost can't snipe in the game.
- Collectibles
- More upgrades than you can eat
- This stupid dancing every time I try to prune is still here",1705227326,1705227326,False,1,1,0.501193344593048096,0,True,False,False

Pros:
+ Gun selection and utilities:
Moderate amount of gun in the arsenal, each of them is unique and have their own pros and cons. Not only that, you can carry up to three different firearms and some other items such as medkits, wire trap, grenades that can be used creatively by the player.

+ support multiplayer:
 I haven‚Äôt try it out cause I couldn‚Äôt get my friends to buy it. But look for others player‚Äôs video, it‚Äôs certainly help lengthen the game time.

+ bullet ballistics:
Within difficulty selection, you can choose to play with ‚Äùrealistic‚Äù bullet physic where the winds and air resistance will affect your bullet trajectory and give you a more authentic experience.

+ Multiple missions and replayability:
 The missions while lack in numbers, made a great job in their designs. This is including the buildings, environments and the backgrounds.
 You can go back to any mission and play it out as many different ways as you can think of. Either blowing someone up of with a landmine or trick them running into a wire trap, it‚Äôs your call.

+ Multiple modes:
There are multiple game mode beside campaign such as cooperative mode and wave survival. 

Cons:
+ Story is not that interesting. (No spoiler)

+ Junky movements:
I know this is a sniping game where you should stay at one spot and sometimes move to other but if you play like a maniac with a shotgun or a smg like me, it‚Äôs just clunky when you stay near an obstacle. Some small rock that looks like can be climbed on will stop you or even make you stuck entirely.

Overall, 9.5/10. A solid game, worth every cents.

Def a chill experience. You go from point to point, do sniping. Occasionally you have to call of duty your way through, but that's okay

Snipping by itself is fun as balls. I didn't not expect it to be that cool. Just take a breath, aim, and watch a glorified , slow-mo and ex-ray of destruction of enemy balls with your bullet. Didn't get old all the way to the end

Now the story is god fucking damn forgettable. I forgot that the stories in video game were used to be that blank. Whatever, it kinda ends on all of the sudden, but feel free to skip the cutscenes.

Also I like the ww2 setting so that's a win.

All things considered, fun game and I can see myself playing other entries and games like that. It's a game that you should give it a try and see if it's your cup of tea.

Ingredients:

6 tablespoons unsalted butter

1/2 cup white sugar

1/2 cup brown sugar

1/4 cup water

1/4 teaspoon cinnamon

1 pinch salt

5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced

1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).

Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.

Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.

Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.

Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.

Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.

As I had only played v2 before and only a slight amount of time on part 3 on the Xbox 360. Now I finally bought it. (I bought 3 as well but went for a refund on that - see my review on that one to know why). It's slightly over 5 years old now this game. But it still works/looks good.

So slightly over 3 hours now into this game. And only in my 2nd (real) mission so far. The AI really looks out for the fellow AI. When someone's suddenly missing, they will come look. A lot of tough opponents (snipers, boats, etc.). And a lot of ways to kill the enemy. 

Till so far I like what I see - in this way overdue playtrough of the final game. I instantly bought the whole package. So with the DLC and everything incl. Just to have the whole thing. I still need to play those DLC missions. And I still need to continue like most of the missions - as I'm just on mission 2 now. Further more I like the fact that you now have somewhat of free choice where to go first. Instead of a real linniar experience in the earlier parts of this franchise.

Now, SE4 is great, which doesn't mean the movement is perfect now- on the contrary, it's fine now but still leaves a lot to be desired and that's the great thing about this series, you know when you've perfected a certain formula you keep on wondering there's no way this series can be improved- the subsequent sequels feel kinda stale. But you can just play SE4, enjoy it immensely and feel it in your bones the huge potential this series has. This series has still hasn't peaked yet, which gives me a lot of hope for it's future.
The gunplay is great here- Rifles are great, as you'd expect from a SE game; using pistol is also really satisfying and made close quarter stealth so much fun; and the smgs- well they aren't the most accurate but I think that's intentional and you can upgrade them to have better handling and accuracy.
Now the major change from previous SE games is that unlike previous titles which were very linear, SE4 is more openworld type- not completely but each mission is set on a pretty big area and has multiple objectives which you can tackle in any way you want. This is a great welcome change. Each mission can take around 1hr or more depending on your playstyle. It took me around 18 hrs to get through the main campaign which had 8 missions (which were all mostly great). I've yet to do the DLCs but I've heard they're pretty good.
There are many more good things to say about SE4 but I'd like to list out what I think needs improvement.
- Context sensitive jumps, you can't grab small ledges in some cases, you can climb some pipes other times you can't. It's all very inconsistent and reminded me of how great Splinter Cell did these things. This is related to movement.
- Stealth is good, but can definitely be much better. Sometimes enemies can spot you from 200m, sometimes they can't see you right in front of them. They also act pretty dumb when they see a dead body. But I definitely like the specific actions and details.
- Weapon upgrade system. It's good that you're making sure the player actually uses the gun to upgrade them but it's a big grind. Like I played the entire campaign and mastered only the silenced pistol, and did a few upgrades for 2 riles and a smg. Killing 100 soldiers only after tagging them is not fun and takes a lot of time. I wish more thought was put behind this.
- Story. I don't think anyone really cares for the story in SE, and this is the last thing I would look for as an improvement in future titles. But it can be done.

These were some of the big issues I had with the game. But even so, I had so much more fun than I had expected. For the price I paid, SE4 IS really sweet. There's not many games in this genre so it also scratches a particular itch. And you know what- there's a small series called FarCry, it's made by a realtively small indie studio called Ubisoft. I think they can learn a thing or two about sniping, elevation, verticality and stuff.
In conclusion, SE4 is pretty good. 8.5/10",1703704621,1703704621,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

What I like is the bullet drop mechanics, wind, gravity, etc,,,
What I DON'T like is when it doesn't work how it should !!!

You have indicators that tell you at what distance your bullet drops.
For every 100 meters there's a indicator.
So when my enemy is 125 meters from me, I assume it's between the 100 meter and the 200 meter indicator.

So when I start shooting like my sniper rifle is a machine gun, and I'll keep missing my target.
I activate the aim assist to see where I should be aiming.
I was very suprised to see that the indicator was between 0 and 100 meters.
And NOT between 100 and 200 meters.

How can this be?
Something in this game doesn't work properly..
I don't want to,, but in order to play this game you must use aim assist indicator.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and we adopted our son together. Both are now 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I felt lost and unhappy. I was self-destructive. One day, I was so angry with everything spiraling out of control that I punched a concrete wall in a moment of overwhelming emotion. This resulted in breaking my fifth metacarpal in my right hand‚Äîthe hand I worked with, played games with, and used to carry my children to bed‚Äîthe hand I desperately needed to ensure I could continue providing.

Upon learning the severity of the self-inflicted damage, I became almost suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man, with no history of depression or anxiety. I had never experienced anger outbursts, nor was I the type to break down and cry, but I was in a tough situation that truly prevented me from seeing the light on the other side.

With nothing better to do, I looked for a game I could play WITH ONE HAND while recovering. Somehow, I stumbled upon this game and read some of the comments. I decided it was worth a try... I must admit I didn't beat the game, nor did I play as much as some of you. In fact, I may have played this game for only a day or two. That being said, after doing so, I had a new joy and hope for life. I managed to leave behind the pain and suffering that had been thrust upon me. I could experience the joy and happiness of other people. I relaxed for 5 ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• minutes listening to this music, long enough to realize that I would be okay.

After realizing this, I turned off the game and went back to work. My hand hurt a lot, but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so sorry for myself and became the father I needed to be at that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving like.

Today, I am close friends with the mother of my children. We don't fight, argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents and friends.

Now I have 3 children. My third child is, wait, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my separation, and we just unexpectedly stumbled into each other's lives. We have been dating for a year and are very happy together.

Moral of the story: you never know what life has in store for you, and if I had given up when all odds were against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

I hope to get around to finishing the DLC missions very soon, but I don't expect my review to change, that is... I really love this game! I have already bought SE5, because I know I will like it... except for the non-lethal ammo, which I will try to play around.

I play on Steam Deck with good graphics and framerate settings, and profit from always-on gyro controls for precise aiming. Both on the Switch and the Deck, I have played through all levels on ""Authentic (Hardcore)"" mode, then ""Authentic Plus"" mode [up to DLC 2 on the Deck]. I have never played on one of the easier modes, because I feel like the various aim-assisting features are not consistent with a game that has ""sniper"" in the title. I have Kill Cam (or whatever it's called) turned off, because I'm there for stealth and sniping, not an action film or FPS experience. That being said, when it all goes to hell and I aggro a load of enemies, I do get that experience too! It always feels great to make a good long shot by leading a running enemy while compensating for wind and distance. There is good variety in the weapons, even if there are some that are clearly better or worse than others, and it is pleasant to upgrade your preferred weapons over time.

One thing that stands out for me about SE4 is how well it recreates the locations. I doubt that any other game evokes 1940s Italy as well as this*. You can [i]smell[/i] the interiors in the maze of houses at Bitanti. You can [i]smell[/i] the oil and the sea in the vast structure outside the sub pen in the first DLC mission.
*Like, I have not witnessed 1940s Italy in person, but I have been to Italy a few times, to many military museums, on high mountains, in maritime installations, inside period ships, and have perused countless antique and vintage shops; the landscapes and buildings in the game viscerally evoke the Mediterranean, and the interior scenes evoke the smell of real period paraphenalia and furniture.

Negative aspects of the game are... I can only think of occasional enemy AI glitches and predictatability. Maybe the interior part of the last level of the campaign does not really fit with the rest of the game, and the last ""enemy"" that you fight does not fit with the playstyle of any other part of the game. And of course bullet drop and windage are exaggerated because of the technical limitations of a computer simulation, but they are consistent within the game, so this is not really a negative.

I paid ‚Ç¨9 on sale for the complete version of the game, which is already excellent value, without having yet played the last DLC missions.",1702000667,1702000667,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

The game's protagonist, Karl Fairburne, once again takes center stage with his sniper expertise, and the improvements to the ballistics system are nothing short of impressive. The satisfying bullet physics, coupled with the iconic X-ray kill cam, deliver an unparalleled sense of accomplishment with each perfectly executed shot. The level of realism adds an extra layer of immersion, making every engagement a unique and pulse-pounding experience.

The open-world approach in Sniper Elite 4 enhances the overall gameplay experience. The expansive maps encourage exploration and strategic planning, allowing players to choose their preferred playstyle. Whether you prefer the stealthy approach, silently eliminating enemies one by one, or opting for a more action-packed assault, the game accommodates a variety of playstyles, providing a sense of freedom and replayability.

In conclusion, Sniper Elite 4 is a triumph in the realm of tactical shooters. Its combination of stunning visuals, refined gameplay mechanics, and historical authenticity make it a must-play for fans of the genre. Whether you're a seasoned sniper or a newcomer to the series, Sniper Elite 4 offers an exhilarating and satisfying experience that will keep you coming back for more.

* After a quick-save, the environment state can be reloaded, causing bodies and alarms to disappear.
* Inconsistent enemy vision: sometimes they can spot you based on a single pixel, triggering an alarm, while other times you can run right past them unnoticed.
* There is no option for ""full stealth."" For example, you are required to detonate the guns instead of disabling them quietly; there is no non-explosive alternative.
* Poor level design: In certain cases, there is only one entrance to a building, even for non-primary targets.
* Broken patrol routes: Enemies can randomly change patrol routes and/or have zero blind windows for a stealthy approach.
* You can't apply skins to certain weapons.

[h1]Stealth and Action[/h1]

If you're into stealth games, this is the game for you.

The AI in this game is amazingly well done. You honestly feel like you're in a real world. The game really encourages you to think about what you're going to do before you do it. Yeah, you can try to kill everyone and if you just want to go in there blasting the place apart, by and large you can do it, but if you want to stealth, you can do that too. I played scenarios where I did most of the mission without killing anyone. It was heartpounding fun to slip in between patrols, throw rocks to lead guards away from doors I needed to get into, leaving traps in remote locations to be set off to draw enemies away from my location. All of it fun and seemed very legit.

Remember how you'd come up on 5 guys, and you'd throw rocks to pull them one at a time to your location and kill them all? Yeah, well here is the bad news. These boys have learned to count. When one of their group goes missing, they notice and start looking for him. Yeah, enjoy that.

Storyline was good. Held together by a fairly thin thread it will get you through, but that's about it. Mostly this game is about tactical scenarios that you need to solve.

Which brings me to a very, very cool part of the game. Realistic mode. They decided to put in a realistic mode in the game. All your superpowers are basically gone. No minimap, no detailed info on the camp, no automatic gun site adjustment for distance and wind. All gone. All I can say is good luck. Be prepared for many, many heart pounding moments.

Multiplayer also offers some added fun although I did not play much of that. Would have preferred if there was an option to limit the sniper role to one (perhaps random) player per side rather than having squads of snipers which can sometimes result in a lot of camping and makes for a boring match. 

An amazing game if you're into stealth games!",1640731779,1700999415,True,1,0,0.519650638103485107,0,True,False,False

What I don't like is that it's near impossible to see where your shots go, making it hard to get a feeling for your weapon and the fact that the game offers you either too much help, with a minimap that shows enemies (making it very easy to avoid them) and aim assist (which you can turn off on it's own), or none at all: The second hardest difficulty has all the help, the hardest one doesn't even show your position on the map or where the objectives are.",1700957157,1700957157,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[h1]A. NON-EXHAUSTIVE LIST OF BUGS[/h1]
[b]1. [/b] Survival mode > map set > Loss of [i]Binocular Check[/i] (list the contents of dead enemy soldiers with binoculars) in survival mode. The loss of this feature varies between the end of wave 8 or the beginning, 9 or 10 at the most.

[b]2.1 [/b] Survival mode > map [i]Urban[/i] > [i]The Wall Bug[/i] which is present at various points in the map: a soldier gets stuck and treads water.
[list]
[*] Balcony next to the terrace of the ""radio house"" (because a radio is present in this house in Campaign mode). Some calls it : ""German house"" or ""Propaganda house"" but it's a wrong name, Propaganda Miniseter's house in Campain mode is Est side, opposite to his radio house.
[*] Radio house > under the stairs, in the wall.
[*] Base / Post Command area #2, south wall side > Under the stone staircase.
[*] [i]Square Tower[/i] (between Bases / Post Command #1 and #3) > in the first floor walls.
[/list]
There are others in this map, which is the one with the most bugs.

When they're not visible, they can't be killed with primary or secondary weapons. To kill them, you must use one of the following: 
[list]
[*] Sticky grenades,
[*] TNT with timer, 
[*] Flar in grouped mode (Rocket to request grouped or ungrouped artillery fire),
[*] Panzerfaust.
[/list]

[b]2.2 [/b] Survival mode > Always on map [i]Urban[/i] > [i]The Stepping bug[/i] :
[list]
[*] Maison de la radio > on the terrace, against the south wall > a soldier walks in place against the low wall. He frees himself as soon as he receives an enemy shot that misses or only wounds him.
[/list]

[b]3. [/b] Survival mode > Facility map > Vehicule's Bug ;
[list]
[*] Most often found on troop transporters, but also on AB-41s, which can remain levitating, like Star Wars ships, or straddling the terrain.
[/list]

[h1]B. BONUS #1[/h1]
The uninitiated may think it's cheating, but it's really just a bonus ([b]Easter Egg[/b]) from the game's original developers: cross the red lines to play, not out of the game, but out of the map (Map).
As far as I know, there are 3 different moves to make, which are a set of key combinations for crossing red lines:
- Crouch + aim: doesn't allow you to cross all the lines, especially in front of certain staircases, it doesn't work.
- Crouch + cable mine: does not allow you to cross all the lines, especially in front of certain staircases, it doesn't work.
- Run + crouch + aim: works everywhere.

Playing in Authentic Plus mode only, it's a real treat, spicing up the difficulty level to its maximum in Survival mode. You need a team strategy, and a mastery of defense strategies (mines, ambushes, etc.).
The best thing is to have at least two players outside map, so you can share areas and help each other out if need be.

It's much more difficult to play outside maps, especially as each map has its own rules and limits: they all differ in terms of the extent that can be explored and used, otherwise you'll fall through the floor, into a black hole and die.


[h1]C. BONUS #2[/h1]
Survival Mode > map [i]Facility[/i] ([i]Center[/i]). In addition to bonus #1, in this map only, another special move performed at a single specific location allows you to go above the entire complex (bunker, hills, etc.) above Base / Post Command #1. Particularly in the steel marine observation turret, where bullets from enemy soldiers only ricochet and cannot pass through the steel dome.
This is the only map with a #2 bonus.  The ""Marina"" map also features a different movement for crossing red lines, but only functional in one place: the wooden house, via the small secondary room. This is of no use once you've mastered the general movement to cross all the red lines.


[h1]D. INTERACTIVITY BETWEEN PLAYERS[/h1]
It is not possible to exchange material between players during a map, with the exception of :
[list]
[*] TNT (Simply throw it on the ground for the other player to pick it up, as with other equipment).
[*] Mines S,
[*] Cable mines / Trip mines,
[*] Flat / anti-tank mines.
[/list]

But it's not possible to exchange: 
[list]
[*] Weapons that are part of each player's basic equipment,
[*] Ammunition,
[*] Medical kits and bandages,
[*] Grenades,
[*] Flar (rocket to request grouped or ungrouped artillery fire).
[/list]


[h1]E. MY OPINION[/h1]
A game that doesn't tire (with a few temporal pauses since its release in February 2017) in Survival mode, because the campaign mode and its 4 DLC, after a few hundred or some thousand hours of play, we've come full circle, and in fewer hours than that. It's all about the team, the teammates who radically change the gameplay experience in Survival mode.

To this end, this game cannot be appreciated or mastered without a good headset: sound is the essential component for hearing where enemies are coming from and what kind of noise they are making, how many of them there are, even what type of soldier they are, and where they are coming from and/or going.

The microphone allows you to synchronize quickly and in real time the exact position of snipers, vehicles, troops, and the death or destruction of all this little world.",1660924510,1700934483,True,2,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False

This one the game machanics are great and the maps bigger which means you have more room to move.

There should be  more missions!

I played this for only 1.4 hours and thank f**k it wasn't any longer otherwise I couldn't have refunded this pile of piss!

The game is about as easy as wearing a hat and that's on EVERY difficulty level even with EVERY assist feature OFF!

I swear whoever it was who programmed these Germans has put them on a five second delay because by the time an enemy loads a weapon I've already riddled the fool full of holes.

The apposing German force may as well be heavily armed preschool children due to the fact they can't shoot a firearm to save their lives and can't even remotely pose a challenge.
Meanwhile you can just sprint around the map like a mad man who kills like it's nothing.

The actual game environment itself looks beautiful but it means nothing when it's an environment in a garbage game such as this one.
Sniper Elite 4 is all just smoke and mirrors with nothing but flashy killing animations and it's vast environments and I certainly want more than that in a game.

I can safely conclude that Sniper Elite 4 is definitely NOT WORTH the money even if it's on special and that's saying something!",1651224263,1700483740,False,4,1,0.390094369649887085,0,True,False,False

Not being able to heal yourself once your are bleeding out with bandages and medkits does not seem realistic as you can still shoot at enemies while bleeding out.

Having completed Sniper Elite 4 on solo and then Sniper Elite 5 on solo and then coming back to play Sniper Elite 4 multiplayer, it adds a whole new dimension as real players are not as predictable. Cannot wait until Sniper Elite 6! For those who like Division or Ghost Recon, this game challenges you more by not getting hit in the first place or face dire consequences more often. There are no random ammo boxes laid out along the way forcing you to kill for most everything you need once your basic starting supplies run out.

It is fun for what it is, you are an overpowered WW2 sniper who also can use every other gun still destroy most enemies if you have patience.  This is a game that I enjoyed the campaign, but will probably never play through a second time.  It is worth probably 15-20 dollars TOPS, but for a sale price of much cheaper than that, its a fun game.  I never played the multiplayer, just the campaign.  
Beware, this game does take some patience, you can go in and run-and-gun, but you will have to run away and hide and pick off enemies after they become alerted.  I played the next one in the series after this one and that was essentially the same game with some improved environments and enemies. 
The missions always give you a similar cue of things to do, but switch up the way it wants it done (stealth, poison, blowing up, etc.)  Its kind of like a WW2 Hitman game, but with little/no blending in with crowds.

Good game if you like WW2 setting, have patience, and want to blow stuff up (including Nazi testicles.)",1699811502,1699811502,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The brown color palette, the cardboard cutout of a skybox, the small yet detailed levels and the lifeless cold eyes of the speaking characters.

A good number of levels, primary and secondary objectives, collectibles, challenges, unlockables, weapons, tools, etc.  You can play the game as stealthily or as loudly as you like.  The big gimmick, obviously, is the sniping.  The difficulty for your character's stats, enemies and aiming can be customized.  At its hardest, sniping is much more complex than in other games.  There's distance, wind, heartbeat, sound masking, etc.  It will take a lot of time to get used to.  Otherwise, you can tell the game to make sniping as simple as point-and-click.

Pretty standard WWII fantasy story.  Nothing special, but not bad either.  The main character is pretty likable; typical hardened Allied soldier.

You can customize up to four separate loadouts, depending on the weapons and tools you've unlocked.  There are primary, secondary and sidearm weapons, all of which have different challenges to unlock upgrades and skins.  There are other tools you can add to your loadout, such as medkits, grenades, traps, etc.  There are also unlockable skins/characters.  I call them skins because all story dialogue is still the main character's, even if you use a woman.

The vast majority of the game's hours will be spent getting collectibles, completing challenges, mastering weapons and earning achievements.  For a casual gamer, this is no big deal.

Completionists, however, beware.  Not only do the challenges and achievements range from simple to extremely difficult, a great deal of them depend on co-op or multiplayer.  There are only two co-op levels and they cannot be played solo.  I tried starting a co-op game by myself and it proactively prevented me because I was the only one in the lobby.  Normally, I don't care about such a thing, but a couple achievements require you to get all collectibles and beat all challenges, including the co-op ones.  This, along with the fact that this game's multiplayer servers are basically barren by now, you will likely never truly 100% this game.

I say this to developers in a lot of reviews:  I should not have to sell your game to my friends or family just to fully complete it.  Nor should I have to beg total strangers on Steam forums to play with me.  That's some serious bullcrap and you should feel bad for your stupid decisions.

Despite these easily overlooked flaws, I recommend this game to anyone who enjoys action shooters.",1699504327,1699504327,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

You will easily alert all enemies in a nearby area, but as long as you keep relocating,  smartly place traps, and use environmental hazards to your advantage, you will keep enemies clueless about your position, and thanks to a lot of tools to choose from, you can easily realize your ultimate predator power fantasy.

I'm not sure why they tried to have a meaningful story. It tries too hard and accomplishes nothing, and some of the dialog and voice acting is pretty bad despite only having a handful of cutscenes. The ascent there trying to do comes off as very goofy. Usually i wouldn't mind but again it takes itself too seriously so its hard to laugh at.    

Honestly the SE formula has gotten pretty stale there not doing enough to change things up, so after playing for about an hour i decided to rush through the game as fast as a could and i had more fun than i did playing normally. After doing this i  realised you could realistically beat the game in a stupidly quick time. I'm convinced you can easily beat this game if you play on the easiest difficulty and only do the main missions you can beat the game in under 2 hours pretty easily and get a refund. It uses side missions to artificially pad out the game, most of them are identical to the main quest objectives. Find this dude, kill another, find a document, things like that. It doesn't affect the story in anyway, you just get more XP. Not like it matters tho you unlock all the guns at level 5 anyway, apart from the the DLC weapons witch i'm 100% not gonna pay for.   

This is probably going to be the last SE game i play, its gotten so repetitive over the years. I might come back if they do something interesting in the future but i doubt that will happen anytime soon.

[b]Spoiler warning. [/b]

In the quickest way I can say it, it's that [b]Sniper Elite 4 doesn't exceed in anything nor fail at anything.[/b] If you want a fun sniper game for a few hours with a NOT that interesting story and not hardcore - realistic sniping, you should definitely consider getting this, [i]albeit at a good sale, because I don't think paying the full price tag is a smart choice here.[/i]

Now, to get a little in depth, let's talk about some important points briefly, to get an understanding of the place of this game and how you should be treating it:

[b]I. First of all, story.[/b] Well.. I can't really say it's good. In fact, it's really not good, but for what it is, it does the job. You as the gamer, are really playing SE4 for the exciting stealth sniping action. Story is set in Italy in the year of 1943 - directly tying to it's prequel (or predecessor) - Sniper Elite 3. In short, the story is about the nazis making a new super weapon that no one really know what is, but one thing the americans know [spoiler](yes obviously you play as an american ally don't be surprised it's one of those stories)[/spoiler], that it needs to be destroyed from german hands before they can use it. Original, I know. You shouldn't take the campaign too seriously, so you don't get disappointed.

[b]II. Gameplay (and level design) [/b] is very easy to understand, but hard(er) to master. You have loads of stuff to play with. From different kinds of traps to rocket launchers, flare guns, airstrikes, and a lot of other fun stuff. In this case, you will never really get tired and say that the selection is poor.

[b]III. Gunplay: [/b] Sniping, being the main focus of the game, feels great. It's snappy, responsive and all that good stuff. The puncture camera is a good addition as in any Sniper Elite game, but you get tired of it the more you play. While sniping is great, sadly thats not the case with other weapons - ARs, pistols and such weapons don't have ""first-person aiming"" but rather just the crosshair getting smaller. Which means you can have a perfectly lined shot with an assault rifle only to shoot it and miss so badly that you don't really wanna touch assault rifles again. The guns are very unpredictable where they shoot and it is rather off-putting, but this gun mechanic was seen in the former games also.

[b]IV. Graphics:[/b] simply said - spectacular. For being a game from 2017, it really doesn't show it's age. Every level starts with a Wow! moment, where you think you're looking at an image from real life. Graphics in SE4 are very good and I find it being a strong point, especially with great colors and great image of Italy in 1940s.

[b]V. Characters:[/b] Now this is something that will be debatable. Characters that we interact with throughout the story are niche, but nice. You never want to hate any of your allies, because they never tell you to go do stupid crap. They are quite likeable, even though we don't get to really know them very deeply. There is one thing that was strange with all characters, being the voice acting. I have noticed this trend in a few other Sniping related games and I never get it. Voice acting is very off - lifeless, hard on the ears, absolutely not realistic, very bass heavy and just not good sounding on the ears. Seems like the resources for SE4's voice acting werent very big. It's a thing that maybe not many people will really care about, but it is something to note.

[b]DLC content: [/b] I think that too much content is restricted behind paid DLC. The base game does offer a good selection of weaponry, but if you look at it for a little longer, you'll see that there are more DLC weapons than base game weapons. DLC missions on the other hand are good, and definitely worth buying if you just wanna squeeze that little more fun from this game.

[b]To sumarize, Sniper Elite 4 is a good package of fun. [/b] BUT. It has one huge flaw, that I would consider to be really bad if I wouldn't mention it: [b]BAD level design.[/b] It is made in such way, that you have to either - have too much time on your hands to wait for the AI to relocate, or make a stupid trap in the lowest of bushes (where enemies don't apparently see you even though you can be -realistically said- seen from a mile away), where 10 soldiers with go and die, while making them come to you with hearing a sound from throwing a stone, in many cases they don't because you've alerted them already and they are literally GLUED to their position. Which leads to... going loud in many more cases than one would like. I found that there are not enough secret passageways or off-routes to plan a good sniper attack. Well of course, you do have many tools at hand with you, but if you JUST wanna try to snipe of a camp of guys stealthly, it almost never works out because THE ONE THING THEIR AI KNOWS TOO WELL IS FINDING DEAD BODIES. It gets frustrating after a while when you're progressing through the campaign missions. 

[b]My opinion: [/b] Likeable, but not memorable. It doesn't do anything differently than other Sniper Elite games, but for some, it may be a good thing. As I've said before, it's a good bit of fun but NOT for full price. If you enjoy sniping games and the Sniper Elite franchise as a whole, you will like this one also, but it won't be a breathtaking experience. You'll want to finish it, but you'll be relieved that it ended rather than wanting to replay it again.

Stealth was not a thing originally, I tried it at the start, but it wasn't as I expected from other stealth games. It's still possible somewhat, but more limiting slower, and less deadly. So I'll start stealth, until the first resistance and just roll loud, John Wick Revolver.


The big con of this game, is playing on 'authentic' removes HUD, and with it map objectives. That's a real pain, because every mission ended with the last 20mins me sprinting around the empty murdered base trying to find the objective interactions. They could of added markers on the map and still been realistic!  

So instead i guess they assume you have played on normal difficulty first to learn the map objectives, or look it up online like it did for my play-through.

highly recommend for shooters, and people who like to calculate the shot. Haven't even played the 2 player coop, im sure thats even better. and adds a little more content re-playability. There are only 10 missions, with 5 additional dlc missions, I averaged 2 hours a mission on first play-though on 2nd hardest difficulty.  Now I did not do it as a completionist, if you love 100% a game, this has a lot to do on the maps, and if you are the type to keep playing a level to memorize it, and just repeatdly like taking npc out, you will enjoy this.

edit after 30hrs:

I tried multiplayer for a few rounds of CTF, it works well. Probably player count is low though. We had a 2v2.

A strange bug occurred to me, when I started the game, some videos kept playing in the background and the only way to fix it was to wipe the videos folder, except those that play directly before a map. (create new folder in Steam\steamapps\common\Sniper Elite 4\FMV and move everything into that)

For completitionists, replayability with the challenges and weapon masteries is surprisingly great, there are Steam achievements as well. Some challenges require you to be extremely stealthy, others specifically ask for a shotgun, always able to spice up your next 1-2 hours in a different way.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.

Killcam always great.
Some new mechanics.

I bought it again last month, and after 17 hours, I can say I was right the first time. For this review's context, I beat the game on hard mode and replayed on easy.

I hate how easy Easy Mode is. I get it's called easy but I was expecting *some* challenge. The suppressed sniper rifle they hand you makes the entire game so trivial. You can make some of the stupidest plays ever and the enemies won't bat an eye at you. You can run up to someone while they're in aggressive mode, go for a takedown, and not take a single point of damage.

The lack of ""bosses"" also stings. In SE3, you have to take down a tank or 2 to clear the level, but all the tanks here are optional to destroy. The only real ""boss"" is at the end, where all you have to do is fire your rifle 4-6 times without any sense of a threat from a single enemy.

I do think the weapon upgrade system was pretty neat, but the lack of other weapons really hurt. The only real weapons you can choose from are the ones you get at the start of the game, and ones you can take from German soldiers. Let me choose my gun in the menu!

I did however like the all the new mechanics. Climbing horizontally across and dropping down from ladders actually gave them a major use, unlike those in SE3 where they could've just put stairs. I also liked how you have to kill a tank's driver and gunner before being able to rig an explosive to destroy it, instead of just repeatedly chucking explosives at it. 

All in all, this game could've been a lot better, but did add a few new features. My word isn't gospel by any means, you decide if this game lives up to SE3.",1691985573,1691985573,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I enjoyed killing Adolf Hitler by sniping a weight support at the U-boat repair dock which made the U-boat fall and crush him. The DLC is very good. Things I didn't enjoy were that 80% of the buildings are static & non-functional servicing no purpose but to make the map into a maze for cosmetic purposes only. This reduced game play immersion especially on the Giovi Fiornini Mansion mission. I played the game for only using the best weapons and didn't fancy using any of the ones of lower quality. Each map can take multiple hours to complete if you're a completionist which is a good thing. The AI behavior is very predictable after a while even on the Hard and Authentic settings. I don't plan to replay this game anytime soon since I consider it as a 'one and done' type of game.

After the disappointment of SE3, this is a deep breath of fresh, cordite-scented air. Big, expansive levels, lots of sight lines, elevation changes... Go close-quarters or long-distance, whichever you're feeling at the moment. Some nice cinematic moments, and little bits of well-constrained storytelling at the beginning of each mission.
The cover system isn't the greatest, but it serves. You have to spend about twice as long finessing yourself into position as you should.
Enemy AI is fine - they still don't really understand height differences, which can make for some very funny situations, but they can put up a decent fight on Sniper Elite difficulty. On the higher difficulties they're quite deadly.
The gun upgrade challenges are kind of silly, but you don't need them at all, every gun is at least competent in its base form - and you're going to end up using the Welrod and your rifle in 99% of cases anyway.
Make no mistake - this game is not difficult, even on Hard (Sniper Elite) difficulty - but it is very enjoyable. It's a smile-inducing romp around Italy, stacking fascist corpses of every nationality like firewood in your wake, finishing with some good old-fashioned Wunderwaffe sabotage.

This game has left me completely awestruck with its immersive gameplay, stunning visuals, and engaging storyline.

From the very beginning, I was captivated by the breathtaking environments and attention to detail. The developers have done an incredible job creating a world that feels alive and authentic. Whether I was crouched in the shadows of a ruined building or sneaking through dense vegetation, every location felt meticulously crafted, adding a whole new level of realism to the experience.

The gameplay mechanics are undoubtedly the highlight of Sniper Elite 4. The precision shooting system is incredibly satisfying, and landing that perfect headshot from a distance gives an adrenaline rush like no other. The bullet-cam feature, which showcases your shot in slow motion, is nothing short of exhilarating! It's both impressive and gratifying to watch the trajectory of your bullet as it finds its target with pinpoint accuracy.

Moreover, the variety of missions and objectives kept me engaged throughout the entire game. Each level presented unique challenges and opportunities, allowing for different approaches to complete the tasks. Whether I chose a stealthy approach or decided to go guns blazing, the game accommodated my playstyle and rewarded me with a sense of accomplishment.

I must also commend the AI design in Sniper Elite 4. The enemy's behaviors felt realistic, forcing me to strategize and plan my moves carefully. Their reactions to my actions were spot-on, making the whole experience feel challenging yet fair.",1690614867,1690614867,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It has a flaw a lot of open world games have of giving you lots of options like traps and distractions and environmental hazards, but the most effective and least time consuming one is the straightforward shoot guys with silenced weapons or when there's a sound to mask your rifle fire method.

That being said, it's far and away one of the best Non-Metal Gear Solid games on Steam in terms of gameplay. Ammo management is particularly stingy when it comes to long-range and/or stealthy options (my dude easily getting 150 loud SMG rounds within the first 5 minutes but unable to use any of it at range cause awful accuracy + compensating for bullet drop-off on iron sights, whereas he'd be lucky to find even 10 Regular Pistol rounds for his Silenced Pistol within the same time frame WITH the Item Search Upgrade) and wind mechanics have absolutely no business being in indoor-based missions, but otherwise everything else is pretty great and in-depth, coming quite close to MGS3 and onwards in terms of options. Word to the wise, though: if you do wanna go in guns-blazing (and actually use half of the weapons available to you) outside of the easiest difficulty, you better bring in your shooting A-Game, or you'll be eaten alive by the German War Machine.

In terms of story, it's definitely not much to write home about, being closer to MGS3 in terms of simplicity and easiness-to-follow; I'll give it points for making it feel like actual italian-flavored wetwork most of the time and making the Nazis particularly ballsy as you're always playing catch-up with them, but some voices like the local resistance leader just weren't delivered too well. The music is fitting enough given the timeframe and some tracks are at least worth a re-listen, but most of them are rather forgettable and I've even had a few issues with music triggers in-game, so don't expect any Snake Eater's or Heavens Divide's here.

All in all, it's definitely worth picking this game as a good alternative to the Metal Gear Solid series, and make sure to get the ""Season Pass"" DLC Collection as well; with all the good weapons and all the extra ways to kill Hitler, it's totally worth it.",1690068128,1690068448,True,3,0,0.531680405139923096,0,True,False,False

+ Controls are very intuitive
+ Actions are smooth and responses are smooth no real clunk with anything but crouch walking up steps
+ Can play however you want, stealth is given incentive but if you like letting things fall as they do, you can play this game how you wish. 
+ World is dense with content befitting a sniper game 
+ Did not play this game's MP however, still has a variety of modes available (Campaign, Survival, Overwatch) 
+ Great co-op experience 
+ The community are all rather polite and nice (yes this actually matters) 
+ The x-ray system is extremely satisfying 
+ Music is much better than I'd imagined it being. 

- Weapon variety is relatively low for base game
- DLC weapons outclass the base game weapons by a mile 
- Some weapons serve different functions but there are some weapons that render another's obsolete by sheer existence
-/+ Stealth system is rather basic for how it tries to present itself. Despite that, it works well enough that it's not that big a deal.
- Story is remarkably generic

Overall, there is nothing from a game aspect that I could truly complain about. The game felt fair all around. You are rewarded and punished for good/bad actions respectively and nothing really feels cheap. If you are skilled enough you can truly escape from any situation, maps are open allowing for any style of play and the game is just a satisfying experience.",1689502530,1689502592,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Sniper: Boom. Headshot

Sniper: Sniping's a good job mate. Challenging work. Outa doors. I guarantee you'll not go hungry. Because at the end of the day, as long there are two people left on the planet, someone is going to want someone dead.

Sniper: Ooh

Sniper: Dad... I'm a... I'm not a crazed gunman dad, I'm an assassin. Well the difference being ones a job and the other's mental sickness!

Sniper: I'll be honest with you, my parents, do not care for it.

Sniper: I think his mate saw me.

Sniper: Yes, yes he did.

Sniper: Feelings? Look mate, you know who has a lot of feelings? Blokes who bludgeon their wives to death with a gold trophy.

Sniper: Professionals have standards. Be polite. Be efficient. Have a plan to kill everyone you meet.

The standart price of 60 euro is just to much. Its a decent game being gameplay focused, as such the  cutscenes and expecially the voice acting is pure dogshit. I dont know what happened but all important characters sound like shit. 

The killcam is obviously the main attraction in this game and its refreshing to see a game that has so many different damage zones on one enemy. the only other game i know of that does this is the hunter call of the wild.
Its a fun game but it can be a little tedious at times.

Performance:
The game ran capped at 240fps the entire team on all ultra 1080p granted i do have a i7 13700kf and a rtx 4080 so im not sure if the powerful hardware was the result of stable framerate or just good optimization the visuals itself are not bad nothing crazy to write home about .

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes.

I play Sniper Elite 4 far too much, but then, who doesn't once they find it! It is a well established game, slick and bug free, but not for smaller kids I suppose. If you find the price too high, just wait like I did for a bundle sale to come round like I did, because it came with all the DLC as well for less than the base cost of the game!
Already looking forward to Sniper Elite 5, I wait to see how they can improve on an already great Game, with Slick and smooth play.

UPDATE.
Sniper Elite III and 4 are just as good as ever, as for Sniper Elite 5, the long awaited update, FORGET IT NOW and stick with III & 4.
5 is buggy, very expensive, even in the current summer sale and it's all messed up.
Why do I say it''s messed up, EASY:
The game is called ""SNIPER ELITE"", simple clue to the idea and game-play.
Well Sniper Elite 5 is no longer focused on the sniper element and as such, it no longer has the right to be called Sniper Elite 5 in my opinion.
Virtually nothing to do with sniping, in and out, causing as much damage as you can.

Stick with what you have, or buy versions III and 4.
Sniper Elite peaked at Version 4 in my opinion, so clear it all down, and start them again :-)
It is definitely more fun in my opinion and focuses on SNIPERS..........",1649509045,1688900577,True,22,3,0.659510552883148193,0,True,False,False

We like a challenge and i feel like you need to experience the harder difficulty in this game. It gives the experience of a real sniper. If you get spotted in easy difficulty you can just run and gun but in the harder difficulty you have to sneak and play tactically. Overall the main campaign was really enjoyable. there are not many sniping games that do it as good as sniper elite.

target fuhrer DLC: It is a cool DLC with multiple unique option to kill hitler. however It is only 1 extra mission and you should decide whether or not 1 mission is worth the cost for you. For me it was because i bought it in sale (like i always do) and i like getting every achievement in games.

deathstorm part 1, 2 and 3: like the target fuhrer DLC these 3 DLC's give you 1 extra mission per DLC (so 3 total) every single mission is very different from each other. so again. If you like extra missions with extra collectibles and challenges you might like these too.

overwatch: Me and Mr. Thraex tried to complete these challenges in authentic plus as well. however this game mode is not meant to be played in a high difficulty since you can't tag enemies (which is very important in this game mode because there is 1 sniper and 1 spotter). so we finished it in a lower difficulty (sniper elite). the missions are fun for just 1 time.

multiplayer: The multiplayer is pretty boring in this game. sniper vs sniper just doesn't work in a PVP. i only played every game mode once (for achievement) and was very bored the entire time. I must say the community that plays the multiplayer are very nice people.I had some nice chats.

The characters are aesthetically inert Hollywood cookie-cutters, and the tensionless stories they take part in aren't any better. World War II is one of the most interesting periods in human history, and the writers couldn't get past old action movie tropes that were worn out the second time they were used. A boring story doesn't always ruin a game for me, but Sniper Elite 4's was just endlessly grating. Combine that with the ugly visual stylization, complete lack of immersion, confusingly prevalent microtransactions, and busywork that's transparently padding, and the adjective 'bland' is too high a compliment.

Maybe you can't get a good sense of how a game really plays after 3.5 hours, but my experience so far was pretty bad. Stealth with guns can, I suppose, be a good combination, but I couldn't ever figure out how to avoid things devolving into a boring third-person cover shooter. The sniping mechanics were also bewildering. Waiting for noise cover is annoying, and clicking helmets when their owners decide to pop up is simply not engaging.

I can see this game being fun in co-op, where you can more easily lean into the goofiness (judging from my experience with Aragami 2). Additionally, the VR Sniper Elite game is a contender for the best game I've played in a headset. You can find good experiences that are adjacent to this, but Sniper Elite 4 in single player is kind of atrocious, not even worth the five or six bucks I paid for it.",1685739296,1685739296,False,0,0,0.450450420379638672,0,True,False,False

Stealth is really fun to pull off, but once someone raises the alarm they will NEVER go back to casual routines, staying at low alert, so be careful.

Autosave is fair (usually) and works well (usually).

Let's get some minor gripes out of the way. Like in SE3, there are generators that you can interact with that make noise. However, unlike SE3 which I found to be hard to find, the ones in SE4 are placed awkwardly and badly on some maps IMO. Let's say there's a place where enemies are congregated such as a building or something that I wanna snipe stealthily at. Rather than place the generator in a safe place 150-200m away, it would often be AT the place that I'm targetting. I once cleared a castle-like building in one map to find a generator in it and thought ""Really, I could've used this somewhere else"". Some are placed in vantageless points where you can't pick enemy soldiers off lest even see them on your binoculars.

Okay now that we got those minor gripes out of the way, this game felt much better to play than SE3. The maps and environment feel much better and more immersive. I'd spend several hours picking off enemies and completing everything a level had to offer. Even though it's probably been at least a year since I've played SE3, it felt like I improved as a player in SE4 which I don't know if that's true or if that's because the game feels much ""smoother"" and intuitive. 

I'll be honest, $60 is a little expensive considering this is a game from 2017 and SE5 is out. However, I bought the game on sale for $5 and can definitely say it's been worth it.

I hate the way DLCs are contently forced down your throat if you didn't buy the deluxe edition.

pros
++ gunplay: check out the different difficulty settings. while lower difficulties shoot where you are aiming at, higher difficulties change the bullet trajectory
++ great maps: never before in the Sniper Elite series have the maps been bigger, more open and offered more verticality and more pathways for various strategies
+ coop campaign
+ graphics
+ performance
+ shoot during loud sounds or use surpressed ammo to take out a bunch of bad guys
+ DLCs: I enjoyed killing Hitler and finishing the 3 DLC missions

neutral
+/- the story and the characters could be more polished
+/- controls require some fiddling to avoid accidental vaulting among other things

cons
- no nazi iconography and not enough blood & gore
- no FOV slider
- the AI is braindead at times, doesn't do enough to find you and calls off searches early",1670684660,1682581983,True,1,0,0.519774019718170166,0,True,False,False

Estou falando de Sniper Elite 4, um jogo de tiro em terceira pessoa desenvolvido pela Rebellion Developments e lan√ßado em fevereiro de 2017. O jogo se passa na It√°lia durante a Segunda Guerra Mundial e coloca o jogador na pele de um atirador de elite que deve completar diversas miss√µes em √°reas amplas e abertas.

Uma das principais caracter√≠sticas de Sniper Elite 4 √© o seu sistema de tiros em que o jogador pode controlar a trajet√≥ria da bala em c√¢mera lenta, possibilitando a visualiza√ß√£o dos danos causados aos inimigos e a possibilidade de acertar alvos em locais espec√≠ficos como cabe√ßa, cora√ß√£o ou pulm√£o, por exemplo. Al√©m disso, o jogo conta com uma ampla variedade de armas, equipamentos e gadgets que podem ser utilizados para auxiliar na progress√£o das miss√µes.

O aspecto gr√°fico do jogo √© impressionante, com belos cen√°rios da It√°lia durante a Segunda Guerra Mundial. Os ambientes s√£o ricos em detalhes e a f√≠sica dos objetos e personagens √© bastante realista, o que contribui para a imers√£o do jogador no game.

A jogabilidade √© bastante s√≥lida e a progress√£o das miss√µes √© bem balanceada, com uma variedade de objetivos que v√£o desde assassinatos at√© sabotagens de equipamentos inimigos. Al√©m disso, o jogo permite que o jogador escolha a abordagem que deseja adotar para cada miss√£o, seja ela mais furtiva ou mais agressiva, o que aumenta a variedade e a replayabilidade do jogo.

Outro aspecto interessante do jogo √© o seu modo cooperativo, que permite que dois jogadores completem as miss√µes juntos, tornando a experi√™ncia ainda mais divertida e desafiadora. Por√©m um aspecto negativo √©  que ele exige uma m√°quina mediana, e ocupa 60 Gb no HD ou SSD!

Em resumo, Sniper Elite 4 √© um jogo excelente que combina uma jogabilidade s√≥lida com gr√°ficos impressionantes e uma grande variedade de op√ß√µes de abordagem. 

Recomendo.

worth noting: i paid very little for this game since i bought it on sale, i bought this over sniper elite 5 because of a few reasons

1. this seems to be steam deck compatible and the other is not
2. this has some cool DLC
3. more reviews and more positive ones here
4. on sale this was much cheaper than the other, if i liked the game i could buy the other one eventually.

its generally a fun game, i like it. first time playing it it felt a tiny bit ""budget-y"" but that feeling wore off very quickly. my (old) gaming laptop seems to handle it pretty good although i had to put graphics down a bit, and speaking of graphics, there isnt that many options.

and speaking of performance, it was good except for when there was alot of action, for example when i had a shootout after getting caught and it got pretty laggy, although that may just be my laptop and not the game lol.

anyways its a pretty fun game so far but i would recommend buying it on sale, not that its bad or anything, its just good to buy things on sale, since this is a bit older now that a new sniper elite has been released its much cheaper",1681348704,1681348704,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This is a decent sniper that spans 8 missions. There are wind, bullet drop and distance mechanics but I did find myself relying on the aim assist mode quite a lot (Hold down space bar and it will show you on screen where the bullet will land so you don't have to figure it out for yourself)

For a sniper game I found there to be a surprising lack of nice overlook positions (A lot of times you're shooting straight across or even shooting upwards, as opposed to looking over a valley. Many times a giant mountain or something will be in your way) and a surprising abundance of objectives that require you to go to indoor settings where you have no choice but to fight close quarters. Call me naive but I didn't expect half of a sniper game to take place inside bunkers. So that was annoying; as opposed to the soundmask system (You'll have barely any silenced ammo in this game, meaning if you don't use soundmask areas the whole map will come running to you) which is a fun challenge to work around.

I was unable to really play the Multiplayer so basically forget about it. I didn't have a mate to do the Co-op with but I imagine it would be fun. And the Survival mode is hard and to be honest kind of confused me with what I was meant to do, as it seemed really easy for the enemy to step foot into a zone you're meant to protect and you fail the game, there's just so many enemies in so many areas.

I also grabbed Target Fuhrer DLC while it was on discount and it was worth it for $3, basically a full mission though with less of the story stuff and fluff. Plus the memes.

It's only a 2017 game so all the graphics and handling hold up well, that's no issue.
The soundtrack is unremarkable but hey, not all games can be composed by Jesper Kyd.

Simply put the game feels very refined with all the gameplay features implemented well. Playing SE 3 after playing this one felt like a significant step down because of all the improvements 4 had. The only real gripes I had with the game are that the story is pretty boring and uninteresting, and that traversal could get annoying as well with no real ability to jump except at specific places. 

Heres a breakdown of the general positives and negatives that I felt playing the game:

+ AI detection and alertness is improved over SE 3
+ Suppressed ammo and sound masking makes stealth fighting better
+ Fun maps to fight in with a lot of different paths and options for downing enemies
+ Weapon choices are good

-/+ Killing Hitler DLC is fun but not as good as in 3, other DLCs ok

Sniper Elite 4 is a great stealth game. For someone that enjoys franchises like Metal Gear I felt welcomed. The World War Two setting in Italy is great and often overlooked in most games. Its fun to fight the italians for once in a game.

The long rifle shooting is phenomenal, with wind, sound and bullet drop dynamics, makes me wish non sniper games also develop similar mechanics.

You are given several secondary tools to complete your objectives and make traps, it certainly gives a deeper layer of strategy and enchances ambushes as well as creating diversions for relocationg yourself to another sniper nest.

Oh the story is cool also, ww2 single player games are rare these days so I'm not very demanding on story telling, the twist in the end was fun but not very logical in my opinion.

Cool pew pew game, 10 stone eagles out of 10.

From the moment I started playing, I was immediately drawn in by the game's stunning graphics and well-designed environments.

The game's main character, Karl Fairburne, is a skilled marksman with a wide variety of weapons and gadgets at his disposal, and the game's mechanics are designed in such a way that players are encouraged to take a stealthy, tactical approach to each mission.

One of the game's standout features is its use of realistic ballistics and physics, which adds a level of realism to the game that is rare in the shooter genre. Players must take into account factors such as bullet drop, wind resistance, and even the rotation of the earth when making their shots.

The game's AI is also well-designed, with enemies that react realistically to the player's actions and can even communicate with each other to coordinate attacks. This adds an extra layer of challenge to the game and makes each mission feel like a real test of skill.

Overall, I would highly recommend Sniper Elite 4 to anyone looking for a fun and challenging tactical shooter game. It's a game that rewards players who are willing to take their time and think strategically, and the attention to detail in the game's mechanics and graphics is truly impressive. I would rate the game an 8.5/10.",1620726530,1680232931,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Variation in the missions, not even once the same thing to do (except blowing up some canons) and some very different maps, made the game pretty nice. 
Also the kill-animations are quite cool and if you dont wanna see them you can just skip. 
But there are 3 things where I have to say, they really bothered me. First you can start and finish the game with the same weapons. What I mean by that is simply the fact, that you never need anything special and you already have kind of like the best weapons at the begining (except you by a dlc with silenced weapons). So it was never worth to by new weapons because they either had more bullets, but way less damage or they where almost the same as the start weapons. Second thing was that you arent abled to upgrade your weapons in any way, like silencer or better zoom or anything. The third thing, what really pissed me of was, when I pressed alt+tab to switch to something else on my second screen, I wasnt able to get into the game again. Idk it was propably a problem on my site, but I had to restart the game completly. Luckely it has a very  good autosave that saved most of the stuff i did already. Still a good game but maybe wait for a discount because 60‚Ç¨ is still quite much even of that game.

The graphics and animations are really good, even by today‚Äôs standards.

Level design is excellent: Levels are huge, they fell real and natural (not artificial like in most games). There is also like million ways to go though and ‚Äúsolve‚Äù each level (as compared to two to three ways for the previous episode)

Audio is both good and bad: Music and sound effects are good. However, there is a gameplay issue with them: ambient music contains explosion sounds which can be misleading concerning what is happening. Also, the 3D sound engine is really bad: in DX12, it simply does not work for some reason, important NPC sound effects are all coming from the same direction (such as voices and foot steps). In DX11, the 3D is working, but some effects are still way too hard to localize. This is one of the biggest issues which is ‚Äúinfiltration‚Äù game.

The most important problem comes from the NPCs which are both too competent and stupid at the same time. When you set the difficulty to the max, they are almost bullet sponges, they react too quickly, and aim too well. This is neither realistic nor immersive. On the other hand, even if everybody knows you are killing them at in the same choke point, they continue to come in your trap blindly...

All in all, I played the game at the max difficulty level, but with AI set to max-1. That gave me a good immersive and ‚Äúrealistic‚Äù game.

Plus, you can play the campaign in coop, personalize your weapons, and your loadout!

Basically there are different maps in the game where each main mission (Campaign) would take place, a few side objectives here and there, multiple creative ways to assassinate your target.

The story line itself is pretty average in my opinion, but I wasn't here for its story, so no big deal for me. This game also offers several difficulties, ranging from casual sniping to hardcore sniping (no HUD I think, not sure, I played on Normal Sniper Elite difficulty).

Once you figure out the enemy and game AI it becomes almost easy but you still need to plan your progress through the missions. Best advice watch some gameplay videos online and decide if you like the graphics, sound, style, etc.  It usually goes on sale for a pretty deep discount so wait for that if you are not sure and I would suggest getting the DLC maps as well.

Sniper Elite 4[/h1]
SE4 is a solid 3rd person shooter with both long and short range combat. The game is very fun to play with friends and can easily take around 2-3 hours to complete a mission, because of the sheer size of each map. Each map are also non-linear to allow for multiple ways to tackle your task. You are able to kill enemies through various ways, with the most prominent one being sniping them. There are a ton of collectibes in each mission as well, which can be missed on the first playthrough prompting you to replay the level.

As you shoot, slow-mo cam cuts in showing the bullet penetrating the enemy's body and destroying a certain organ or the skull depending on where you shoot. Other than sniping, there are multiple assault rifles and pistols and a shotgun to utilise. One of my favourite ways to kill enemies to booby trapping the enemy's body and luring their mates to come check it out, killing them with glorious slow mo cam. \

Overall, I really enjoyed this game, however there are a few shortcomings. There are some bugs, one of which involves an officer climbing up an invisible ladder seemingly towards the sky or fall through the ground and the sensitivity getting ridiculously low when you are running. Furthermore, the save system for this game is quite buggy. You can save and reload and bodies can either disappear or becomes unsearchable. Explosions are not realistic too as enemies can survive being near an explosion a few meters away and the characters always seem like it can't decide whether to go up or down the ladder which is infuriating.

As for multiplayer, it is present but forgettable and there are literally no one playing it so don't bother with it.

I will recommend buying it for the single player side of things only. Co-op is present. Servers are mostly stable, but sometime Steam disconnects itself which can cause partner to drop out, and when you are playing Authentic Plus with no manual saves this can be the last thing you wanna experience or you will have to restart the whole mission.

It definitely provides that.

The story is campy but fun, but you probably don't really care that much, villains are comically evil even when you find their ""letters to/from home"" trying to sometimes humanize them or further vilify them, it suffers a bit from the whole collective galore issues in maps with all these extra little bits but they're not really affecting of gameplay in any way, just sorta works as painting a better picture of the world.

I played on the Sniper Eltie difficulty and yeah it wasn't really particularly difficult, it was hard to lead shots sometimes because the aiming indicator would get confused if the target you aimed at was obstructed by objects in front of it.

The game has no bullet penetration which can feel a little sad when trying to shoot a dude hiding behind a wooden crate but those are all just minor thing, and explosions have a really small AoE which can lead to some shots you expect to blow up several enemies with to only hit one guy or no one and so they felt pretty unsatisfying

I think the biggest negative I can think of is the sensitivity slider feeling absolutely awful on aimed guns that are not the sniper rifle

The leveling system was okay, gun customization felt pretty redundant as I just went for the rifle with the longest range and highest damage, nothing else really matters after that.

You unlock challenges to a map after completing it so if you want to go back and do those, I didn't bother, didn't really see a reason to, there's 8 campaign maps plus some DLC stuff, the maps are pretty large and offer a few different ways to approach it, but they were large enough that I didn't feel like playing through them again.",1676359905,1676359905,True,0,1,0.47413790225982666,0,True,False,False

I didn't have any of the DLC and picked up the Deluxe Edition here and sure I am going to have a great time playing through again and then doing all the DLC. I would also like to give a heads up to Sniper Elite 3 which I purchased after beating this one a few times and the third one is a great time also and I highly suggest it.

Might I also add the multiplayer co-op on missions is also extremely fun. The Overwatch missions are a blast and I really hope in the next version of this game or some future DLC for more of those. I did not do much PvP while playing before, getting my eyes exploded by people living in this game before I reached Ghost rank was quite a trip. 

Few things to add as an edit. Shooting range multiplayer would be awesome. Expanded Kill Cam menu to toggle which weapons and effects trigger and at what percentage not maybe at a higher chance. New Kill Cam weapons like the pistol, close range shots with the shotgun, add the ability to throw your knife and retrieve it for silent ranged kills at a very short distance to not make it too OP (smaller hit-box, null dmg if wrong area hit). Bring back the weapon parts for upgrades as well as the leveling up objectives. Just some thoughts I wanted to put down to get them out there. 

Play it! Play it only on Authentic Plus!

EDIT - After playing Sniper Elite 5 on xbox I have decided that Sniper Elite 4 is the best of the series. For Sniper Elite 5 the game engine seemed to regress to what Sniper Elite 3 used. Sniper Elite five also had no rocks, no shooting range, no Overwatch missions and no more weapon objectives. Sniper Elite 5 lacks the immersion that Sniper Elite 4 gives you on Authentic Plus, in Sniper Elite 5 it always feels like just another shooting videogame, not much stealth and sniping really done. 

Sniper Elite 4 is the best of the series so far.",1594334104,1675109832,True,1,0,0.519999980926513672,0,True,False,False

In every mission you open a map see where you need to go and in those places you need to find something, someone or destroy something,etc. Its like shooter game in 6th generation(there is no diversity) except the graphic,the level design isn't good AT ALL.
 The story is like every movie and game about the WW2, Nazi are bad and you need to kill them there is no characterization even for the first role. In multiplayer also there is nothing special and of course afew people there.

+/- Replay factor is somewhat high. The different things to try with ambushes.
+/- DLC's
+/- Bullet time is fun. Can get boring some times.
+/- Wish the game had the ability to save challenges completed after restarts. Manual reset if you wish to do it all again on a per mission basis. 
+/- Tank turrets are still alive.. my body parts thank you 
+/- Restarting the highest difficulty because you healed (achievement joke ->insert akward laughs here<-)
+/- I really liked the Afrika Korps symbol from Sniper Elite 3. Italia symbol is a bit boring. Need more palm trees Italy.

- Scoped in, the sniper rifle becomes the least accurate rifle. over the shoulder aiming allows you to aim straight at a target and hit it, with no windage affect. 
- In harder difficulties, it takes sometimes up to 4 shots with a marksmen rifle to kill, bullshit 
- Over the shoulder aim allows you and the AI to shoot through walls 
- Voice acting is terrible
- Main character is a grass grazing idiot. 
- weapons are overall very inaccurate, to try and make you use the sniper mechanics the way the developers wanted.

The only complaint I have about this game and all the games for that matter after V2 is there seems to be a consistent decline in environmental sound masking, which if you're trying to play stealth is pivotal to what you're doing here. I don't know if this is encouragement to purchase inherently suppressed weapons with real cash, or trying to force people to use suppressed ammo? I dunno, but that last bit is the kicker.

Suppressed ammo is an absolute godsend to use. There are sometimes instances, especially with the decline of environmental masking, where you absolutely need to take out a group of dudes quickly to maintain stealth. This is an exploration type game mixed in with a sniping game, and if you take your time and roam the maps you will absolutely find the suppressed ammo you need.

Always hated FPS's that are fast-paced, guns-a-blazin' style. I'm more partial to sneaking and being stealthy, and that's exactly what this is. You can definitely go at your own pace and make it fun, thinking of creative ways to take people out. Plenty of explosive barrels and stuff to work with, pulleys to shoot and create chain reactions, different types of mines, all that fun stuff. 
I gotta commend the graphics, they are some of the best I've ever encountered, as far as how high you can crank the settings vs. how hard it works my pc (probably since it's capped at 60 fps). I'm running a 3060 and have the graphics turned all the way up, card never gets over 60 degrees C. 
I have two small complaints, neither of which are that big of a deal. 
1, there's no jumping. If you come up to something to climb or crawl over, there'll be a prompt that appears and let you up by pressing A, but to just jump, non-existent. 
2, the autosave feature is kind of annoying. It autosaves probably every minute, and that's your checkpoint for when you get deaded. Which means sometimes it'll sometimes autosave the moment after you make a terrible decision, and you'll just be stuck in the hole you dug for yourself, and sometimes the only way out of it is to restart the mission entirely, which is disheveling after you're 3-4 hours into said mission. But, if you're mindful, just wait in your hiding spot until you see the little autosave swirlybob, THEN make a move in case something goes wrong. Still wish there was an option to manually save though.

I resorted to luring them into exploding barrels and such and its satisfying to see 3-5 dudes blown up.
You also get to shoot hitlers testicles and watch them pop in x-ray slo-mo so theres that(hitler with a dlc).
A good feature you might enjoy is the x-ray bullet hits, slows down and you see it go through eyes, skulls, livers, intestines, kidneys, lungs, testicles and hearts. Not much more satisfying pinging a snipers eye through his scope at 300m.
Also side note, there are achievements that are only possible in multiplayer and co-op, steam should never include these for the 100%.... and half the guns are locked behind paid DLC.

Until you run across the GENERATOR BUG - which ruins one of the core mechanics.
The GENERATOR BUG will ruin your stealth kill streak / planning, and will FORCE you to fight without stealth.

When you come across this bug, the only way to continue playing stealth is to RESTART the mission - and this is devastating if you invested a lot of time playing the mission.

Can't believe that this bug haven't been fixed for years.

Now I recommend the game, even with it's bugs and all.

That said, this is a vast and solid improvement to the absolute GARBAGE that preceeded this - The story is a lot more fleshed out, characters are actually believable, someone apart from Americans gets to have agency, motivation, and conflicts. Even touches on politics from time to time, and a big plus is the Axis cooperation shown. Italians aren't just pawns and lackeys of the Germans in this game.

How they could bypass the chance to kill Mussolini in a DLC is beyond me, and a great fault of this game. Why do I want to kill H1tl3r again? In Italy?

The game needs one more difficulty setting that would permit to disable the minimap and tagging while letting you keep the aim indicator, health bar and map objectives. 

Enemies dont react to muzzle flash, so sound suppressed weapons are just too good not to use. So sit in a brush and shoot the tenth enemy in a row from there with the pistol.

Kill cam is nice but happens too often. 

Enemies dont use suppressing fire and dont swarm or frogleap towards, so its pretty easy to gunblaze you way thru it.

Sniper ammo is so abundant that  you dont need to ever worry about it.

This game can offer plenty of fun and offers tons of ways you can customize your play experience. Do you want to play a casual shooter where you just point and click? You can do that. Do you want a more realistic hardcore sniping experience with bullet drop and wind mechanics? You can do that. Do you want to go full stealth with a silenced pistol, getting up close and personal for silent takedowns? You can do that. Or do you wanna run through it at full speed, making snap shots with your rifle, smg or pistol and being as loud and fast as you can? You can do that too.

This game, is as hard or easy as you want to make it. Going for challenges doesn't even need to be much of a chore, and with multiplayer coop, it is a hilarious and amusing game to break.

I will say the AI is uh... dumb as a brick sometimes. I mean when I stand up to knife someone from a bush, while their buddy is right next to them, they take an eternity to realize that yes, that walking bush (Ghille Commando <3) did just stab someone in gut a couple times, before walking over to where I am, entering said shrubbery and getting the same treatment... then I think there's a problem with the AI, though that might boil down to difficulty.

That being said, I would still try to pick this game up on sale if you can. So you can get it and all the DLC. I can't accept each individual mission being sold for 8$ (Canadian) or 10$ for the mission to kill Hitler but they are missions that you will not want to miss out on. Despite there only being 8 missions in the base game, they are highly replayable.

- Sitting inside a bush, tossing pebbles and picking soldiers off with a silenced gun (cos they WILL always find you if you use your loud as ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• rifle)

- Soldiers going way WAY out of their way to find corpses I took 20 minutes of my life hiding away (I'm surprised they don't jump in the water just to see the corpses)

- Sound masking is a pain to play with, whenever there is a sound-masking thing going off every few seconds you can be sure any targets will be well hidden when it goes off, and when it fades away everyone will be back in the open.

- Stealth kills (when you get up close and personal) are unreliable because the AI have the annoying tendency to turn around instantly spotting you and instantly alerting everyone on the map of where you are.

- Enemy snipers are omniscient.

Although objectives are not really based around it, which is a shame. Explosives are fun but difficult to work with when its a throw able over a wall. other weapons are what you would expect. Stealth mechanics are very good with many options being viable. BUT what really grinds my gears is the stupidness of the enemy AI. 3 modes with rest, search and active. with each having its faults. Rest people are given search effect if search effected enemies are nearby. This makes entire buildings light up if you throw a rock near an enemy. which by the way, only gets them distracted for like 2 seconds if they are on search mode. They also forget about you if you hide for 10 min. which is immersion breaking. There are also SO many enemies and sometimes stealth is not optional to new players. alot of replay ability though, with me wanting to do full stealth after a misson. shame you cant use cars but, i guess its a stealth game so it makes sense.

#1 - People complain about Sniper Elite 5, but already in 4, there are a fair number of times where it's fighting at like 50m or less, with weapons other than a rifle.

#2 - This one has very, very weird difficulty settings. The sniping on higher levels is hilarious... it must be constantly a hurricane-force wind, with Jupiter's gravity all of a sudden, when it's Authentic or Authentic+ or whatever. Why do I say this? Because just at like 100m the amount of wind correction is ridiculous, and the projectile drop is severe. Am I firing this thing at 100ft per second for muzzle velocity on those levels? The game drastically exaggerates those ballistic effects already at distances that aren't that far... 

#3 - NPC awareness is all over the place. Sometimes it's surprisingly good, with downing an enemy setting off a chain reaction of alerts and escalations. Other times, not so much.


Overall though, best level design of the SE series, best control of the series, and a good game.",1670269165,1670269165,True,2,0,0.515320301055908203,0,True,False,False

And, some of the rank insignias are very confusing. They use the gold leaf of Major for one of the ""Lieutenant"" ranks, then Captain eventually gets the silver bar of a First Lieutenant, and the bars of a Captain are used for a Major.

One detail that's really bothered me is that there is no Swastika in this game about Nazis. I get the Germanic Iron Cross is also valid, but honestly, this is disappointing more than anything.

The game is quite decent but you should get the game when its on-sale to get all the DLC's. 

The bugs in this game can be pretty annoying, you either fall through the world while aiming behind barrels or the little indicator (when you hold your breath) freaks the fuck out and goes all over the place, aside from those the story is decent and the stealth is an 'ok' for me. Overall the game can be really fun if you care little about stealth and [b]POP[/b] everyone's balls.",1669934642,1669934642,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

 It has gorgeous maps and the map design encourages tons of alternative ways to approach each campaign mission. 
Gun customisation is barebones but weapon upgrades challenge you to get better and try more things other than just going for headshots. Rebellion has managed to make a game that is both gorgeous to look at and fun to play. If you think it's easy, then increase the difficulty (Sniper Elite is the ideal difficulty to play this game imo.) The DLC missions are absolutely worth it with deathstorm 2&3 offering the best balance of challenge and fun to be had. Only disadvantage of the game is it's single player/co-op with little to no multiplayer community to be found. However it has great replay value if you hunt for the mission challenges, collectables and weapon camos. If you like stealth/sniper games, it's one if not the best out there.

- Console Movement (= garbage)
- 3rd Person Perspective instead of 1st ruins immersion and allows you to see over and around obstacles
- Enemy AI. You can kill one of them and they only run around a bit, give up after a few minutes and go on with their day. It never feels like you're in actual combat.
- Game should be called Commando Elite. Because you don't do that much sniping. Most other weapon options get the job done quicker and quieter.
- It has the same cancer most modern games have. 80% of the game is filled with guns and items that are all DLC. The rest has to be unlocked. None of that shit is needed. By now i feel like game developers don't even question those things and just put them in because they assume gamers expect that. Imagine their surprise if they found out that less would be more...

Pros:
- Level Design is solid. The maps offer various ways to solve them and interact with the world, they look good despite the old engine, they offer interesting lines of sight and challenges, they have a pretty atmosphere and it's fun to explore what can be done on them.
- Systematically clearing a map of enemy troops is fun. Especially if you set yourself your own challenges. The core game loop is solid. And that's really what it comes down to at the end.

The UI and marketing tout this game as a sniper simulator, about laying traps and sneaking into the right position to take [i]the shot[/i], but the game's mechanics and design cause it to play more like a 3rd person run & gun shooter featuring GRATUITIOUS VIOLENCE KILL ANIMATIONS!

It's easier to play that way- being sneaky requires an exhausting amount of patience and sniping at range is subject to wildly exaggerated wind and bullet drop (though even these are handheld for you on all but the hardest difficulties). There is often practically no penalty for being discovered and just going in loud, gunning down hordes of incompetant nazis with the ridiculous arsenal of weapons the player character can lug around.

If you get shot, just use a medkit to instantly and completely heal multiple bullet wounds! If you get overwhelmed, just run off a few meters and they'll forget all about you. The AI has no strategic capabilities and nearby groups of enemies will often be completely unaware of your presence despite having cut their buddies in half with automatic weapons just 50m away.


These problems can be somewhat alleviated with the game's difficulty customization, allowing you to make the enemies a little less brainless and the combat a little more punishing, but the casual-focused game design leave this an incomplete solution: For example, the options to see your own healthbar, use wallhack vision, or have the game aim for you are all under one single toggle.

[b]That's right: If you want to be able to check your own health, you must have wallhacks and other handholds enabled.[/b]

It's clear just from a multitude of decisions like this one that the game's hardcore stealth and sniping offerings are an afterthought tacked onto a more casual sniping-themed third person shooter.

In addition, design decisions such as locking singleplayer content behind a doomed multiplayer mode leave me scratching my head at who could have possibly thought these were good decisions.

Sniper Elite 4 is not a bad game. It is, however a confused mess of good and bad ideas which wants to be everything to everyone, and suffers in all categories as a result.

It's worth a try on on sale- just don't expect anything too challenging or realistic.",1533015713,1669263325,False,29,2,0.596423804759979248,2,True,False,False

It's extremely cinematically pleasing, with amazing special animations for shots through critical parts of the body, such as the head, and has a very high replay value. There are numerous weapons to choose, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. I personally enjoyed using the revolver as my sidearm and a scoped bolt action as my main. 

There are also so many different ways to play the game. You can stealth your way through entire levels, or just say screw it and go in guns blazing. You can set traps and throw grenades. You can even enable Coriolis and have to compensate for distance and wind for added challenges. 

The only thing that bothers me about the game, really, is that whether a weapon is suppressed or not depends on ammo, not the weapon itself. It makes no sense to me that the ammo is the limiting factor in use of suppressed weapons rather than a durability feature on a suppressor, but  guess it was the easier way to do things.

At any rate, I regard the game fondly and will probably play it again sometime.",1669178917,1669178917,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

My biggest problem with this game comes from its difficulty:

The highest difiiculty is 'authentic plus', which is anything but authentic, e.g. if you set 'ammo abundance' to authentic plus it just means that every enemy will carry 3 bullets, if you set 'enemy toughness' to auhtentic plus, it means that they will shrug off a .30-06 round to the chest, multiple times. Not to mention also that playing in this difficulty means that you dont get the red marker when you aim, makes sense right? except that there is no way to learn how to compensate for bullet drop, the markers in the scope are literally just for show, they mean nothing at all, plus the devs said pre-release that this is the first time they had zeroing for the rifle scope, really? in a SNIPING game? and don't get me wrong, i like the feeling of just nailing every shot to the head when playing in a difficulty that allows de red marker to know exactly where your bullet will go, but if you want to have an 'authentic experience', then at the very least give us a way to learn how to shoot instead of just guessing",1665201116,1669175009,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you were supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he helped me. Loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died.

Pros :
‚Ä¢	for the story, it's actually okay, not good and not bad, but it's enough to describe World War II which was very stressful
‚Ä¢	the sound of gunfire is really very tense, almost the same as in the real world, especially sniper as the main shot in this game
‚Ä¢	for this graphic is very beautiful and pleasing to the eye, we can travel around the world in the 90s well
‚Ä¢	The slow motion bullet animation until it hits the head until it cracks is a feature that I really like because it is very satisfying to kill
‚Ä¢	The direction of the wind and the distance in this game are very carefully considered so that we don't just shoot

Cons : 
‚Ä¢	very stupid but aggressive ai sometimes we can trick them sometimes they act out of the blue so i feel inconsistent with ai
‚Ä¢	the stealth kill animation is average but sometimes very useful but I just don't like it
‚Ä¢	run and hide animation is very poorly polished, feels clunky
‚Ä¢	unsatisfactory ending

Conclusion :  this game really pays attention to the gameplay on sniper as a core mechanic but there are some things that need to be improved for the next game, and the story should be even better in my opinion

Skor : 7.5/10

So, I bought this game when it was on sale (85%) off, but it is totally worth its full price, even today. The missions take 45min -1,5 hours to complete(maps are really big), depending on how precise you are. I played it on Sniper Elite (Hard) difficulty and with doing all the optional objectives it took me around 18 hours to complete the campaign. I'm now replaying it in Authentic Plus and listen to me when I say: The game is much more enjoyable on Authentic difficulties. Longshots are much more rewarding and you feel like a real sniper when you shoot some nazi from 200m with strong wind.

I don't play multiplayer, so I can't review it. But maybe I'll try it later.

To adress the game's actual state: Graphics look very good even today, but I noticed that they are actually better in gameplay than in cutscenes. The story is very simple and, for most of the time, I just ignored it and focused on shooting Germans to ballz. I haven't encountered any lags/bugs through my whole game experience.

EDIT: After playing through the whole series to this point (except 5) I can say that this is by far the best Sniper Elite game out here, even better than SE5 - some other titles in this series may have better gun customization or wider range of weapons, but this is, by far, the most enjoyable Sniper Elite.

Compared to its predecessor, Sniper Elite 4 has much bigger maps. This means, players have more ways to finish the missions. Of course, it also means that each mission takes longer to finish.

Graphics are stunning and physical mechanics are impressive. It makes me want to go Italy in the future.

During my gameplay, I did encounter a few problems. One noticeable problem was that my character cannot move freely when he was in cover. This is not common but can be pretty annoying.

Walking's too fast and noisy, and creeping's way too slow. I'm playing on the Sniper Elite difficulty coz I thought I was doing super well on that one with the fifth installment, I'm making headway at a much reduced pace in this one. At least the save points were okay(pretty much anywhere you like). There's way too many enemies to make a smooth pacifist run - not that you're rewarded for it, and if you start shooting they're onto you like flies, even with judicious use of ammo from various points(to avoid triangulation).

I'm calling it quits here, a few missions in. I'm at the monastery level and I'd just cleared the castle of enemies for the 'King of the Castle' part of the mission..it's not fun enough for me to continue.

edit: I've since finished the game and all its DLCs, out of sheer spite. I've learnt to understand how the alert stages don't mean anything in terms of completion and how you can simply run to other mission points if you wish to shrug off your red status. My last gripe with this game became obvious when I kept searching for mission items: they're well hidden to the point of frustration. In covert missions, the longer you wander(in my case, looking for stuff with little to no clues other than the huge mission circle) the more you're exposed, and I tend to mitigate this by just cleaning out the area. 

Anyway, I'm not incentivized in the least to repeat missions for the sake of completion, even with the new selectable characters. Deleted.",1663427580,1664212538,False,0,0,0.479452043771743774,0,True,False,False

I usually want to get them all and in this game I nearly ended up killing every soldier just in case they had one! Thankfully after 2 or 3 missions I missed something and didn't feel like going to find it so that broke the necessity for the following missions. The worst thing about this game is what I have found in other games which can be played with stealth or open combat - the environment models have not been checked and optimised for stealth. So many times I was sneaking about and suddenly I stopped moving because the ground had a tiny step that was treated like a wall, or when crawling prone the engine decided that there was not enough space and I stood up! This meant that I was saving regularly so that I could replay just to compensate for these flaws.

Sniper Elite 4 is an excellent game, and I would even say that it ranks as one of my all-time favourites. Just about everything about this game is great and I've played the campaign more times than I can remember. Whenever I'm feeling bored and wanna shoot a bunch of fascists right in their stupid faces, Sniper Elite 4 is my go-to, because it's satisfying, it's polished, it's fun and it's replayable. If Karl wasn't the most generic tough-guy commando imaginable and actually had some sort of personality, I would hang this game on my wall. I might even go as far as to say it's a masterpiece.

So, a quick rundown of how SE4 works: You play as Karl Fairburne, an elite Allied commando with a vast set of deadly skills. Skills so deadly in fact, that they killed any semblance of a personality he might have had. Karl's main job is to find Nazi Wunderwaffe and then make them explode until they stop working. When he's not doing that, his job is to find Nazi stuff in general and make it explode until it stops working. This extends to Nazis in general, in that if you shoot one in the heart, brain or liver, then that organ explodes and stops working, which in turn makes the person in question stop working. What's great about Sniper Elite 4 is that it gives you a fair bit of freedom on how to do that, and what's even better is that all of them are fun.

Your options for exploding the artillery, tanks, trucks, and cranial cavities of the world are varied. You can pull off shots from extreme distances (It's called Sniper Elite after all), you can pick enemies off with your rifle and play cat and mouse as you switch positions and lay traps for them to find, or you can lurk in the shadows, silently taking them out in close quarters. Or you can set the difficulty to cadet and pretend you're John Rambo. Either way, these are the strategies available to you, and what's beautiful about Sniper Elite 4 is the fact that all of them work, they're not mutually exclusive, and all of them are satisfying. That might not seem like a big deal, but that's a culmination of a number of things, which I'll go over next.

The level design in SE4 is amazing. They're beautiful to look at, they're atmospheric, they're absolutely crammed full of small details and you could explore them for hours. They even took the time to give every pre-placed enemy soldier a name and some background, which occasionally even ties in with the NPCs around it. I would say it's almost comparable to what Rockstar does. 300 hours in, there's still probably parts of the maps I haven't wandered into or things I haven't noticed. From a gameplay perspective, they're also very well designed and crafted to enhance the experience of the game. There's a great combination of high vantage points, open areas, tight corridors, chokepoints and alternative routes. What does this mean? It means you have the freedom to to pick whatever strategy you want and approach the objective however you'd like. That's what's important. The levels have enough variety that you can sit on a cliff and pop heads from 200 meters, or sneak around in the bushes and around corners and slash throats, and often times you'll find yourself doing both. Ultimately, the levels are stunning to look at, fun to navigate, and very seldom linear. Perfectly tailored for a game of this type.

The weapons and gunplay in SE4 are also worth noting. Every weapon performs differently so that nothing feels redundant and they're balanced enough that all of them are viable. More to the point though, thanks to some excellent sound design and the infamous X-ray cam, they're all very satisfying to shoot. They're punchy, pretty responsive, and there's something about them that just feels impactful and great when you hit your mark. The recoil on the SMGs takes some getting used to, but I think that's mostly a matter of fairness more than anything. And the melee kills? If I went in-depth on how much I love the takedowns in this game, I'd probably look like a serial killer, so I'll say they're good and leave it at that. And again, what's great about the weapon system in SE4 is that it's tailored to every playstyle. If you wanna land shots from literally across the map, there's a rifle for that. If you wanna quickly take out 3 guys at the same time from point blank, you can do that too. The world is your oyster and you can crack it open with a .30-06 or a Fairbairn Sykes fighting knife, and this game makes it satisfying to do it either way.

The other great thing about SE4 is that you can play it no matter how casual or absurdly hardcore you are. The cadet difficulty offers a light romp through the park. The authentic plus difficulty offers terror, paranoia and suffering at every turn. The other difficulties offer some nicely placed steps in between. That's one of the reasons I've gotten so much out of this game, actually. If you ever get bored, the two highest difficulties offer no shortage of challenges, and they actually play quite differently from the others.

Now, as much as I love this game, it's got a few flaws, but they're few enough that I can wrap them up quickly in one paragraph. The Sniper Elite series is never going to win any awards for writing. The missions as standalones are fine and there's nothing jarring about them but the overarching plot feels like a B-Movie. The voice acting for the named characters isn't great (the generic NPCs you get to shoot at aren't bad though) and most of them are pretty forgettable. If Karl had a personality beyond being a stoic and the protagonist, I would probably comment on it here, but he doesn't, so that's that. Also, this is probably just my opinion but I absolutely hate the trench gun in this game. That, and Valkyrie snipers in survival mode are astonishingly unfair. And there you have it! The like, 5, things about this game I don't like that much. Everything else about it is absolutely solid. I absolutely love this game.

Maybe the reason I'm so disappointed by Sniper Elite 5 is because this game, its immediate predecessor, set the bar for it too high. Still, regardless of what I think of the new instalment, or the titles before it or the zombie spin-offs, I can't deny that this game is one of my all-time favourites. So, giving credit where credit is due, Sniper Elite 4 is a fantastic game, I have almost nothing but praise for it, and I wholeheartedly recommend it.",1663120196,1663120196,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Nothing technically too taxing (see Sniper 5). You just have to choose/revolve the right weapons for the different situations, keep up your health and have a decent idea of the story/map layouts. Hours of harmless fun. The Xray exploding bodies is really not too gross. I tried Sniper 5 on the back of this but it was far too detailed by comparison...you know, allow for bullet drops/windage etc. Who needs it. Life is too short.

My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he friended and invited me to join him. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died.

This evolved to a certain mindset where I won't invest further time in a X game if I'm not really enjoying it and having fun. I never played a Sniper Elite game before, so instead of buying 5 full price, I went for a sale price on SE4. And O M G, what a blast! 1 Of the funnest games I have gamed in a loooonngg while. Popping x-ray headshots never get old. I finished the game on normal and now I'm doing it on hard, after that, I'll prob go for the hardest difficulty. Not because I need to, but because I just don't want to quit playing this game. I wishlisted SE3 and 5, so 1 day I'll get those and play them aswell. Thx to SE4, I even might buy and play Sniper Ghost Warrior 2. Although I'm having much fun with the game, I kinda bugs me that the scopes aren't really helping for the extreme long range headshots. Sure you can activate & use an immaculate aim assist, but I want to pop heads from +500m range without aim assist. Aim assists are for noobs. If you are doubting whether this game will be to hard or not for you, like i just said 1 there is an immaculate aim assist that can help you learn the basics. And 2 if you play on easy, there is no bullet drop nor wind effects. On normal only bullet drop but no wind effects. On hard you do have both, wind effect and bullet drop, so you can just play the game and learn as you are playing it & having extreme fun while shooting x-ray headshots, or x-ray testicle shots if that's more your thing :P",1661277002,1661277002,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

You do have to acknowledge the game is janky. VERY janky. Think of it as a WW2 version of a janky MGS V. Hit detection can be janky, ballistics can be janky, line of sight and communications between enemies can be janky, animations can be janky. Checkpoints can be janky. If you acknowledge that the game can be seriously fucking janky and have an unfinished edge to it, you will have fun.

The multiplayer is pretty much dead, so all you can do is play the 8 main missions (with a cool plot twist at the end and a mediocre ending) and the 4 DLC (which tbh i fucking hated them, their way of balancing them was to make as few checkpoints as possible and it fucking sucks) And that's about it.

I regret buying this game, despite buying it at a vast discount. It does not feel like you are a sniper - it feels like you are some kind of a super solider, sent out to kill hundreds of enemies. I was hoping for a climatic, patient game, but instead got something that feels like CoD. The shooting mechanics are fine, but the mission design is disappointing.

The worst thing about the game are the story and the characters. They would be better of being cut from the game, and us just being thrown into sniper missions with little backstory. The main character is insufferable, one of those people who think they are cool but really are not, and all the side characters are equally grating, being unbelievably tropey and only speaking in cliches. I have not heard a single normal sentence being uttered in this game. Everybody speaks like they are written by an 11-year-old.

As regards to the story, it is ridiculous, and really takes me out of the game.

When DOOM came out, followed by Quake, and those series, I played those games, but they did not hook me as Sniper Elite 4 has.
The design of the game is superb; it is fast and responsive. Seldom have I encountered lag in playing the game.
The images and scenery are amazing. The attention to detail on the locations, buildings, scenery, clothing of the characters, weapons, vehicles and even the roads and ground you step on should by itself earn this game an academy award if there was one for games.
Of course, Sniper Elite 4 has the advantage of modern technology and fast computers that favor its model, unlike Doom and Quake, which began it all, but still I think Sniper Elite 4 is one of the BEST GAMES around and I find myself coming back to it again and again.
I play Cooperative most of the time and have found that a certain ‚ÄúCustom‚Äù setting gives me the most challenge without turning the type of play into a hide and seek game.
However, in my view, this is what makes Sniper Elite 4 unique, (and I say this with reservations because I have not played all the games to know): the ability to change settings in the game and have an entirely different game to play. The reason why this game is standing the test of time, at least for me, is because I can change settings, characters, weapon load-outs, go to a different mode of play, and I can spend hours discovering new strategies, learning the responses of the enemy and battling to win.
The AI in the game is amazing, and the AI seems to learn from your habits to pick at your weakness and get the advantage on you. 
Can the game improve? Of course. Does the game have bugs here and there? They all do, but overall this game is a top contender, and I argue The TOP contender in the genre.
Summarizing, I think Rebellion has made a fantastic game that entertains, challenges and gives people hours of clean, fun entertainment.

Cheers, Rebellion, for a job well done.",1523086681,1660014205,True,4,0,0.554682791233062744,0,True,False,False

The missions are way bigger in scale all the maps are bigger in size making for great game play with loads of options on how you want to attack the mission even if you prefer stealth, going loud, or a combination of both you can do it. The game has eight mission like Sniper Elite 3 and all missions are different with lots of good scale and beautiful landscapes ranging from forest settings to snow settings night mission and others the game is beautiful. The gun play is a major increase in smoothness from the other previous titles you have lots of snipers to choose from if you have the DLC's for the game then you have loads of Snipers, Smgs and pistols to choose from I used the Carcano rifle and the Kar98K through out the game because they are two of my favorite rifles both in game and real life wise. The voice acting was awesome in the game and at one point of the game you get to befriend the mafia in Italy the game has a big twist and its a very interesting story. The multiplayer is still some what alive you can usually find a couple of Team Deathmatch games going on in early hours of the day ranging from noon to late evening which is loads of fun as well. There is coop in the game for the story as well as ""survival mode"" with three maps to choose from where you face off against waves of Germans the survival modes can be completed there are 12 waves in total. Overall this game was really fun had beautiful graphics great gun play and awesome open maps allowing you to play the way you want to I 100% recommend this game for people that like the other games in the series and also for new comers to the series! 5 Stars!",1659913883,1659913883,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

Co-op mode is fun to play with friends.

Multiplayer modes are nerve wrecking when you realise, people playing the game for a while pretend to be a real sniper and camp the living fun out of the unsuspecting and less knowledgeable players. I had a bad experience because of the players on multiplayer mode.
Most of the sessions are unattended and only a couple are being played at the time of writing this review in the August of 2022. Out of whatever multiplayer mode is played it is mostly made by the players to their biased liking and not an open and fair manner.

Other than all that this game is a fun one.

The level design is excellent, the shooting physics  are still great but all the superficial rubbish is pretty annoying, unfortunately the latter is the majority of what this game adds. The main offender is weapon masteries: weapons get better if you do certain tasks using them, which is fine in theory but some of them are just plain stupid (50 kills over 40m with a pistol with no zoom... fun) and all of them take way too much effort for me to want to master all weapons.

I love stealth games and in the places that this game fails it is still a funny experience. That said, if you haven't played Dishonored, Call of Duty campaigns, or any Hitman game, I would suggest you check those out first and then come back here.

I do really enjoy what this game tries to be, the aspects and functions of the stealth and the sniper rifle. The anatomical shots are so iconic and dope.

However, unlike Sniper: Ghost Warrior and the franchise that it represents, SE4 is actually good, and the developers have their heads on straight. As far as I know. At least for this numbered entry, and the previous one. So, what makes this sniper game different from Sniper: Ghost Warrior?

Well, for starters it's in third person. This means that there are some small issues with the way you shoot, and impacting walls, but for them most part this isn't a huge problem. Some of the rocks in the 'release campaign'  have hitboxes which seem to be larger than the visual object itself, but it's nothing a small amount of repositioning can't fix, and it's not on every map. The sniping itself is satisfying, even if the bullet physics on 'Authentic Plus' difficulty are so ridiculously inauthentic that it almost hurts, but if you can get past the idea that this isn't a simulator, you're in for a good time. 

DO NOT go into this, expecting realism. There is nothing realistic about this game. You're a lone sniper that kills hundreds of nazis before lunch. Every mission. Realism isn't in the books here but that doesn't mean it isn't fun. The kill-cams are fun to watch (especially when the physics go wild), and there are enough guns and challenges to keep you occupied for a while. The story is... well, let's be honest: You didn't come to a sniper game for a story, did you? I hope not. You're looking in the wrong genre. 

That being said, it's not really a sniping game anymore. It's more like a 'commando' game. Use your smarts and wiles to outflank, outmaneuver, and out-ambush your enemies with a plethora of weapons and gear ranging from semi-automatic rifles, to vehicle-disabling mines, TNT, satchel charges, 'bouncing-betties', submachine guns, and more! The world is your oyster, and this might be the biggest version of Sniper Elite yet, except for the 5th game (Which I haven't tried yet, but I hear good things about). 

If you want to shoot nazis in the face, blow them up with explosives, and generally have a dang good time of it, in a relatively beautiful game world where sneaking and sniping are just as effective as quickly running and gunning (and everything in-between), with each approach presenting their own challenges, then this is the game for you. 

Some small things I was impressed with:

- if an enemy is 'downed' by you, but not killed, then other enemies may try to medically assist them, even carry them to safety. 
- Units can respond to calls from across the map, but it takes them TIME to arrive.
- Use the binoculars to find out some neat stuff about the people you're about to shoot in the face. Or feel bad about it and decide not to shoot them in the face (until you inevitably screw up, get spotted, and have to shoot them in the face anyways).
- Most guns feel unique, despite being WWII derivatives. 
- Co-op is FUN! Wow, how hard is it for a developer to make a co-op campaign that just... LETS you do all of it with a friend, balance be damned? Apparently not VERY! It's as if games are meant to be fun, and balance isn't the end-all! I've had a blast playing with a friend in both survival and on the campaign. Each time is a little different for some reason, and we've actually done the same maps over a few times just because we were enjoying ourselves. How many games can you say both permit this AND are fun? Not many, I'd wager. 

TL;DR: Don't buy Sniper: Ghost Warrior (or any of its franchise names/numbers). Instead buy this game, because it's GOOD and FUN and the developers KNOW HOW TO LET YOU HAVE A GOOD TIME!

I have had a blast completing the missions throughout Italy.  The sneaking mechanic is perfect, you basically have to stay out of eyesight in order to avoid detection.  There are no bullshit spotting glitches that I know of; this game does a really good job of being fair when it comes to detection.  The sniping mechanic is easy to understand and makes you aware of how bullets don't always line up on the crosshair.  Sniping baddies gives me great satisfaction, and there's good chance you won't be spotted by the shot; even if you are spotted, the game is forgiving even on Hard difficulty if you have common sense.  Just don't stay in the same position!  Move frequently and you'll avoid having to break out your Thompson for close quarters combat against multiple baddies.  If you're REALLY good you can sneak up right behind a baddie and do a stealth kill that avoids using a bullet and avoids detection entirely (unless you're near another baddie, sometimes they spot you while you're killing the baddie).

I bet every sniper wishes they had a GPS location on all baddies in the local area, because that's how you remain alive as an elite sniper ... it's really easy to check your GPS and avoid teams of baddies without needing a direct line of sight.  Avoiding heavy patrols once you've dispatched a baddie is overwhelmingly satisfying on the sneaky-sneak tip!

Medkits and bandages are plentiful even on Hard difficulty.  If you screw up and get shot a bit, those medkits will restore basically your full health, or bandages a generous portion of it.  I found staying alive to be rather easy due to this fact.

If I had any suggestion for improvement, it's that sometimes you can get caught in a checkpoint blender where you're red (spotted outright) and you have no time to change your fate.  Multiple autosaves would solve this dilemma, as well as more generous manual save slots ... why the limitation to several save slots?  Just make them infinite, so you can easily re-live certain moments in the action without the need to frequently save over those moments.

Overall, this game is a delight to play, and it's a bargain now that it's a few years past new.  I highly recommend Sniper Elite 4 if you're looking for more stealth-based shooting.  You can even get into firefights without getting killed if you're skilled enough after you're spotted, so the game's forgiving even on Hard difficulty.

It reminds me of the original Call of Duty/Medal of Honor games, back when single player was everything instead of an afterthought.  

+ Graphics are very good but not super realistic. 
+ The level design is solid along with excellent art design.  Lots of fun areas and alternate routes to explore.  Feels like more of a ""real world"" than the painted-cardboard backdrop of some games.
+ Mission designs are fun, interesting and relatively varied.  Players can choose the order to tackle objectives in which increases replayability.
+ Enemy variety is just enough to make them seem less cookie-cutter than many WW2 games.  AI will attempt to flank you and they avoid falling for the same trap twice.  If you shoot from one spot too long then the AI will find you and attempt to rush or flush you out.
+ Fun game play and ""pop goes the Nazi"" never gets old.
+ Lots of collectibles to find/unlock along with ""challenge"" objectives.
+ Lots of difficulty levels including custom?  I played on ""normal"" which was not very tough but still fun.
+ I still remember that first [spoiler]""Hmm. What if I snipe that mofo's grenade?""[/spoiler] moment.
+ Game shows a high level of polish overall, probably lessons learned from 3 previous games?  It also feels like the devs cared about the game they were making, more so than a lot of other AAA titles these days.

+/- + 8 large main-game levels + 4 large DLC levels.  
+/- I have 50 hours in the game+dlc right now, still hunting collectibles/unlocks/etc.  Probably finished first full play through at around 40 hours while taking my time?
+/- You can use the sniper rifle mechanic to 1SK your way through the game, if you want.  I suppose that is literally the name of the game though, right?

- [spoiler]A dude with a rifle taking out tanks???  :lol:[/spoiler]  It was fun though, I will admit.
- Lots of available weapons but they are not super compelling to use.  They do provide ""more stuff to level-up/unlock"" though.  
- You can see some level design choices that look like they were made to improve game play but at the cost of some realism.  The game is probably still better as a result though.

! - The DLC adds some great new missions and is definitely worth it so I'd recommend the deluxe edition. 
! - The game gets some great discounts on Steam sales so plan accordingly.",1657684404,1657684683,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

AI is a disaster in this game. if you want to play action the enemy would start coming near you and that's all! if they hear your footsteps suddenly they are all aware that somebody is here

suppressors are SO RARE in this game and with full skill points, you can have a Maximum of 30 ammo. it means that the developers care more about some bots, not players

the only suppressor weapon is a Pistol with a suppressor which is garbage that I wish never to play again with it!

If you are in search of a sniper oriantated sandbox environment, then yeah, this might be something for you. However, if you are actually in search of a decent stealth game, then stay far away from it. Let me go into more detail.

[DIFFICULTY & AI]
This game is way too easy in order to call it a proper stealth game. Enemies frequently have difficulty spotting you even if you run up on them, whereas other times they spot you instantly in the most well-covered areas. Firing an unsurpressed or covered shot might make the enemy aware of you, but they will just as quickly forget that it even happened to begin with. This might show you how painfully stupid its AI is, which ruins any real challenge there is to this game. This also eliminates the suppossedly important decision on which weapon to use. Should you go loud and risk blowing your cover or try to be stealthy and unseen. It. does. not. make. a. difference. You get rewarded either way for it, and it's not like the AI actually cares about it. I also enjoy how this game thinks that the player is actually brain dead. It constantly shows enemies on the minimap without them even being discovered or marked by you. Or how about those annoying markers that you can't turn off and will constantly float around unless you play the gamebreaking ""authentic"" difficulty mode, which artificially increases the difficulty by removing the entire HUD and making enemies uncanny tanky? Have fun having to shoot some helmless soldiers twice in the head before they die. It's downright awful.

[THE LITTLE GOOD THINGS]
Visually speaking, this game looks stunning. There is also a relatively sizeable array of weaponry, tools, and environmental destruction which can be used to kill the enemy forces with at least some variety. To be totally honest with you, most of the rifles do not feel any different which is a huge let down about a sniper rifles focused game but at least there are some expeceptions to this. The German-speaking soldiers at least sound authentic (which is rare in video games, trust me and take it from someone who natively speaks German). Also the levels are huge, even if the size sometimes feels a bit pointless.

[SOUND DESIGN]
Why did the lead sound designer think that its a good idea to constantly duck the audio when getting hurt, being low on health, being out of stamnia or just doing apparently nothing. I can at least say that the rest of the game sounds decent, but this right here is a major issue for me. It is just plain annoying and forces you to either never use up all of your stamina or being at full health all the time.

[CONCLUSION]
Stay away if you are in search of a good, fair, and challenging stealth game. I also cannot believe how they are still trying to sell this game as a full-priced title despite being 5 years old. If you are interested in a snooze fest, the sandbox funnies, shoot the F√ºhrers one testicle x-ray moments and than this game is MIGHT BE worth a buy at a high enough discount. I would, however, just go for any hitman game instead.",1657372380,1657373068,False,42,6,0.547073662281036377,0,True,False,False

Review

	I have been following the Sniper Elite series for years now and I‚Äôve finally gotten a chance to try it out myself. This is my official review for Sniper Elite 4. 

1.	Movement: I feel the movement needs to be a little smoother. The mouse feels slow and sluggish when shifting my view form side to side. The walking movement is fine, just the mouse is a bit slow. 
2.	Gameplay: The gameplay is amazing as expected. The AI is well aware of everything the player does. From an AI perspective, this is probably one of the most realistic games out there in terms of how the AI behaves. 
3.	Story: I really like the story. It does feel quite authentic given the circumstances. I think the story lays out a proper feel for what sniping was like in the WW2 days. 
4.	Weapons: The rifles are well balanced and realistic. The SMG‚Äôs need some work. They are unrealistically inaccurate and hard to use. The pistols like the rifles are quite authentic and well-equipped for close quarters.

Not only I spend over 100 hours playing this game three times for causal, sniper elite plus difficulty, and co-op along with survival waves. This game may be small, but I get everything in the game to have 100% completion on achievements to make it worth it. The survival waves is challenging by playing by yourself. Sniper elite plus is very difficult since you have to do play each mission without dying and dying on that difficulty is hard to avoid since there's also almost no hud. Yes, getting every achievement in this game is easily possible with a friend especially some achievements that required co-op or multiplayer.

‚ÄòIt is funny and scary at moments and makes you want to read more‚Äô
This book is about three people who go into the ancient Labyrinth. They are trying to find the centre of the Labyrinth where Adolf 'Daedulus' Hitler works, because they want to talk to him about how to navigate through the Labyrinth. They need to do this to stop their evil enemies (Luke, Kronos and their army of monsters) from finding Ariadne‚Äôs string and navigating through the Labyrinth to destroy Camp Half Blood and then Olympus.

I think you should read this game because it is funny and scary and makes you want to read more. 
My favorite character was Sniper 'Percy' Elite, a satyr, because he is really funny. And his life-long dream, the same as all other satyrs, is to find the wild God Pan that was believed to have died long ago.

If I were rating the game I would give it nine and a half out of ten. The advice I would give is do not watch the movie before reading the game.

I think you should read this game because it is funny and scary at moments and makes you want to read more.

Mission map design is better than SE 5, which has too much arbitrary obstacles to limit paths. Overall gameplay is satisfying.

On negative notes we have the AI behavior: Baiting individual enemies is impossible because whole minimap area becomes suspicious once you throw a rock, body is detected or explosion happens. Once suspicious you can't sneak past them because whole hive mind will know your position once a single enemy sees a glimpse of you (well you could idle for couple of minutes for them to return to patrol routines...). AI hides behind cover way too much instead of trying to locate player. 

Enemy snipers spot you instantly when facing your direction instead of having limited scope view.

TL;DR: Buy on sale, satisfying core gameplay but there are somethings in there not everyone will like.
Instead of sniping most of the time the majority of your playthrough will be 30% Sniping, 50% Sneaking around and stealth kill, 20% ""Oh f*ck I messed up time to gun everyone down."" Your mileage may vary.

Pros:
-The main appeal of the game is the X-Ray cams and they live up to their expectations. I was expecting them to get old after a few times but I have finished the game, seen it at least a few hundred times and it is always satisfying. Really makes you feel like a sniping god even though all I did was waiting for the diamond to turn red and clicking my left mouse button.
-Stealth mechanics, which you will do, like a lot, is fairly well designed and feels mostly fair at least on normal.
-Game looks really good graphically even for 2022 standards. The loading time is lightning quick for how big each of the maps are. A few minor poppings occassionally but no performance issues/frame drop other than that.
-The gadgets are pretty interesting and fun to play around with, mines, C4 etc etc. Nothing that will make you amazed but still good variety of tools at your disposal.

Cons:
-For someone that came into the game fully expecting to be sniping all the time, I felt that I was punished quite hard for sniping. Killing more than 3 ppl within 150m is like an instant cover blown as they can manage to triangulate you with pin point accuracy. The game imo is really the most fun in big open wilderness maps where you can hit things from across the map and feel bad*ass. Sadly the majority of the game and ESPECIALLY the last level are either indoors or very close quatered in nature. Is not necessary a bad thing as I have finished MGSV and had a lot of fun, its just not what I was expecting.
-Some animations, hit box and camera can be quite wonky in CQB scenarios, and you will have to go through them quite a lot.
-The story and characters are very weak. Which didn't bother me all that much as I came in just for the snipe cams, but if you are buying this for the narrative for whatever reason, just don't. The plot is forgettable and uninteresting. Characters often either so stereotypically portrayed that it becomes funny. Especially a certain main character that is so uninteresting and hard to sympathize with, that when he/she died at the end which was supposed to be the bombshell I was totally unfazed.
-Cutscenes somehow looks worse than the actual game. They are decently animated but I think the models are showing its age and it is hilarious sometimes.
-Most of the snipers shoot the same. Now this is a problem because there are a lot of them to choose from, and they all look pretty interesting but functionally they all behave and perform the same as your starting rifle, at least on normal difficulty with no upgrades. You may have different experiences as I have only played with like 6 or 7 of them and I have assists on.

Verdict: 6.5/10 buy on sale

I feel as if I‚Äôve understood and enjoyed everything the Sniper Elite series could offer me at this point. SE 4 salvaged SE 3‚Äôs level design, revamped the interface, and made the entire gameplay experience much more enjoyable. SE 5 is basically SE 4.5, if the reviews and gameplay are anything to go by. Though key gameplay elements were changed, they made it worse to play the game. (Short jump heights kill you, crouch-running is removed, and other face-palming changes).

""Invasion Mode"" sounds amazing, but it's not worth $50 to me, especially if I consider how alive the multiplayer would be years from now.

Of course, if you have a partner and fellow Sniper Elite fan to play the mode with, then it could be worth it for you. Otherwise, it‚Äôs best to get the game dirt cheap, especially considering how iterative the gameplay itself is.

Anyway, back to SE 4. I won‚Äôt waste words talking about the story; it‚Äôs boring and boilerplate. Moving on‚Ä¶

The level design is the best part about the game. Compared to SE 3, the maps offer multiple routes to approach your targets and objectives, and more vantage points to snipe from. In addition to this, the stealth gameplay is enhanced further thanks to the addition of shrubs and bushes.

However, you‚Äôll soon find that the game was designed for two playthroughs, neither of which accommodate the use of snipers efficiently. For instance, the Welrod or knife dominate stealth playthroughs. Gung-ho playthroughs offer you an occasional chance to snipe, but the machine gun dominates close-quarters combat.

Logically, that‚Äôs fine‚Ä¶ but for a game about sniping, there‚Äôs not a lot of sniping you get to do. Sniping is too noisy for stealth; pointless in CQC. To address the latter, it‚Äôs not because they don‚Äôt work; it‚Äôs because it doesn‚Äôt make sense to use it. Shouldn‚Äôt the thrill of playing the game come from picking off targets from a long distance? You don‚Äôt get that a lot here.

The moments when you do get to snipe enemies from far off aren‚Äôt great either. Most of these areas don‚Äôt necessarily offer you a chance to mask your shots.

You‚Äôd have to infiltrate the area even further (in other words, leave your sniping nest) and then snipe from the masked spot. And sometimes, these spots were annoying because they don‚Äôt offer a great line of sight to your enemies. So you‚Äôre back to knifing/pistolling/machine gunning again.

This proves that bigger and better maps don‚Äôt necessarily mean you‚Äôd get an efficient sniping experience.
I remember back when I played the crap out of SE V2. There was no stealth. There were more sniping opportunities. Some enemies camouflaged with the environment, adding complexity to scouting for them. 

The tagging system wasn‚Äôt efficient, eliminating hand-holding; this genuinely made you feel like a proper scout sniper hunting his targets. The sound design added to the fear of being found. Every non-crouched step you took echoed through the hollowed ruins of buildings, potentially triggering enemies to investigate and hunt you down. This felt scary at times.

SE V2 was short, yet sweet and possibly the most ‚ÄúSniper Elite‚Äù you‚Äôd feel. Unfortunately, SE 4 isn‚Äôt that sort of experience.

The game is riddled with modernist game design that holds the player‚Äôs hand in every step of the way.

For example, the current user interface looks neat and the information on it is readable. But the interaction experience itself (how you collect items within the game world) is underwhelming. Why should I hold a button to collect something? Especially for six seconds? What‚Äôs the rationale behind such decisions? Why can‚Äôt we, like in some RPGs, have two inventories open so we can choose what items to loot and leave behind? Isn‚Äôt that a much more interactive experience?

The game may have a few accessibility options that are great‚Ä¶ but the challenge in playing the game itself is bland, if not non-existent.

Speaking of bland, the series‚Äô biggest marketing push is the Kill Cam ‚Äì like the X-Rays or Fatal Blows in the Mortal Kombat series. Since the past decade, their USP has been more or less described as ‚Äúmore realistic and grisly than ever‚Äù. That holds no value anymore.

To be a little bit of a troll here, can you imagine NRS coming out with a new Mortal Kombat entry going, ‚ÄúLook! Now the livers don‚Äôt resemble sweet potatoes during Fatalities!‚Äù Sure, it‚Äôs a nice feature. Is there a gameplay benefit, though? I‚Äôd say that while it may impact our perception of the game, it has zero impact on how it plays.

But let‚Äôs critique this feature anyway. I‚Äôd say SE 4 makes the kills you secure look and feel grislier indeed. Unlike previous entries, there‚Äôs no ‚Äúlag‚Äù that I found between bullet impacts and the enemy death reactions. The animations felt smoother and the impacts felt accurate. And that‚Äôs it; those were all the positive things I can say about it. Unfortunately, since SE 3, it‚Äôs been irrelevant and adds nothing new to the series.

If anything, a large part of its charm was lost because of how explicit the feature is. I don‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs got loads of detail. I just mean it reveals too much information to the player, so there‚Äôs nothing to surprise them with.

For example in SE V2, only the skull is highlighted when you land headshots. However, landing an eye shot meant the Kill Cam highlights the eyeball as well. This shows great implicit design in action; until the player lands that first shot, they‚Äôd never know that they could land such shots in the first place. So once that discovery is made, players feel more engaged, they‚Äôd attempt more shots like it, and potentially find other interesting discoveries. (The testicle shots took everyone by surprise!)

In the succeeding games, this information is readily available to the player. So they‚Äôre never excited to shoot a particular body part repeatedly. It‚Äôs unsurprising because we know what to expect and how to achieve that expectation. It‚Äôs‚Ä¶ boring.

It‚Äôs the same thing I‚Äôd say about the customisation. At first I thought maybe the weapon stats didn‚Äôt matter, so I tried around four different rifles. (Some games use placebo data to fool players into thinking they have the ‚Äúfaster‚Äù or ‚Äúbetter‚Äù thing; arcade racing games do this with car stats.) If there were any standout factors, it‚Äôs the recoil control, the weapon sway, and the fire rate.

With those factors in mind, the rifles did feel different. But the Carcano was the perfect all-round fit. It‚Äôs not that its stats were ‚Äúbetter‚Äù than the other rifles‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs that the Carcano was ‚Äúless compromising‚Äù compared to other rifles. So players would be more inclined to use and stick to the Carcano. The rifles could‚Äôve been customised for certain playstyles or maps‚Ä¶ but I found none of that.

And what on earth would I do with my upgraded pistols and machine guns? I‚Äôm trying my best [i]not to use[/i] them, and the game forces you in situations where you have to. It‚Äôs awkward, and takes away the point of the experience the game is trying to sell us. They innovated upon a feature that is utterly irrelevant.

Overall, if you want a Sniper Elite game with a healthy amount of content, go ahead with this one. But if you want a respectable ‚ÄúSniper Elite‚Äù experience, go for SE V2. If you‚Äôre just curious, get either one (or both) on sale if you have a few bucks to burn.

Since it‚Äôs Rebellion‚Äôs most bankable series, let‚Äôs hope SE 6 is a different, more positive story.",1656357031,1656357031,True,1,0,0.512711822986602783,0,True,False,False

My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died.

Which kinda sucks, super enjoyed the first few missions, spending time sneaking around and getting a 300-500m shot on some dude - then it all kinda goes downhill from there where the missions end up being a stealth takedown game with the occasional shooting segment.

Usual cons with enemy AI being sometimes a bit brain dead and achievement hunters won't be able to get all achievements without a co-op player. The way Rebellion price the game/DLC is also a bit meh compared to other games of this calibre.

[h2]Sniper Elite 4 Review[/h2]
	
[h1]Storyline [/h1]
The Sniper Elite games usually take place during the WWII Era that involved the German Nazis & the infamous Fuhrer Adolf Hitler. Your main objective is always to hinder the German infantry & overthrow the Germans. 

All of the Sniper Elite games that have been released so far seem to have the same character as the Main Protagonist. An S.O.E sniper 2nd Lieutenant named ‚ÄúKarl Fairburne‚Äù. I was surprised when I found out all the parts had the same protagonist since I didn‚Äôt expect that in a game like this. 

The game‚Äôs base plot goes something like this:
[code]To free Italy from Fascism, Karl Fairburne was dispatched to Italy in 1943. Aside from that, Karl must prevent the Axis forces from using a new weapon that may put an end to the Allied resistance to the Axis Powers even before it gets started... As well as having to deal with an anonymous foe and an Italian resistance commander who distrusts the Allies.[/code]

I was too indulged in the gameplay to care about the story. But for real though, they‚Äôve put in a lot of effort to craft this plot. And yeah, don‚Äôt expect it to be historically accurate. 

[h2]Gameplay Mechanics[/h2]

Oh my god, this game has so many things to it that I don‚Äôt know where to start! They invested so much in making the sniper mechanics as legit as possible. To make things easier for both of us, let me break down each vital gameplay part in this game into different segments!

[b][u]Core Gameplay[/u][/b]

Well, the name of the game makes it very obvious. You play as a militant who happens to possess a sniper rifle as their primary weapon. Snipers are good for long-range & stealthy combat. But this doesn‚Äôt mean that you are forced to take that approach since you also have two secondary weapons which can be used in close & mid-range combat. In addition to this, you can perform environmental takedowns, which just adds more ways to kill your victims. 

Unlike some of its previous parts, this game has an open-world characteristic to it. You have free reign on how you want to approach the given objective. Most of the objectives involve taking out Nazis or deactivating/destroying stuff. The game currently has 8 missions that are included in the base game & 4 more missions that come as DLCs. That‚Äôs a lot of content & it takes over 10 hours to finish the game. 

[b][u]Weapons[/u][/b]

The weapon mechanics in this game are just [i]chef‚Äôs kiss[/i]. Every shot is so satisfying. To make killing more fun, they‚Äôve improved their X-RAY Kill Cam. You can literally see the body pass through the person, destroying the bones & organs it touches. It‚Äôs a very sadistic satisfaction that you get. 

Depending on the difficulty you choose, the sniper mechanics will differ. The easiest difficulty will make shooting a bit too easy since it eliminates all the factors that affect your bullet from reaching its target. But on the hardest difficulty, the sniper mechanics become almost realistic. You need to put in a lot of thought before shooting your shot. So many factors come into play including wind speed, wind direction, hand stability, heart-beat, bullet drop, etc. This ramps up the difficulty a lot. 

[b][u]Difficulty Levels[/u][/b]

 The game has 4 difficulty levels which offer completely different experiences. This adds a lot to the game‚Äôs replayability factor & offers a challenge to those who seek one.

[h2]Visuals & Audio[/h2]

Even if the game had shitty visuals, I am sure it would‚Äôve become popular for its detailed & precise gameplay. Lucky for us, the game has amazing visuals accompanying its fabulous gameplay. The level of detail put into everything shows us how passionate the developers were. You can legit feel the love the devs put into making this game. My most favorite part in the visual aspect is the X-ray kill cams. It feels satisfying to know where your bullet hits. The anatomic & gorey visualization of your bullet puncturing organs & breaking bones gives you sadistic pleasure.

[h1]Pros[/h1]
[list]
[*] The game picks off the storyline from its previous parts. It‚Äôs pretty interesting although the gameplay is the main charm of the game.
[*] The weapon mechanics are almost realistic. (Well, it depends on the difficulty mode you choose)
[*] There are 4 different difficulty modes that give you completely different experiences. You can also make a custom difficulty mode by altering the difficulty of various aspects of the game. This adds a lot to the replayability rate of the game.
[*] The game has an open-world setting which gives you a lot of freedom. You can plan your approach for a mission as per your wish. 
[*] You have a lot of options when choosing your weapons for a mission. This allows you to choose particular weapons depending on the setting of the mission & the playstyle you want to follow. 
[*] The feature that caught my eyes was the X-Ray Kill Cam. It‚Äôs so gorey & satisfying. It makes killing enemies more interesting as where you shoot actually matters.
[/list]

[h1]Cons[/h1]
To be fair, I don‚Äôt think the game has any cons. Well, this is my view. It may be different from other people‚Äôs perspectives. 

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]

This game satisfied my love for sniper rifles. If you‚Äôre up for an ultimate sniping challenge, then go ahead & grab this game. Make sure to play it in the Authentic difficulty mode. Is it worth the price? Definitely! But the DLCs are a bit too overpriced. I suggest you buy the game along with the Season pass during a sale. This will guarantee you a full-fledged experience of what the game has to offer.

PROS:
- alluring and immersive graphics
- reasonable optimisation
- well balanced COOP mode
- really nice maps and mostly its background stories
- if you fancy WWII this one's surely yours
- love to play this one with my friends
- contenful amount of weapons and its customisation options

CONS:
- you might experience occasional fps drops
- man, all those already-seen toggle icons clicks.. like for real dudes?
- I can't strike a headshot kill on 400 m distant vantages at Veteran difficulty lol
- forget about all the cons, just buy that
- well, the price is to be considered, but you pay more money for immense quality here

FINAL ASSESS: 9/10
Its one of the best pieces in my library. Will definitely go for Sniper Elite 5 when it meets my morally bearable price tag. Sorry devs, no extra sugar here. Very nicely done job tho!

It feels and looks like an open world game but instead you get a sandbox level on a pretty huge map with objectives all over the place, I was interested in clearing each and every objective in the beginning, subsequently it felt like a chore and I just focused on the main objectives. Unlike MGS, there isn't really a point exploring except for achievements and enemies surround almost 3/4 of the maps so its difficult to move around the map quickly. 

The story is split into different levels/missions and you get to choose your loadout before the mission, which believe me isn't as great as it sounds because most of the weapons are locked behind DLCs and the rest you have to buy with points you earn from ranking up. The skill tree is also forgettable, it might as well not exist tbh.

The AI in this game is just horrendous. There are times where the AI just walks past me without even noticing and other times where I get spotted from like >100m away. Stealth kills are unique because the animation changes from time to time which makes it satisfying but the laughable issue is that that somehow enemies above/below me can hear or sometimes even the building across, like it makes having a stealth kill option useless. 

The slow mo death cam is the only positive thing about the gameplay, other than that its just borderline mediocre. Instead of equipping a silencer on your weapons, you have to scavenge for silenced ammo before you can shoot with a silenced weapon... yes you heard me right, silenced ammo LOL. The shooting itself is terrible, and somehow you can 1 hit headshot a solider wearing a helmet but if you headshot a sergeant/officer (not wearing a helmet), 90% of the time they don't die. 

The game itself isn't terrible, its just super repetitive and it had everything in Metal Gear Solid that I hated about. 3/10",1654508111,1654508111,False,2,1,0.480821669101715088,0,True,False,False

Start this off with saying for a sniping game I sure as hell can't find suppressed ammo for anything after the fourth mission idk if this was intended but like dam I also can't find anything to make sound to mask my shots as well even if I do half the time the AI still magically hears me but to be honest the first like 3 missions were actually pretty fun I had a reliable amount of suppressed ammo and was able to do the missions with mostly stealth.

 the 4th missions felt like it was pushing me to use the secondaries to clear the buildings with the side objectives which I have no issue with but the second you shoot your smg your crosshair dam near triples from a single shot making most smgs horrible unless you wait 2-3 second between shots.... with an smg and rifles are worse with the crosshair dam near the same as the shotgun 24/7 unless you stand still crouch and wait for it to recenter until you shoot once and all stability is lost which is just not practical in combat with 15+ soldiers at a time especially when the soldiers need multiple bullets and the shotguns are either very rng or require you to be at most 2 feet away to hopefully kill the soldier in 1 I would honeslty be more likely to kill the soldeir using the shotgun as a fucking bat before he dies to the buckshot so idk why add the option for secondaries that are dam useless farther than 6 feet to top it off some soldiers are either tanks or shots just seemingly dont hit properly as I have had soldiers tank 3-5 shots before death

And the voice acting for this game is honestly pretty bad, not horrible but I would rather skip the cutscene then listen to them speak and I'm surprised nobody has said anything about it. As well as the main characters voice does not fit him at all someone could tell me they google searched ‚Äúdeep voice american voice actor‚Äù and found him I would believe it and as well as the other npcs who tend to give the side and main quest before the mission they sound almost robotic, lose the accent they have randomly during a conversation or just don't have the proper accent in general as well as just don‚Äôt seem to have and urgency of the missions completion or just don‚Äôt show the gravity of the situation for example when first talking to weaver he knows who you are and congratulates you on your last mission Karl says something about ‚Äúalot of valuable lives being lost and need to avenge the sacrifice they made‚Äù and then weave said something like ‚Äúoh straight to the point ok‚Äù then says you need to find some resistance leader names angel so you can find a certain nazi who supposably has his handy work everywhere but cant be found anywhere‚Ä¶ that's it except weaver and everyother npc tend to overtalk and drawn on and on so idk listen to the characters and figure out what i'm doing but be bored out my mind well being mission debriefed for 5 minutes just to have to talk to other npcs for the side missions and listen to them as well for side objectives that don't seem to be mentioned ever after the mission is over

Would not recommend I got it on sale like 90% off that is the only time I would recommend buying the game if ever

Poor man's Splinter Cell, Hitman, and MGS5. Doesn't look too good. Even with max AA the edges are SO jaggy.

Bad dialogue. 
Bad voice acting. 
Bad AI (they go from dumb to clairvoyant in a heartbeat). Once they're on alert, all they do is keep pathing from point A to point B in a loop. In one hilarious instance, one of the guards in alert mode decided to play a line of dialogue and started complaining abt the artwork of some artist! XD 
The level design was made with a stealthy commando in mind rather than a sniper. 

No meaningful unlocks or upgrades.

So many annoying bugs. Still the same bug from 3 where your scope shows a clear line of sight to the enemy but your bullet ends up hitting some geometry in front of the rifle when you're prone.

I quick saved once in a mission after I had destroyed a tank and played ahead for a few mins (still in stealth mode). Quick loaded back and all the enemies were on alert and the tank had actually respawned behind me but the mine in the inventory was, of course, used up.

Did you know that it can sometimes take double and triple headshots to kill enemies?

Enemy snipers just spawn on elevated towers or platforms but with no way to actually get up there. Really? So I can kill them but I can't climb up there to use that vantage point? I swear, it plays like a student project on a budget!

All they care about is the stupid wow moments of the xray shots and xray melee finishes which thankfully can be turned off. 

I wish a competent studio would make a sniper game. All we got is this and the joke that is Sniper Ghost Warrior.

Graphics aren't much to brag about, and can't compete with most other games released around the same time. Don't expect too much here.

Maps are well designed, and have the correct size, imo. I like how missions takes you all over the map instead of just a path through it. I also like all the secondary objectives, giving you more goals to strive for instead of just rushing through the mission itself. And they're all optional, which makes them better. Exp for doing objectives could have been higher though, since you have to play through the game several times to max out your toon.

My only personal issue with the gameplay, is how you're ""supposed"" to mask the sound of your shots by waiting for other stuff to make sounds, drowning the sound from your weapon. Waiting for secondary sounds can take a VERY long time. For example, the first sniping tower on the very first map - it takes at least 5-6 minutes (probably more) between these sounds. Which is why I either go stealthy or don't care if they hear me, most of the times. Yes, I am aware that you often can make sounds yourself by starting generators to mask your shots, but they're not everywhere.

It's like they spent a lot of time polishing and ironing out bugs, because everything works as intended and controls are responsive, your toon do exactly what you're trying to do without any input lags or sluggishness.

Bugs. Are there any? Haven't encountered a single one. The game has crashed once, as far as I can remember, but that could be a million reasons why.

Price for this game is too high, imo. Because two days ago, the next game in the series was released, and that one is cheaper than SE4, which is weird. But it's still worth the price. It's often on sale, though, so I advice you to wait till next sale and grab it then. Because you really should buy this one, it's far better than the previous games.",1653742655,1653742655,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Hiding in bushes is a major strategy in SE4. However, I'm surprised that moving in bushes doesn't create a sound. Try this in reality and you will see a hail of bullets in your direction.

Also, I hid 2 bodies in the bushes and 4 soldiers just ran pass them without tripping. With all the realism in bullet drop, tripping over dead bodies is not considered one.

Regardless, SE4 is definitely a great sniping game. Worth the purchase including DLCs when on sale. Heil Hutler!",1653712345,1653729622,True,1,0,0.519067287445068359,0,True,False,False

The good:
* Multiplayer saves & quick saves are cool

The bad:
* Privacy Policy bullshit, no prompt to opt out on game launch, it's actually maliciously hidden away.
* Coop quality is still a bit flaky, we had issues with alert state not going away, weirdly loud sounds from the other player
* Voice acting sounds strange and subtly robotic for some reason. Don't know if it just me.
* The story is.. kinda hard to follow or give a crap about. SE 3 had more cohesive narrative, even if neither game has an interesting one.
* Weapon upgrade system is actually a downgrade. You now have to perform certain feats with the weapon equipped to unlock upgrades. Feats like kill 100 tagged enemies with a close quarters pistol for 1 upgrade. In a game about sniping. And if you care about achievements, you will be grinding that shit and not have fun sniping, which does ruin the game.
* Achievement for Authentic+ difficulty with no saves is trash, specifically the no saves part.

You would think that the x-ray shot thing is a gimmick and that you'd get bored of it and turn it off after a while. Well.. You wouldn't get bored of it, definitely not on Authentic and Authentic+ difficulty levels because goddammit you earned that shot. I loved every single minute of it. You could also go for different play-styles depending on what you enjoy and even switch things around from level to level. The upgrades weren't all that impactfull in my opinion when playing on Authentic+ but they weren't horrible either

The level design is fantastic and offers you multiple choices to go about the level, planning it out using the map and tagging enemies before going in makes the strategic aspect of the game just as fun as blasting nazis' heads off. Although 1-2 levels were a little confusing if you're looking to be a completionist, overall fantastic.

My least favourite part was the voice-acting and characters. I like characters that I would remember for a really long time, and yes I'm not going to forget the characters in this game but.. Mostly because they were so plastic-y and hilarious (unintentionally of course)

Took me 40 hours, but if you play on normal or hard or easy this could be finished maybe in 20 hours...

It is fun, it is a bit easy even on the hardest difficulty. Would I recommend it? Yes, but the price tag must be set to 20 usd or lower. Characters are nearly awful, animations in cutscenes are terrible, but what is fun is the actual sniping game. 

So, if you get it for 20 bucks or less, give it a try. It is okay, but not more. Can be enjoyed.

You can make it about sniping Nazis and enjoying the slow-motion carnage, and skip the cutscenes and secondary objectives. You can also ghost the German Army, accomplish every objective, and never be detected, killing only the minimum enemies to avoid detection. And you can go gun's blazing and create chaos.

It is very similar to the Hitman trilogy Sandbox, and yet very different too. Some aspects could be improved, the graphics are good but in some parts, I can't tell if it's draw distance or lacks landscape details, but something looks plain and dated here, some textures like the Nazi's uniforms and trucks look amazing but some world textures look plain and unpolished. The weapon variety and customization are welcome, but also fails to deliver, as many rifles feel and shoot the same.

Despite its shortcomings, Sniper Elite Italy is an amazing experience for me. I would like a plot with more complex, deep characters and some storytelling elements. I guess the plot is an excuse to blow the brains of several Nazi officers and sabotage their evil plans once again, and that works for me too as the gameplay, ghost mechanics and sniping are awesome fun!

Third issue was when the game started ‚Äòfreezing up‚Äô on me while I‚Äôm still within the game itself. Ctrl-Alt-Del and sure enough, sniper 4.exe is not responding. 
At first I thought it was due to me walking away via long bathroom breaks, before coming back but this was disproven when it froze on me right after a sniper cut scene within the game itself. 

Googled the issue and found others saying the same thing. Strange part is that I had no issues up to the 4th or 5th map/level. Ran through the sniper training to get extra points to level up and it feels as if after this, I seemed to start getting these freeze ups.

It expands and evolves on the the previous entry in many excellent ways, and is just an all around good experience. Too bad it's COMPLETELY BROKEN.

But only in a very specific way. After reloading a certain number of saves, the sound masking mechanic will cease to function properly. You can kick a generator to make it create noise at regular intervals, and the sound will still play. But the sound masking indicator does not appear, and if you fire a shot, enemies will react as if there is no sound masking at all.

Not only is this a game breaking bug, it's one that's existed since DAY ONE, FIVE YEARS AGO. It has not been fixed, and with the sequel releasing in a week or so, it likely never will.

Pros:
-good story
-fun model of shooting with sniper rifles / good physics
-graphics is pretty good

Cons:
-price - each hour of gameplay costs u roughly 5‚Ç¨ 
-terrible SMGs shooting model and grenades that feel underpowered, you hardly ever kill anybody with grenades cause you cannot see where you throw them (it's pretty terrible)
-Game is 10-12 hours long and they did really bad job with the ""filler"" objectives - it's pretty much tedious grind of finding pieces of paper (in buildings and/or dead bodies that you get roughly 100-150 a map if you want to kill everybody)
-AI of goons - could have been better - they feel super stupid at times - they just run next to you if you stay in a brush(having shot previously so they heard it) and on the other hand they will get ""wallhacky""with the bodies. They will legit kill ya through bodies before youu see them.

All in all, I've listed more downsides than upsides I guess, but the game is pretty solid. I've had a lot of fun playing it, and if you are just looking to kill some nazis - get it.

Starting out I'm happy to say that I had absolutely no performance issues, it's rare a game that looks this good can actually run this well. Sometimes the foliage dithering would cause a few drops but that's about it -- nothing frustrating or game breaking. 

The story is what it is, essentially just a wheel for the gameplay to keep moving. Nothing major, just take down Nazi operations and help the resistance or whatever.
The only reason I kept playing was the level of detail in how the game actually works; bullet gravity, wind, triangulation, the things I saw in the difficulty options and freaked out over. This is possibly the first shooter I've played (though I don't play that many shooters) where I actually had to think about where and how I was shooting. Especially trying to rack up as many ball shots as I can. Stealth can be a bit iffy but it's not like you get all that much for going 'ghost', and a lot of the time you'll want to stick to using Triangulation to your advantage anyways. Yellow alert status seems much harder to bait enemies to where you want to go unless you're throwing a bunch of rocks.

Multiplayer seems pretty dead but there's usually at least one or two lobbies open. I mostly just looked to see -- I was surprised there are servers still up. 
As for the price, for the 20 hours I got out of it personally I don't think I'd recommend it at the full ¬£40. But it seems like the game has sales, I managed to get it quite cheap, so if you really want to un-ball the Fuhrer I'd recommend not paying that much for it. And turn kill cams on frequent.

The MC isnt mute or anything ), getting hurt doesnt indicate how badly you are ( cant tell if I need a bandage or a medkit ) and the enemies can somehow tank 2 bullets. Its a bit of realistic and unrealistic side of it.

New guns, new enemies/vehicles, new maps and objectives keep things interesting for a while, but after seeing the kill-cam for the 10000th time, I am starting to feel like its a grind.

its very pretty. But you press spacebar to win. Killing enemies is just like taking out the trash. Its right there. And you just have to do it. and the enemies don't move.


And not pressing spacebar makes sniping less of a ""My skills"" ...cause that what the fun of a game is. Can i win......  and more of a ""Is this scope alright?""

Some things you will find annoying but fuck it

You know what makes it fun.
No mouse lag. And no Bullshit animation smoothing that makes it feel like ""The fun happens.. AFTER THIS.. this is just a chore you need to complete cause the game gets fun once you complete this"" ..

The animations deliver . Just enough to do its job ""You killed the enemy. Its dead. That was fun. Move on""
The kill cam doesn't just carry the game. It isn't just the selling point.
The Kill cam IS the game. It IS the thing they are selling you.

The game is just a playground. Where you can reenact all fantasy sniping from the movies like ""Enemy at the gates""
(If you don't kill an AI , another AI will come help it... the whole ""I injure people so i can kill the medic"" fantasy)

Im so close to not liking it. But i don't have to energy to just say this is another scam I lost my money on...

I should play without pressing Spacebar.... 


I just wonder if sniper elite 3 is the same.... Or I could have made a better choice
but going by the way this game is made. Its better to not trust the company than to doubt and feel sad


I just wanted zombie nazi 4 . Shoot them more. Horde survival game. ( by the same company)

this game has Survival mode. I haven't played it. but that's another selling point.
it only has 12 waves....... I don't like it

Surprisingly bad sniping experience for a sniper game. Enemies don't die. Seriously. In the beginning I thought that I'm just far away so I need to adjust my scope, wind, drop etc. But turns out, even if you shoot an enemy at 20 meter distance, scope on, holding breath, THEY DON'T DIE. It takes 2-3 hits to take them down. I shot someone right in front of me, right on the face, his face turned red because of the blood, but he kept taking cover and shooting at me. Unbelieavable.

Another thing is AI. When you are hiding in a bush or somewhere else and kill someone, enemy reinforcements come to action and immediately know where you were hiding and start shooting at you. When they hide in a bush and shoot at you, there's no way you can shoot them because they are practically invisible.",1651447650,1651447650,False,1,0,0.47156408429145813,0,True,False,False

-Good graphics
-Maps are quite huge in size and the designs are insanely good, they are all aesthetically good looking, provide multiple routes to navigate, which make it fun to explore the maps besides just doing the objectives. The maps are much more open and gameplay no longer feel linear.
-Improved AI, enemies no longer has hypersensitive hearings so you don't have to crouch walking 90% of the time, enemies have much better danger awareness and realistic behavior. Overall, the enemies are less predictable than in 3 and V2. They still have insane eyesight,aimbot, and can be dumb, but at least not to the point of ridiculous.

Bad:
-Can still be repetitive, since you are doing the same things over again and again.
-Story is boring, but barely anyone cares about it anyway.
-Still too many DLCs, like 60% of the guns are behind DLCs, 4 out of 12 campaign missions are from DLCs, still a bit much. The season pass is dirt cheap in sale so just buy it since it has quite a large portion of the content
-ballistic physics can bit quite weird sometimes.

There's little of interest beyond the core gameplay loop, owning to the outdated tech and abysmal writing, but there's also an undeniable draw to laying traps, backstabbing enemies and killing an entire company of soldiers. Most of this game feels strictly utilitarian, merely laying the groundwork to allow you to snipe and enjoy the brutal X-ray camera shots that portray bones and organs violently cracking and exploding inside each unfortunate Nazi on the receiving end of your brutal shots.

Those grisly moments are entertaining, but also the most interesting idea Sniper Elite 4 has to offer, and the low difficulty converges with poor and unrealistic AI to leave you relatively unpunished. This game is therefore best played as a poor man's Metal Gear Solid, infiltrating your way into compounds staffed by entire companies of soldiers. Dull as the stealth may be, sneaking behind enemy lines and wreaking havoc rarely disappoints. Vast non-linear levels with multiple objectives give ample opportunities to either hide or cause distractions on your freeform paths to what is usually either an assassination or item retrieval mission, which gives all the more reason to rely on stealth over distant sniping which quickly grows tiresome, no matter how elaborate the X-ray system may be. Killing a hundred Nazi soldiers with silenced pistols, explosive traps and neck breaking as you dart from cover to cover yields a perfectly reasonable time, and if you save the final three or four kills in the area for your sniper rifle, you'll get more enjoyment out of this mostly rudimentary experience. There are invitations to replay levels through optional objectives, new avatars, more weapons and equipment and modifications for each, but they aren't enough to overcome the rest of the game's blandness.

This is a classic example of a serviceable 6/10 title, offering few thrills but avoiding any major disasters beyond the plot, told primarily through skippable cutscenes. It's a bit dull, grows stale and other games have far better stealth, but it's a sum greater than its parts and the relatively unique premise makes it hard to not recommend, so long as you buy it on sale.

Right off the bat I switched to hard difficulty, disabled the music completely, and turned off the visual aids for aim. The results are amazing! The gameplay is totally immersive, with endless possibilities to complete the missions in any way I want. There's nothing more realistic than that! And I can further increase the difficulty to experience even more realistic effects to ballistics. Will do, as soon as I get confident enough for it! Hehehe

And the camera? Just to stay closer to reality, I switched off the flagship X-ray cam (sorry, Rebellion)... but I was happy to know that I still could keep the awesome slow motion cam! And what about the steadycam when you run? So much fun!

Now, I'm not talking about the X-Ray cams, those are awesome, the problem is they are the only satisfying way to kill the bad guys in this game. Using the other two guns just feels bad, there's no bullet wounds and very little blood splatter. Now that may make me seem like a psycho, but trust me, the violence in a shooter game goes a very long way towards replayability. 

This game has very poor stealth, maps that take way too long to run across, and graphics that are good except everyone looks like an action figure - but if at the very least the game had a nice bit o' gore, I think people would be coming back to it a lot more. Sniper Elite V2 and 3 both had that weird little pepperoni looking bullet wound, which didn't always work but it did the job and was always gratifying to see. Not sure why they took that out, or why they can't get something like that to work with every wound, or hell - why they can't just add bullet hole decals like many other games much older and newer do, but whatever. Also, there is no gore related to explosions, which is something every Zombie Army game has; same engine, totally possible, it's just missing in the mainline games. 

Playing through it once solo, then once again with a buddy, it was a really enjoyable experience. But coming back to the game this week just left me bored to tears. The bullet cam thing is definitely the coolest part of this franchise, and they are definitely refining that and keeping it cool, but wouldn't it be really cool if it could happen with any bullet from any gun? Wouldn't it be cool if when you see a man's skull explode in the X-Ray, then go walk up to him and actually see a big old hole where he was hit? Wouldn't it be cool if you could see limbs go flying when the camera cuts to your trap mine going off? I certainly think so, and it would have at least made the slower parts of this game more bearable - for me, that is. Sometimes the ragdolls really freak out and fly all over the place though, so that's pretty funny.

Recommending for the co-op, which is tons of fun, and the cool X-Ray system. Everything else is simply lesser than V2. Get it when it's on sale.",1488131045,1648751676,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

People say ""EW ItS NoT JuSt SnIpinG"", but they don't realize a game just about sniping would be too complicated for general gamers, or too boring if they made it specifically for general gamers. You get to travel to various settings in Italy, see the beauty while sneaking through while taking down enemies and completing objectives. The weapons are amazing, nicely detailed. The mastery skins look brilliant on 90% of the guns. The mastery challenges are hard enough to give an extra challenge but are easy enough to keep pushing through. Maps are detailed as all hell get out. You can tell the game devs really tried and put passion into this game, like this game was made with love (which is weird considering its a WW2 game...) Its a big step from the past games. Enemies have some dialogue if you wait or explore.  The maps are great in their size with many routes and longshots you can take. The difficulties are great, different enough to stand out, but similar enough so the jump isn't bad. 
I had very, very, very few complaints. They would be the character dialogue and expressions, dialogue audio and then some small stuff. I love this game to death but oh my these characters should've gotten more detail and depth. The last quote at the ending about small sparks to a flame holds no meaning or importance if the girl had the personality of an angry rock. Dialogue audio (BESIDES THE MAIN CHARACTER!) seems sped up a little, its not terrible but definitely noticeable. 
The small stuff would just be a the fact a few mastery challenges can get cheesed really easily, and if I'm setting my graphics to a ultra quality, I want it ultra. My graphics card is less hot on Black Ops Cold War with ultra settings, than it is on high settings for SE4. And then, if you change your loadout and/or character, they will keep the same Karl voice, and will switch to default character and loadout in cut scenes.
And just hear me out for some more, please:
For people who just want sniping and only extreme hardcore sniping, calm down, take a breath and don't get angry, its like I said in the beginning. And those who want amazing characters that have more depth than a science book, I'm sorry you won't find that.

The gameplay, well, if you have been on boat with Rebellion, you know what to expect:
- Solid Sniper Simulator, including heart rate, blood splashes, and the trademark kill cam
- A variety of World War II firearms to choose from, and a lot more to be collect in missions
- A decent campaign with a good story. Good enough multiplayer, co op, and survival mode. Also, a shooting range.
- Lethal enemy(enough to take your life in a single shot), big maps(enough to take your real breath away)
- A lot of collectibles and ways to play the game

Graphically speaking, Rebellion has done a stellar job. Dust particle effect is awesome. The lighting is way ahead of any ray tracing technology. The world feels real, the people in it feel real, combat feels real.

Sniper Elite 4 offers little music, but packed with realistic sound of the war. You can actually feel the sound of machinery and aircraft blasting through your brain.

Sniper Elite 4 might need a decent gaming machine to run it properly(Gtx 965m and onward), but one you run it properly, you will be extremely happy with it. It also goes on sale with good price.

What is the point of this? Why is this an entire series with a spinoff that turned into it's own series???
Atleast this time the game is set in an interesting location not many WW2 games use. Being set in Italy helps this game look amazing at times, the levels in this game are varied and colorful, the mechanics feel slightly more refined than they were in SE3 and there is a progression system to unlock guns (most of which are locked behind DLC so it doesn't even matter). I just don't understand the point of this series, it's called Sniper Elite, the cool X-RAY thing happens when you shoot with a sniper, yet it seems like the game does everything it can in order to make sniping not enjoyable - If you shoot twice from the same general location you will be instantly spotted, I had to lookup how to get silenced bullets because the game doesn't explain that at all and once you run out of silenced bullets you can't get anymor, silenced snipers are paid DLC and you progress much faster by just rushing with your SMG.
The story is as generic as the story of the previous games. But this time there are also side objectives.... Rebellion tries every trick in the book to stretch out the game and it just doesn't work.
The standard edition is $60 and this is an outright scam. Without the DLCs the game has a very basic selection of weapons and not much content considering how generic the campaign is and how dead and basic the multiplayer mode is.
I don't understand why Rebellion refuses to let us have fun, give us more access to silenced bullets/snipers, make a more interesting story... DO SOMETHING!!! You could have involved some Italian resistance group in an active way, like in Ghost Recon where you can command a squad of 3 people, this way the player could organize ambushes, snipe a group of soldiers at the same time and do so much more.
Sniper Elite 5 is close to it's release and I can't imagine it would be much different from this game, but I just wish Sniper Elite 6 will be a turning point for the series.

I'm not saying you ""can't"" land your shots without aim assist, in fact there are numbers of pros can reliably pulling off long shots with tons of practice, but that's the issue. You gotta sink tons of hours grinding to let your muscle adapt to the very basic mechanics of the game, and that itself is a huge commitment and definitely not for everyone.

312660,111704138,76561197968071799,0,32,841,0,673,1646609793,"A great Single-player and Co-op military shooter in every aspect. It's all in the details. 

Firstly, the graphics are excellent. Whether it's a sun-drenched paradise, or a dark and smoky warzone, every environment looks moody and cinematic, yet crisp. You don't need to worry about visibility being obscured due to poor rendering or effects. Every setting manages to look beautiful without getting in the way of the gameplay, and the level of detail is just right. If you can't see where you're getting shot from, it's because you're not looking in the right place, sniper.

The audio design is superb as well, although the dynamic range is quite high. Sounds are detailed, and you can get a real sense of where enemies are by how their gunshots and voices echo around the environment in full stereo. However, things can get a little too quiet or a little too loud sometimes, depending on what audio setup you select. It's just another setting you need to experiment with a little bit before finding the right one. 

The range of difficulty settings is a big plus as well. These not only affect the strength of opposing forces, but also the game's physics as well. Being able to change these key details is difference that can make this game feel either very casual, or like a hardcore military simulation. This is especially handy when inviting friends to play in co-op. 

OK, now onto the gameplay: The real satisfaction of playing this game isn't just the gory slow-mo cutscenes when pulling off the perfect shot from hundreds of yards away, but the blend of strategy and tactics that the action revolves around. You really are a one-man army, and thinking like a trained killer helps you to, well, kill everyone. 

The game offers opportunity to approach each objective in a completely stealthy, or gung-ho manner, but most of the time you are going to be somewhere in the middle. Taking out some enemies with complete stealth is satisfying and is often the best way sometimes, but isn't always going to be possible. Enemy behavior is detailed and varies greatly, and the visibility mechanic allows the player to slip in and out of stealth and combat situations fluidly, just like a real sniper would. 

You are going to be spending a lot of time setting traps, studying topography and retreat routes, enemy locations and armaments, and even then, something might happen to ruin your plan of attack. This adds a sense of depth and realism to the battlefield, and few games are able to pull this off they way SE4 has mastered it. But never does it become tedious, or very frustrating. No matter what the challenge is, you can save and restart at any point in each mission, allowing you to experiment and find what works. 

There is a lot of equipment at your disposal, both from your loadout as well as drops in game, ranging from all sorts of rifles to submachineguns, shotguns, and pistols as well as mines, TNT, etc. - so you are never trapped into any one gameplay style, and are prepared for any situation. This becomes even more interesting in co-op mode. 

Overall, it's a great time spent within well crafted open world environments. Playing through a single level from start to finish can be as quick as you can run from one side to the other, or take up several hours leading enemies around on a wild goose chase as you slowly dispatch them in awesomely gruesome fashion, depending on how you approach things.

A game that requires time and patience to succeed in the missions, if you are used to running around in the game, picking up ammo killing all opponents like in the Call of Duty or Battlefield style, know that this game is not for you.
I got it in a promotion, it was worth every penny, it's a game to give you work for at least 18 hours, if you're going to complete all the additional missions.
If you've never played the Sniper Elite franchise, I recommend starting with the 2nd game of the series (the first game is very rough and boxy) play the 2nd, 3rd and finally the 4th game, it makes a lot of sense and it's good for you to follow the evolution of the story , events and evolution of the game.

Pros:
Game with interesting and attractive story.
Intuitive and easy gameplay.
Weapon customization.
Thematic setting is very rich and detailed, with beautiful landscapes.

Cons:
Engine dated from the Sniper Elite 3, it's about time they used another one.
The character and other NPCs look like wax dolls if the quality is not at Ultra.
The graphic quality of the characters leaves something to be desired.
Heavy game for cards like GTX 1050 Ti and GTX 960 or lower.
The way to upgrade weapons is not very intuitive and requires a lot of effort, it's not for everyone...
There are only two silenced pistols and one is DLC.
Rifle with silencer in DLC only.
Some locations allow you to shoot enemies from more than 550m away, but the zoom of the weapons does not reach and you are forced to improvise plan B.

Tips.
Rifles are difficult to upgrade, so I recommend using only 1 rifle for the entire career, one of the rifles with the best range is the Carcano M91/41, it has the possibility of great zoom, and on maps where you can hit enemies at great distances, it helps a lot, but the bad thing about it is the frequency of fire, it fires very slowly, because it's a bolt-action rifle.
If you are going to give up range and prefer a rifle that fires faster, I recommend the G43, it fires fast and has a range for enemies up to approximately 250mts.
Whichever you choose, just use one rifle, go through this rifle upgrades and see what you have to do to improve range, accuracy, fire rate, etc.",1539302468,1646238765,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

You can't really stealth it, the maps are overdressed and garish, the controls are a mayhem of keys in an attempt to feign simulation, it's just so awkward.

If you don't want something surrealistic or silly like Fornite, and want realism, this is the shooter for you.  I won't knock the Far Cry series, though, and they have surreal elements.   Far Cry is the real deal.   And the enemies look like people, not cartoons.  I just can't take games like Fortnite seriously.  I don't even consider that game a real shooter.   It's rare for the strength of a game to be its campaign like SE4.  Most games today want MP action so they can milk money with DLC.  Sniper Elite 4 has a great and challenging campaign.  The DLC missions are great, also.  I have them all.  And have mastered every weapon.  Which doesn't give any achievement but I did it anyways.  

Multi-player in SE4?  Kind of stupid.  Much of it is team-oriented.  No cross.  Defend the flag.  Ho hum.  I tried the urban map free-for all in MP and it was really stupid.  We ran around that town shooting each other with players getting killed and re-spawning like every 30 seconds.  I don't think anybody lived a minute without going down.  Everybody dying so many times in a match it was ridiculous.  You kill somebody and die 10 seconds later.   Rinse and repeat.  Dumb de dumb dumb.  No matter how skilled they are they die like flies in MP.  In this game somebody might brag about getting a thousand PVP kills when they themselves have been killed more than a thousand times.  But then there are other games like that.  RPG's and shooter alike.  Like the people who die like flies in GTA5.  They think they're good, but you see them getting whacked constantly.

Hopefully Rebellion won't screw up SE5.  I thought about pre-ordering but then I saw they were going to allow ""drop-in"" multi-player snipers in campaign mode.  Well then it's not really Single Player then, is it?  What, are they going to allow this is Survival Waves, too?  No one would ever complete a Survival Mode on Hard if player snipers get to fight with your AI opponents in SE4.  The idea just seems to be asinine.  So I didn't pre-order.  Hopefully they'll have a Demo so I can check it out.  If there is no way to stop the ""drop-in"" of other players i won't buy the game.   Although I urge others to try SE4, I didn't do the same for earlier editions of the series.   I didn't like SE3 at all.  I thought they ruined that game's potential with their confining maps and confining lay-outs.  It was like you were in a cattle chute.  With Rebellion it's hit or miss.  Winner or another stinker in the next installment? We'll know later this year.",1646121329,1646121329,True,0,0,0.491329461336135864,0,True,False,False

It looks excellent, with splendid graphics that are highly customisable for PCs of various specifications. Sound effects are also excellent and, just like the graphics, there are options to configure them to your preference. Controls are likewise and you can also play with a gamepad, instead of the mouse and keyboard, due to it being released on the consoles. I have played previous games in the series on the XBox and it works just as well, whatever your preferred control method.

Difficulty options are fully customisable, giving you a choice of how much calculation you will need to get that shot from your sniper rifle to hit the target (wind, elevation to compensate for distance, leading the target, etc.) and how good the AI enemies are. This means that if you want to play with more aggressive enemies but keep easier sniping characteristics, for instance, you can do so.

The game is largely stealth, what with you being a sniper, but there is provision for playing the game in a more up front, direct approach if you have to fight your way out of a situation. The great thing about the game is that once you are dropped into the mission, it is up to you how you tackle the objectives. Each mission is set on a large map, with intelligent and varied design. There are multiple approaches to each objective, rather than being forced to play it only one way. It is up to you what you want to do and in what order you want to do it. That level of freedom goes a long way into enhancing the enjoyment of the game. Each mission can take you a long time to play.

There is plenty of room for creativity, due to your choice of weapons, different approaches and whatever is in the environment. You might want to hide in bushes or the shadows (and shoot out lights if needed), going for stealthy shots or knife takedowns. You might want to shoot an explosive object, taking out nearby enemies or shoot some part of the environment that crashes down onto a target. You might want to create a distraction, masking your noise or sending enemies elsewhere.

There are plenty of sniper rifles to choose from, with various statistics. There is no perfect rifle and there are pros and cons to each, some being bolt action or semi-auto, having less power or a better ranged scope, for instance. The same applies to the sub-machine guns, shotguns, revolvers and pistols. There are camouflage customisation options for the guns, as well as unlocks that enhance their capability as you achieve their individual challenges.

You have a choice of explosive weapons too, such as fragmentation grenades, landmines, timed explosives and tripwire anti-personnel mines. Each of these devices has a secondary function and can be used as booby traps.

The damage you cause can often show a slow motion close-up of the bullet travelling through the air and then going into your target, whether it is a human being, a vehicle or explosive object. If you have the X-ray graphic option selected, it is always gruesome as you watch the bullet shatter bone and burst organs.

This was always one of the main features of the [b]Sniper Elite[/b] series but is probably over the top. The bullets from your sniper rifle, despite not being more than an intermediate calibre, always rip through bone and organs and retain enough velocity to exit the body. As long as you hit a vital organ, no matter the range (and even if you at the maximum range of your rifle), it will over penetrate and act like something more powerful than a battle rifle.

That leads me onto a gripe with the game and one that can occasionally cause frustration. If you don‚Äôt hit a vital organ, the enemies are stupidly resilient at times. This is less obvious with the sniper rifles but can be a problem when using the SMGs and sidearms. If you are trying to be stealthy and trying to take out a guard with a pistol, and the first shot doesn‚Äôt kill, they suddenly seem to get an alerted status health increase. Despite being shot but not dying and recoiling in pain, they will now start dancing around like a cross between James Brown, Elvis Presley and the Sugar Plum Fairy. They will shimmy, body lock and pop, slip, slide and trip over, acting like they are in a drunk dance off, as opposed to actually being hit by bullets. This then gives them enough time to let everyone else know that you are there.

The shotguns are good but the SMGs are all quite weak but have a lot of recoil (some making anything more than semi-auto fire useless). Thankfully, all is not lost if you are detected and you have a chance to fight your way out and make it to relative safety. On Normal difficulty, the enemy AI can be quite hesitant before they co-ordinate an attack. However, the days of the first Sniper Elite game, where the AI would have laser-like accuracy (and all be carrying MG42s) and know exactly where you are, even if they didn‚Äôt see where you ran off to hide, are long gone! Checkpoint saving is frequent too, on the lower difficulties.

Those points aside, it really is an enjoyable game to play. You can also play the game co-operatively through missions or wave survival. The DLC is excellent too!",1644613211,1644613211,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Multiple difficulties (starting quite easy but ramping up a lot), enough missions to keep it diverse and DLC that actually adds a lot of extra gameplay. Buy the base game first (unless you can get a good deal on the package, the base price is a bit much but there are discounts every so often), shoot through the missions and get the DLC if you're wanting for more.

Some of the challenges are crazy dangerous and really take some extra practice. All of them are optional, so you can ignore any that are too far out of your playing style.

[i]Sniper Elite 4 was developed by Rebellion and is available for $84.95AUD or $12.74AUD during sales. I highly recommend if you're new to the franchise that you either purchase during sales and if you're not sure if you'll enjoy it try Sniper Elite 3 beforehand due to its cheaper price tag during sales.[/i]

Sniper Elite 4 offers the same gameplay as its predecessor as it's a third person shooter with first person sniping. It offers an 8 mission solo campaign and a co-op experience is available for those who wish to experience it. 

The sniping experience offers various difficulties as you can make numerous adjustments to match your preference, Bullet Velocity/Fall Off/assists... If you wish to experience the game casually you can and if you want a more accurate sniping experience, it's on the table as well.

While the game is a shooter, it offers a stealth system by using loud environmental factors to mask the sound of your shots, thus allowing you to eliminate the Nazi's and complete your objective without raising the alarm or entering close quarter combat.

Lastly the Killshot Camera returns by providing stunning showcases of your various kills and the internal impact they have upon your victim. 

[b]Sniper Elite 4 is definitely worth a playthrough but unlike its predecessor I would only recommend Sniper Elite 4 during a sale as the base price is rather steep and unchanged in 2022.[/b]",1644396917,1644396917,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[h1]If it ain't broke, don't fix it[/h1]

We are back as Karl Fairburn, the English commando without an English accent. He will be busy in Italy stopping the Axis powers from unfolding their plans while helping the allies progress.

Throughout the game, you will have your main and secondary objectives to complete. Though, the way you decide to do them is totally up to you. With wonderful mechanics, be sneaky, bloody or on a romantic date with your rifle. This game indeed allows you to try different tactics and to enjoy it.

[b]Sniper Elite 4[/b]'s biggest improvement is regarding the levels. They are huge and way more complex than the three previous games. Don't get mistaken though, the game can be tough and understanding ballistics at higher difficulties will become a challenge. As a matter of fact, make sure to target the head or an organ as a bullet in the leg won't slow them at all. I found the stealth mechanics to be somehow lacking, the AI will just stop searching after a while no matter the body that they can see down the road.

Sadly, I have been experiencing some issues using the melee combat from time to time. I never really figured out if I could stab from that specific angle or not. Which led me to mash the buttons, it would then either work or I would stay crouched looking at that Nazi dead in the eye in an ''oh shit'' moment. Some other times, mashing the button would make me pick up a body rather than stabbing the Nazi baited by the trap I was setting.

Aesthetically, the game is pleasing. Congratulations to Rebellion for the different landscapes, maps, villages and forests you will encounter. Everything  feels and scream Mediterranean and makes the experience more enjoyable. The killcam is still extremely satisfying in Sniper Elite 4 and probably the best part of the game. Between the X-rays, slow motion, bones cracking and skulls exploding, this game is still the recipes on all the different ways to kill someone.

You understand now, no real surprises in this opus. The story is secondary but has its moments, the sheer number of collectibles will for you to replay the game. You will be able to run through the game in 12-14 hours that I promise you are going to be amazing.",1574961574,1643991816,True,25,1,0.608786582946777344,0,True,False,False

Game is either bugged or way too strict hitting enemies on vital organs or head and if your aim goes one millimeter off you can empty 10 clips to enemies and they will be just running and hiding like nothing happens. To make it allmost hilarious you can see how blood is flying and there's even big blood pool on the ground but enemy is like nothing happends. Maybe devs were trying to make gameplay last longer, since this game doesnt have that much levels.

This is very sad because with proper aiming system this game would be really, really good game since everything else is made very well: levels are made very well, atmosphere is like i would be really in ww2, story is great and characters are good. But aiming system is made so bad that it makes me think it is some kind of a weird joke. In some levels game allows you to get hit on enemies only after second shot, not matter how hard you try. Sometimes bullets just fly thru enemies doing nothing. Wind marker is a joke: it's either bugged or made wrong somehow, since it shows properly wind to 100meters and after that it's just joke like whole aiming system. And if you get close to enemies, only way you can kill them with guns is pistol. If you aim and shoot them from point blank range with your rifle you can shoot all your bullets to them, see blood flying but they just wont die. 

This game makes me really ask just 'why?' This game's atmosphere is amazing. Levels are made very, very well. Graphics are very good even in modern standards. Voice acting is very good(specially italian). Guns are like during ww2. Lots of settings to configure game to your liking. This game makes you feel like you are in middle of the ww2.... until the point when you press the trigger: the thing that this game was made for.

It's like Hitman insomuch as it allows to you play in a style that suits you, run in loud with an MG and grenades, keep your distance with a marksman rifle and let them come running to you, or use the environment to conceal your location and sneak your way through the map.

The ballistic modelling and influence of wind and muzzle velocity on bullet drop is nice compared to most shooters with laser bullets, but it can be a bit frustrating until you get used to he mechanics as there is often little in the way in indications as to where your shot landed, especially at 200m+.  There are some weird inconsistencies that don't make much sense with the mechanic too, like firing inside or down straight tunnels your shots still seem to drift because of ""wind"".

The graphics are nice, despite being 5 years old at this point, and the audioscape is nice too.  I've been playing on Authentic difficulty, and the AI doesn't feel completely dumb running at you blindly, they will flank and suppress, nor does it feel  unfair and aimbotty or like enemies are bullet sponges to artificially inflate difficulty.

The bullet killcams are pretty cool (can be disabled), I imagine I may get bored of them eventually, but they seem to be infrequent enough that they're fun, but not annoying.

Overall I'm really enjoying the game, there's lots of content, and you can sink 1.5+ hours into each mission if you want to, exploring and completing secondary objectives.  Based on this experience, I'm looking forward to Sniper Elite 5, coming later this year, and definitely recommend people giving this a try, particularly on sale.",1643442467,1643442467,True,8,0,0.633263885974884033,0,True,False,False

If you enjoyed the original Hitman games like Silent Assassin, you'll enjoy this. If you are a fan of WW2-era weapons and history, you will enjoy this game even more. 

The story is great, the gameplay is great, the graphics are gorgeous, and it runs extremely well. Get together with a friend and take-on the campaign mode and see how many sets of testicles you can obliterate. 

The single-player modes have lots of replay value. There are at least 5 different ways to complete each mission and several side-missions with hidden lore and unlockable weapons and costumes. The challenges that earn you weapons upgrades and skins are actually fun without being too tedious, and teach you to use those weapons in ways that aren't necessarily apparent at first. 

This is a game that rewards patience and skill and makes you feel incredibly badass when you pull-off a long shot or a clever trap kill. I have been playing this game for at least 2 years and I keep going back to it when I need to blow off steam by eviscerating nazis. Killing Hitler never gets old, and there's so much content for completionist gamers to explore and unlock that, even at full-price and nearly 5 years since launch, it's still worthwhile.

Even on my laptop the graphics still look really good, and regarding the campaign this one had a pretty good story line and a great ending. Checking out the DLC missions and weapons is definitely worth it, especially when you have like 10 different ways to kill hitler. Game-play is smooth and the take-down animations are really refreshing. One downside would be that the customisation of individual weapon parts is not there like in Sniper elite 3. Upside would be that it was replaced with the weapon mastering system which in its own right makes it fun to grind, and also the huge amount of guns at your disposal which you adapt to in regards to your play style. I would also recommend Sniper elite V2 & 3 as they are also both great games. Definitely recommend if you love stealth games and killin nazis :).",1603524103,1643427349,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Sniper elite 3 doesnt have a fov slider too but i feel like the camera is a little bit further away and it has a little higher fov setting so that i can actually play.

You can probably mod this game to have a fov slider but i feel like that should just be a standard feature.

Let me review the review.

Its still dogshit. Im getting through it, its clunky, not much customisation, all the weapon upgrades are just a single thing and you have to unlock them by grinding specific kill types.. I don't even think there are enough enemies on a map to get some of them in one go.

Also, I have no idea how its managing enemy health. I shot guys in the head while shouldered and it wont down them, but use the scope and its a one shot kill even without the fancy bullet time thing.

All the character models are basically the same with very minor tweaks, The women look like the men with different hairstyles, not that there is even a very good selection of characters.


I fixed the window focus issue by swapping over to borderless fullscreen, but I mean thats a shame that the devs havnt fixed this issue because the posts I found while looking for the solution were from when the game initially released, like 2017... and some of them were the same issue but for Sniper Elite 2 so who knows what kind of herbs and spices the developers are huffing.",1641169679,1641299439,False,1,2,0.490066230297088623,0,True,False,False

The reason I suspect is because multiplayer is terrible. The run speed is entirely too fast and the ballistics are highly exaggerated, a 300 yard/meter shot is tricky with wind here. You can miss shots entirely by not accounting for wind or drop at 150 yards. Irl a rifle zeroed at 100 yards can hit anything from point blank to say 350 yards without adjustment. Granted you might get a heart shot aiming at the head but its not 6 feet low.  Prone stability is not what it should be.

You literally can't go through the single player missions without killing anyone except the main guys. This turns the game into sort of call of duty tier non-sense. IRL a sniper probably takes 3 shots max on a mission? Guessing here but short of SHTF snipers don't go out and kill 20 people on a mission even the 5 from the first mission are... well... very risky.

Pros:

-The gun shot when you fire your sniper rifle is still on point, I love the slow motion of it as well, when the bullet travels it's way to the target

At this point I haven't even touched the DLC missions.

As for the DLC, not a fan of paying for new weapons unless they come with a new map... but the devs have a number of weapons+skins packs.  I bought the season pass when it was on sale - otherwise I don't think I would've bought it.

There are a few annoyances in this game such as no FOV control; stuck in 3rd person when moving or firing secondary weapons (1st person only when zooming on rifle or binoculars); rarely sound/music bugging out when quicksaving/loading (requiring you to restart the game to fix); and AI occasionally being stupid or buggy.

This chapter in the series is set in the allied invasion of Italy and so covers scenarios set in Sicily, Naples, Cassino, etc.

This game can be fun if you switch off and dive into a clich√©-filled WW2 stealth game. Just don't take it too seriously or worry about realism. I recommend you turn up the difficulty level so the X-ray and mini-map cheats are not there to reveal the enemies: this slows the pace of the game down as you must be more careful, but the experience is better in my view.

Although this game has a good basic formula I think it's time for some innovations. For example improved AI or some new game play elements.

[h1]Positive[/h1]
[b]Level design[[/b] is well done, the maps contain a lot of paths, rooms, objects and atmosphere.

[b]It's not realistic[/b] this is important to set expectations for the game. It's not trying to be a military simulator with realistic sniping, you'll be disappointed if you want that. But it does pack a stealth/sniping game into maps where you spend an hour or two to hunt down maybe a hundred or more enemies, this format is not compatible with making a realistic experience but it fits a game experience.

[h1]Negative[/h1]
[b]Bullet camers[/b] have been a part of this series since the start, but I find them gross and disable them. The game could stand without them but it's too late now the series is known for them.

[b]Too many hints and cheats[/b] the default difficulty gives you too many hints to locate enemies. This makes it too easy. Turn off the X-ray vision and the minimap makes it a slower but more immersive experience. Shame the enemies still chat too much to give away their position or tell you they are reloading their guns.

[b]Slow upgrades[/b] it seems to take too long to earn the upgrades. I was just confused by the reward and progression system.

[b]Limited AI behavior[/b] seems the same as previous games. Probably time for innovations here in the next game to make the experience better.

Can run the campaign with another player, the whole thing, not required.    (Note, each player on own PC/own game buy/install/internet connection, not local co-op)

You can do survival (1-4 players) with max 12 waves of increasing number of bots and plenty of tweaking of them to make it more to your liking, say you want NO radar (indicating location in EASY/NORMAL/HARD difficulties)  you can turn that off, the 2 difficulties above that, don't have the radar!

There is a Co-Op mode for 2 players only, that each of you takes a different path in the areas, one of you can Sniper only and the other does all the closeup magic, basically one on overwatch the other sneaking around, it's a blast!

Has built in voice chat and works well!

At level 30, all your perks slot will be open to you, highly recommend mastering out weapons as part of your learning the game strategy/leveling up, and plenty of help to be found via search if you need some nuance help!

If into PvP, that is out there too, but I'm all Co-Op in this one, outstanding, some bugs but nothing that made me rage quit, plus even if the internet is being a pain, it can be played off-line albeit some modes of play are not a/v then obviously.

One thing of note, no cross play with console players if that was important factor for you.

If you own Zombie Army 4, different flavor, but I like and play both and looking forward to SE5 next year!

Now a wonderful bargain game and still going back to it again and again!

It was a blast, and a great way to relax and spend a couple hours while stuck in quarantine. I'm a casual gamer, so the lower-moderate difficulties were the perfect casual shooter experience. The freedom that this game gives you in how you tackle the challenges before you is unparalleled, you can run in guns blazing, or you can try and ghost mission (completing the mission without getting caught). The freedom is one of the many things this game has going for it. The Target Fuhrer DLC is also worth the price, I mean, you get to kill Hitler, who wouldn't wanna do that!? The campaign would introduce new challenges at every mission, keeping every mission a fresh experience. The story was a little lack-luster, but was fundamentally solid and I was more focused on headshotting Nazis to care all that much. The survival mode is also a blast, setting traps, picking enemies off from a distance, and blowing them away up close with a Double-Barreled Shotgun or Thompson. The fun factor gets a shot of steroids when you add friends to the mix, I can't tell you how many times my friends and I had an amazing time seeing who could get the most testicle shots, or blowing each other up with satchel charges. Now I've sung a lot of praise, but there is one thing to consider. The replay value is there for the campaign, but it's there with friends or upped difficulty. I will also say, if you are trying to gold all of the weapons (which I am currently doing) it can be a real grind sometimes (have you ever tired getting kidney shots on purpose?). In my opinion though, totally worth the price tag and I'm very excited for Sniper Elite 5.

the game has a great story line amazing, DLC's. And has multiplayer.

[h1] The summary [/h1] 

This game is good. It has great mechanics the kills are satisfying and the location are varied enough that every level feels special with his own challenges to overcome and overall i recommend it.

[h1] The good [/h1] 

- [u]There is a difficulty for you. [/u] It does not matter if this is your first time holding a virtual sniper rifle or you are a  pc shooter veteran because there is a difficulty for you. If you want a more laid-back experience where you are running through bullets and popping nazi heads left and right i suggest you start on the normal or easy difficulty and getting to hard as you become more and more comfortable with the game mechanics but if you want a more ''realistic''  where you are hiding in a bush waiting for the perfect moment to strike and keeping track of your bullets in your your mag so you dont waste any of them when on the floor when you reload kind of  experience then you should start on hard and shorty after that move on to hardcore and hardcore+

- [u]The levels are great. [/u] They look pretty and having a lot of variation in their aspect it never feels like you are always stuck  in the same place doing the mission objectives with exploration being rewarded withuseful ammo and medkits and even soem secrets if you get lucky

- [u]The combat is fun. [/u] The ragdolls are funny the shooting feels great and the reloading animations are decent. The game has an aim assist that you can use from the difficulty easy to hard and putting a higher focus on map knowledge and enemy placement but hardcore and hardcore+ doesnt have an aim assist or a minimap and the enemies hit harder and you get spotted more easily. You will have to account for distance lenght from your target and wind speed if you ever want to get a headshot with the sniper rife again, you will have to choose your targets carefully and play more stealthy and using traps direct combat not being recommended without having a plan. 

- The gun variety in this game with all guns having differents strengths and weaknesses with thier stats getting better the more you use them

- [u] The killcams... oh boy....the killcams... are great![/u] showing you in detail where exactly you shot that german without being too gory or over the top, in my 120 hours i havent got bored of them yet but if you do you will probably be glad to find out that you can make them appear less  or disable them entirely in the options meniu. 

- [u] The dlcs maps are well made and i feel like they really add something to the experience[/u] and  in fact they were  my favorite! Although i will say that in a game about ww2 and shooting germans i feel like shooting hitler should be in the base game and not a dlc 

[h1] The bad [/h1] 

- [u]The A.I should react to the trap you put on the floor more often[/u] ... come on, did he really didnt see that huge ass trap my in front of him? 
 
- [u]Hard to find players on multiplayer of for co-op[/u]. Alrought the co-op is not a problem if you own the game i saw that no so many people play mutiplayer being hard to find a good server and is very rare to find a full one altought this may or not be a problem depending where you live is something to keep note of.

- [u]Not having a minimap is hard to get used to [/u]. I understand that hardcore is supposed to be HARD like that the point but i found not having a minimap  and the game not showing me where i have to go infuriating  since the map pretty big and this lead to me walking past objectives and wandering the map  aimlessly, killing everyone and hoping that i would stumble upon the main thing i had to do. I got better at this at time when on but for me at least it was a pretty steep learning curve 

- [u]The locked weapons  behind DLC.[/u] It sucks and it shouldnt be a thing. The game full price is about 60 dollars/euro why do 50% of the guns be looked behind a DLC? is infuriating.
 
- [u] Melee kills are too easy to get. [/u] In campain this isnt a huge problem but is still pretty wierd  how you can scare them when running up to them if they are not aware of your presence locking them in to an animation allowing you to get easy kills.  in multiplayer however... things change and is still  very easy to get melee kills by camping in a bush scanning for movement and then running up to you and killing you leaving very little time for you to react and giving you PTSD thinking that   someone is watching  always you  and shooting every bush  like we are in vietnam.


[h1] The  conclusion  [/h1] 

The game has it flaws some flaws? yes, many that i didnt talk about because i didnt want to make this book of a review any longer than it is  but is a good game and you should give it a chance although i would recommend getting it on a sale with the DLC's being around 10 euros and honestly i think is worth it.",1577474056,1640016960,True,1,0,0.5,0,True,False,False

i finished the entire campaign including all DLCs on Sniper Elite difficulty, and also i spend around 10-15 hours on survival mode (both solo and tag team with other players) 

well if you play this series before i believe i don't have anything much to say, because the gameplay still satisfied as the predecessor, plus more gorgeous graphic and if you buy this during 75-85% discount for deluxe edition, there is nothing to complain, 

but for those whose never play this series before, this is a ""major"" stealth game mechanics, but if you want to be a Rambo, sure you can do that too, but from my experience that i try both way, i feel stealth is the way developer would like us to play, because it's really fun, for the story this one took place in Italy during world war II, it's fictional combined with base on true (event, character) and by the way, don't let the name of the game fool you, there is plenty of firearms for you to play, not just sniper rifle, depending on your style like i said, so if you are looking for TPS with great quality of game, wait for sale (Winter Sale about to come after all) and grab this one you won't regret, oh but don't forget everything inside this game is ""At the world war II Era""

That's it for this game from my perspective (actually there is several multiplayer modes, but less people still playing them, but if you patient enough to wait then maybe some few people will join you, or if you want to play Survival, please just add me, i still craving to kill Fascist and Nazi though)

Positive:
1. Gameplay is somewhat decent and simulates sniping atmosphere pretty good, the X-ray after effect is a nice addition although too many is sickening so I minimize it.
2. The main character voice acting suits this game.

Negative:
1. Overall graphic is a bit below mediocre, in general view graphic is mediocre but graphic for far distance place is bad (the first map, San Celini Island is very obvious for sea outside of main island).

2. Little buggy, I encounter 2x crash during loading and 1x funny bug, mc died immediately after talking to Kessler in interrogation. I cant reproduce them again.

3. Enemy often has sixth sense, first is when I look at soldiers from far away with binoculars, enemy soldiers just act casually without suspect but when I look with rifle scope wanting to snipe him, enemy somehow often acts a bit evasive. Second when I did some legit stealth kill (did it from behind without victim suspecting and other enemies are not closed by), other enemies are often alerted. Both happen in peaceful, not alert mode.

4. Common weapons. I can understand developer charging us for extra missions and special weapons, but I cannot accept developer charging more for common weapon in WW2 such as grease gun, sten gun. Please dont be too greedy.

1. Nicely made game. I think this is the best sniping experience that you can get as of date.
2. Wide range of sniping rifles with lots of mastering to do
3. Well thought of scenarios
4. You can play this game like a real sniper or go for ALL BANG!
5. The videos of bullets cracking through skull or testicles is interesting to watch but may get boring after some time. I have it switched off in my settings. I play lot of multiplayer and do not want that interfering with the gameplay.
6. I really liked the ghillie suit (Part of DLC). That really helps me be a part of the foliage and knife an unsuspecting enemy. More fun to use it in multiplayer games.
7. The multiplayer game offers you 10 base maps which can be tweaked to play different scenarios for example Death Match, Team Death Match, Capture the Flag etc.
8. I loved the Authentic Plus Mode (With Bullet Drop and Wind). Once you get used to this, you may not like playing any other mode.

[THINGS I DID NOT LIKE]

1. The Game has lot of bugs/glitches. This becomes a PITA especially in the multiplayer when people take advantage of it.
2. The ability to shoot long distances without aiming. One may argue that they do aim but right clicking to briefly open the scope and then left clicking to shoot is not aiming. You cannot do that in real life.
3. The ability to spin and shoot. This is really stupid. Again, something which you cannot do in real life.
4. Spawn Points. Your teammate can block a spawn point. Because of this your entire team spawns at that same place. Then it is like shooting ducks in a barrel.
5. There have been no recent updates. It becomes boring playing same map again and again after some time.

[WOULD LOVE TO HAVE THE BELOW]

1. More multiplayer maps. It becomes quite boring to play the same map again and again for so many years

[SUGGESTION]

1. Do not buy this game at full price. Not worth it. Wait for the sale and then buy. And during the sale get all the DLC. It is really worth it!
2. Play the campaign map first before playing multiplayer. Get used to your rifle and the gameplay first else you will get lost in multiplayer and finally may give up the game in frustration.
3. Please do not blindly follow the Youtube videos. The most common mistake that newbies do is go to places shown in those videos and get killed by pros.
4. Have an open Steam Profile (Especially the gaming hours). Ensure you do not have VAC/Game Bans. Else you will not be able to play in most of the servers.",1613372567,1637915783,True,10,1,0.61515277624130249,0,True,False,False

I don't know if it's because this is my first Sniper Elite game, but this is an experience that really gives you the true sense that you are an elite Sniper. I put 48 hours into Sniper Elite 4 at the time this review was written and I'm going to try to explain why I enjoyed the game so much in great detail, and pointing out some of it's faults. Alright, let's get started.


[h1]Story and Campaign[/h1]


Set behind enemy lines in fascist Italy before Operation Avalanche, 1943. You are Karl Fairburne, a British Commando who is seemingly a one-man army. The Germans have created some kind of new 'Wonder Weapon' capable of destroying naval vessels with deadly accuracy, and It's your job to find out how to stop it and ultimately loosen Nazi Germany's grip on Italy.
Avoiding spoilers for any new player for this game, that's about it story wise. As for the main characters, they appear as wood, who seem incapable of changing their facial expression, even the character you play as- don't tell me you really like Karl. And I get that he's a commando and all, but it's hard to really give a damn about the cast when you're making fun of them like I and my friends were. Hell, they even give you the option to play as a different character after you beat a mission for the first time, but you'll still have Karl's commentary going in the background. I can give credit to the game for making me laugh though.


[h1]Gameplay and Coop[/h1]


First, graphically speaking, Sniper Elite 4 looks absolutely beautiful on max settings; The payout for the specs is totally worth it. I gotta tell you, the mission design is amazing, the levels are huge, average around 40 minutes to complete, and you can play through it any way you want to. Grab a friend and play coop campaign; it's so much fun. 
The progression for weapons in Sniper Elite 4 is unique and creative. Instead of getting generic kills to progress weapon unlocks, you must complete a series of challenges for said weapon for damage, reduced kick, etc. The Stealth in this game is done very well compared to many I've played, though the A.I can be a little silly at times.

[h1]Rating[/h1]

My final rating for Rebellion's Sniper Elite 4 is a strong 8/10. If you want it, I recommend purchasing the Sniper Elite 4 Deluxe Edition. On sale of course. The extra content with it will add much more to your experience with all DLC including another campaign.

I hope my review helped you out.",1519397450,1637779060,True,29,3,0.74442136287689209,0,True,False,False

First thing's first: The sniping is fun. it's challenging and it takes some time on the range to figure out how to aim, but there are some basic rules you can learn that will help you. And the kill cams are extremely satisfying. There's a reason it's what this game series is known for. 

So far I've only played the first 3 levels but I have to say I'm extremely impressed with the level design, especially on the first two. There is a LOT of freedom in terms of which way you go and there is a lot to explore and discover.

Stealth in this game is pretty good, the noise you make matters and there are environmental factors you can use to help keep yourself unseen from an audio perspective (e.g. masking the sound of your rifle by timing your shots to be disguised by an environmental ambient noise). Also when the soldiers are looking for you they do a good job of actually searching every location so you do have to be careful.

Once the AI finds you they do a pretty good job of attacking you. I'd say there may be some scenarios where maybe the AI could be better (e.g. in the first mission I believe that at the very least the big general you're trying to kill should be barricading himself in a room or something or trying to escape once it's known that your an enemy trying to kill him, not actively searching for you himself). But overall they are smart enough to kill you and able to be manipulated in a pretty consistent way, which is a must in a stealth game.

Also, these levels are LONG. Like 1-2 hours per level with a lot of stuff to do in each, on top of just killing nazis. you can find letters/documents that can give you hints about objectives and do a good job world building. Overall they are very well done.

I'm gonna give this game an 8/10. It's solid fun, and with the dlc there is a lot of content and a lot of nazi's to kill. Also you can shoot Hitler's right nut off. What's there not to like?

And even though I've only been playing the easy level, it's not easy-easy. Bullets and explosives are a lot to be found in this level, but not the silent ones, so I'm still forced to do stealthy strategies. The x-ray cameras can be set as off, but even that I set it on, it's not too regular that it annoys me. Besides, watching ruptured organs and testicles for killshot never gets old. But of course the A.I in this level are not that smart, as to be expected.

While Karl as a protagonist is a little over-dramatically presented, the game play is phenomenal. The world is much more open with multiple ways to accomplish many tasks and varied approaches and strategies can be applied to each level. There are five levels of difficulty - I am playing through on level 3 now and I'm still finding new options and locations I haven't seen before. For me this game hits that narrow sweet spot of being too challenging to be boring and not so difficult that it becomes frustrating.

Authentic plus will tingle your perfectionism, one error can spell disaster and sometimes the perfect run hinges on that one shot.

On top of being an amazing stealth game it functions surprisingly well as a standard action-shooter, which the game will inevitably devolve into on your first mission attempts.",1635428828,1635428828,True,4,0,0.54848170280456543,0,True,False,False
