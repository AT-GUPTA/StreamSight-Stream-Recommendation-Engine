- sect system has a lot of potential

I want to keep playing it, but I often find myself closing it randomly (not alt+f4 in frustration just... closing it). I wish I could tell you what was missing because there's so many things they got right. It's definitely worth the money though, especially as the devs are actively building it. I predict that when the devs are done with this it will be an amazing game.

For the good stuff:
- The mini games for combat and social battle are very fun
- The meridian puzzles are very rewarding and just an awesome system overall
- The sect systems are cool (though they need some refinement)
- I like being able to tame things
- The sheer amount of skills, abilities, and inner kung fu available is great
- There so much freedom in how you approach the game
- The tile system is a really cool way to build out the world

First piece of feedback for the devs would be to have more sound in the game, currently when wandering around the map the lack of sound makes it feel more dead than it is. Even just ambient noise would help. While it's relaxing it's also TOO relaxing and makes me wonder why I'm not just taking a nap.

Second thing I can say should be improved is creating some tension for the player, the game is very much ""at your own pace"" but there's basically nothing pushing me to do more than just sit on the ground and meditate all day. Maybe have there be a rival or something like in many xianxia light novels, make the character need to eat regularly early on, or have kung fu masters/other sects challenge you randomly. Currently the only mechanism that exists are bandits which are mid-game only.

Lastly try to fix some of the cheese tactics currently in the game, like buying a house and being able to take 10x more money then you just spent out of the grocery cabinet (just make the house cost the total of all the items in it, it's so easy to build a house you don't ever need to buy them). Or recruiting the master of a sect via social battle to reduce to sect duel difficulty when taking over their sect.

Embrace the absurdity of wuxia, and you'll be fine. Runs great (i.e., made to run in internet cafe computers), plays very cleanly, and absolutely unique. It's rock-paper-scissors, but the kind you played with your friends where you also had a gun and a sword. I enjoy just watching the people in my world chill and develop, build their houses, have children, and then go terrorize some dude because he had the gall to steal their books.
So you get bored, and you enter the fray; you find the bandit building his new house, turning a new leaf - character development, right? Then you talk to him, find he still hates you since you stole his kung-fu, and he immediately challenges you to a verbal duel. You win, then you actually duel him. You win again, because you stole his kung-fu. You then sabotage his house, and find him again, only for him to barely win in a fight before stealing your clothes. You mald for a bit, then track him down again, and take his head. You then mount this on a shelf in your house, and this is a normal day in TMK. Die, reincarnate, and repeat the mistakes of your ancestors. Great fun, just wish I didn't have to translate for my friends the poems for each new location.
Keep in mind two things:

1. It's a Chinese game. UI is jank at times, but works somehow. Don't ask me, it just works. All the items and text (well, apart from some of it...) are rather accurate, if equally jank. You will, however, be shepherded into a rough understanding of the game that will keep getting better, regardless of language. Runs like a dream, optimized well enough, and artistic as you can imagine.

The AI is on the weaker side but for the game itself it doesn't need a super robust AI (worth noting the dev are working on the AI)

In my second life I took on many jobs, completed many of them and obtained ""wealth"", I decided that since I have money that I should now grow stronger so I joined a sect. While training with a sect leader I receive word that a auction was going on and decided I should flex on the poor. I bought a treasure map and went into the desert to find this great treasure, however upon reaching the peak of the mountain I realized I was surrounded by thorns and before I knew it I was unconscious and fell off the clip breaking most of my bones. Then a small child found me and asked ""what are you doing? are you stupid?"" then carried me to a discreet location where they cut my throat.  

In my third life I decided to tame a crew of monkeys, then I used the money they gained by begging on street corners to buy friendship with a local military commander. Before I knew it him and the other high ranking leaders considered me their literal brother and swore to vanquish my enemies. They harassed and showered me with gifts including large sums of gold so I used it to finance my ""common sense housing"" policy where I make every roamer a dirt farmer in my community by selling them a trash house and gaslighting them into farming. Once finished I joined the beastmaster sect, then I used my autistic rizz to seduce the female leader of the sect making her my lover and by default the sect now considered me a brother and told me to build my own beastmaster sect. At this point I had my lover, two outer disciples, 8 monkeys, and four boars following me home when suddenly a horde of bandits appear and attack us from both sides. I killed many with the use of the arhat fist and soultakers song techniques but the last bandit plunged his sword into my chest cavity and my ""budding"" empire came to a close.

I could see it possibly becoming something good down the road after at least another 6 months to a year in development. As it stands right now, its just a hodgepodge of different gimmicks and mechanics that don't work very well together. 

Despite having many tutorials, tips, and hints, the game is just not intuitive. I've heard some reviews compare this game with Kenshi, which it most certainly is not. 

The UI is an atrocious mess, hard to remember where anything is, and difficult in general to navigate. The skill system is all over the place, and most of them don't seem to do much of anything. Because of this, there is no natural feeling of progression here. 

To make up for the lack of content, the devs resorted to adding a number of unnecessarily complex systems such as the Chi board, where you can drag your mouse around metaphysical nodes to boost various attributes. Nothing you do here is permanent, and can be redone at any time on whim. The battle system, which makes up the core of the game, is yet another gimmick. The animations are well done but, at least for me, I couldn't determine intuitively how to reliably ""win"" an engagement. Its really just a bunch of dragging your mouse around the screen to various attacks until one of you dies. Once you do win, you'll see a bunch of skill-ups quickly scroll your screen. But again, there is no feeling of actual progression, and you'll start just ignoring the messages. 

Likewise the crafting system is equally bad. You gain skill levels in crafting as you craft things, which logically opens up new crafting options for you. However, some of these options require gold to unlock. Who are you paying this gold to, yourself? That makes little sense itself, but then they add 'crafting insight' materials as a requisite for further unlocks. You get them automatically as you level up anyway, again making the whole mechanic entirely pointless. 

The building system is alright, and you have some blueprints to choose from right out of the gate. The homes look pretty good, but the whole system is put to shame due to the crafting annoyances. You shouldn't be able to build a 3 bedroom home with two clicks instantaneously, yet you're unable to craft basic furniture. 

Its like a group of children got together and left all their ideas strewn about the development floor. There's little rhyme or reason to much of it. But somewhere in there is the foundation for something reasonable, maybe. But if this is what the devs put together so far, I am not sure I have faith in their ability to streamline and cleanup this smattering of different design ideas while at the same time adding reasonable content to the game.",1708479209,1708479209,False,0,0,0.454545468091964722,0,True,False,True
1696440,158852513,76561197989298452,0,18,816,0,816,1707756853,"It seems like a very fun game, IF it ever gets finished. It needs the following MAJOR changes: translation, it shouldn't be so difficult. We have a worldwide web, USE IT. There are plenty of people who can translate from chinese to english, and vice versa. The chinese population is absolutely massive, and i refuse to believe that these services are somehow not available. Second major point of concern: the graphics. The graphics look like this whole thing was shoved into a 2013 ALPHA engine. This raises a big red flag for me, im concerned the developer wil never 'go pro' so to speak. You dont really see this in the screenshots, as these are for obvious reasons, cherry picked. The actual game however looks really, REALLY, bad. And i'm a gameplay over graphics guy, old school gamer. But there is no excuse to use such low quality even with all the free engines and assets available.

Long story short, it looks, reads, and feels, like an alpha version of something developed a decade ago. I know this as i've had actual alpha versions of various games back in that day and they looked exactly like this. 

However, the idea is 10/10, the combat is 10/10, because it feels like a card game to me and i love that. But as of right now, the game is incredibly hollow and it just looks really, really, really bad. As in, hurts my eyes, bad. The desert environment looks the best, the rest.. once wet.. shines like 4 suns into your eyes. Texture lighting is also really harsh, to the point where internally i'd be hoping for a pixelated downgrade.

Another example of why steam needs a point system and not just thumb up or down. This is NOT A BAD GAME. It deserves it's positive reviews, and for a reason. However, i dislike modern steam ethics, where people circlejerk in games like this and shoot down any criticism ""because muh ratings"". This game is heavily, heavily flawed, and as is, is very hard to play or get into. 

It needs more information, and a professional translator, as translating from [xxx] to [english] should always be a priority unless you decide to release whatever product you make locally. If you wish to use the international market, then speak the international language: english. There are many systems that are poorly explained, if at all. These systems however are critical as this whole game hangs together like a spiders web, where literally anything can interact with anything. Again, GREAT IDEA, and the execution is not too bad either. But for now i wil use a thumbs down for this review simply in hopes that it gets more attention that way and that it's read more often.

Dear developers, focus on language (and i can't believe im saying this..) fix your graphics engine or just use another one? It genuinely hurts my eyes. The textures are very sharp, very bright, and don't get me started on rain. 

The gameplay however, is brilliant, and i can definitely see where this is going and its a good path to be on. But for now i wil use my early access privileges to mention all these things. After all, that is what it is for.",1708478727,1708478727,False,1,1,0.479651182889938354,0,True,False,True

It completely ruined my character because I had to pay an 8k gold fine to get out early (which I didn't have because I had just spent it all on drugs) and so I would have had to wait for a RL hour to finish my prison sentence. Plus, trying to build up your favor with anyone without having a ton of skills maxed out sucks hard. It is definitely doable ( and I know because I spent a couple of hours doing it) so I won't complain about it too much, but it is annoying if you are trying to learn leechcraft or get in the good graces of anyone early on in your game.
Mods might (and probably do) have some fixes for these things, but most of them are in Chinese so it is a bit of a hassle to search through them unless you are a native-level Chinese reader or have a webpage with an auto-translate function.
Long story short, take a few steps away from your computer, ignore what you've seen on Youtube, and decide for yourself if you want a conditionally more difficult, Chinese version of Kenshi.",1708312531,1708312531,False,3,0,0.516935467720031738,0,True,False,True

First the fighting system. You have several basic fight moves you can use and you use a certain amount to unlock special moves. The enemy projects the movies it'll make and you cant ""counter"" them to basically. You can hold 6 special moves, and you unlock more by completeing quests. During the fight you can counter the enemies moves (which are telegraphed to you) a certain amount of times to basically stop their turn. You can see the chart on the topmiddle of the screen during the fight. This is your bread and butter the first few characters because you are very weak untill you get more karma (more on that later)

You start the game on a small square map (wake up on a boat with no memory) complete some tutorials and learn the basics and complete a quest which unlocks a new map tile that you place your self. So the game play loop is complete quest for your tile of the map, unlock placing a tile on the map of which you get to pick from 4. The new tile will have a new quests you need to accomplish to unlock a new tile.  The tiles range from cute little towns to massive castles to just wilderness or lavafields. Also you get a powerup when completeting the quest so you can make your basic moves hit harder or you can unlock more special moves.

There's also npcs running all over the map that you can befriend, marry, enslave, hire, teach, or learn from. They are also running around doing their own things so they can and will fight each other and die. 

The game is a roguelike in a ways in when you die you use the karma from your life to make a new character where you get more health or unlocks depending on points you acquired in your previous play. you play on the same map and if you're lucky you can even find your old loot so the setback is more getting the skills you lost. 

There are also animals you can tame and name. I tamed a monkey who upon getting my butt kicked by a very strong enemy picked me up and ran me to a hosptial.  This game is pretty silly at times to, you can have a kungfu fight with a dog, or a chicken, or a snake and its pretty funny. They also will occasionally pitch in on t he fights.

That's been my experience so far. and this is a medium to high recommend - it's a very quirky game but if the above sounds fun you can't beat the price.

1. Crafted a nice cozy lodge which was immediately sold to some nosey martial artist because he looked like he could kill me with a sneeze.

2.  Started my epic journey by helping a local hunter to kick some monkey butts. Rejected any reward and got a nice equipment and enough brownie points to learn the secrets of taming.

3. Obviously went back to tame a monkey slave so that it can beg outside my new house. The fisherman who rescued me was the first victim to my begging syndicate.

4. After a week of sleepless nights, finally figured out the ancient art of crafting a small straw mat. Who knew a good night's sleep was just a bunch of straws away? 

5. Decided to recruit my hunter buddy to help me clear out some bandits.

6. With the hunter's help, we found their camp and pounded a bandit senseless and snagged all his loot – because sharing is caring, right?

7. As my trusty hunter friend was taking a break, the bandit pulled a fast one on me, ambushed me, beat me silly, and even trapped me in a cage.

8. The hunter returned with an elder martial artist from some sect, and together we gave the bandit another beating – but sheesh, he hid all my stuff! The elder offered me a spot in her sect, though.

9.  Went cliff-diving for a hidden chest and, surprise surprise, broke my leg. What happened to my qi-gong?!

10.  The bandit showed up again wanting to join my crew after so many beatings. I figured, why not? He's my personal walking insurance policy now. 

11. Checked the fucker's inventory, and lo and behold, he had all my stuff from before! But he demanded gold to trade it back. Fine, you can be my bodyguard, but this better be a long-term commitment! 

12.  Dragged my broken-legged self to the clinic for healing, only to witness the bandit sneak up and murder the doctor. Checked her pockets – yup, he took all her loot too! 

13.  Realized the shop belonged to no one, so I went ahead and helped myself to the counter's inventory, claimed the house, and locked it up tight. Who needs a real estate agent when you've got a monkey-taming, bandit-befriending genius? 

14.  Checked out the new sect and managed to tick off one of the inner-disciples. Oops, my bad! 

15.  Met the sect master and, in a bold move, threw all my newly acquired wealth from the clinic at her feet. Instead of a promotion, I accidentally became her lover – well, who can resist a man with a broken leg and a bandit buddy? 

16.  Got the sect master wifey to spill all the sect's techniques, flaunting my knowledge in front of the envious inner-disciple. Just another day in the life of a monkey-taming, bandit-befriending, sect-loving legend! 

Although early access, this game is worth every penny on steam.

Be a slave, a fisherman, a farmer, tame animals and then sell them, learn skills from strangers who later turn out to be your enemies or friends. Found your own sect and develop your own fighting style. Master the art of begging and get both your friends and complete strangers to shower you in silver coins out of pure pity. Meditate and develop powerful new skills through mental strength and sheer will.
Fall off a mountain, break your legs and get kidnapped by bandits. Build your house, then visit the nearest pub and its local boozers to drink with them until you lose your mind. Why? First of all because you can, secondly because you have chosen the ""school of drunken kungfu"" and now get buffs if you and your opponent are drunk while fighting. The wife of one of the local alcoholics is angry because her husband has been drinking too much and blames ""YOU"" for it? No problem, duel with her in a verbal duel using ""friendly"" and ""thoughtful"" words.

-I greatly enjoyed the game for what it is currently, however It needs to expands its game to become something great. I see potential and here are the things i have seen that can be improved or implemented. 

Needs more 
-Unique monsters  (example... Twin tailed fox, Tri Tailed wolf, ANYTHING FROM A MANGA IN THIS GENRE)
-PETS put essence into pets( eggs) 
-Actual Boss Monsters 
-ACTUAL CLANS TO TRAIN TO SAGE
-Unique items -> cannot craft 
-Unique Situations 
-Unique Resources 
-Better NPC (""AI"") ... IF i die skip so world is unique for NPC's evolving too (good example Shadow of war LOTR game)
-more skills that are harder to get (need high level sect rep) 
-Need Harder way to gain rep(can just teach dude 1 technique and get like 1k rep) (or make higher level unique skills harder to get etc 100k rep or 10k rep) 
-Enhance Weapons 
-SAGE cannot be the top tier its too easy 
-needs more unique maps 

Concerns 
-Cannot beat person in Tournament but can beat them in the world?
-NPC DIES IF I HAVE ANY EFFECTS AND KNOCK THEM OUT?!?!? now I'm fighting everyone since they're mad ( i said spare them).  

FINAL 
-making the map takes ages and you kill too many people and ruin the world without any reformation of the NPC's or global economy.
-No ruler expands in an accurate timeline
-I can pick gear up from previous lifetime (why did no one lese pick up 1 million $$$ worth of items?) 
-Needs advance of skills 
-Needs combining of skills to create new ones 
-Use more imagination for skills

Thank you, Sseth, for teaching me what that pharse means in the first place, or it would go over my head.

The game is already a fun sandbox. Interface is a bit messy. English is mostly readable. If more depth is added with time, it's gonna be an instant classic soon enough.

It's single-character-focused Kenshi where you build the world yourself (out of several blocks) and try to become the most powerful martial artist you can be.

Let me explain further.
You play a Martial Artist in a Wuxia kind of world - so lots of soaring mountains and suddenly hostile Terrain. The World has to be constructed Piece by Piece - every time you solve the Challenge that came with a World Tile, you are awarded a choice of Tiles to add to the World. The way you solve these Challenges differs - some are solved by building specific Buildings, some by interacting with People, finding hidden Chests, learning a specific Technique or the old Standby - killing stuff.
The Combat System for this is pretty unique; you are presented with several Moves on your Screen as well as Modifiers that can apply to these Moves. You combine the Moves and Modifiers in Sequence and once you are done, apply them to the Enemy. What Moves you get depends on your Martial Arts, how effective they are depends on your stats and your Inner Kungfu. Sounds strange, plays very fluidly. 
Not so the Dialogue Minigame, which is a fun little Deckbuilder in Theory, but intransparent and surprisingly time consuming in Practice.

Overall though it's immense fun to build your own Wuxia Zhangjiajie to hop around in, squad of drunk Monkeys in tow, on your Way to beg for spare change on the Stairs of the Forbidden City.

SsethTzeentach's Video on this game should have turbocharged its visibility in the West, which I hope will lead to an influx of english-language-based mods because currently, I can't understand a single mod on the Workshop and I would really like that to change.

Finally, a few notes on things I was hoping for that didn't yet manifest in the current game:
-Sect interaction seems really limited right now, but I suspect this will be a high Priority for the Devs, so just a Note for now.
-Generally, due to the Nature of the Tile System, nothing really seems like a part of a larger Ecosystem - every Tile is self-contained. I was hoping there would be adjacency-based modifiers or Tiles that change if they neighbor one another, and while that may come, the current System doesn't seem built for that.
-The Nature of Translation from Chinese makes some parts, like the short Sequences when you meditate on an Enlightenment or the Songs/Poems some NPCs sing, really hard to appreciate. I know what it is supposed to do, it just doesn't land the way it's supposed to in English.

And, as always, this is Early Access, so lots of unfinished or broken stuff, like the Art Skills or the Process of becoming a Sage in anything but Combat.

This is a great strength of the game and a big part of why it's so playable despite the currently poor translation (which, apparently, has been improving over time). Many of these open ended sandbox games throw the player into the world and expect them to read a comprehensive guide or play through a lengthy tutorial, little of which is usually absorbed. The Matchless Kungfu instead gives brief notes on gameplay mechanics as you encounter them, but other than a brief combat tutorial, new systems are often introduced organically when you choose to seek them out.

Unless your only goal in life is to beat the snot out of everyone weaker than you, you don't always have the ability to do what you want to right away, and the challenge is in figuring out how to achieve your goals. This creates a satisfying loop where systems are only ever introduced to you when you choose to seek them out, but unlike in many games, these unlocks aren't behind grind mechanics that don't respect your time and exist solely to stretch the game. It's about deciding how to get to what you want to do. If you have the ability to train a skill to its next level you usually need a minute or less once you're there. 

As a Kenshi player, one of my first goals was to establish my own settlement and sect. But you don't start the game with the ""Establishment"" skill and the only way to initially learn it is to seek out a teacher. So that guided me to learn about instructors, to meet the other sects I had placed in the world, figure out how their hierarchy works, and ultimately find someone high ranking to teach me about Establishment. After a [i]very[/i] brief 15 second lesson, I knew enough to plant a flag and throw together a basic structures. And finally, with all those stepping stones taken and the knowledge of important game mechanics planted in my brain in a very organic way, I was able to start learning how building a settlement works piece by piece as well.",1707738892,1707738892,True,1,0,0.500486433506011963,0,True,False,True

Props to that guy!

Also, whoever made the music for the mouth-cannon argument battles. That guy needs a raise too! Best-fitting thematic music I think I've had the pleasure of hearing in any media (off the top of my head)


If you want an actual blurb of the game:
Kinda RPG, mixed with ""card game"", mixed with whatever the amazing hell is the acupuncture/meridians/""passive skill"" mechanic.

I'm not usually too in to card games, but the ""card"" mechanics are kept simple, or hidden enough that I didn't particularly notice? them. This might actually be a downside to card lovers.
For those that are interested: 
- the number of moves you have in combat is limited (a hand), and  is drawn from a pool (deck) of summed ""activation costs"" of your active skills. There are also other things that will affect swapping/drawing/discarding ""moves"", but I don't wanna get too far in to spoiler territory.
- the verbal combat game is DEFINITELY more like a card game/deck builder. You have an active pool of cards (let's say 'deck'), every turn you can add 1 card to your 'deck', then it's shuffled and 9 cards are drawn and played face up. Those cards can affect each other (usually neighbour cards), and/or get exiled. Your ""damage value"" goes up by the total of the card's resolved values and effects. A further ""meta"" is that you get new cards you can pool from (buy?) by unlocking them with skills or other interactions in the game. Such as chaining enough passive skills in the acupuncture board.

Other than that, it's pretty standard Chinese Wuxia

- Mystical lands
- Auctions
- Martial arts abound in traditional mystical China
- Yin, Yang, Gu, and Dao (if I'm not mistaken) powers, but kinda low-fantasy. You're not slinging fireballs, but hitting someone with your fire-charged internal energy may give them some small burns.
- and yes, you can still eat shit v.v. at least this one doesn't exactly encourage it.

Combined with a Sect (clan) management
Open world building (yes, you CAN build in someone else's house, but that stuff will belong to them now)

Even the music and atmosphere are nice

really, it's quite compelling in my opinion

And at the price they're asking (£12 last I checked), it's an easy sell for anyone in to Wuxia, or even just RPGs

Down sides?
Yes, there are some bugs (like the final level up trainers are missing. But you can still TALK your way to max level, or luck out with a manual at auction). 
Yes, some of the translations are janky. 
Yes, the game mechanics can feel somewhat dense to get in to (especially with the translation)

Matchless Kungfu is one of the strangest games I have ever played, and I have been having nothing short of a blast with it. You must embrace the absurdity of it all to get the full experience. Matchless is a sandbox, so what you do is up to you. You can join a clan, or start your own and turn it into an empire. You can become an assassin, or turn towards something more mild, and open a tavern. Or you can make a living by fist fighting ferrets and selling their meat. Anything's possible in the martial world. 

The experience is only enhanced by the often incomprehensible and jumbled translations, and you'll find that a lot of mechanics you just have to learn through doing. Even so, the most important bits are understandable, so you won't be totally in the dark. 

There are glitches, and there's plenty of things that just feel jank, but it adds to the experience. As I said, you just have to embrace it, and you'll have a fantastic time.",1707715535,1707715535,True,2,1,0.524250805377960205,0,True,False,True

I would recommend it but at the same time probably only if this is your kind of thing, ... that being said I didn't know if this would be my thing going into it... so you may have to play it to know for sure, that being said you could probably tell if you would like it within the first 2 hours of play, so I guess worst case you could refund it assuming you don't go over 2 hrs,

seeing as this could feel a little long

I joined the Drunken sect because I thought it would be funny to go around fighting people while drunk. I roamed around teaching random strangers (including bandits) the ""Groin Kick"" (how to kick in the balls) martial art to gain reputation and good will with them.
I then went around doing quests after befriending the sect master and elder (12k and 13k vigor respectively) and recruited them as followers. after my second quest they promptly died by freezing to death after saving my ass from freezing to death. I buried them and became the sect leader. and now have been raising up my sect to become the strongest in the world.

I looted his body and imprisoned him in my sect right next door to his. he freed himself and got stronger. came back to rob me again (3k coins) got his ass beat again and again i stole all his shit and imprisoned him. he then mysteriously disappeared (i actually didn't do anything to him he's just gone, bandits probably beat him up and killed him) from the world with zero consequences to my reputation.

Somehow my penis fell off or was possibly removed after being beaten up by the very bandits I taught the martial art to. then my penis was pick-pocketed by those bandits and for the next 2 IRL days I went around beating up bandits and learning better martial arts to reclaim it. I finally found it and ran into the issue of i have noone to re-attatch it because noone in my world is good enough in leechcraft.

Highly recommend the game. very fun. translations can be a bit wacky. however there are some visual issues with fullscreen run it windowed and restart the game after a few hours to run fine.",1707636570,1707636991,True,5,0,0.551066219806671143,0,True,False,True

combat is done really well i like the counter system a lot. it can be confusing at first but once i figured out that the combat cards i equip effect which moves appear each turn it was very straightforward to balance damage with on hand countermoves.

 i also enjoyed the npc interaction its nice that sect members run up and say hello or offer to teach you abilities or inner kungfu it makes sects feel like functioning communities. 

being able to inherit skills from previous family members is nice, it makes the game feel risky so you dont want to die but not so risky that you loose everything which is nice for a feeling of constant progression. 

the games stat allocation is a system called chi which you use to link stat nodes together for stat bonuses and in patterns for inner kungfu bonuses which you construct yourself like a puzzle which is a unique system i haven't seen before and enjoyed.

there are a few complaints i have, mainly translation could use some work but honestly it has led me to some hilarious dialogue so its not a deal breaker. it does however make some aspects of the game very confusing to understand at first. another complaint is that the English version of the game is bugged so that the option to become a sage (max level in a skill) does not show up in dialogue with the sage instructors. sage is very important for skills you want to bring to your next character as you can transcribe books at a bookshelf for your next character to read and level up. currently the only workaround is to find an npc who is interested in talking about the skill and discuss it which will give you 5% bonus experience in that skill, then do that a total of 20 times with different npc each time which really sucks because each npc has their own routine and will run all over the map so logistically speaking the only reliable way to do this is to build 20 cages and after getting a 5% bonus beating the npc into the dirt and locking them in a cage which wile absolutely hilarious is very tedious.",1707609316,1707609316,True,0,1,0.485771477222442627,0,True,False,True

This can lead to a lot of confusing moments in the game which doesn't hold your hand from the beginning.

Essentially, it's a Kenshi style game where you create a character that can basically live as you like. Build a tavern, blacksmith, temple, spa and other npc's will come and visit and pay you money. You can get into relationships and have children who you can play as if you die. Each quest (non npc) you complete will allow you to unlock a new tile to add to the map with it's own quest. This is then essentially a rinse and repeat concept.

Combat is really unique, I've never seen anything like this in a game before and it's really quite fun. It's basically turn based kungfu where certain attacks counter others, and by performing a specific chain, you unlock a special attack you can use.

The only thing holding this game back is the translation, as I mentioned earlier. The devs have a great game brewing here and if they really want to reach the Western market, they will need to invest in a good translation. 

At this current stage, I don't really recommend the game, even though I feel like it deserves a positive score because of this, but I do want the dev's to see that they're making a great game here and to give them some moral support.

- World generation is probably the most creative I've seen in a game. (You place a new section of the world whenever you have gained enough xp to do so. The next chunk you place is dependent on what you choose from a list)
- Animations are so fluid and very expressive (Such a nice looking game too)
- Combat is a strange Rock vs Paper game thats pretty fun to play.
- There is so much interactivity between the world and its NPCs. (NPCs can fight, talk, trade, buy property from you, and much more)
- There is another minigame that can help you before fights, give you a trading advantage, and gain relations with people.
- The sound design is cool too. Very calm when it needs to be and funny/tense whenever it needs to be.

The graphics and art get the job done pleasantly. You don't end up seeing characters up close too often but they aren't oversimplified. The environment is detailed and textures well sized.

Sound design is appropriate though mostly you'll be hearing the BGMs and environment ambiance.

I'm impressed with the item/equipment effects variety. Items aren't boring like in most games, the effects vary greatly, are creative and viable.

The translation currently is sloppy but I haven't run into more than a handful of questions about what something does.

If you're willing to put some effort into learning the mechanics and are looking for a somewhat casual singleplayer sim-rpg, definitely give this a go.",1707291046,1707291046,True,2,0,0.514250338077545166,0,True,False,True

The map expansion system feels fresh and interesting. There's a lot you could do with that, but it already works. I think the pacing of progression and unlocking locations could be tweaked, but it's not bad.

Combat feels a bit like a luck draw, as you get a random selection of move types to choose from each turn. But there are mechanics in place that give the system depth and I'm still learning how to master it.

[h3]The Positives:[/h3][list]
[*]The how you make the world seems interessting and tough it may be premade map tiles the ammount of them doesn't make them seem repetative but rather refreshing especially with the quest system that unlocks more tiles when you complete them and the overall world looks pretty.

[*]The Fighting system is well designed and makes for interesting gameplay and rewards planning outside as well as inside combat.

[*]It has very well designed Base building mechanics that is easy to use.
[/list]
[h3]The Negatives:[/h3][list]
[*]Yet the major thing I have a problem with is the bad English translation it's not as much as it has bad gramar or typos, the whole meaning and usage of words seems like it has been thrown trough google translate good like a good example is in every inventory menu I can see the button called ""turn off"" on the bottom right, I thought that I actually turn off something but after looking trough it it is literally just the ""back"" button to get out of the menu and that is only one noticable example. And alltogether it is sometimes hard to understand what is meant another example would be in the loading screen i see a tipp ""Swim: Hold Ctrl key to go down"" where I could assume it means ""While swimming Press Ctrl to dive"" which wasn't hard to assume but there are some things which I actually needed to google but even when googleing there wasn't much about the game at least in english.

[*]Other problems that I saw is the Ai behaviour is too dull, example is an NPC came up to me to give me a quest about bandits which i took but the NPC had the trait [thieving] so when I ended the conversation he in front of me started to sneak and try to rob me in plain sight and even got mad when i stepped away or retaliated.
Another moment was when I trespassed somewhere and when I did i was talked at by a Guard which just said ""you commited a crime"" or something and that I needed to pay 3k coins which i did, little did I know that I was persued by 3 guards that still chased after me and the second demanded payment of the same ammount I payed and saw the 3rd one coming at me where I immedeatly understood what he wanted and run away. Or also where people randomly go to palces and one of my ""retainers"" just somehow was imprisoned randomy and I couldn#t understand why.

[*]Another big problem that I noticed, you level up skills by doing them to perfect them, nothing bad or anything, but the problem arises when you want to gain the last level of the Skill for some, as it needs to talk to certain people of certain families which usually gives you some quest to gain the last level which would be fine... except that the system is bugged and the quest don't exist, I get information on how to get the last level for a skill and a map tile for me to place ""as in where it is located"" but when I get there I see some people and one who seems to be really good at that specific skill and he doesn't do anything after looking it up on the internet it seems that this problem exists for the English version of the game and the only methode to actually getting the last skill [i](as you do not gain exp from doing that thing at that level)[/i] is to talk to random people about that skill MANY times which also has a cooldown and normally this talk is made to increase rep witht hat person but the reason this methode works is because o the side bonus of getting 5% progress for that skill additionally.
[/list]
[b]So in conclusion[/b] I can say that the game isn't unplayable or that bad, but I cannot recommend it to other people in what state it is in for the English version simply because it has headache inducing peoblems rather than gameplay breaking problems [i](except that ""gaining last level of a skill"" quest issue)[/i] and the main decision factor to buy this game is ""Are you able to mentally deal with the mentioned issues of the game?"".",1707266838,1707267045,False,1,0,0.497925341129302979,0,True,False,True

The Good:
- Is a fun, unique experience
- The combat system is fun
- For an early access game, it has a lot of content
- The character progression is fun

The Bad:
- Currently, there is a glitch in the English version where the Sage trainers won't spawn. This can be fixed by switching to Chinese, making a new world, selecting whichever one you want to train, and then switching back to English once they are spawned (Note: the Geomancy trainer also does Sage Wall Climbing)
- The translation can be incomprehensible at times, but I'm sure that it will get fixed with time.

The only complaint I have, which is shared by most other reviews I've seen, is the English translations are terrible in some places. It's not a game breaker, mind you, just makes comprehension a bit difficult for some of the lore and conversations. The systems in the game are simple enough to pick up with just a bit of trial and error anyhow, so no great loss.

As for the meat and potatoes in the game mechanics, they are all fantastic. You really feel like a wanderer amidst a martial arts wonderland, surrounded by opportunities to make money or build up your power and influence. Granted nothing is overly complex or in depth at this point, all the moving gears still fit together extremely well to make the current game very enjoyable.

I have enjoyed my time with it, and I see myself wasting a lot more time with it going forward.",1707031261,1707031261,True,2,0,0.547325074672698975,0,True,False,True

 - The combat plays out with picking matching symbols to make up a combo and watch your characters fly around dishing out martial arts moves, kind of like rock paper scissor on crack. You progress all your skills by doing more of what you are trying to progress, so it can be a bit grindy but I'd say it is a good kind of grind, because the grinding process feels dynamic and fun.
 - Exploring rewards you with new combos (new martial arts skills and school), unlock new clothing, weapons, play style. 
 - You can build a house just to comeback every once in a while to stock up and storage stuff, or you can build a homestead, get a wife, start up a shop, or even an guild of your own with followers to challenge other martial arts masters and take over the world.

Overall the game was a fairly enjoyable experience, you can start 3 new playthroughs within a week and the game won't even feel repetitive. I look forward for future updates and the full game.",1707025872,1707025872,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

-Was so beautiful to a guard that he claimed love at first sight. When I politely refused him, he threatened to beat me within an inch of my life. I then of my own volition decided I would like a boyfriend.

-I was threatened to be robbed by a bandit who became intimidated. In my arrogance, I assumed being on par with me would mean I could teach this evil doer a lesson.

I'm more of a Kenshi type of gamer and this caught my eye because it is a true sandbox game and whilst it is an open world, it's more akin to a... World you build up, which is then as a byproduct open so to speak.

Obviously it isn't Swordpunk like Kenshi, nor do you control a squad of individuals directly as you would in Kenshi and the base-building elements aren't the main focus neither, it still has similar themes in which you can just do what you wanna do. There's quests and tasks and such but it doesn't take away from the fact it's a sandbox game. Ultimately you'll end up controlling the pace of the game in terms of progression and how you go about things.

It's fun despite it's quirks and yes it's got that early access feel and the English translation is a bit rough at this moment in time but for what you're getting for the asking price? Provided the devs of this game keep on pushing out updates, you're going to get your money's worth and THEN some. This game has a lot of potential and it's already good for what it is, I just hope it gets even better.

Don't expect to get far with your first couple characters.
Do what you can and by the time you die you'll have built up enough karma to make your next life easier.

My last life I went to a sect to possibly join them and learn some techniques.  Before I got there, one of their people poisoned me, and I mean heavily poisoned me, then proceeded to beat the shit out of me.
Would have been a close fight otherwise, but the poison messed me up.
They proceeded to strip me, throw me in a cell, then my dad came to rescue me and the woman that captured me proceeded to kill my dad in front of me.
Then not long after I succumbed to the poison.

But because I managed to do quite a lot of stuff on that character before dying, my next (current) character started with about triple the vigour of the last.
Each reincarnation seems to get progressively stronger.  possibly exponentially.

While the english translations range from ""Mostly ok"" to ""What is this poetry supposed to mean"" (Read: Definitely unfinished), the gameplay itself is intuitive enough that I have never felt lost as to whats going on, and for when there are problems, the in game guide is the most thoroughly translated of all the text. 

And thats important, because this is a true sandbox game - the real joy here is in going around and just seeing what happens when you try and do things. Can I break a guys water well, set fire to his house, and watch it burn down as he panics looking for water? Absolutely. Can I use love worms to make 2 sect leaders fall in love with me, then watch them burn the world to the ground over my affections? Naturally. Can I use beast tongue to recruit an army of monkeys, and corner the begging market across the land? Not only can you, you should, its really effective.

If you like weird indie sandbox games, or wuxia power fantasies, this game will be right up your alley. Everything is smooth and intuitive from the combat to the cultivation, you'll have moments ranging from tense battles to slapstick comedy of errors, and the devs are putting out updates seemingly every day (seriously, I took a break for a week and theres already a new update out adding an entire new faction with unique mechanics).

Firstly, it would greatly enhance gameplay if the initial world autonomously generated elements and if the placement grid extended beyond the current 15x15 limitations. Moreover, removing the constraint requiring land to be connected for placement would add versatility.

While the graphics exhibit quality in certain aspects such as buildings and inner cave environments, overall environmental visuals could be improved. Automatic generation of land in the starting world, with the option to lock it so it cannot be deleted when a character is created, would enhance immersion. Additionally, introducing events where NPCs and sects from other worlds attempt to invade the player's initial realm, and vice versa, could add depth and challenge to gameplay. This safeguard against accidental deletion ensures continuity and stability within the game world, further reinforcing the player's sense of connection to their starting environment.

Expanding beyond the existing small realms to include unique, periodically accessible realms with distinct enemies would enrich exploration. While the game harbors promising concepts, further updates are desired, particularly in graphics enhancement and mod availability.

For instance, incorporating features such as the potential for breakthroughs in chi points or skill advancement during meditation would deepen character progression. A dynamic world that evolves alongside the player's actions, necessitating continuous improvement for survival, would add significant depth.

Furthermore, introducing unique aquatic elements, drawing from East Sea lore, could enrich the game world's diversity. While The Matchless Kungfu currently offers an enjoyable experience in its Early Access stage, there exists substantial potential for expansion and refinement. It serves as a robust framework awaiting additional layers of content to realize its full potential as a masterpiece.

If you love Wooshoo and Kung fu, this game is for you. 
The game is fun, constructive and deep, full of depth, multiple systems and potential relationships, from rivals, students and masters, to husband or wife. 

Competitive NPC's that make the world feel flowing and alive. 
Being able to edit the world, build and change where you want land plots to place, has been a really big breath of fresh air. 

This game is a labour of love and I enjoy it a lot. 

Part of it's charm is it's unforgiving difficulty and NPC's which may or may not destroy your kung fu or knock you out.

This game is like a Morrowind, Chinese, dynasty, kung fu fantasy. It's really fun, things, like skills, meridians and abilities exist to be used and broken. The game let's you and anyone else, become overpowered or crippled. It's up to you to decide how you want to break the game, and become op. Or stay a poor beggar. It's cute. The graphics are nice, and I haven't had any issues for a long time.

A friend recommended me this. Unlike the game that shall not be named, I don't have to mod this to build this world. 

In current state of translation it has a steep learning curve. But I really enjoyed the time I spent with this game. For that price? This is a gem. The battles work better this way, the mechanic of world building and cultivating is great. 

I wanted the universe, yet I find the better sandbox here in these rice fields, training kung fu with animals.  

Also, it actually has a story which I totally forgot about like 20h in.

This feels like a true labor of love for the creators, but the buggy behavior and seeming lack of game balance make it tough to play.

Super eye catching artistic battles

It's the kind of game that when I saw it I immediately knew I'd enjoy it, so it's hard for me to point out things other people might like. 

Game has a few downsides I'm really hoping will be smoothed out in later updates, still find the game very enjoyable though: 

1. Game world isn't very hostile (or there isn't really an option for it to be.) The worlds I've read in translated novels are usually ruthless. Some wild animals will be hostile, but they're more of a nuisance than anything. No conflicts between Sects, I can just walk into any sect and buy their manuals while being an outsider. 

2. NPCs don't really scale very high in power either. Sect leaders are like (spoiler on power level of story enemies) [spoiler]1/3rd the power/HP of the endgame story enemies (which felt like more of a gimmick fight, but might have been my build.) I was able to basically 1 shot any NPC once I was strong enough to finish the story.[/spoiler] Bringing some old monsters out of seclusion or something would be cool. The guys that created the techniques or founded the sects or something. 

3. Some other stuff could be balanced like economy and NPC relationship gains. Feel like doing them the ""intended"" way is a drag, but are easy to cheese. 

4. Translation needs a lot of polishing, I even find the title ""The Matchless Kungfu"" to be a bit odd. Stuff like the log saying ""Me/Me's"" instead of ""I/My."" Like ""Me fought [some guy]"" or ""Me's retainer died."" Or ""Outdoor""/""Indoor"" disciples instead of just ""Outer""/""Inner"" 


Overall though, still a very enjoyable experience that I hope gets updated/polished more. I'll still be happy with my time spent and purchase even if it wasn't going to be updated though. If you're bothered by jank/odd translation/early access stuff you might want to wait, but otherwise I'd say it's worth the price and your time if it seems interesting to you. 
All the negatives I have to say are me hoping the game can be even better than it already is.

The rock paper scissor system is really damn intuitive and fun and when coupled with the unique special move animations every battle becomes a visual treat (especially when your pets including eagles, horses, pigs and ferrets join in the battle. Nothing beats seeing your horse and pet ferret join in to get a few blows on your enemy.)

It's unique and has a ton of potential.

Hopefully the number of world tiles is large enough to present some unique paths adventure wise, I haven't really gotten through enough of the game to know but I am already seeing a number of repeats.

Jumping around, building and fighting all feel very fun, and the game is honestly not that difficult to break down.

Fighting and social both work off of a sort of deck building/resource draw building mechanic and they both feel unique enough without being too complicated. Social just came out, and I feel the red options could use some buffing, but over all it's absolutely hilarious and a joy to utilize (though maybe a bit but I am not sure that is really a concern in a game like this).

It's not helped by the fact that they seem to have translated from chinese directly to english, without regards for cultural norms, so I felt confused about almost everything. I was tasked with training _something_, but the word shown was ""dugong"" or something, which is just utterly useless. Latin letters, neat, but still a chinese word that describes something not in english. There was also arguably too much text on screen giving numerics for everything about a random character I was standing close to. Almost certainly related to the character, but the amount of text was just overwhelming, and when interacting you get several categories to choose from, but they all kinda overlap.

First off: Amazing job on the recent updates guys, the translation is 90% understandable for us english players now, and learning the new sect system has been absolutely fun. PLEASE do not underestimate yourselves, you are doing an amazing job.

Now for the notes:
-NPC AI. I've noticed the AI tends to just... stall out... in certain places. Sometimes people you hire as bodyguards will just idly watch you get your ass kicked, sometimes bandits will beat your ass only to walk away and not rob you. Animal Aggro range is just too large, taking one step in a swampy area leaves you knee deep in snakes you oneshot halfway through the game.

-Economy. This is probably the big one for me. The economy is ATROCIOUS. It doesnt matter much seeing as the game is in early access, but as it stands the hyper-inflation of gold is crazy. Once you start making money, you end up with more than you can do anything with, and from there you just gotta start hitting boats and taverns to become god. I'm not sure what would fix this besides an overhaul TBH.



Those are my big notes I've come across so far. 

Suggestion:
Tags. Give us the ability to tag NPC's that are important to us, so we can track them on the map easier. Maybe make it a feature of the eagle

As of now this game is an 8/10. (Updated for 12/9/2023, some previous negatives have been fixed).

This game is fantastic. To sum it up it's a Wuxia open world sandbox RPG puzzle fighting game. The fighting in this game is incredibly unique and complicated. But, if you properly learn the mechanics the combat is unbelievably fun. The game is also weird in it's own funny way which really writes a story unique to your character. The world really does feel like its alive unlike so many other open world games.


-----Positives---------
-- THE COMBAT -- 
Fights are like puzzles where you need to find the correct order of moves to victory taking into account combos required to use techniques of your own whilst crippling your enemy. The progression of your character and his martial abilities also feel very amazing and you can quickly see changes in you strength. You will also lose many of your battles and possibly your life, you'll easily know when your outclassed by a master and it leads to really funny stories and interactions. There is also a lot of build variety and martial arts to learn which keep things fresh.

-- NPC ARE COOL --
The way NPC's act and operate in this game is truely alien and out of this world weird and ye'old'ages kind of dramatic. Imagine a world where everyone is an overly dramatic Wuxia side character. NPC's can have some really smart interactions at times, but also suicidal ones sometimes. However, the AI hardly feels like you need to babysit them, they can take of themselves and survive alone in the world (90% of the time). Whats really cool is how NPC's will actively seek you out in the world to talk to you and challenge you. If your carrying lots of money and your a big spender bandits might find out and rob you. If you actively cause problems your enemies may team up against you to teach you a lesson. Making allies is actually a very important aspect in this game too. With the right friends they can save your life. Including pets! You can hire and pay people to do a lot of jobs as well and you may even be offered the same jobs by a guy you walk past on the street. Overall theres a lot of unique non repetitive interactions NPCs will run up to you to chat about. Characters seem to simulated around the world too. It really does feel like a living world, akin to Kenshi.

-- THE BUILDING SYSTEM --
Building as of now is really fun and simple. You can quickly make a nice cozy home and its very straightfoward. I really like the system for building and theres a lot of pretty options for roofing, walls, windows, and doors. to There's an alright amount of room for making unique and creative designs with the building system as of now. But there are issues (see negative).

-- GREAT MAPS --
I say maps instead of world because you quite literally make the world by yourself through completing tasks to add a new sector to your map. Its kinda weird at first but I've come to like it. The maps also look great. It adds a nice sense of progression you can see. Most maps have a task and you complete it to unlock another map. However some requirements are really annoying...

--- DO IT YOUR WAY! --
There is quite a lot of ways to go about completing a goal you set for yourself. Let me tell you a story, I got robbed and thrown in a cage, my friend came to save me but was also imprisoned. I escaped. I was left naked and in the wilds, I made some money from mining and paid an elder of a school to go beat the ever loving shite out of this bandit. I also then bought a body guard. Dispatched of the bandit and deprived them of all their kungfu and kept them as a prisoner in my house. Another time I invited a real tough guy out drinking and paid for his beers. Until he feel over knocked out, luckily I planned for this and developed a tolerance so I can rob people without them even knowing. I also made a decent bit of money and helped out my school later on by opening a clinic. They didn't have one so I treated my sec member's injuries and became good friends with them. I sold a decent bit of stuff too. So there is quite a few ways of going about things. The best part though is that you can completely ignore some aspects of the game that you find boring. I don't like the verbal duel system ( a poor translation for debates lmao) but I haven't been forced to do it once. 


-----Negatives-------

--- THE TRANSLATION ---
The translation at times can be serviceable to NEAR incomprehensible. I've played quite a bit and some stuff really requires you to squint your eyes and read over a paragraph of nonsense to decipher the meaning. Only a very few times have I been completely lost. However, it can be REALLY funny.

--- LACKING HOUSE DECOR ---
The building system is great but theres a real lack of what you can do with the interior of your home. It's mostly crafting stations and counters respective for the types of goods to sell.

--- THE CRAFTING GRIND ---
Easily the worst part of the game. The crafting system is really cool with great items to pick from to flesh out a build. But the grind is very annoying. In order to make and craft a work bench such as a forge to practice and start out with your smiting you need to already be very proficient with the forge skill. Same applies to other crafting skill levels. So essentially you run around the world you made and hope to god you picked a map with a crafting station you want. Only then you realize you need someone to actually teach you how to become a beginner in that skill first. Then you have to go and make friends with them. After all of that you can start the real grind. You will need a lot a lot of materials to craft. So you will be mindlessly hitting trees for quite awhile. Some are worse than others, best to save skill grinding for when you get gear that boosts material gain rates.

--- TEACHING / LEARNING ---
You can view and see any martial art an NPC knows. You can teach them and they can teach you. However its monotonous and time wasting yet essential to learning a lot of skills without spending tons of $$$. You gain partial progress each time they teach you and you need to just ask them again to teach you the same skill. Theres about a 6 second delay for an animation where your talking. You have to repeat this over and over to learn quite a few skills. It used to be instant.

--- MAP PROGRESSION TASKS ---
To gain more maps in order to expand your world you must complete a map's goal. Some are straightforward while others are outright evil. Such as create a temple shrine and pray for rain and then sell a bunch of wine. Did I mention in order to craft a temple you need to grind out your establishment skill (home building skill) to a high rank? Better start mindlessly building shacks 40 times. It can be ridiculous and eventually becomes a chore you have to do.

--- Performance ---
It's not a game that will melt your GPU or CPU but it will make them run harder than they should. The game is just unoptimized. With my AMD card I get annoying stutters and can hear the fans kick on real loud when adding a map to the game. GPU temps stay at safe under load levels but it really shouldn't be using 78% of my 7900xtx when at medium settings in 2k. Its a perfectly playable game though.

Had no idea if I was going to like it but here's my story so far.

My first character got mugged after losing to a monkey that knew kungfu. My bestie took that bandit out and I looted his stuff. That man preceded to debate me, pickpocket me, and attack me every chance he got. Until I finally took the fight to his home, and he killed me.

I then played the child of the Drunken Fist sect. Felt OP as heck, and first thing I did was kill every single bandit. An era of peace. I cultivated, I trained, and I worked my way up the ranks. The third most prestigious aside from my mom and my boss. Then the fire nation attacked. Literally, the fire nation sect sent about thirty dudes and attacked our capital. I managed to take them all down in the most cinematic chaotic battle I've experienced in a game. Well two of those guys were in stealth mode and destroyed our flag. I founded the sect all over again, and began a war.

This war led to the absolute annihilation of the fire nation. Every single man and woman was killed. Maybe a bit extreme for destroying our flag. Already my allies were worried about my arrogance, but then I started to conquer. Anyone who hated my brutality was murdered. Forty-eight out of fifty-one tiles were taken as I began to build an amazing world. My sixty-six sect-members building monuments and buildings that tower over all to show my grace. There were only three out of seven sects left, and I prepared to take on the rest.

Arrogance was my downfall. As I was slain. My husband was now a widow, and my children without a mother.

Now I'm on my newest character. A distant cousin, a wise old man who's an absolute God when it comes to the drunken fist style. I tried to work my way up the ranks, but sixty-six people is too much to challenge. So I've created the Sober Rebellion Sect, who practices the school of Alcoholics Anonymous. We're thirty-four strong now and are in an open war with the Drunken Fist sect. Fighting my old character's mother and all of the goons I personally chose and recruited.

So many die everyday. And I realize, I'm literally playing shadow of war, going against a map, army, and an enemy of my own creation. The Drunken Fist sect is evil, and I'm trying to rally the Madness Cult and the Dragons Teeth against them. Buddha knows we need all the help we can get.

There's so much praise I could give this game. It's amazingly flexible, it allows you to grow your characters through different generations in any way you like, having a bunch of sects (martial arts schools) trades (woodcutter, farmer, hunter, etc) and gear and weapons to personalize your character. You can even have a number of animal companions, or human companions.

The gameplay is really innovative, and in spite of not quite resembling anything I've played before is easy to learn. You could say that the combat (and verbal combat) mechanics are nothing but a complex rock-paper-scissors mechanic, but believe me when I tell you rock-paper-scissors was [b]never[/B] this fun.

Many reviews point out this is similar to Kenshi, but I kinda disagree. On one hand, Kenshi is [i]fugly,[/i] everything there looks decaying, or rotting, or heavily mutated due to radiation poisoning, in [b]The Matchless Kung Fu[/b] everything looks dreamy and beautiful like in [b]The House of Flying Daggers.[/b] Not only it's aesthetically different, in Kenshi your character is a nobody that needs to build their skills, relationships and resources to impact the game world, in [b]The Matchless Kung Fu[/b] you are a nobody... [b]that knows Kung Fu[/b], and by the second day your character will be dashing across the top of bamboo forests and dueling bandits like they were born doing it.

Another difference with Kenshi is that, although The Matchless Kung Fu has a harsh, heartless world, where bandits will behead you and NPC with hold deadly grudges against you, TMKF is more lighthearted and has a slapstick sense of humor, much like some Chinese Wuxia films do.

I could go on and on, but I'll cut myself short with some words of warning. The game is in Early Access, so expect some rough edges and unfinished mechanics. Always check how often a game is updated or how responsive the dev is before buying an EA title. The English translation is sufficiently good, but I hope it's a placeholder for a more finished translation [b]and localization[/b] of the game, as non Chinese players might benefit from a more thorough introduction to some concepts used in game (meridians, Chi, Qi gong, etc).

The game runs w/o problems in Linux via Wine/Proton.

编辑：
先说结论：如果你是冲着“武侠版Kenshi”来的，那还是请回吧。
与其说这是个游戏，不如说是开发者拿来练手的测试品...这游戏生硬的把其它成功游戏的部分机制拼凑在一起，没有做任何的改进，很多设计让人摸不着头脑。给我的感觉是，很多机制不是为了“好玩”而加入的，只是单纯为了复制其它游戏而加入的。
而在这个生硬缝合的框架下，游戏自身的内容可以说是一点没有。不论是地图任务还是NPC任务无非都是“收集”、“打怪”类型的，毫无可玩性可言。战斗系统也很糟糕，作为一个玩家会反复体验很多次的游戏主要内容，每回合出一个随机但重复的解密小游戏简直是在挑战玩家的耐心。经脉系统初看有点意思，但是实质上也只是孤立于游戏主体的小游戏而已。地块系统的设计就更令人疑惑了...这么个花里胡哨的东西跟大地图比到底好在哪里？又丑又不实用...唯一的解释就是可以降低开发成本了...而且单块地皮的设计单独拿出来看也只能用简陋来形容...再加上NPC之间基本没什么互动，NPC和玩家的互动也非常单一，整个世界给人一种割裂且死气沉沉的感觉。",1701397754,1701408717,False,1,1,0.472740739583969116,0,True,False,True

You pick something you want to do, and you work to be an expert in it. Sneaking/theft eventually makes money a non-concern. I'm sure things will change when I experiment with building, where I'm guessing this game may shine. I also have not played with the karma system much yet, still on the first character. 

Combat is complicated to start, and simple to master. It's rock paper scissors with deck building elements. What ever abilities you equip increases the odds of getting that type. So equip something like toe stomp, you get more kick 'cards'. Your companions/pets add to what you get as well. So it's easy to set yourself up to always win, even against harder enemies. This combat idea is neat, and I really like the animations. It's just too simple right now. (The hardest enemies just have massive HP pools, and fighting them just takes too long to be worth it when starting out.)

There are some weird translation issues in English, but you get the idea of what it's trying to say. The audio/music is okay, but I enjoy the game more with something else playing in the background. I hope they continue to expand on the game, it has great potential and the price is decent for where it is at in early access.

Edit1: Building is honestly pretty boring. There's not much creativity to it like Kenshi had. Crafting/building is very optional, as stealing gets you anything you could want. The combat gets more luck based since it's actually a deck building game, which ends up being boring and repetitive.

no one was giving anything though....

then some quick merchanting to get coin to fix my leg

got my pet posse, rolled up on the first bandit, whipped her ass, got my stuff back, found the second one, whipped his ass and as payback for breaking my leg

i broke his motherfucking kungfu

The translation is poor and there is often some confusion with said translation about how things are functioning, but it is still a solid game for what there is so far.

If you enjoy Kenshi, this might be a different monster, but still fun! It feels more solid as events approach you and keep things interesting. The world building (literally) is a cool mechanic where you are not overwhelmed with where to explore too much at once (though you could accidentally unlock a lot at once, but choose to not uncover it yet)

Dev's update game regularly and listening to fans feedback (discord). Price is more then perfect for the game (even could be higher :)) 

Those who like Kenshi or even Valhalla should try this one, Open world, generated world, meaning: you can create your own mini worlds square by square or game will generate it for you if you like more challenge. 

Those who like to build own village / town / base building things, definitely should try this game. Several variation of building style and purpose, all serve own business: smithy, hunter house, miner house etc etc. In comparison to other games with similar idea, the Matchless Kungfuu offer live world. You can sell your building to NPCs and they will use it as they will live in. If you would like generate some income, you can build Tavern or Music House ( I wish they add TeaHouse, because NPCs get drunk all the time), yeah NPCs will come over to have a drink. As single player game it makes you feel that world is alive. At this stage I wish there was more content to decorate your indoor buildings ... however it is still early access we need to wait what happen next. 

RPG game play is done well: each story or each reincarnation could be different gamplay for you, in totally different style. In first life you could be Sect master in second you can be the worst bandits in your world, or maybe simple farmer. Conversations with NPCs after few hours seems  repetitive but it serve purpose. Recommended talk a lot with NPCs :) they can teach you a lot. Last update improve Sect management A LOT!! thx devs. 

At the stage of 182 I still cannot find the way how to beat ""the story"" still looking for my Chi - no spoilers. Story at the beginning is not obvious and you unlock story progress while playing. I will only say ""Karma is a b****"" :D very important.

And at the and every fan of Kungfu, anime etc should try this game, If you wants to create your own Naruto feel free to do so. My first character was SailorMoon and no one can take it from me :D and yes she had daughter Chibiusa and actually all daughter were sailor warriors :D

BUT, and this is a massive but, I love the combat, i love the meridian system allowing min maxed play to not only be meta but heavily encouraged, its everything i want it to be and has the potential to be even more. the dialogue has that funny scanlation feel to it where the English is just slightly off enough to give it that ""are you courting death"" vibe. the rock paper fist combat is surprisingly deep and i always find myself optimizing the smallest details on a build. the community is great too, the full English guide tells you all you need to know but i don't recommend it until you've died or are just lost. with that being said, i wish they had a better tutorial for your first character, and some better direction in general, but its really not that bad to warrent a real complaint. Another thing, i want the economy to feel a little more real, sometimes it feels like money is just a valueless tool and is genuinely way too easy to make, like you can make millions for basically nothing. this is pretty time consuming but it is what it is, bannerlord, kenshi, they all do it so i dont mind, just a gripe.



Anyway, its worth the early access buy, i put 57 hours into it, and its a 15 dollar game, if i translate that into dollar per hour of fun ration thats 1 dollar per four hours, well over the price to time margin and well worth a buy, especially for the Wuxia fans out there.

Going forward I think there's a few places for improvement:
1. Better translations - They are legible but confusing. A better explained guide to meridians as well.
2. Easier access to ""Sage"" levels in abilities - They have yet to implement a real way of becoming a sage in something.
3. Easier access to inner kungfu and skills - It's really annoying searching for a random NPC to teach you necessary skills.
4. More in-depth NPCs and relationships with characters - I'd personally like a more fleshed-out sect system and Master/Disciple relationships. NPCs are also very prone to getting themselves stuck, particularly in extreme environments.
5. Completely rework the end-game area, it's terrible.
6. Make the world seem less stitched together; the block system of the world makes sections feel entirely isolated and piecemeal which sort of breaks the environmental imagery.",1698285625,1698285625,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,True

VERY innovative combat system, very interesting skill realization mechanics and very interesting reincarnation / generational mechanics! Very very fresh experience! I mean, I didn't even like Kenshi and I LOVE this one!

I have lost a save where i was at my 4th generation by the 80th hour of this game, and then it took me another 40ish hours to go and get all manuals, skills, legendary gear and at a third generation, which in my experience so far is more than enough to finish the content in this version of the game.

actual review:
npcs and ai - i dont know if they are buggy, or they are missing some code since its early access, but ive noticed they have a tendency to get stuck in certain places, either because of terrain or because they just sit there and pace back and forth. the children that u make when they become adults they just end up pacing back and forth around your house. also, in my first playthrough it took me much longer to aquire skills because i was still learning the ropes. if youre going through your first playthrough you might notice npcs having something like 9k hp by the end of your playthrough. idk how they do it, but they just show up after a few ingame days with double the hp, without having changed items or anything.

relationship system- again idk if this is a bug, but if you befriend/romance an npc so as to make him recruitable in the team, they get halved hp and possibly half damage too. this is why i end up running solo with my ferret on my shoulder. i like that there is this system though, since it can be improved and added upon at anytime by the devs who seem to be highly involved in this.

skills- very satisfying to watch, and they all are very cool, for every kind of martial arts enthusiast, from fist, palms, kicks or weapons (staff and sword) afficionados. sadly, there is an optimum way to play, and not all skills fit with eachother, while there also are some skills that VASTLY outmatch all the others. for example, theres a skill that does as much damage as you have Qi and maxing it out gives you damage triple to your max Qi which can be enhanced through craftable and stealable/purchasable pills or food. i have completely given up on using it since it defeats my most pleasureable part, the combat.

combat - i have never played a system like this before. the sort of passive way to interact and load up a turn of combat allows you to fully enjoy the animations and moves the characters show, which, by the way, are very acrobatic and cinematic. 

the world - another very unique system, where you expand your map by one tile by completing challenges assigned to already unlocked tiles. these challenges also are a must since your character starts of really weak, as strong as one of the large animals. however, the world ends up becoming really empty after a while,  and by that i mean after you become able to defeat even the last enemies, the huanmos servants, which would require you to strongly downplay your power in order to have some sort of challenge in combat. lets hope that they will improve upon that in upcoming patches, but as i said before, it would seem that waiting for ingame days to pass would allow npcs around the map to become stronger, maybe even populate the map even more, although i dont know if npcs are able to make romantic relationships between them, let alone make children. other than that, the world feels really alive, with the npcs having their own houses, going over crafting routines, putting up items to sell and even going and buying booze and food at taverns or shops in general.

9/10 experience, most probably becoming a 10 at full release. i have high hopes for this game to improve a lot over time, especially at full release. even so, full price is WELL worth it. as for the reviews regarding GPU overheating, i havent had any problems though the game tends to take up a lot of memory. (i have a 3060). i will edit the review and let you guys know if the gpu problem has actually been fixed. (post-edit:yes, the gpu problem has been fixed. i guess i downloaded the game after they had fixed it) great game!

NB: also hopefully they release a coop-multiplayer patch.

Overview: This game is about wushu/wuxia world, and it is more or less like a sandbox game mode where you are free to do anything you like. 

1.1 First impression: When I saw some more introduce this on you tube, Immediately I got hooked due to the creative battle mechanics, So I immediately purchase it on steam and start trying out. It is addicted if you like this kind of game mechanics

2. Gameplay :
2.1 Mechanics: 
What I like 

The core gameplay involves a lot of wuxia battle, the system is quite creative as I have not seen it else where. It also works like a deck builder that allow different attack type to be retrieved during each round of battle. If the developers continue to work on the battle system it can become deeper and more innovative than this. 

It has quite some ulti move(绝学） and also inner power(内功） to be chosen。It can combine to become very powerful combo. If this is your first playthrough the inner Power is like a kind of puzzle that you can't activate every power. It is a good trade off.

You can build a lot building and facility to earn money. Some skill requires special people to give you breakthrough before you can go to next level.

It has very dynamic map system that allow dynamic way of location placement, to make every play through its unique experience. Each map location has its own objective and quest to be solved.

What can be Improve:

Conversation and interaction with NPC is kind a lacking, not much to be done, after learning skill giving present and asking them to join your guild and constant battle and sparring.

During Battle, once you level up and become more powerful, basically a lot of status effect become irrelevant. Even in normal battle some of the status effect not really useful, but have effect after battle. The battle system is good enough, but can be more in depth with more stuff like:
1. More variety and effect of item usage in battle ( currently items are used in beginning of game play)
2. More powerful and combo ulti can be learned and created.
3. Ulti skill learning and level up is too easy, most need lesser than 200 points to max out.
4. Skill and ulti skill should require special condition or quest to be unlocked for higher level

Building and guild become irrelevant when progress to mid game. Hope it can be further improved to have more offense and defense building to provide complex guild fight.

Inner power sphere/line is new to me. Hope this can be further improve to include more elements like how FFX sphere grid or path of exile with ""keystock"" and allow more end game item to make changes like sphere grid in FFX. 

Current Equipments do not provide much changes or fine tuning for game play style. Developer should make those equipment so that focus class so that significant buff can be provided to using specific attack style . The item should have more property like prefixes and suffixes and allow further crafting. 

Introduce class specialization like assassin, warrior , and etc etc. to provide buff/perk for using it. Like thief can sneak better with throwing weapon damage enhancement. 

Party battle is lacking, even you bring party member usually the battle seems confusing and mix up. Hope this can be further improved to allow control of each party member to execute their move better with priority and sequence. So multiple party members + enemies part members can come together to create complex battle. Skill should allow AOE damage to multiple party members.

2.2 Challenge
For me the learning curve is quite easy. You can understand the battle system easily and well explained. After a 1 to 2 hours of repeating game play you be able to grind the game quite well to get yourself with better skill and equipment. 

(spoiler alert)
The game has drastic and steep damage/hp enemies change when you enter last boss area, you cannot defeat them if you don't know the system well with high damage skill. Luckily I beat it on the first play through.
(end spoiler)

Most quest and challenge is not too hard if you have the correct equipment and inner power. Grinding is also easy and fast.

2.3 Game play engagement
if you like the battle mechanics you will stick to the game for long. If not, most likely you will quit very soon. Other elements like building, map and sandbox will need more improvement before  getting more engaged and more addictive to this core mechanics

2.4 Innovation
Totally new battle system, and inner power. Sandbox mode, non-linear game progression, dynamic map placement. These above keep me stick to the game and complete push me to complete the game ASAP.

lack of innovation on item, building, and story telling ( very less). 

3. Story
Plot: not much, no complexity, very direct. no LORE nothing.
Characters: You are the main character, you build the sandbox story, no side characters story , and etc. 
Dialogue: Very lacking , repetitive, may be Chat GPT can help? 
Emotional impact: really nothing at all. 

I would recommend that , the system can be further improved to include quest chain and story quest chain. And introduce different main character to follow their story line. 

4: Graphics and design:
Visual: Average, understand by users and not like triple A with grand design. OK for me, can be further improved 
Animation: main battle is quite ok, no complain for me because I enjoy the core mechanics more
UI/UX: easy to learn, with all short cut key provided and map. Good tutorial for starting and most details are provided and guided to start the game

5: Sound and music
Our all sound effect is ok, but can't remember any good sound track or voice acting. 

6. Replayability
Good replayability, but will definitely need more contents from developer. Many repetitive side quest just to buff your damage. 

End game and non-end game play is almost the same now

7. Conclusion
Is a good game I have not play for quite some times. The new mechanics , the sandbox, dynamics and etc. really keep me going. I wish the developer can further polish and add more contents to it. May it DLC? or 2nd chapter. or? Keep innovating

Recommend it a try.

This is a great sandbox game that's already super fun in early access. Despite the store page saying there is no plot, there actually is a main story that is drip fed to you on occasion. With even an end-game sort of quest present that drops on you once you're powerful enough. Overall so far the game is like patchwork. There are a lot of fun mechanics mixed together, but the links between them are rough, half-way translated, and appear that there is still work to improve on. 

This early access is for those who are familiar with unpolished games needing work.

Some knowledge for new players jumping in since it is not sufficiently explained in the game. The main way you are going to power up is to search for more ""Inner Kungfu"" abilities that you activate through your Meridians/Chi Points. Most importantly you should know that your Meridians can be channeled through each other multiple times to quintuple their effects. For example, if you have one path that lights up with 3 nodes and loops back to your Core, and then use your Chi points to start 2 more paths to link up with those same nodes, you would have basically activated them 3 times over.

The language barrier is a little annoying, but the translators are working on cleaning those up.  It's currently a couple steps above most MTL Wuxia novels in terms of translation quality.  

I'll give some tips for those that decide to try it:

-If you break your leg from falling or get loaded with ailments, go to a clinic and lay in a sickbed, one of the white beds.  The doctor will eventually come over to you to ask what you need, then you pick a dialogue option to pay for healing your ailments or broken leg.  Side note, if one of your PETS gets a broken leg, I have yet to find a way to get the doctor to heal it.  Instead, you want to build affinity with the doctor, and practice with making potions and whatnot at the crucible until you are able to get the Inner Karma ""Golden Acupuncture""  Then you activate that Inner Karma, and anytime you put Chi into an acupoint, any ailments directly surrounding the acupuncture point are healed.  Far as I can tell, that's the only way to heal such things, though there might be consumables that can do it that I have yet to encounter.

-Start taming animals early, they can be a pain to lug around at times, but they can help immensely in battle.  Careful with your horse and high places, mine loves to break his legs due to moving too fast while up high.

-Try to tame the ""boss"" animals, such as the big monkey, big dog, etc.  While you can boost up the base versions of the animals, the boss animals are several times stronger from the start, and yet cost the same thing to tame.  Edit 10/6/23 I think there's also an upper limit to how far you can tame the base versions of animals.  My normal monkey has eaten hundreds of pinecones and is still around 1k vigor, while my Big Dog has over 5k vigor and there's no sign of stopping.  So keep that in mind as well.

-Tame a monkey early, big or not.  If you lose a battle, the monkey can pick you up and take you to the clinic, sometimes even causing you to avoid being captured/killed.  Be aware, if you're heavy, the monkey will be very slow, as they have to take on all your load with you.

-If you want some advice on making money, keep in mind you can just exchange with any NPCs at all, with base resources.  The auction works well for bulk selling base materials as well. 
 
-If you're like me, you may spend waaaay too long trying to figure out what ""production experience"" is and how to get it.  ...It's not something you get from producing a lot, it's a physical item that you have to buy.  Check counters at shops, they sometimes have them there.  Same deal for weaving experience, forging experience, etc.  

-As the game doesn't really explain it to you for some reason, the sneak key is ""G.""  I didn't know for a few hours.  Be very aware that people will kill you if you steal from them if they don't know you well, as a streamer I watch (Tomato) found out the hard way.  

-When you beat a human enemy, ""take relic"" takes their head off, killing them.  Not advised to do that to anyone who isn't a bandit, as it will likely cause entire factions to hunt you.  

-Get a skill that heals you in battle.  Self explanatory, really.  Some enemies I've found have 4000+ vigor, and I don't even want to think about how long it'll take to get to that point myself.  They'll wear you down through attrition alone if you can't heal.  A defensive skill such as the golden bell one is also pretty much required to survive the biggest attacks and skills.  

-If you badly need help, grind up some money and request a commission for a strong NPC.  You'll be paying them to bodyguard you, and it can make some battles a breeze.  (Be advised you are still the primary combatant, so your ally, unless they pick their own fight with your enemy, will not be able to save you if you decide to poke a black serpent while you have less than 1000 vigor.  You're still the one that has to take the hits, they just provide more damage.)

-""True Qi"" is gained by activating certain kinds of inner karma.  Get high enough true Qi in an element, it can even prevent you getting any ailments from it at all.  

-Find the bookcase in a sect's training hall if you want to buy the sect skills.

-Remember that ""H"" lets you build complete houses, they're not in the production menu.  Be very careful with placement, the center of the blueprint will create a statue which you have to reach to add the materials and build it.  So if it's over the edge of a cliff, you'll have to do some annoying finagling with placeable stairs to get to it.

For now, I think that's it?  There's probably more, but nothing else is coming to mind immediately.  Oh, right.

-Get a ferret.  They ride on your shoulder and are far too cute not to get.  That is all.

Edit 9/20/23
-The Qinggong ability will require you to seek out Enlightenment Stones to advance.  However, the translation is different from what it tells you, as of when I type this anyway.  The first zone especially that you need is Eagle Hunt Platform.  You'll want this earlier than when I discovered it, it gives you double jump.  The other one is at the only ""mirror lake"" zone I've seen.  I forget the name, but it had the enlightenment stone... and poison frogs.  Don't be fooled by the normal name for em.  That's all I'll say.  Eagle Hunt Platform is Scorching, Mirror Lake is Miasma, so prepare accordingly.  

Edit 10/3/23

-Found out that you can transcribe your skills and inner kungfu if you acquire a bookcase for your own home.  It makes a skill manual for it, which you can sell, but it costs money to transcribe.  I have attempted giving the manuals to my children to help them out early on, but I didn't see them use them... might just not have used it yet.  

-As above may have hinted, your children, when they come of age, will be blank slates.  No inner kungfu, no skills.  They can still fight other NPCs with no issue, as NPCs only fight each other based on vigor values, not anything else that I can discern.  I say that based on how the kungfu tournament always goes.  I saw two characters fight, one had merely 3 more vigor than the other, and the one with 3 less vigor always lost.  Not once has an NPC with more vigor lost to one with less, in my experience.  

-Recruit your children to your sect as soon as you can, else if the sect they join becomes hostile (the bloody sect masters kept trying to rob me, so I kept winding up with hostile relations by not noticing until after I mangled them, that they were a sect master), it can become dangerous.  Killing your own kin is EXTREMELY hated.  

-To destroy another sect, destroy their flag, and replace it with your own sect's flag.  All their members will become roamers or whatever other job they may have had, and can then be recruited... as long as they don't hate your guts.

-Don't bother trying to tame black serpents, poison frogs, or flame lizards.  They're special creatures who cannot be tamed, even if the option is still there, just greyed out.  

-Beware of having multiple intimate relations, your partners will get jealous.  If you console them, they will develop hysteria ailments.. which you can heal to get a large boost to relations with them.  Fair warning, it'll be a lot of chi required.  

-Beware of having multiple children at once.  You'll get nagged incessantly about the progress of each and every one of them.  Take it from the guy who thought it was a good idea to have 7 of them at the same time.  

-Be aware, the method to get the Sage level for certain things like Forging, Establishment, and so on, is currently bugged.  The family with the secret has no option to let you learn it. You have ""talk about topics the other person likes"" about 20 times to level up to Sage, right now.",1694449545,1696613835,True,64,0,0.865652561187744141,0,True,False,True

On my first character I was the number 2 in the sect, I had the prestige to supplant the Sect leader and become the sect leader myself if I had just given the word. Unfortunately I had 2 kids. I had them so that I could make sure all my characters are blood related just in case I died...which happened much sooner than I expected...

So I was counting down the days til my kid was full grown so they'd actually show up in game and when my kid showed up so did the sect leader. Supposedly the little devil had committed a crime or something and the sect leader wanted to kill her. So I asked him not to kill her and then APPARENTLY chose the wrong option because I got my kungfu abolished, my tendons cut, and left to die in a volcano. So being a cripple in a volcano I absolutely did die. 

Being the brain genius that I am I had prepared for my death, the only shocking thing was that it hadn't happened sooner.  Head's were gonna roll for this all the same. I made my new character, picked up the venom and ice physiques that I had unlocked and returned to the land of the living. I had stored every one of my martial arts books in a box inside my hut and boy did that come in handy. I only really needed two abilities though. Arctic Palm and Snow-Melting Sword. Arctic Palm proc's the freeze status effect and Snow-Melting Sword hits for like 8x damage as many times as they have the ice proc...Did I mention that I had been in an Ice sect? The sect is based on a snowy mountain meaning I could get a phenomenal number of hits in.

The English translation isn't so bad, specially if you're used to wuxia novels/comics/games.

If I have any gripes, I just wish the world was more dynamic. As of now, the NPCs and animals mostly stay within their map sections. Give or take a few who go out to mine and forage. I'd love to see more wandering caravans, platoons and random battles happening as I explore. Maybe have groups of bandits or enemy sects attack the player's properties? Kidnap my retainers?

Gonna play more and will put out a more solid review later

EDIT: 42 hours in

Story: Yes this have has a story. Although the story is not yet finished as it's still currently in early access, it takes quite a while before you reach the point where the current story stops.
Thankfully, you can get past the point where you can unlock your second and third character slots. The second character I created is the son of my first character hehe

Character creation: At first, you begin with a very weak character. As you go on your adventure, you will learn skills, meet friends, make enemies and if you're unlucky, return to karma and create a new character. But wait, that's where the fun starts! Matchless Kungfu character creation works in a way that the stronger you are when you reached your demise, the more points you unlock for all succeeding character creations. Also, this does not reset. Meaning you don't have to worry about having a game over early in the game as progress gets tracked as a whole across multiple reiterations. 

When creating a character, aside from customizing the appearance, you can also choose to become a child of a character in the game (after 1st death). What surprised me the most is that you can even be the child of your previous character! (You need to unlock the second character slot first for this one or choose the wife/husband of your previous character). If you are born as a child of a family, you get access to their house, shops, and chests. This is a great way to speed up your progress to catch up to what you lost. You can also inherit some of the skills of your parents.In addition to lineage, you also get to select talents. You unlock talents by completing achievements in the game and you use karma points to activate them during character creation. 

World Building: As mentioned by others, you generate the world 1 tile at a time at your own leisure. You unlock more expand points by completing the quest of the area or by buying a new tile in the docked ships by the border of the current map. Map also stays even if your character dies. This means that any building, any sect or anything that you did in the world during the previous iteration, will remain. You can create up to 6 worlds in total, each world are independent of each other.

Combat: The combat is very interesting! It's a kung fu version of rock paper scissors with a twist. On top of the normal moves, you can also execute skills which can turn the tides of battle. There is no limit on the number of skills you can learn but you can only equip 6 active skills. For the internal skills, you will need to activate them by using the meridian system that will be introduced in the game when you first unlock it. One thing I can say is that how strong your character is depends on how well you set up your meridians.

Meridian Tips: Empty spaces that your connection passes through, increases your max health. Always buy the meridian shift pills to make things easier for you later on. If possible, occupy all spaces in the board while trying to complete your accupoints.

Crafting, Building: Crafting and building is fun in this game. You can craft pills, potions, weapons, clothes and even furniture. There is also no limit on the amount of buildings you can make. You can even build on top of the area you already built on. Although some of the building mechanics needs improvement such as being able to drag and drop tiles or walls, overall, the crafting and the building is good!

In this game, you can also establish a sect or join a sect. For this, I won't discuss much since discovering it's benefits and features is one of the most fun parts of the game.


OVERALL: 
This game offers unique game play inspired by Rimworld, Kenshi and Amazing Cultivator sim. Current story is not yet finished but it stops at a point where you can consider it as the end of the current chapter. Enemies in the *that* area is especially fun to fight and is a teaser of what can possibly be added to the game in the future.

My initial thought when I encountered the combat system was disappointment that you don't control your character in a conventional sense, but now it's probably my favorite thing. I would describe it as Rock/Paper/Scissors 3.0 with Kung Fu. 

I can sense from what's here that the relationship and sect management is going to be a lot deeper than what is currently released, but right now the function is minimal. What I really hope for is something that involves generational and incremental power struggles between families and sects for power and control on the miniworld. 

The way you generate your world tile by tile with different biomes, villages, environmental challenges, and more is just such a cool idea, I have to thumbs up this game.

Things i like: 
- Chinese martial arts world with Sects to join, in order to learn their skill and moves.

- Sandbox with different biomes. But instead of a big map from the start, player gets to place tiles or plot of lands to create their very own world.

- You get to own property either by purchasing or building your very own. You can even build houses or building just to sell it to NPCs.

- Open business with your property, be it a drinking bar or selling provision items.

- Craft items, cooking etc and making potions.

- Tame pets that helps you in combats or for rides.

- Make friends which will help you in combat, carry you to safety or even heal you.

- Make enemies which will poison you, burn your properties or even outright attack you. 
   Bandits or enemy from other sects can capture you and throw you into a cage.

- Some maps have objective, meditate to learn new skills or search for treasure chest for new items or martial arts skill books.

- Combat is fast pace rock, paper, scissor style. Match enough attack to unlock skills/ability  which can be use next round.

- You can get blind, crippled or even get kill.

- Rogue-lite too, ability to create new character after you die, with new or unlocked perks / traits. On the same world you piece together.

- Treasure hunting can be quite fun too, show you a map with a 'X' and you have to figure the rest yourself.

- Sneak around stealing stuff is fun.

Things to improve
- The AI is better now [strike] is a mess, especially if you just join a Sect. The scripted flower giving scene is bad, you will get attack no matter what (accept or reject the flower) [/strike].

- Music/sound seems to be very soft, have to turn up my speaker volume just for this game.

- Everyone looks about the same so far, needs more variety (Sects should have uniform of sort).

- Will be difficult when starting, needs a bit of time to get used to the combat and understand the system.

- Sneaking around is fun, but no mini game for lock picking. Basically just click and wait.

Overall, I'm fairly happy with the game and enjoyed it during my main play-through. This is an innovative take on the Chinese RPG genre, with some innovative deck-building / card-battler and world-building mechanics. Given that this is an indie effort, I will give the creators much more credit than if it is a full-blown AAA title.

What I enjoyed about the game:
1. The exploration mechanics is fun while it lasted. it is a simple but seldom-seen tile-by-tile world-building system where a new tile is made available (you get to choose the type of tile, broadly classified as toxic swamp, fiery volcano, frigid ice, hot desert, or temperate plains) whenever you complete the stated objective of any given tile. The tile climate determines the type of status effect that strikes you whenever you traverse through the tile. Swamps infect you with poison, volcanoes causes you to burn, ice restricts your repertoire / size of your 'card' deck in battle, and so on. Pretty fun for the most part.
2. NPCs do feel like sovereign individuals that have their own lives, missions and aspirations, and so on.

What I didn't enjoy about the game:
The deck-building / card-battler combat mechanisms is far too simple and lacks depth. Essentially it is a rock-paper-scissors simulator. Each round, you and your opponent assembles a deck of some martial-art attack style (punch, slap, kick, slash or ranged). Punching beats kicking, kicking beats slashing, slashing beats slapping, and ranged beats slashing, and so on). Your opponent plays his entire hand, and you choose your counter-play. You get to equip up to six special moves that are activated when you play some qualifying hand (e.g. two kicks and three punches for some move), and so does your opponent. Each round plays out card-by-card, and you or your opponent takes damage to your HP accordingly. The battle is over when either of you reaches zero HP.

It is simple, straight to point, but it got tiresome very quickly. Stronger opponents simply come with more hit-points and/or larger deck sizes and/or more moves per round. But the underlying mechanic is still rock-paper-scissors throughout. I didn't look forward to combat in the end because there's no tactical depth to speak of. It is always one vs. one. There isn't any positioning or movement point mechanics to speak of, so none of the typical back-stab, glancing, side-blow, AOE, or crowd control mechanics apply.  Straightforward rock-paper-scissors from start to finish. There's also a distinct lack of enthusiasm whenever I get to learn a ""new"" move, since its just any number of variants from the basic move-set with some small damage or status modifiers.

Overall, if you don't really care for tactical depth and combat intricacy, and/or just want a simple idler, this game is a solid entry and will entertain you sufficiently for the low sticker price.

P.S., I played the game in its native Mandarin language so I can't speak to the quality of the translations.

P.P.S., there are absolutely no micro-transactions, pay-to-win, gacha, always-online / multiplayer / social / live-service mechanics in this game, so that's a huge, huge plus. It is 100% single-player, just the way I like it.

总的来说，我会给绝世好武功打个＂推荐＂．游戏里面有一些挺有趣的点．建立世界，探索机制，等等都蛮有趣，挺新鲜的．最能进步的是战斗体系．现有版本基于一对一，＂剪刀，石头，布＂的逻辑进行战斗，重缺乏任何深度，也不促进从玩的心态．无论是小混混，到高手，到登峰造极的武林至尊等级的对手，也只不过是选个石头，剪刀或布．我个人会比较偏向有融入一对多，多对一，多对多，定位，时机，状态控制，方向，单位／多位攻击等等的战斗体系，才能有千变万化，无限从玩的深度．希望创始人能考虑添加．",1694846403,1694847222,True,2,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,True

First things first: At this point the game is kind of rough around the edges. If you do everything right you'll be able to finish it around 20 hours. However it keeps getting updates and each update is a proper one.

The most interesting thing about the game is its ""tile placement"". Your character shapes the world around them by placing tiles they earn when they complete an objective. These tiles unlock new challenges and the cycle continiues.

The combat mechanic is interesting. It is turn based with a twist that forces the player to ""react"" their opponent. The player gets a set amount of ""moves"" with different types, these types depend on whatever techniques they have ""equipped"". The weapon types counter each other rock-paper-scissors style. All in all the combat is never ""dull"", except one specific build where player finds ""Wave Palm"" technique and amasses enough qi to become One Palm Man.

The game also has a building system, I haven't done much with it but it seems good.

The crafting system is at the moment barebones but you still have hundreds of recipes for cooking, forging, weaving, etc.

The relationships system changes a lot and is quite interesting. At this point it is one point below Mount and Blade in terms of consequences of your actions part of relationships but it keeps improving.

All in all a must buy for the fans of the genre.",1694822326,1694822326,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Lots of content already.
Engaging combat system.
Nice animations during combat. 
The map tiles system is fun and ill be easy for the devs to add more to as the game grows.

Cons:
The MTL can be rough at times, it will use different words for the same thing a few times, and there are still some mechanics I'm not sure of because of the poor translation.
Character creation could have more options for appearance. 
Some of the moves are pure RNG to pull off unless I'm missing something. 
For example, I can get eight moves at most to pop up so far, and some of the skills require a perfect roll for all of them. 

Overall it's a really solid game for early access and I'm excited to see what else the devs come up with.

I would say that playing this game is rather joyful, but it is also at its rather early stage of evolution. I use the word ""evolution"" because any sandbox game with kinda plot encountering/emergence mechanism, not to say Kenshi-like game, can reach its peak if and only if its NPC AI and systems iterates 1,000 times, however, any good sandbox game show its potential of becoming a hit at its early stage (yes, this game is one of those).

For me, this game is rather crude right now, and I can raise a bunch of questions about its maturity:
1) Why does the game become not challenging for my character so fast?   
2) Why don't I feel the ""Jianghu"" [1] and the kung fu masters act like a dumb ass at all?
3) Why is the game so unbalanced that some schools are stupid in front of the Tier 1 schools? 
4) Why are some systems not playable at all?

But, I promise that this game is still becoming better, and the developers are listening to the players through QQ groups (a social platform in China). What impressed me is that the structure of this game is extremely malleable, just like Kenshi. And developers will soon release official story-triggering editing tools, as well as open workshops. Not hard to imagine, everyone can write a good story of Wuxia [2], Jianghu, and etc, and share it with everyone.

I strongly recommend you learn something about Jianghu, Wuxia, and Chinese martial artist novels first. Please enjoy.

Best,
A modest martial art learner and gamer

Note:
[1] ""Jianghu"" (江湖) refers to the circle/social network that ancient Chinese martial artists lived in. This is a circle of the outlaws, in which people do not stick to existing societal laws (the rule of the court/government), but by their own moral principles.
[2] ""Wuxia"" (武侠) refers to the fiction theme in which ""Jianghu"", wushu (martial arts), and the story of the martial artists is the most important concepts.

Chinese Version:

感兴趣功夫或武术主题游戏的大家好。我是一个以中文为母语的人，强烈推荐你购买这个游戏。

我想说的是，玩这款游戏是相当快乐的，但它也处于相当早期的发展阶段。我之所以使用“进化”这个词，是因为任何带有剧情偶遇/涌现机制的沙盒游戏，更不用说类似kenshi的游戏了，只有当NPC AI和系统迭代1000次，才能达到顶峰。然而，任何优秀的沙盒游戏都有可能在早期阶段就看出成为大作的潜力(是的，这款游戏就是其中之一)。

对我来说，这款游戏现在相当粗糙，我可以对它的成熟度提出一系列问题:
1)为什么游戏对我的角色来说变得没有挑战性的速度这么快?
2)为什么我一点也不觉得“江湖”，功夫大师们像个傻瓜?
3)为什么游戏如此不平衡，以至于一些流派在最好的流派面前显得愚蠢?
4)为什么有些系统根本不可玩?

但是，我保证这款游戏仍然会变得更好，开发者正在通过QQ群(中国的一个社交平台)听取玩家的意见。令我印象深刻的是，这款游戏的结构具有极强的延展性，就像Kenshi一样。开发人员将很快发布官方的故事触发编辑工具，以及开放创意工坊。不难想象，每个人都可以写出武侠、江湖等的好故事，并与大家分享。

我强烈建议你先学习一下江湖、武侠概念和中国武侠小说。请享受。

The learning curve for how combat works seems small but is giant when you begin to realize how much prep is expected for big battles (traps, pills, food, meridian, alignment, skills, weapons. heck breaking your legs is a combat bonus if you  have no kick based skills you are running.) .

The complexity and lack of communication aside, the combat system is clever. a complex rock paper scissors matching game that rewards alternating between different spaces with limited swapping nodes. resulting in a martial arts game where the player is rewarded for having anime internal monologues, taking time to analyse the enemy's moves, and coming up with ""what may be the only way to win this fight "" based on what martial arts you are training in ""going all out just this once"" might mean dosing up with an obscene amount of poison to enhance your body because of some internal meridian buff you have, or as alluded to before BREAKING YOUR LEGS... so you don't have 50 leg nodes thrown up every turn when the enemy is fist heavy and counters you.

I've never played a game like this and the acclimatization took some time. It was a bit disturbing at first, an overload of information and new ways of apprehending a world. But once you got it, damn what a game!

- The possibilities are well thought, original and possibly endless. The freedom of choice seems to go wild : you can be born cripple and blind, choose to help, ignore or punish pretty much anyone, become a disciple of the sect (or sects) you feel drawn to (many of them are really unique and stylish), eradicate an entire city on a misunderstanding, steal all the secrets of other sects while creating your own etc. All of it in one lifetime. The thing is, you can reincarnate and build on the consequences of past lives. And the cycle goes on.
- The combat mechanics are new and the animation beautiful. Just fighting for the pleasure of the puzzle mechanics and the design made me go on a rampage just to see how far it goes...and it goes far.
- You can build your own world, one tile at a time, making your playthrough really unique.
- There's a lot of thoughts around the experience design, a lot of grinding chores (felt in other games) are made simple, efficient and easy to use on this game (gear, loot, ressources gathering, ressources and items management, building etc.). 
- Depending on your kinks and desires, there's a way to be satisfied without a grind, unless you want to.
- They are filling the worlds with details and upgrading the content regularly, it will only get better.

And that is wonderful, because it breaks so many conventions.

Having said that....


This is underdone, unfinished, mismarketed, and despite the seemingly boundless potential - woefully misdesigned.

Stay away for about two to four years.

The interface needs rethinking, the skills grow too fast and are seemingly available for everyone else, seemenly everyone is stronger than you are, the best way towards riches is straightforward robbery and being a dick, there is a lot to do and very little reason to do any of it.
Square continents are downright immersion breaking.

Spent 17 hours apparently trying to persuade myself that I wasn't wasting my time and something interesting was going to happen soon.
Interactions aren't tracked, so I do tend to forget whcih woman threw herself at my feet first.
Some scripted situations are fun, but they are always the same, always completely repeatable, and there are few of them.

When it's finished, when it's adequately translated (a cyclopean job in itself) and when the design flaws are ironed out and community generates some decent mods - then you can play it.

Until then I'd stay as far away from it as possible.",1693478791,1694254384,False,13,0,0.435164362192153931,3,True,False,True

The combat system is unique (some kind of deck building with combos). The universe is really fun to explore. NPCs with you reincarnating in the same world makes for some funny situations, feuds over generations, etc.
And the devs seems to be aiming for something better, with a lot more content. 
I recommend.

Except... except if you are touchy about the translations. Most of it is gibberish, so you need to get the"" essence "" of the conversation. Which, for me, created very funny situation where it happened exactly the opposite of what I thought I clicked on. Usually doesnt destroy a run :)

if you can bear the wonk its the ultimate sandbox
relationships, building, gathering, crafting, training, taming, quests, jumping and flipping around the world + BEST of all - the many fun stories and experiences that unfold
- ie I joined a sect married a lady across from the training hall, she rescued me from bandits after I was captured
- fell from a cliff and broke my leg, doctor picked me up and carried me to his hospital for treatment

the only issue I think anyone would have is with the combat - its not an action game, youre dragging around punch and palm and kick symbols + a few colored orbs to kick off different combos. Using a certain amount of punches or kicks or whatever is then used as a resource for special moves. Its pretty fun and works really well especially because players get so many options for different moves and approaches. but if you dont like turn based combat or puzzle or card games you may be disappointed

Also you unlock and expand your world biome tile-by-tile, for example over a play session I added a village, desert training ground, a temple, and some plains with bandits (JI YUEN MY ARCH NEMESIS!!!!!!!!!!!!)

lots to do in the world in general; can build and sell properties, run shops, sell all sorts of wares - lots of fun roleplaying NPC life stuff

Its a weird little game but highly enjoyable for the hours I have in it. The English is servicable and the developer/publisher at the date of writing has released several fixes daily and even near daily (minor) content patches. For the 15€ or so I paid, I'm happy with it.

The game is quite often compared to Kenshi and while there are a lot of similarities, this game allows for a lot of different play styles such as: solo character play, sect management, business management, and much more while Kenshi tends to funnel you into caring for several characters and building bases.

Serious review:

My overall thoughts are that this is a great game and I would gladly recommend it.

(Note: This game was just released and some of this may be subject to change.)

---Pros---

-Geography: Building the world as you go along lets you make it how you want, which I like.

-New Game: TONS of replay-ability. Which is good since this game is essentially a rogue-lite.

-I'm a Big Kid now: Lack of hand-holding means that you get to live how you want to. Either be a hero or be a no-body.

-Filthy Weeb: Very good feeling of being in a cultivation manhua, though it doesn't have the whole (Rank of Immortality) thing.

-Squirrel: So far, I've never run out of activities to do or had a feeling of being lost despite not being told where to go.

-Hermit: Building your own house basically where-ever you want lets you be a hermit at the top of a mountain. (Win for me.)

-Probably a whole lot more that I like but can't think of right now.

---Mid---

-Omae wa mou, Shindeiru (You're already dead.): This can be a brutal game where you think that you're doing well only to get one-shot by some passing 'master'. Not bad for a sense of keeping the play in a grounded sense of reality that 'We aren't the hero.' but I'm still on the fence about it since I kind of both like it and hate it since you could have several goals ahead of you all for it to just come to an abrupt end unexpectedly. 

-Combat: Is strange for me in a way that I can't explain. As soon as I got my character's fighting style to be the way I wanted it, it began to be interactive enough that I didn't get bored with it even though I FEEL like it'd gotten repetitive hours ago. (Other people might feel different.)

---Cons---

-Engrish: Chinese/English translation is a little rough even though you can mostly understand most of what's going on. There are no acquaintances, friends, brothers, enemies or rivals. You are simply married to everyone with various positive or negative numbers behind the words. There's also a lot of stuff that you just have to piece together which may only be possible if you've studied Chinese culture in the past or read the Chinese cultivation manhuas. 

-Money Grubbers: While there are a lot of events that can happen, one of them is that some people will come up to you at and ask for 2k currency to get their business started. And while I know that (at least one of them) will give the money back with interest, they don't find you to do it and thus this is the way that I've lost most of my money in the game thus far. The problem is that this event seems to happen more often than the others and it almost feels like a system that's set in place to make sure that you never have enough money and, if you don't pay, you get the Miserly title.

-Wonky Tutorial: While you will get used to some of the systems eventually, things can be a bit confusing at first. And while there are guides in the game that some a decent enough jobs, I for one thought that there were some things that needed a bit more polishing. (Like the fact that you're move sets are based on which skills you have equiped. Not sure if it was explained and I just hate reading though.; )

-Where's my money?: Getting currency in the game is somewhat simple at first... Until you realize that (in the current version) merchants and other people don't replenish their currency. I eventually had to start making money either from doing people's tasks or from just making a bunch of crafting-related items and listing it all up for the auctions that come every now and then. Two ways that don't have currency pools to drain.

- Probably more that I can't think of right now.

---Final---

Overall, I would give this game a high 7/10 with the potential being at least 9/10 should some issues be fixed. Could even be 10/10 depending on if mods and support for them become a thing.

For example: I was mucking around with crafting and made a trap which i set down for a laugh. A horse walked into it and fell down, KO'd. I went up to it and go the option to tame it...OK...5 minutes later I am riding across the map with a pet monkey and wild boar in tow fighting a bandit group that annoyed me. At one point I tried to burn down their house, got ambushed and locked up in a cage after they stole my stuff. I escaped, crafted my own gear and took horrible revenge on them all. Then I wen't back to my house and rested in the hot spring I built outside my house while my pet monkey begged for coins from passing townsfolk. Then one of bandits turned up and begged to become my younger brother because I was apparently super awesome so I accepted him and now he is a woodcutter who has a feud with a local beggar although I think the Bionic Snake technique I taught is helping him out. Following this I joined a martial arts sect and had one of the outer disciples announce she fancied me only to be waylaid by an inner disciple who liked her and warned me off. Now I plan to get stronger, kick his ass, become an inner disciple and then marry the outer disciple.

I swore I'd never trust an EA game again until I tried the Demo for The Matchless Kungfu, and honestly I still do not, but I am willing to take a chance with this game.

[b]How is better than Kenshi?[/b]

- There is a quest and event system in the game that makes NPC interactions more impact due to the relationship system. [i](Captured by bandits? Your spouse or brother may just come to save you.)[/i] [i](Bandit tries to steal your gold, but realizes you're stronger? Maybe he will surrender and become your loyal disciple.)[/i]

- Base building is based on a grid, so building is cleaner and can be entrusted to your students while you're off doing tasks. [i](However, a map based u.i. for interacting with buildings you own would be nice and is not currently in the game.)[/i]

- The karma system makes dying a part of the game, and something that isn't nearly as punishing. [i](Fight, Die, Learn, and Become stronger. Instead of the Kenshi way of Fight, Die, Learn, Try Again.)[/i]

- A.I. logic is roughly the same kind of stupidity as Kenshi A.I. and needs work, but at least being in EA you can be certain it will see a lot more progress. [i](Main issue right now is NPCs navigation breaking when they jump on a rooftop while trying to enter a doctors clinic.)[/i]

- Group management is a lot smoother. (Build a guild / sect, give them tasks, and they will mostly go do them without you having to supervise or babysit them.)

- The map building based on tile sets is pretty neat, and works well.

[b]Downsides?[/b]

First is that I'm really looking forward to playing again later tonight. To me, there's no better sign of a worthwhile game than it leaving that kind of impression. I'm also adding some small clarifications below...

I took a chance on this one because it looked weird. I'm not a fan of kung fu movies or martial arts games, but I do love innovative RPGs. The thing that almost dissuaded me from buying it was how many of the (few) reviews compared it to Kenshi -- a game that I could never get into.

Personally, I don't see the comparison. Other than that it's a sandbox RPG with rice paddy hats, I don't think it's anything like the other game. The text in Matchless Kung Fu is borderline undecipherable and I'm still less confused than I am in Kenshi. 

COMBAT:
It's a mini-game-style combat system unlike anything I've played. (Although it's probably easier to pick up if you like these kinds of martial arts games.) I still don't think I understand how it works, but I am able to win fights, so I guess that's all that matters.

Combat does look pretty cool. The freeze-frames of kicking dogs and monkeys in the crotch are hilarious. I guess you don't need to fully ""get it"" to appreciate it.

TILES:
I was intrigued by the map that you build yourself. As an avid board game player, I found it to be very accessible. If nothing else, it's a new spin on exploration. Rather than knowing there's a built map out there for me to run around, I kind of lay it out myself and choose (from the given options) what biomes and threats I want to see next. Yes, you end up with a square continent, but it's a game. I can make the small sacrifice of seeing a perfectly straight shoreline if the mechanic is new and interesting.

BUILDING:
What lured me in was really the prospect of building houses and shops. I love building things. I was able to put together my first house within fifteen minutes of starting the game. To my surprise, an NPC ran up to me and offered to buy it. So I sold it, then built another next to it. It seems like I'm not just able to build houses, but an actual village with NPC inhabitants. And I'll eventually build shops that sell things to those NPCs. That part has me excited.

NPCs:
They're interesting. I haven't fully figured out what makes them tick, but they have plenty of relationship stats you can parse. I'm currently trying to make friends with a random NPC who showed up in my little village. Unfortunately, there are other NPCs who don't like her for some reason and will constantly beat her half to death. It's interesting, I'll say that.

QUESTS:
No overarching plotline that I'm aware of. I think there might be one hidden within the Chinglish near-jibberish...something about having amnesia and trying to find a cure. Maybe?

Each new tile you add to the map has its own objectives that you can complete. You can go up to any NPC and ask for quests, resulting in a list of fetch quests for resources or special items. Since you need money to heal after getting beat down, I found it was a good idea to do a bunch of these early on.

LANGUAGE:
The translations aren't just bad, they're abysmal. At times, it's pretty funny, but the outright incorrect word usage gets in the way of learning the game. For example, the word 'recycle' used to indicate that you can pick something up. It took me a minute to realize that they used the word 'Orion' to mean 'hunter'...although I guess that should have been obvious. (?) They used the word 'marriage' to mean 'relationship', as in the gradient of possible relationships (I think) so you're constantly running around 'married' to things. 

The conversations are indecipherable. I've had to make a lot of guesses when it comes to commands and conversation trees. I couldn't tell if the first NPC that talked to me was being nice or threatening. My choices for responses all seemed to pretty much mean the same thing, so I chose the one that I thought meant 'thank him for saving me'. Turns out it was an insult to every belief this guy holds dear, and more than enough to warrant beating my ass for being some kind of religious zealot. I have no idea.

Many commands are just as bad. You gotta guess what they mean. (Like 'take relic' means chopping off someone's head. So be glad there's a warning on that one if you try it.) 

A dog beat me up, then had to 'decide what to do with me'. He chose to break my legs. A LOT of NPCs decide to break my legs. This is the funny stuff. I don't mind it. 

--

If you like games where figuring things out is part of the fun and the challenge, this is a winner. Granted, the language barrier adds an unwanted element of 'mystery', but it's not impossible to navigate, and the game seems pretty forgiving when you guess poorly. 

Overall, it's surprisingly fun and unique. By imagining that I'm inside the mind of a psychotic beggar, everything makes perfect sense. Including getting beat to hell for saying 'thank you'.",1693543067,1693597259,True,6,3,0.543928921222686768,2,True,False,True

Seems to be inspired by Kenshi when it comes to some of the art style, base building, crafting, etc., but the combat system seems totally novel, and when you add in the different moves and potential inner meridian combinations, I can see the potential for ridiculous depth there.

Machine translation they're using during early access is a little rough, but good enough to poke your way around. Conversations and flavor text are fine to muddle through, but my main complaint here is I wish they would use a glossary or standardize some translations related to stats. If i get an item that says it will increase ""true qi"" - there is no such stat. Is it the same as ""chi,"" ""spirit,"" or ""energy""? 

Surprisingly not many bugs I've run into for a game fresh into early access. I've heard there may be some performance issues later in the game with larger maps, and while I've not yet seen that myself, I will note that load times to seem to scale up relatively quickly with increase in map size. 

Overall, go for it. What can go wrong with any game where two of the first moves you learn are ""Face Slap,"" and ""Groin Kick""?",1693488207,1693488207,True,1,0,0.501032352447509766,0,True,False,True
